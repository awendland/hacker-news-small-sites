February 11, 2021 | https://www.marcogomiero.com/posts/2021/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.marcogomiero.com/posts/2021/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As you may have heard, JCenter is shutting down in May 2021.</p><blockquote><p>Into the Sunset on May 1st: Bintray, JCenter, GoCenter, and ChartCenter<br><a href="https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/">https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/</a></p></blockquote><p>So, if you are using JCenter as the repository for your libraries (as me), it’s time to migrate.</p><p>In this article, I will not go through the publishing process of a library to MavenCentral, because there are already plenty of resources available. For example, I followed the one written by Márton Braun.</p><blockquote><p>Publishing Android libraries to MavenCentral in 2021
<a href="https://getstream.io/blog/publishing-libraries-to-mavencentral-2021/">https://getstream.io/blog/publishing-libraries-to-mavencentral-2021/</a></p></blockquote><p>Instead, the topic of this article is to show how to manually migrate the old artifacts of a library without recompiling them.</p><p>It’s important to migrate also the old artifacts because not all the users of your library are using the latest version. But if the library is old, it’s difficult to recompile it from scratch. For example, I’ve tried to manually rebuild the first version of <a href="https://github.com/prof18/YoutubeParser">YoutubeParser</a>, but I quickly failed because it was using a version of the Android Gradle Plugin of 5 years ago that is now incompatible with Android Studio 4.</p><h2>Download old artifacts from Bintray</h2><p>The first thing to do is downloading the old library’s artifacts from Bintray. It is possible to download them, directly from the Bintray directory page:</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://bintray.com/package/files/%7Byour-bintray-username%7D/maven/%7Byour-library-name%7D">https://bintray.com/package/files/{your-bintray-username}/maven/{your-library-name}</a></p></blockquote><p>For example, this is the URL for my other library, <a href="https://github.com/prof18/RSS-Parser">RSS-Parser</a>: <a href="https://bintray.com/package/files/prof18/maven/RSS-Parser">https://bintray.com/package/files/prof18/maven/RSS-Parser</a></p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/bintray-dir.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/bintray-dir.png"></a></figure><p>Here, it is possible to download the artifacts by simply clicking on them.</p><h2>Sign artifacts</h2><p>The next step is signing the artifacts, with a GPG key (to generate one, you can follow the instruction on <a href="https://getstream.io/blog/publishing-libraries-to-mavencentral-2021/">Márton‘s article</a>). The command to perform the signing is the following:</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="bash"> gpg -ab rssparser-1.0.pom
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/sign-terminal.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/sign-terminal.png"></a></figure><p>Remember that all the files uploaded to MavenCentral must be signed. In my case, I have to sign the <em>.aar</em> file, the <em>.pom</em> and the <em>jar</em> that contains the sources and the <em>JavaDoc</em> of the library.</p><p>The signing command produces a <em>.asc</em> file, that must be uploaded as well on MavenCentral.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/signed-files.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/signed-files.png"></a></figure><h2>Manual upload artifacts</h2><p>Now, it’s time to upload the artifacts. Login on <a href="https://oss.sonatype.org/">Sonatype</a> and from the menu on the left, select <em>Staging Upload</em></p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/manual-upload.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/manual-upload.png"></a></figure><p>First of all, in the <em>Staging Upload</em> section, it is necessary to upload the <em>pom</em> file.</p><p>Switch the upload mode to <em>Artifact(s) with a pom</em> in the dropdown window and then select to <em>pom</em> to upload.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-pom.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-pom.png"></a></figure><p>Then, in the section below, it is possible to upload the other artifacts. To do that, it is necessary to select them from the file system with the <em>Select Artifact(s) to Upload…</em> button and then add them to the list with the <em>Add Artifact</em> button.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/artifacts-to-upload.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/artifacts-to-upload.png"></a></figure><p>Don’t forget to upload also the signatures (the <em>.asc</em> files)!</p><p>After adding all the artifacts, upload them with the <em>Upload Artifact(s)</em> button. It is also necessary to provide a brief description, for example <code>1.1 manual upload</code></p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-artifacts.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-artifacts.png"></a></figure><p>It could happen the the upload is stuck and the progress bar never goes away. If it happens, reload the page and redo the process (I’ve noticed that it can happen when the browser tab is open for a while).</p><p>After the upload is successful, select <em>Staging Repositories</em> from the left menu.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/staging-repo.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/staging-repo.png"></a></figure><p>Now, the process is the same as when the artifacts are upload from Android Studio (or from the CI). The only exception is that the close task is started automatically (if it not starts, you can start it manually from the top bar).</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/wait-close.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/wait-close.png"></a></figure><p>The close task takes a few moments to perform, and after that, it’s time to release the library with the button in the toolbar.</p><p>And that’s it! After the processing time (usually between 10 to 15 minutes) your library will be available to <a href="https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/">MavenCentral</a>.</p><p>If you have any suggestion or any kind of doubt, feel free to reach me out on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoGomier">@marcoGomier</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

		<h3>Deep learning is revolutionizing text-to-speech and speech synthesis technologies.</h3>
<p><strong>By Yishay Carmiel and Ben Lorica.</strong></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Recent progress in natural language processing (NLP) and speech models have made voice applications accessible to companies across industries. From smartphone applications and personal assistants to sales and customer support to smart home speakers and appliances, voice applications have become part of daily life. Advancements in deep learning and artificial intelligence technologies—natural language understanding (NLU) in particular—have brought voice technologies to a broader developer audience and greatly expanded practical use case scenarios.</p>
<p>While much of the recent media coverage and attention-grabbing applications have focused on automatic speech recognition (ASR), in this post, we’ll focus on text to speech (TTS) and speech synthesis—technologies that create artificial human speech.</p>
<p>As consumers integrate speech technology into their daily lives with such products as smart speakers and smart home systems, they increasingly will demand higher quality and more <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/25/960299623/voice-author-explores-accents-language-and-what-makes-a-tone-sexy">realistic speech synthesis</a>. We expect TTS and speech synthesis to drive the next wave of innovative voice applications. In 2018, <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html">Google Duplex</a> introduced a system that previewed capabilities that speech synthesis and NLU technologies might be able to achieve. The system demonstrated personal assistants capable of booking appointments by interacting with humans through phone conversations. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis#Applications">Assistive technology</a> use cases in healthcare will also drive innovation in speech synthesis, bringing maturity to impaired communication aids and novel solutions for a wide range of disabilities. We expect to see highly advanced applications that can, for example, serve as the voice for a patient with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jan/19/vocal-polyps-injury-singing-john-colapinto-steven-zeitels">damaged vocal chords</a>, using their own voice.</p>
<p>At a high level, voice applications have three main components: speech recognition, speech profiling, and speech synthesis.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition">Speech recognition</a> is the translation of spoken language into text. It is also called automatic speech recognition, computer speech recognition, and speech to text. A major application of ASR is transcribing conversations. Other examples include “Hey, Siri” commands, such as “call home,” and voice interfaces requiring simple data entry (e.g., entering credit card numbers or call routing—”press or say ‘1’ for customer service”).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-0263-3_4">Speech profiling</a> is the process of audio mining information from speech beyond recognition, including age, gender, emotion, the language spoken, speaker verification, etc. Applications include biometrics, sentiment analysis, and metadata extraction to improve customer intelligence initiatives.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis">Speech synthesis</a> is the artificial creation of human speech. In this post we’ll occasionally use the term “speech synthesis” to refer to technologies that cut across TTS and speech synthesis. The more familiar term is “text-to-speech” but we’re opting for “speech synthesis” because we expect input sources in the future to include a range of formats including text and audio. An example of a system that can take audio input is <a href="https://tencent-ailab.github.io/pitch-net/">Tencent’s PitchNet</a>: a model that takes audio of one singing voice and converts it into audio of another voice singing the same content.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>An Overview of Speech Synthesis Systems</h2>
<p>Voice applications are complex. A close look at voice-enabled AI conversation applications, for instance, reveals the complexity of components on which such applications rely. Each of the components in Figure 1, for example, might require multiple machine learning (ML) models.</p>

<p>The fact that speech technologies mainly interact with humans increases their complexity. Most machine learning systems use quantitative metrics to measure the effectiveness or accuracy of their outputs. If an ML system is designed to catalogue species of birds, for example, it’s straightforward to score the accuracy. The output of voice applications is meant for human listening and requires qualitative metrics evaluated by a panel of humans. A common metric is the Mean Opinion Score (MOS), where a panel of listeners rates the output of a speech synthesis system using a range of 1 (lowest perceived quality) to 5 (highest perceived quality).</p>
<h3>Classical Text-to-Speech and Speech Synthesis systems</h3>
<p>Until the mid-2010’s when voice applications began integrating deep learning technologies, systems for producing artificial voices had two main components: natural language understanding and signal generation.</p>
<h4>Natural language understanding</h4>
<p>Natural language understanding is the process of a machine learning the peculiarities of language and understanding language components in context. In English, consider “1939.” The proper rendering of 1939 into speech depends on the context. NLU’s job is to understand the context and properly parse “1939.”</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My father was born in 1939 (“nineteen thirty-nine”)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please press 1939 (“one-nine-three-nine”)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This computer costs $1939 (“one thousand nine hundred thirty-nine”)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Classical NLU systems first pass text through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_normalization">normalization system</a> which converts text into a canonical, standard form that can more easily be rendered into speech. Next, the system passes the converted text through additional systems that turn it into linguistic units of sound called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme">phonemes</a>. These units get assembled together using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosody_(linguistics)">prosody</a> model that ensures words and sentences sound correct.</p>
<h4>Signal generation</h4>
<p>Signal generation is the process of taking the text output from the NLU component and turning it into a realistic sounding voice. Early signal generation systems used a voice concatenation approach that recorded uttered parts of speech, such as phonemes or combinations of phonemes, and concatenated them while maintaining prosody and intonation. In principle, this system could generate speech from any text presented to it. Concatenation systems are complex and produce outputs that aren’t as realistic as modern deep learning-based systems.</p>

<h3>The rise of deep learning for speech synthesis</h3>
<p>Deep learning has revolutionized systems for producing artificial voices. Two main components, in particular, have seen significant innovation: the process of converting text to a <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/dali/user-guide/docs/examples/audio_processing/spectrogram.html">high-level audio representation</a>, and the process of converting those representations into speech. Two deep learning models, WaveNet in 2016 and Tacotron in 2017, provided such significant improvements over existing systems that deep learning has now become central to modern speech platforms.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WaveNet">WaveNet</a>, a neural <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/vocoder">vocoder</a> system from DeepMind, is a deep learning model trained on speech recordings. It is used to produce human-like voices. You can hear it in action on the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech">Google Cloud Text-to-Speech</a> service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10135">Tacotron</a> is a deep learning-based text-to-speech model that synthesizes speech directly from text characters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the introduction of WaveNet and Tacotron, major components of speech synthesis systems have come to rely on deep learning. Neither system, however, is an end-to-end (e2e) solution. Speech synthesis systems are composed of several components that are built and trained separately (see Figure 3). This means each component has to be trained individually, with its own training data. The speech synthesis system then relies on sequentially training each component in the pipeline. WaveNet and Tacotron each address one component of the end-to-end pipeline.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03575">2020 paper from DeepMind</a> introduced an end-to-end (e2e) speech synthesis model that takes an input (text, phonemes) and outputs raw speech waveforms. e2e systems are also being investigated <a href="https://twitter.com/bigdata/status/1314615419156586496">in automatic speech recognition</a>. While end-to-end speech synthesis systems have attracted the attention of many researchers, it’s important to note that we are in the earliest stages of realizing an e2e system that can take an input and fully process a reasonable human-like output in real time.</p>
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>There are several active areas of research in speech synthesis. Each offers a myriad of applications and use cases, along with risk/reward trade-offs.</p>
<h3>Adaptable speech synthesis</h3>
<p>In today’s applications, it takes hours of recording and tuning for a speech synthesis system to output a specific person’s voice. What if we could take an existing, realistic sounding speech synthesis system and imbue it with specific voices with only minutes, or even seconds, of a person’s voice recording? A highly personalized, realistic speech synthesis system could revolutionize an unlimited number of applications. The reality of such a system isn’t as far off as it sounds: open source cloning systems that require only a few minutes of recorded audio of a speaker’s voice are <a href="https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning">already available</a>, and are bound to improve over time. <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-ai/build-a-natural-custom-voice-for-your-brand/ba-p/2112777">Microsoft recently announced an offering</a> that allows companies to create custom synthetic voices.</p>
<p>Looking further ahead, we expect to see mainstream speech synthesis systems advanced enough to generate <a href="https://google.github.io/tacotron/publications/multilingual/index.html">multilingual audio using the same voice</a>. This would drive interesting applications for travel, media and movies, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiiSAvKJIHo&amp;feature=youtu.be">public service initiatives</a>, to name just a few use cases.</p>
<p>There are obvious risks of adaptable speech synthesis systems. Fraudulently impersonating someone—using <a href="https://www.nisos.com/blog/synthetic-audio-deepfake/">audio deepfakes</a>—is becoming trivial and opens up many potential nefarious applications. A <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fraudsters-use-ai-to-mimic-ceos-voice-in-unusual-cybercrime-case-11567157402">Wall Street Journal article</a> described how fraudsters were able to impersonate the voice of an executive and demand a wire transfer. As the technology becomes more sophisticated, blackhat users likely will become more sophisticated as well.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>This series is about me learning something in my spare time. More specifically, it’s about me learning quantum mechanics, as a way of getting back into physics, and as a way of making good science.</p> <p>I’ll explain: I have recently started a PhD in machine learning at the University of Geneva. The main project I’ll be working on is about applying machine learning and statistical methods to physics, mainly high energy physics (HEP) and solar astronomy. I am part of a very strong multidisciplinary team of physicists and AI people, so I could probably do without a strong physics background. Still, I feel like that can’t hurt, right?</p> <p>So there you have it: I want to study and understand physics in order to do better research.</p> <p>But that’s not the whole story. I also love physics, and I have tortured myself over and over as to whether I should have majored in physics rather that CS during my university career. This is not to say that I am any good at it. I only had one big physics exam during my bachelor (topics were kinematics, some classical mechanics, electromagnetism), and all the rest of my knowledge is made of bits and pieces coming from random youtube lectures and non-technical books I have read over the years. So yeah, it’s finally time to get serious.</p> <h3 id="why-start-with-quantum-mechanics"> <a href="#why-start-with-quantum-mechanics"></a> Why start with Quantum Mechanics? </h3> <p>Because I find it exciting, and that’s probably enough. Starting with classical mechanics would likely bore me to death. I know QM is not easy or intuitive, and that math can get hard. However, I don’t feel completely ill-equipped. Thanks to my engineering and ML background, I know one thing or two about probabilities, linear algebra, Fourier series and complex numbers, which I have been told are a substantial part of the required background.</p> <h3 id="what-is-your-study-method"> <a href="#what-is-your-study-method"></a> What is your study method? </h3> <p>I usually try to be extremely deliberate about my study method. I won’t go into the details here, but I use active recall and spatial repetition tools such as Anki so that remembering what I study is no longer a random event but a purposeful act. There are many interesting resources about such techniques, such as <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">this</a>, and <a href="https://aliabdaal.com/spacedrepetition/">this</a>. Michael Nielsen has even developed an <a href="https://quantum.country/qcvc">introduction to quantum computing</a> delivered in a “new mnemonic medium which makes it almost effortless to remember what you read” (hint: it’s active recall and spaced repetition).</p> <p>As for the learning resources, I have chosen two introductory books: one is from the theoretical minimum series from the great Leonard Susskind. This is supposed to be a very simple introduction, starting from first principles. I have already flipped through the pages, and there actually seems to be quite a lot of content, or at least more than you would expect from a book of this kind.</p> <p>The second book it more technical, and it comes up over and over as a suggestion for learning QM: Griffiths’ Introduction to Quantum Mechanics. Honestly, here I have no idea what to expect.</p> <p>So here’t the plan: I’ll go through both books simultaneously and try to solve most exercises. I’ll also create flashcards and diagrams of the concepts, and let Anki do the rest. Additionally, I’ll write this blog series, which hopefully helps me understand things better. So if you are here to learn, don’t just count on my writing.</p> <h3 id="requirements"> <a href="#requirements"></a> Requirements </h3> <p>The requirements are basic linear algebra and basic probability. And complex numbers. Some notions of classical physics can also help.</p> <hr> <h2 id="spins-and-qubits"> <a href="#spins-and-qubits"></a> Spins and Qubits </h2> <p>The fact that we cannot fully grasp some things about the inner workings of our universe should come at no surprise. After all, we evolved to survive, not to understand. Ok yes, we have a strong intuition for many classical-mechanical things, but the reason is that things that behave classically are closer to our experience than things that behave relativistically or in a quantum mechanical way. So what we can do here is simple: let’s just go with the math and with the experiment. I don’t expect any of the concepts I encounter to be “relatable”. I am going to trust the result of the experiments, and link that to the math which hopefully explains them. And I’ll start with the <strong>spin</strong>.</p> <p>Sooo, the spin is an extra degree of freedom that some particle have (all of them? I don’t know).</p> <p>This spin is a very quantum mechanical concept, which is why trying to visualize it classically would miss the point.</p> <p>Now, the spin of a particle is a quantum systems on its own right. In fact, it’s the “simplest and the most quantum of systems”, according to Susskind. Just by going through a very simple experiment involving the spin, we can already start to notice some important differences between classical physics and quantum mechanics.</p> <p>The experiment involves a measuring system, which we call $\mathcal{A}$, that records the state of the spin of our system (we’ll call it $\sigma$). We can orient the measuring apparatus in order to measure this “something” along a specified axis. As a test, we rotate the apparatus along the $z$-axis, and notice that our measurement has the value of $1$ or $-1$.</p> <p>Now, if we reset the apparatus to measure again the spin along the $z$-axis, and assume the simple evolution law</p><p> \[\sigma(n+1) = \sigma(n)\] </p><p>which tells us that the state of the system remains unchanged through time, then the previous measurement should be confirmed, again and again. We say that the measurement of a state <strong>prepares the system.</strong></p> <p>In quantum experiments, performing the same measurement repeatedly gives the same answer until the system is prepared differently. We will see this in more detail now.</p> <p>After we have prepared the system in the state $\sigma_z = 1$, let’s now rotate the apparatus of, say, 90 degrees, and measure the spin along the $x$-axis. Something weird happens. Sometimes we get +1, sometimes we get -1. It looks like the result is no longer deterministic, but in some peculiar way. In fact, if we repeat the experiment multiple times, we find that the average value of the measurement along the $x$-axis is $0$.</p> <p>In fact, this is generalizable to any direction. We can pick any direction $\hat{m}$ and prepare a spin so that the apparatus measures a $+1$ in that direction. Then, we rotate the apparatus to any other direction $\hat{n}$. Again, the result of the measurement will still be either $+1$ or $-1$, but the expected value will be equal to the projection of $\hat{m}$ over $\hat{n}$ , that is, $\cos{\theta}$, with $\theta$ being the angle between the vectors.</p> <p>In <em>bra-ket notation</em> (we’ll talk about this more in detail)<em>:</em></p><p> \[\langle{\sigma}\rangle = \hat{m} \cdot\hat{n} = \cos{\theta}\] </p><p>Notice that this is the same result that we would expect in classical physics for some vector quantity that we measure. However, in the classical sense, the result would be deterministic. In QM, the result is statistically random, but the average converges to the classical result.</p> <h2 id="vector-spaces-inner-products-bases"> <a href="#vector-spaces-inner-products-bases"></a> Vector spaces, inner products, bases. </h2> <p>In quantum mechanics the space of the states is a vector space. We call vectors <em>ket.</em> This is a <em>ket:</em> $\vert a\rangle$. Some simple axioms are defined in this space: the sum of two kets is a ket, ket addition is commutative and associative, and some other things like the existence of a 0 vector, an additive inverse, and linearity. Up to this point, everything looks normal, and the vector space we have defined is practically the same as the space of 3-vectors in Euclidean space. However, the space of our <em>kets</em> is a complex vector space, made of complex numbers, and where the multiplication by a scalar value also extends to complex numbers! This is a very abstract concept, but it’s absolutely needed to make the theory work mathematically.</p> <p>Now, if you know something about complex vector, you will likely remember about the complex conjugate. Briefly, given a complex number $z$, there exists a complex conjugate $z^*$ that we obtain by reversing the sign of the imaginary part. So if $z=x+iy = re^{i\theta}$, then $z^*=x-iy = re^{-i\theta}$. Note that the product of a complex number and its complex conjugate is always positive, yielding $r^2$ in our case.</p> <p>In the same way, a complex vector space has a <em>dual</em> space that is its complex conjugate vector space. In our case, for every <em>ket</em> $\vert A\rangle$, we can define a <em>bra</em> vector in that dual space: $\langle A \vert$, which is essentially its complex conjugate.</p> <p>Now, if you got up to this point, I am pretty sure you remember about dot-products in Euclidean space, right? Well, that dot-product is a specific instance of so-called <em>inner products,</em> which we can also define in our complex space. In out quantum-mechanical magical world, the inner product is defined between a <em>bra</em> and a <em>ket</em>, and the notation is</p><p> \[\langle B|A \rangle\] </p><p>and, of course, the result is a complex number. These products are linear, and interchanging bras and kets corresponds to complex conjugation</p><p> \[\langle B|A \rangle = \langle A|B \rangle ^*\] </p><p>Concretely, the product is performed in the exact same way as for the dot-product: sum of the products of the components.</p> <p>We can also bring with us some familiar concepts from Euclidean spaces:</p> <ul> <li>A vector is <em>normalized</em> if its inner products with itself is 1.</li> <li>Two vectors are <em>orthogonal</em> if their inner products is 0.</li> </ul> <p>In our vector space, we can also define a <em>basis</em>, which is simply a set of vector that can be used to derive any other vector in the space through linear combinations. It’s often useful, and it is especially in QM, to talk about <em>orthonormal bases</em>, which are <em>bases</em> where the vectors are normalized and orthogonal between each other. Note that the number of vectors in a <em>basis</em> is equivalent to the dimension of the space.</p> <h3 id="quantum-states"> <a href="#quantum-states"></a> Quantum States </h3> <p>With some math tools under our belt, let’s try to formalize the notion of a <em>spin state</em> from earlier.

        <p>Continuing from <a href="https://adrian-salajan.github.io/blog/2021/01/25/images-functor">image editing with Functors</a>, we will now understand Applicative by editing images with it.</p>

<h3 id="applicative">Applicative</h3>
<p>An applicative is composed of 2 things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A function which can wrap any value <code>A</code> with the context <code>F</code>. <code>pure(a: A): F[A]</code>. So it must be that <code>pure</code> knows what the <code>F</code> context means.</li>
  <li>One of the two functions which are equivalent to each other (can rewrite one in terms of the other + <code>pure</code>):
    <ul>
      <li><code>map2(a: F[A], b: F[B], f: (A, B) =&gt; C): F[C]</code></li>
      <li><code>app(f: F[A =&gt; B], a: F[A]): F[B]</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Below <code>app</code> is used with the enhanced syntax:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>fab</span><span>.</span><span>app</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>])</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>B</span><span>]</span>
<span>//where fab is of type F[A =&gt; B]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This structure must obey the laws:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identity</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>((</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span><span>).</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>fa</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>fa</span></code></pre></figure>

<ul>
  <li>Homomorphism</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>).</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>))</span> <span>==</span> <span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<ul>
  <li>Interchange</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>ff</span><span>.</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>))</span> <span>==</span> <span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>((</span><span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>A</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>B</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)).</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>ff</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<ul>
  <li>Composition</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>val</span> <span>compose</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>B</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>C</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>A</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>B</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>A</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>C</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>_</span><span>.</span><span>compose</span>
<span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>compose</span><span>).</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>fbc</span><span>).</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>fab</span><span>).</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>fa</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>fbc</span><span>.</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>fab</span><span>.</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>fa</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>These laws are a bit complicated, so again like Functors we will check them with Cats laws. The tests are more fine 
grained than only these 4 laws so if some fail we will get a better idea what and where to fix.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>checkAll</span><span>(</span><span>"Applicative laws"</span><span>,</span> <span>ApplicativeTests</span><span>(</span><span>Image</span><span>.</span><span>imApplicative</span><span>).</span><span>applicative</span><span>[</span><span>Int</span>, <span>Int</span>, <span>String</span><span>])</span></code></pre></figure>

<h4 id="map2">Map2</h4>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>map2</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>],</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>B</span><span>],</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>C</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>C</span><span>]`</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This says it can merge two contexts. The <code>f</code> function knows how to merge A and B into a new value C,
but <code>map2</code> knows (just like <code>pure</code>) about what the <code>F</code> context means, so it actually knows to merge both contexts together.
We can replace the word “context” with “effect”:  map2 knows how to merge two effects.</p>

<h4 id="apply">Apply</h4>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>app</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>B</span><span>],</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>])</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>B</span><span>]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is more tricky to understand intuitively but given a function/program wrapped in the context/effect <code>F</code>,
we can run the program with the value in <code>a: F[A]</code>.
Not to be confused with the functor’s <code>map(a: F[A], f: A =&gt; B): F[B]</code> - there is an extra <code>F</code> over <code>f</code> in apply.</p>

<p>Because <code>apply</code> also gets as input two <code>F</code>s and returns only one it means that it also knows how to merge these <code>F</code>s (just like <code>map2</code>)</p>

<h4 id="map2-vs-apply">Map2 vs Apply</h4>
<p>So what is the difference? Formally none because we can write one in terms of the other + pure</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>def</span> <span>map2</span><span>[</span><span>F</span><span>[</span><span>_</span><span>]</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>B</span>, <span>C</span><span>](</span><span>fa</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>],</span> <span>fb</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>B</span><span>],</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>C</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>C</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>val</span> <span>one</span> <span>=</span> <span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>f</span> <span>curried</span><span>))(</span><span>fa</span><span>)</span>
  <span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>one</span><span>)(</span><span>fb</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>def</span> <span>apply</span><span>[</span><span>A</span>, <span>B</span><span>](</span><span>ff</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>B</span><span>])(</span><span>fa</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>])</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>B</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>map2</span><span>(</span><span>ff</span><span>,</span> <span>fa</span><span>)((</span><span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>So it’s clear that both <code>map2</code> and <code>apply</code> know how to merge F contexts/effects, but what about the difference in signatures?</p>

<p><code>ff: F[A =&gt; B]</code> from <code>apply</code> is the partial application of <code>f: (A, B) =&gt; C</code> from <code>map2</code> with <code>a: F[A]</code>.
It kinda holds a <code>F[A]</code> inside. More precisely it’s a program which ran with input A will produce a F[B].
We’ll see this below on images.</p>

<h4 id="applicative-is-also-a-functor">Applicative is also a Functor</h4>
<p>The complete name is: <a href="http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/Applicative.pdf">applicative functor</a>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>def</span> <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>A</span>, <span>B</span><span>](</span><span>fa</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>])(</span><span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>A</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>B</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>B</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>))(</span><span>fa</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>But functor is not an applicative, functor does not have <code>pure</code> so it does not know as much about what <code>F</code> means.</p>

<h4 id="applicative-on-images">Applicative on images</h4>

      <span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Given F is an Image it means we can combine any 2 images, pixel by pixel. Of course, if we can combine 2 images we can also combine any N images.</p>

<h3 id="getting-more-intuition-on-map2-and-apply">Getting more intuition on Map2 and Apply</h3>

<p>We define a program in our F (Image), which will generate a checkers-like pattern.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala">    <span>def</span> <span>checkerPattern</span><span>:</span> <span>Image</span><span>[</span><span>Color</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Color</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

            <span>else</span> <span>c</span>
        <span>}</span>
      <span>)</span>
    <span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We will run this program giving it as input the original bird image, and we get</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>checkerPattern</span><span>)(</span><span>bird</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://adrian-salajan.github.io/assets/posts/applicative-image/colorifyBird3.png" alt="checkers-bird"></p>

<p>Now let’s create the same result with map2.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>map2</span><span>(</span><span>bird</span><span>,</span> <span>checkerPattern</span><span>)((</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>b</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://adrian-salajan.github.io/assets/posts/applicative-image/colorifyBirdPlusNoBird3.png" alt="checkers-bird"></p>

<p>I’m going to repeat myself because this is awesome:<br>
<code>ff: F[A =&gt; B]</code> from <code>apply</code> is the partial application of <code>f: (A, B) =&gt; C</code> from <code>map2</code> with <code>a: F[A]</code>,
<strong>it kinda holds a <code>F[A]</code> inside</strong>. We can even extract this core image from our checkerPattern program in order to see it by giving it the transparent color:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>checkerPattern</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>c</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>c</span><span>(</span><span>Color</span><span>.</span><span>Clear</span><span>))</span>
<span>//OR</span>
<span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>checkerPattern</span><span>)(</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>Color</span><span>.</span><span>Clear</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://adrian-salajan.github.io/assets/posts/applicative-image/checker.png" alt="checkers"></p>

<p>And one more fun example, combined with the bird image:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>I don’t think any little girl grows up with the goal of “I want to be an OSS Android browser developer” and to be totally honest, even as an adult I just kind of fell into it. I first joined Mozilla as an intern during my change-career journey mainly because I had taken one Android class, knew some Java, and applied on a whim at the right time to hit the recruiter’s inbox. Despite not actively seeking Mozilla or Android out, I immediately fell in love with the project and team and knew I had stumbled into a very special place. The problems were interesting, I had opportunities for leadership and growth from the start, and the people were kind, smart, and supportive.</p>

<p>At Mozilla you’ll meet the smartest and most passionate people who could be tech leaders at any other major company (and almost certainly make more money) but are choosing to work specifically on Firefox because they believe in the product and the mission. It’s definitely intimidating to come in as an intern to one of the original “software companies” but everyone I’ve met is truly wonderful and welcoming. It was (mostly) fun to be the underdog and celebrate our wins, large and small alike. I felt connected to the mission and the products we were creating. I felt like I had a large impact in my team after only a short amount of time (most teams are quite small and tight-knit). The fans and the community were passionate and many times I had the cool experience of wearing a Firefox t-shirt in public and people thanking me for my work (now that I’m writing this, it feels a bit odd. I guess you had to be there).</p>

<p>So if it’s so great then why am I leaving? I know it’s not a satisfying answer, verging on cliche, but I’m just looking to do something new. That and.. I am also extremely burnt out. The very small mobile team has been through a gauntlet in order to ship a full rewrite of the flagship Firefox for Android browser (partly during the pandemic no less). Working too much during the week for the last 2 years was normal for me and while never asked for from my team, I cared deeply about the product and the success and it would have been impossible to hit our deadlines and ship something I was proud of without it. And when we finally did ship, I WAS proud of our team and what we had accomplished, but the release just felt like a blip in our planned schedule before jumping into more sprints and fires and thinking about the next iteration.</p>

<p>I did take one week of PTO right after our release! … which just so happened to be the week that the large layoffs happened. I was safe from layoffs, but morale plummeted, and I was definitely not refreshed. The cherry on top was being specifically targeted for harassment that same week after the release by unhappy users of Firefox looking for someone to direct their frustrations at<sup><a href="#myfootnote1">1</a></sup>. There’s nothing that Mozilla really could have done in this scenario, but it left a terrible taste in my mouth after all of the blood, sweat, and tears I had put into this project. For someone who thought of themselves as an empathetic dev overworking myself FOR the end users and product, this hurt and I’m not sure I ever really recovered. While the pace is slowing down now and there’s a promise of no more deadline crunches, I just feel that I haven’t been able to catch my breath no matter how much time I take off. Whether that’s the project, pandemic fatigue, or all of the above, I’m very ready for a break, a fresh start, and a change of pace.</p>

<p>Working in open source full-time has been an incredible experience that has had its extreme ups and downs. On the positive side, I’ve loved mentoring new contributors to get their first open source PR merged. I’ve enjoyed all the positive interactions with the lovely community volunteers who care as much about making the product better as I do. On the negative side, it has become increasingly hard for me to separate work from not work. I found myself “contributing” (read - working) at all hours of the day. Replying to issues, emails, and public chats when I was in bed at midnight, when I just woke up at 7am, in the car on the way to go hiking on the weekend, and then while ON the hike. This might be a me problem, but boundary setting when there’s a public repo always getting new issues, comments, emails, and chatroom messages was difficult for me. And of course not all of those messages are nice; the constant stream of negative comments from unhappy and rude users during the work week and outside of it was extremely draining. Besides politicians, this might be one of the only jobs where you can wake up to an inbox full of emails and messages about how much everyone thinks you suck at your job. You definitely grow a thick skin quickly, but it’s still exhausting.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people tend to forget that Mozilla was also my very first job in tech. I learned so much there and there’s always more I could learn, but it’s good to try new experiences and face new problems, especially early in my career. I will be forever grateful for the experiences I’ve had at Mozilla and the people I’ve met. It was my “big break” into tech and I will never forget that! I will keep using and supporting Firefox and take a lot of the Mozilla ideals with me wherever I go. My experience was super formative for how I view ethics, privacy, and other important issues inside the tech space.</p>

<p>I am excited about my break and my next adventure but I’m definitely very sad to be leaving Mozilla and the wonderful people. The (good) problem with working with people who are true friends is it’s painful when people leave, including yourself. I will miss everyone dearly, especially all of my mobile team peers. I hope you all stay in touch and our paths cross again once conferences are a thing again (or maybe I’ll just crash the next All Hands, I’m not above it). If you’re at Mozilla and want to say goodbye, please ping me in the next 2 weeks! I’ve also heard I’m quite easy to find online! 😉</p>

<p>Love you all ❤️ XOXO</p>

<p><a name="myfootnote1">1</a>: EDIT: Saw this made it onto Hacker News and people in the comments were doubting this harassment happened. Classic. I documented it well on my Twitter at the time, but I’m happy to give more context. I tweeted around the time of release that I was proud of the team for all our hard work and I’m not “worrying about the haters” with a photo of me drinking a beer and flipping off the camera. I never referenced users. “Haters” is just a saying that the youngins say that isn’t specific but according to the internet, <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hater-4589594">“a hater is a slang term used in everyday language and especially online to describe an individual who talks and behaves negatively in response to other people’s success and goal achievement.”</a> It was a light-hearted joke for my Twitter friends after a year of hard work and constant negativity. In response this tweet was posted all over Reddit and 4chan and then there were coordinated doxxing attacks, multiple 4chan threads full of violent sexual and death threats, troll PRs opened in our repo, all of my photos pulled off of my Instagram and posted into these threads with disgusting commentary, and actual calls to my work from fake “journalists” to try to get me fired. I’m not going to post the comments here because they make me sick but feel free to search the archives to see for yourself. If you think this is ever an appropriate response to a dev on the team telling a joke online, I can’t help you.</p>

<p><span><span>Important News!&nbsp; February 4, 2021</span></span></p>

<p justify="" text-align:=""><span><span>First the good news. The repairing/rebuilding of Aurora Clocks will likely continue for many years.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Now some&nbsp;bad news.&nbsp; We just sold the last of the new cases we used for&nbsp;new Auroras.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The availability of new Auroras are becoming&nbsp;problematic. Here's the story.&nbsp; For 60 years one&nbsp;company, Hansen motors,&nbsp; has been manufacturing the motor and&nbsp;"special"&nbsp;movements for the Aurora.&nbsp; Hansen was bought&nbsp;a couple of years ago and the new owners have decided to discontinue production of all&nbsp;clock&nbsp;movements.&nbsp; The movement is a&nbsp;gear-train that moves&nbsp;the hour and minute hands.&nbsp; They will continue making the motors which will allow us to keep doing repairs for a long time.&nbsp; And more good news, &nbsp;95% of the&nbsp;movements never fail even after 40 years.&nbsp; They just need a little oil every 25 years.&nbsp; So that's the "movement news, but there is more....</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Other partially good news, I have about 140 of new Aurora movements, but now&nbsp;another problem,&nbsp;I &nbsp;don't feel like&nbsp;investing another $16,000 in a batch of new Aurora cases to go with those movements without some encouragement.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Last time this happened was 10 years ago.&nbsp;Here is a similar plan to what I did then.&nbsp; If enough customers send&nbsp;in $100 deposits/clock we will&nbsp;put them back in production. And I would not cash the checks until I had decided to go ahead. And they would only be charged $459 more for each Aurora + shipping.&nbsp; Last time, about 25 customers sent in checks for about 30 Auroras so I went ahead.&nbsp; It takes about 4 months from ordering new Aurora cases to shipping your clocks to you.  And it way take 2-4 months to get enought deposit checks.</span></span></span></span></p>
			<p><span><span><span><span>For your reference, since new Auroras were becoming scarce I was raising the price during the last month of production.  The last ones were sold for $699 plus shipping.  So the customer sending in deposit checks will be saving between $100 to $140/clock. </span></span></span></span></p>
			<p><span><span><span><span>The world keeps changing.&nbsp; But I am Mr. Persistent, a.k.a. Barry Gamble.&nbsp; Take care my friends.  Hey, I just get my 1st COVID vaccine shot yesterday.  Yea!</span></span></span></span></p>

</h2>

				<p>So, on my desk I often have a desktop computer and a laptop. I've got a decent HDMI/USB <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch">KVM switch</a> so I can flip my big monitor, keyboard and mouse between the two, and that's great.</p>

<p>However, I also have a hi-fi amplifier and speakers for audio output. This is hooked up to the desktop PC, and has selectable inputs, one of which is connected to a lead for the laptop - but I rarely plug the laptop in. This is because I can only select one input on the amplifier; and although I'm usually only listening to media from one device, I want to be able to hear notification pings from either. So I tend to leave the laptop on its own nasty little speakers and only have nice audio from the desktop PC.</p>

<p>Clearly, this sucks. Many years ago I had a cheapo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixing_console">mixing console</a> that sat on my desk, with my CD player, minidisc player, and PC connected to the inputs, outputting into my amplifier; it was cool to be able to just hit play on anything and hear the result through my good speakers, and having all those knobs and sliders to play with was definitely gratifying. However, it was bulky, full of useless-to-me features like phono inputs and cross faders, and eventually died a death from being left switched on all the time.</p>

<p>Plus, I'd recently <a href="https://www.snell-pym.org.uk/archives/2020/11/09/electronics-projects/">resolved to do more electronics</a>, so there was only one thing to do: Make a mixer.</p>

<p><a href="https://snell-pym.org.uk/photos2/2021-02-09%20The_Polyp_Mixer.html"><img src="https://snell-pym.org.uk/photos2/2021-02-09%20The_Polyp_Mixer-medium.jpeg" alt="The Polyp Mixer"></a></p>



<p>My requirements are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Physically small; desk space is precious. In the long run I will probably mount it underneath a shelf when I build my custom desk so it takes up zero footprint, which means it needs to have controls on the front and sockets on the back, and ideally have the bare minimum of cross-sectional area required to fit those controls and sockets.</li>
<li>Sound good. I'm no audiophile, but I don't want it to be the weak link in the audio chain. I am very much a beginner at analogue electronic design, but I wanted to do a good job of this rather than blindly following some design off the Internet and risking it sounding bad.</li>
<li>Four line level inputs, so I have room for growth. I mainly have two inputs on the desk, but I plan to add a radio transceiver in the near future which would make it three, and adding one more for experiments makes it a nice round number.</li>
<li>12v DC power, as I'm standardising on that for a number of upcoming infrastructure projects.</li>
<li>Adjustable volume for each channel, so I can fiddle with knobs.</li>
</ol>

<p>There's no need for cross-faders, tone controls, phono inputs, a separate headphone mixer for DJs to cue up the next track, VU meters, or even a master volume knob (I can just use the one on the actual amplifier).</p>

<p>So, I set out searching the Internet and scouring my books, and came up with a design.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>I had to learn a whole bunch of stuff to design this, so I'm going to share what I learned. I'm assuming that, like me, you know electronics basics such as what components basically do, the kind of DC digital/power electronics required to light up LEDs and all that, but are new to analogue stuff.</p>

<h3>Op Amps</h3>

<p>I'll defer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_amplifier">Wikipedia</a> for deeper details, but the TL;DR version is that the op-amp has two inputs (+ and -) and an output, and the output voltage is some large number (the "open loop gain", typically a hundred thousand or so) times the voltage at + minus the voltage at -. Subject to loads of caveats about the + and - voltages being between the power supply voltages minus some headroom, and the output can't go beyond the power supply voltages minus some headroom, and so on. But if the input voltages are both well between the power supply voltages, and the difference between them times the open loop gain is also well between the power supply voltages, and nothing is changing too fast, then the simple rule holds.</p>

<p>But a gain of one hundred thousand is excessive for many applications, not to mention that the gain varies with temperature and frequency and all sorts of other random stuff we don't want our circuit sensitive to, so these are used as building blocks to make actual useful amplifiers.</p>

<p>The simplest way of doing this is to observe that if we connect the output back to the - input and feed a voltage into the + input, the op amp will try its hardest to make the output voltage almost equal the input voltage on the + input. If the output voltage is at all below the + input, then because that lower voltage is fed into the - input, there will be a positive difference, the output voltage will be pushed up. If the output voltage is below the + input, then the difference will be negative, and the output voltage will be pushed down. If they are exactly equal then the difference will be zero, which also pushes the output voltage down - but if the output voltage is just a tiny fraction (the output voltage divided by that large open-loop gain) below the + input voltage it'll just balance out. This is called a "unit-gain buffer" or "voltage follower" because it basically copies a voltage.</p>

<p>Why's that useful?</p>

<p>Well, another important trait of op amps is their impedance. The input looks like a very large (megaohms) resistor to ground, so when it's connected to a circuit, it doesn't draw much current and doesn't affect the circuit much; it just quietly samples its voltage, like a multimeter. However, the output can provide a reasonable amount of current when it tries to produce the desired output voltage, so it can drive loads that consume actual power. This means a unit-gain buffer can be used to measure the voltage in a circuit without influencing it, driving something that needs that voltage but will consume some power. This is why amplifiers are used in audio to drive speakers!</p>

<h3>Inverting Amplifier</h3>

<p>After the unit-gain buffer, the next simplest op amp circuit is the inverting amplifier, and it's perhaps the most useful.</p>

<p>So, imagine you have two inputs, A and B. If you feed B straight into the + input of an op amp, just like with the unit-gain buffer, but then make a potential divider out of two identical R-ohm resistors; connect A to one end; connect the op amp output to the other end; and connect the - input to the middle. Because the - input has that high impedance, so doesn't draw current from the circuit and just looks at the voltage, the - input will always be at a voltage exactly halfway between the output voltage and voltage A.</p>

<p>As before, if this midpoint voltage is below B it will be pushed up by the op-amp increasing the output voltage and if it's above B it will be pushed down by the op-amp decreasing the output voltage, and the output voltage will only be steady when the midpoint voltage is just a tiny fraction below the voltage at +, which is voltage B. Because that voltage is always the midpoint between A and the output, it means that if A is at 5v and B is at 4v, so the midpoint voltage is 4v, then the output voltage must be 3v.</p>

<p>And if A is at 6v while B is at 4v, the output voltage must be 2v.</p>

<p>So, the output voltage is equal to (2*B)-A.</p>

<p>And because the feedback is through a potential divider, you can vary the resistances to create different effects. If the voltage at the - input, rather than being the exact midpoint because the two resistors are the same, is actually one third of the voltage difference from A to the output because you use 1k ohms between A and the - input and 2k ohms between the - input and the output, then the output voltage will have to swing twice as far to make the - input nearly the same as the + input; the output voltage will be B plus twice B-A. If you swap the resistors around, it'll be B plus half B-A. You can set the gain to whatever you want - the output voltage will be B plus (R2/R1)*(B-A).</p>

<p>Another way of looking at it is with current flows. Remembering that almost zero current flows into the inputs of an op amp, and that the op amp set up with feedback from its output to its - input will try to make its - and + inputs be at the same voltage, we can assume that the - input is at around the same voltage as the + input, voltage B. So the first resistor R1 between A and - has a voltage difference of (A-B) across it, and so some current will flow, (A-B)/R1 (from I=V/R). But that current can't flow into the op-amp so it <em>has</em> to flow into the second resistor R2 and out of the output. If that current is flowing through resistor R2, then the voltage across R2 must be R2<em>(A-B)/R1 (from V=IR). Since the "top" of that resistor is at about voltage B, then the voltage at the "bottom" of that resistor where the output is connected must be at voltage B-R2</em>(A-B)/R1, and if you simplify that, you get B+(R2/R1)*(B-A) volts at the output, as we had before.</p>

<p>However, this also highlights a downside of the inverting amplifier: it draws current from the input, while a bare op-amp input like the unit-gain buffer only draws negligible current. But the good news is, that current is (A-B)/R1 and we get to choose R1; we can choose any input impedance we want by just setting R1, and then choose R2 based on R1 and the gain we want!</p>

<h3>Audio line levels</h3>

<p>So, what exactly comes out of that line-out or headphone-out socket on a computer?</p>

<p>The standard plug is a "3.5mm TRS jack"; TRS because it has three conductors - the Tip, a Ring, and the Sleeve. The Tip is the left channel audio, the Ring is the right channel audio, and the sleeve is the ground reference. We cannot assume that the audio source can provide much current (if it's a headphone jack it probably can, but if it's just a line output it probably can't; and a lot of equipment these days conflates headphone and line outputs), so we need a high impedance input. The voltage on the audio channels will be an AC signal, going above and below the ground reference in voltage, no more than 2 volts peak to peak (so +/- 1v), ranging from about 20Hz to 20kHz for good music reproduction.</p>

<h3>Starting the Mixer Design: Input Amplifiers</h3>

<p>So, the first stage of my mixer needs to be to buffer each input so we present a controlled high load impedance to all the connected audio sources, and then have a …</p></div></div>

 <li>Nadella dismissed claims that Microsoft is engaging in antitrust activity with its Teams service. </li>

<p data-pos="4">Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shrugged off Slack's antitrust complaints against Microsoft and attributed some of the chat app's successes to free access to MicrosoftWindows <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-10/microsoft-ceo-says-big-tech-needs-clearer-laws-on-online-speech" rel="nofollow">in an interview with Emily Chang of </a><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-10/microsoft-ceo-says-big-tech-needs-clearer-laws-on-online-speech" rel="nofollow">Bloomberg Television.</a> </p>
<p data-pos="6">Nadella said, "Would Slack have even existed if it was not for the free access they had on top of, say, the Windows platform?" </p><p>
The messaging app <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/slack-microsoft-eu-antitrust-complaint-teams-app-anticompetitive-2020-7" rel="nofollow">filed an antitrust complaint in Europe last year</a> over Microsoft bundling its Teams chat platform with Office 365. </p>

<p data-pos="16">Both Apple and Google <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-amazon-google-pass-costs-digital-services-taxes-2020-9" rel="nofollow">raised fees</a> they charge developers in some European countries in late 2020 to defray costs from new European taxes. Microsoft <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/store/register/" rel="nofollow">charges a one-time fee for developers</a> to register on its interface. </p><p>
Nadella said to Bloomberg's Chang that Microsoft provides "the most open platform in Windows and even in Office 365."
Both <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/slack-7000-new-paid-customers-since-february-coronavirus-2020-3" rel="nofollow">Slack</a> and its competitor <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-teams-daily-active-users-2020-10" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Teams</a> have seen surges since remote work became the new normal during the coronavirus pandemic. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/salesforce-slack-acquisition-merger-deal-2020-11" rel="nofollow">Salesforce acquired Slack</a> in $28 billion deal, the companies announced in December 2020. </p>
<p data-pos="22">Microsoft did not immediately responded to a request for comment. </p>
<p data-pos="24">Jonathan Prince, Slack's vice president of communications and policy, said in an email, "the idea that Slack wouldn't exist without the company that has tried to copy and then destroy it is as silly as it is irrelevant."</p><p>
Prince addded, "the only relevant question is whether Microsoft is illegally abusing its dominance and tying Teams to its apps and services in order to protect its chokehold on </p><keyword keytype="UnKnown" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="enterprise" actualkeyword="enterprise">enterprise</keyword><p> software and prevent the discovery and adoption of new and innovative tools. It's an especially brazen bait and switch for Mr. Nadella to ask us to ignore their current illegal behavior because their past illegal behavior doesn't include an attempt to block the launch of Slack on PCs back in 2013."</p>
<p data-pos="28">Microsoft is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-satya-nadella-us-tech-firms-should-welcome-competition-2021-2" rel="nofollow">no stranger to antitrust complaints</a>. Prior to Nadella's tenure, then CEO Bill Gates <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-microsoft-antitrust-lawsuit-2019-6" rel="nofollow">faced down a federal antitrust case</a> in the early 1990s. In 1998, Microsoft was sued by the Justice Department. Initially, it was ruled that Microsoft should be broken up, but that ruling was later overturned. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>

<p><strong>Update 1:58 AM PT:</strong> <em>Updated the post to clear confusion about how Google’s Safe Browsing feature works.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Apple’s privacy push is much more widespread than it seems at the surface. A perfect example is the new privacy feature in <a href="https://the8-bit.com/ios-14-5-changes/">iOS 14.5 Beta 1 (V2)</a> which redirects Google Safe Browsing traffic through Apple’s own proxy servers to enhance users’ privacy and to not let Google see your IP address. </p>
<p>Google Safe Browsing is a security service created by Google that checks whether a website is malicious. When you access a website on the desktop version of Chrome on your Mac or PC, for instance, Google Safe Browsing checks if a website is safe to browse and displays a warning accordingly. The user ultimately has the choice, however.</p>
<p>As Reddit user u/jaydenkieran explains, Apple uses Google Safe Browsing when you enable “Fraudulent Website Warning” within the Safari settings in the Settings app on iPhone or iPad.</p>
<p><a aria-label="According to Google (opens in a new tab)" href="https://support.google.com/transparencyreport/answer/7380435?hl=en#zippy=%2Chow-do-you-determine-that-a-site-is-unsafe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Google</a>, its Safe Browsing system works by scanning sections of Google’s web index and “identifying potentially compromised websites.” Then, Google tests those websites by using a virtual machine to check if the website compromises the system. If it does, it’s added to Google’s online database. Google also identifies phishing websites by using statistical models. </p>
<p><a aria-label="According to Apple (opens in a new tab)" href="https://support.apple.com/en-ae/HT210675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Apple</a>, before visiting a website, Safari may send hashed prefixes of the URL (Apple terms it “information calculated from the website address”) to Google Safe Browsing to check if there’s a match. </p>
<p>Since Apple uses a hashed prefix, Google cannot learn which website the user is trying to visit. Up until iOS 14.5, Google could also see the IP address of where that request is coming from. However, since Apple now proxies Google Safe Browsing traffic, it further safeguards users’ privacy while browsing using Safari.</p>
<p>Apple has been intensifying its push for privacy with iOS 14 what with the <a href="https://the8-bit.com/app-tracking-transparency-guide/">App Tracking Transparency update and the inclusion of App Privacy Reports in the App Store</a>. </p><div><p>See also</p><div id="block-wrap-78641" data-id="78641" data-base="0"><div><div><div><article><div><p><a href="https://the8-bit.com/what-is-app-store-small-business-program/" title="App-Store-Policy-15-App-Store-Program"><img width="100" height="100" src="https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/App-Store-Policy-15-App-Store-Program-100x100.jpg" alt="App Store Policy 15 App Store Program" srcset="https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/App-Store-Policy-15-App-Store-Program-100x100.jpg 100w, https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/App-Store-Policy-15-App-Store-Program-80x80.jpg 80w, https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/App-Store-Policy-15-App-Store-Program-432x432.jpg 432w, https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/App-Store-Policy-15-App-Store-Program-529x529.jpg 529w, https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/App-Store-Policy-15-App-Store-Program-724x724.jpg 724w, https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/App-Store-Policy-15-App-Store-Program-1039x1039.jpg 1039w" sizes="(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px"></a></p></div></article></div></div></div></div></div>
<p>At the same time, companies like Facebook are actively opposing the Cupertino giant, accusing it of negatively affecting the advertising industry. Apple’s response has been simple: </p>
<p>“We believe that this is a simple matter of standing up for our users. Users should know when their data is being collected and shared across other apps and websites — and they should have the choice to allow that or not. App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14 does not require Facebook to change its approach to tracking users and creating targeted advertising, it simply requires they give users a choice.” </p>
<p>Google itself <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/04/google-still-hasnt-updated-its-ios-apps-while-pondering-android-privacy-controls" target="_blank" aria-label="had been holding off (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">had been holding off</a> on updating its host of apps on the App Store due to the App Privacy Health Reports in the App Store that lets users view how an app tracks them. However, Google later disclosed that it will update its apps to include as little tracking as possible.</p>
<p>Having said that, it’s interesting to see Apple focus on enhancing user privacy as much as they can. And setting up a proxy server to filter Google Safe Browsing traffic just so Google cannot users’ browsing activity will be a welcome move for a lot of users.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What’s the most successful rebranding of the past 10 years? Airbnb? Google? Burger King? Nope. The award goes to….🥁🥁🥁….skipping breakfast! What was once best known as an excuse for lazy teenagers who didn’t feel like making a bowl of cereal is now being shouted from the rooftops from health enthusiasts and experts. Its new name: intermittent fasting.</p><p>For those that aren’t aware, there is an unwritten rule of intermittent fasting: you must unabashedly tell all your friends and family about how amazing it is. After a couple months of trying it out, it’s time for me to follow orders.</p><h2 id="fasting-101">Fasting 101</h2><p>When we think of nutrition, we often focus on how much we eat (calories) and what we eat (fats carbs, proteins, etc.) However, there is an important and often underemphasized third dimension: when we eat. As described on a popular fasting app’s <a href="https://www.zerofasting.com/why-fasting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">website</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Three meals a day is a modern accident. Our metabolisms are programmed for periods of feast and famine. Unlike constantly-grazing cows with four stomachs, we aren’t built to maintain a constant drip of food.</p></blockquote><p>The gist of intermittent fasting is to reduce your eating window. There are a variety of styles. The 13:11 Circadian Rhythm style consists of a 13 hour fast followed by an 11 hour eating window. It tries to replicate the body’s natural clock by fasting roughly after sunset until morning. The 16:8 is the most popular. To reach the 16 hour fasting goal, it’s common to fast from dinner to lunch the next day. Aka skipping breakfast.</p><h2 id="the-benefits-of-fasting">The Benefits of Fasting</h2><p>People are excited about intermittent fasting for good reason. Numerous studies show promising physical and mental benefits. For example, it can help you:</p><ul><li>⚡️ Boost energy</li><li>💪 Lose weight</li><li>✨ Reduce inflammation</li><li>🩸 Reduce insulin resistance (driver of Type 2 diabetes)</li><li>🧠 Increase mental clarity</li></ul><p>You can read about these benefits and others in more detail <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/intermittent-fasting-guide#benefits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-health-benefits-of-intermittent-fasting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h2 id="my-experience">My Experience</h2><p>Today is my 65th day in a row fasting and I plan to stick with it for the foreseeable future. I’m impressed with its ease and effectiveness.</p><p>I started with a 13:11 style and quickly moved to a 16:8 structure. I skip breakfast and have my first meal around 12-2pm. During the first week I was a little hungry and tired in the morning, but now I feel great right up until my first meal of the day. In fact, I now frequently extend the fast to 16-20 hours.</p><p>I’ve noticed a number of physical and mental benefits. And unlike other dietary changes I actually enjoy it. I can harness my inner teenager and be lazy about breakfast. If I feel like ice cream I can have some damn ice cream and not feel guilty about it. In return, I have more energy and mental clarity. I’m also at my lowest weight level and % body fat since the prime of my collegiate soccer days. Below is how its impacted my weight so far:</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>As I learned in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24945404-the-obesity-code" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Obesity Code</a>, we have a natural weight set point. Kinda like a body weight thermostat. While traditional diets that focus on calorie reduction can help you lost weight in the short term, they rarely work long term because we naturally gravitate back to our set point. In contrast, fasting can actually change your set point, enabling long term weight change. While it’s still early, my initial results are promising.</p><p>While my experience has been positive, it’s important to mention that <strong>fasting is NOT for everyone</strong>. Everybody’s body responds differently. Accordingly, it’s important to consult a doctor before trying it. This is especially true if you have diabetes, have problems with blood sugar regulation, take medications, are underweight, have a history of eating disorders, or are pregnant.</p><h2 id="fasting-tips">Fasting Tips</h2><p>The Obesity Code contains a bunch of great intermittent fasting tips. I wouldn’t have been able to beat the initial hunger and fatigue without them. Straight from the book:</p><ul><li>💧 <strong>Drink water</strong>: Start each morning with a full eight-ounce glass of water.</li><li>🤹‍♂️ <strong>Stay busy</strong>: It’ll keep your mind off food.</li><li>☕️ <strong>Drink coffee</strong>: Coffee is a mild appetite suppressant. Green tea, black tea and bone broth may also help.</li><li>🏄‍♂️ <strong>Ride the waves</strong>: Hunger comes in waves; it is not continuous. When it hits, slowly drink a glass of water or a hot cup of coffee. Often by the time you’ve finished, your hunger will have passed.</li><li>🤫 <strong>Don’t tell everybody you are fasting</strong>: Most people will try to discourage you, as they do not understand the benefits. A close-knit support group is beneficial, but telling everybody you know is not a good idea.</li><li>📅 <strong>Give yourself one month</strong>: It takes time for your body to get used to fasting. The first few times you fast may be difficult, so be prepared. Don’t be discouraged. It will get easier.</li><li>🥑 <strong>Follow a nutritious diet on non-fast days</strong>: Intermittent fasting is not an excuse to eat whatever you like. During non-fasting days, stick to a nutritious diet low in sugars and refined carbohydrates.</li><li>🍽 <strong>Don’t binge</strong>: After fasting, pretend it never happened. Eat normally, as if you had never fasted</li></ul><p>Interested in learning more?

<p>Sennett Devermont is a police accountability activist whose streams police encounters to his Instagram followers. When he visited the Beverly Hills Police Department last Fri to obtain a form, BHPD Sergeant Billy Fair recognized him and began blasting music from of his phone.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLCpHBQjX8r/">https://www.instagram.com/p/CLCpHBQjX8r/</a></p>
<p>Fair was following the example of other BHPD officers who have made a habit of playing copyrighted music during encounters with the public, apparently to trigger automated copyright takedowns on the major social media platforms.</p>

<p>As Dexter Thomas writes for Vice, this form of copyfraud has a failsafe: if the filter doesn't block the livestream, the archived footage might be easily removed through copyright complaints.</p>
<p>Instagram's copyright policy suggests that videos with incidental music are permitted, but the company's filters are incapable of distinguishing "incidental" and "non-incidental" use, while its appeals process is a long-running production of Kafka's Trial.</p>

<p>Moreover, the platforms use a "copystrike" system, which means that cops who successfully deploy this tactic can chip away at activists' presence on the system – three strikes and their accounts are permanently removed.</p>
<p>Thomas: "…[P]laying copyrighted music as a deterrent to the First Amendment-guaranteed right to openly film police is, if not BHPD official protocol, at least a technique that has been deployed by more than one officer."</p>
<p>Back in 2019, anti-racist activists experimented with playing copyrighted music at Nazi rallies to make them unpostable on social media. At the time, I warned that this would end badly.</p>

<p>Exactly a year later, BLM protest videos started disappearing from the internet thanks to copyfraud and overactive copyright filters.</p>

<p>Copyright filters are a terrible idea, not just because they have all but eliminated the ability of musicians to perform classical music online:</p>

<p>Nor merely because they allow giant companies to steal from independent video creators:</p>

<p>They're a bad idea because they create a backdoor system for censorship of any and all material – because they fray the fabric of our online speech forums, and give bullies a devastating weapon to use against those who document their crimes.</p>

<p>Two of the most astute IP scholars I know also happen to be two of the best legal writers I know, and also happen to work at one of the worst IP abusers in the country: Jennifer Jenkins and James Boyle, of Duke University, the nation's leading academic trademark abuser.</p>
<p>Duke has a universal reputation for being a serious trademark abuser, but Jenkins and Boyle wanted to empirically investigate that reputation. The result is "Mark of the Devil: The University as Brand Bully," forthcoming in Fordham IPLJ.</p>
<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3780381">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3780381</a></p>
<p>To do empirical work, you have to find stuff to count. The problem is that questions like "who is the biggest bully?" are stubbornly qualitative, and quantizing Duke's conduct risks incinerating the most important elements in the quest for some kind of quantitative residue.</p>
<p>But the authors hit on a very good quantitative/qualitative methodology: they would count trademark oppositions, which are legal filings sent after a trademark has received preliminary approval. That way, they'd be counting oppositions to trademarks that had some merit.</p>
<p>Even better: trademark oppositions have to be accompanied by legal arguments explaining why the university thinks the trademark should be blocked, and that produces a qualitative account of how Duke thinks about its trademark.</p>
<p>Then Jenkins and Boyle used their considerable legal knowledge to characterize each opposition's argument on the basis of how plausible or stupid it was, quantizing the qualitative question of whether Duke's lawyers were fucking around.</p>
<p>Some background: universities have reinvented themselves as brand-factories and oriented their activities around slapping their logos on random shit and selling it. That's why Ohio State applied for a trademark on, I shit you not, the word "the."</p>
<p>Boise State asked for a trademark on all non-green football fields. U Texas wants the trademark over making devil horns with your fingers ("I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of metalheads suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced").</p>
<p>The trademark and licensing business is a squalid affair. The (grossly overstated, rarely realized) risk of a mark lapsing into the public domain ("genericide") justifies endless bullying of people who say and do normal things that glance off your trademarks.</p>
<p>Trademark was established to protect buyers, by allowing the makers of well-known goods to punish rivals who sought to deceive their customers. Over the years, trademark has been distorted into just another grift, a way to make the rich, richer.</p>
<p>As the authors point out, citing Mark Lemley et al, there's no good trademark justification for allowing a university to snuff out "counterfeit" tees  – the buyers of these items haven't been tricked into getting a bargain on a way to advertise their team allegiance.</p>
<p>But the expansion of trademark into an economic right for mark-makers (and away from a way of protecting the public from deceptive sellers), combined with the bogeyman of genericide add up to a perfect business for the greedy and unscrupulous. For bullies.</p>
<p>So, is Duke a bully?</p>
<p>Oh shit yes.</p>
<p>Let's look at some graphs. Here's how Duke stacks up against comparable US institutions in terms of how often it challenges a trademark.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukecancels.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukecancels.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>They slice this data many ways but it always looks like this: Duke is a huge outlier.</p>
<p>But wait! Maybe those trademark cancellations are good, actually. So let's go to the quantized, hand-coded qualitative assessments of Duke's arguments.</p>
<p>They're garbage.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukemerit.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukemerit.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>"85% of Duke’s oppositions were coded either clearly erroneous or far-fetched"</p>
<p>But wait! Maybe the authors are being mean to Duke. What's "erroneous or far-fetched?" Well, it seems that Duke challenges any trademark application containing "Duke," the letter "D," a devil, the world blue, or any word that sounds like "duke."</p>
<p>All of this is laid out with beautiful clarity in the paper, and the back third of the paper moves on to ask What It All Means – why is Duke such a godawful bully. The authors entertain several possibilities, like perverse incentives in trademark, etc.</p>
<p>But they don't draw conclusions. I have one, and it may be uncomfortable for my honorable and good lawyer friends, which is that law has a bullying problem. There are many fields where esoteric knowledge gives you the power to coerce others, but the law is especially bad.</p>
<p>Luckily, most of my experience of lawyers has been with people who fight for the underdog, but honestly, I think they're the exception. I had a very eye-opening experience about 15 years ago, when a friend asked me to come speak to some co-workers.</p>
<p>My friend worked at a giant company in a creative unit, and he asked me if I'd come speak to his group. It was close by home and I told him of course I'd do it. A day before I was meant to come by, he emailed apologetically to say that legal had sent him a contract for me.</p>
<p>Now, I wasn't charging this massive, profitable company a dime. It was a favor for a pal. But I looked at the contract and it was bonkers – like, I promised I'd never mention the name of the company in print, ever, without written permission.</p>
<p>I told my friend I couldn't sign that clause and he told me he understood, but the legal department wouldn't let me in the building unless I signed it. I canceled the talk. A couple months later, I met a lawyer from the company at a signing and I told him this story.</p>
<p>He grimaced and said he knew whose doing that was, another lawyer in the department who counted their successes by how badly they could humiliate the people who contracted with the company. He listed several of these, each more outrageous than the last.</p>
<p>This wasn't just a power-trip, it was sadism. And it's not limited to that lawyer or that company. I sent back two minor, small-dollar publishing contracts today that had abominable language in them – blanket indemnities, binding arbitration, huge rights grabs.</p>
<p>These aren't (or weren't) standard. There's no business reason for them. I mean, I <em>can't</em> indemnify a multinational corporation against all claims for the simple reason that I couldn't afford to hire lawyers to argue their case. I'd just go bust.</p>
<p>There is a toxic strain of competitive sadism in the law, an ethic of victory through someone else's humiliating defeat. If I had to guess why Duke smashes all those trademark applicants' dreams, I'd say that sadism is playing a major role.</p>

February 10, 2021 | https://brennan.io/2021/02/09/so-python/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://brennan.io/2021/02/09/so-python/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

  
<p><em>Stephen Brennan • 09 February 2021</em></p><p>INTERNET – Stack Overflow users today rejoiced at the prospect of Python’s
upcoming 3.10 release including the controversial new pattern matching feature
described in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0634/">PEP 634</a>.</p>

<p>“Python 3 has been out for a while, and the goldmine of Python 2 to 3 migration
questions has started to run dry since January 2020,” said one user, referring
to the end of life for the Python 2.x release series. “We were starting to
worry that we would run out of major language changes to confuse new developers.
But thanks to pattern matching, we should be set for another 5-7 years!”</p>

<p>The question answerers on the popular site, <a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, were commenting
on the upcoming Python 3.10 language feature of pattern matching, which allows
syntax such as the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>match</span> <span>status_code</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>200</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"OK!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>404</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"HTTP Not Found"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>_</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Some other shit, sorry!"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Stack Overflow users gushed over its similarity to C’s <code>switch</code> statement. “New
users will see the <code>case</code> keyword and instantly feel comfortable based on their
knowledge of C,” one SO answerer remarked. “But that’s when we get them! <code>match</code>
is about subverting expectations, by assigning to variables when the programmer
expects a comparison. We’re going to earn so many Stack Overflow reputation
points this way.”</p>

<p>This user’s comments referred to the unexpected behavior of the match statement
when used with identifiers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>NOT_FOUND</span> <span>=</span> <span>404</span>
<span>match</span> <span>status_code</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>200</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"OK!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>NOT_FOUND</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"HTTP Not Found"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case, rather than matching <code>status_code</code> against the value of
<code>NOT_FOUND</code> (404), Python’s new <del>SO reputation machine</del> match syntax would
assign the value of <code>status_code</code> to the variable <code>NOT_FOUND</code>. Another Stack
Overflow user explained:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think the core developers finally looked at the numbers, and saw how few
questions Python 3.x was getting on Stack Overflow. Here’s a language that has
finally matured, and it really strikes a balance between usability and
predictability. When we reached out to the core development team about the
dire situation, the developers knew they had to step in and add an
unpredictable feature to rectify things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last time the Python language conspired so strongly to confuse new users was
the controversial “mutable default argument” feature:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>def</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[]):</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"myfunc({})"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>))</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>l</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>" l={}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>l</span><span>))</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
 <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
 <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, some Stack Overflow users were not so rosy about the future of Python 3
questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sure, Python 3.10 is going to trigger a massive influx of questions. But that
doesn’t mean we’ll get more reputation points! Most mods are just going to
mark all the questions as duplicates, even if they don’t have good answers
yet. Pattern matching may be a beautifully booby-trapped new feature, but it’s
not going to save us from bad moderation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, the Perl community rallied in support of the latest developments in
the Python language. Said one Perl developer: “Honestly, I’m just glad Python
has finally given in to gratuitous new features, and Perl 7 is now the language
of reason and moderation. I can’t wait until they realize how many operators
they can overload.  Maybe Python 2.7 can make a comeback after all?”</p>

Now, they have conducted a clinical trial to study its efficacy. Trial participants who spent a total of four hours training with the app at home showed an improvement in their ability to handle real height situations.</p><p>Fear of heights is a widespread phenomenon. Approximately 5% of the general population experiences a debilitating level of discomfort in height situations. However, the people affected rarely take advantage of the available treatment options, such as exposure therapy, which involves putting the person in the anxiety-causing situation under the guidance of a professional. On the one hand, people are reluctant to confront their fear of heights. On the other hand, it can be difficult to reproduce the right kinds of height situations in a therapy setting.</p><p>This motivated the interdisciplinary research team led by Professor Dominique de Quervain of the University of Basel to develop a smartphone-based virtual reality exposure therapy app called Easyheights. The app uses 360° images of real locations, which the researchers captured using a drone. People can use the app on their own smartphones together with a special virtual reality headset.</p><h2><b>Gradually increasing the height</b></h2><p>During the virtual experience, the user stands on a platform that is initially one meter above the ground. After allowing acclimatization to the situation for a certain interval, the platform automatically rises. In this way, the perceived distance above the ground increases slowly but steadily without an increase in the person’s level of fear.</p><p>The research team studied the efficacy of this approach in a randomized, controlled trial and published the results in the journal <i><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41746-021-00387-7&amp;t=N2I0MDY0MmQzYjJmMzVjZGRjMDZlMDY1YWYwYTU2ODdjYjgxZDI3OCxjTkoyZTgxNQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F642786101323579392%2Fvr-fear-of-heights-treatment&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1613161766">NPJ Digital Medicine</a></i>. Fifty trial participants with a fear of heights either completed a four-hour height training program (one 60-minute session and six 30-minute sessions over the course of two weeks) using virtual reality, or were assigned to the control group, which did not complete these training sessions.</p><p>Before and after the training phase – or the same period of time without training – the trial participants ascended the Uetliberg lookout tower near Zurich as far as their fear of heights allowed them. The researchers recorded the height level reached by the participants along with their subjective fear level at each level of the tower. At the end of the trial, the researchers evaluated the results from 22 subjects who completed the Easyheights training and 25 from the control group.</p><figure data-orig-height="750" data-orig-width="1000"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a7d2ab9c5b854b35199b6c548b829d0e/bbcffefc0ed2b483-20/s1280x1920/7474345b9acfd469b9bf2042fe648c90b3c3accc.jpg" data-orig-height="750" data-orig-width="1000" width="1000" height="750" alt="image"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;Advanced level of the virtual reality app. Credit: <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.unibas.ch/en/News-Events/News/Uni-Research/Virtual-reality-helping-to-treat-fear-of-heights.html">Bentz et al., NPJ Digital Medicine 2021</a>.</i></p><p>The group that completed the training with the app exhibited less fear on the tower and was able to ascend further towards the top than they could before completing the training. The control group exhibited no positive changes. The efficacy of the Easyheights training proved comparable to that of conventional exposure therapy.</p><h2><b>Therapy in your own living room</b></h2><p>Researchers have already been studying the use of virtual reality for treating fear of heights for more than two decades. “What is new, however, is that smartphones can be used to produce the virtual scenarios that previously required a technically complicated type of treatment, and this makes it much more accessible,” explains Dr. Dorothée Bentz, lead author of the study.</p><p>The results from the study suggest that the repeated use of a smartphone-based virtual reality exposure therapy can greatly improve the behavior and subjective state of well-being in height situations. People who suffer from a mild fear of heights will soon be able to download the free app from major app stores and complete training sessions on their own. However, the researchers recommend that people who suffer from a serious fear of heights only use the app with the supervision of a professional.</p><p>The current study is one of several projects in progress at the Transfaculty Research Platform for Molecular and Cognitive Neurosciences, led by Professor Andreas Papassotiropoulos and Professor Dominique de Quervain.

February 10, 2021 | https://inleaves.com/writing/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://inleaves.com/writing/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			<p>If I’m repeatedly drawn to a thought, feeling, or belief, I write it out. I believe writing is the most practical tool we possess to think <em>far</em> more effectively.</p>
<p>For those of us with woefully average gray matter, our minds have a limited reach. Like an erratic compass needle, our minds cling to the most provocative fragments of ideas without helping us map the territory. <strong>Writing forces us to articulate things with a level of context and coherence we can’t achieve in the mind alone.</strong> Writing lets us expand our working memory. It also exposes the gaps — blind spots, falsity, bias, prejudice, ambiguity — in what we write.</p>
<p>At its best, writing (and reading) can help us confront the ugly and uncomfortable aspects of our nature. It can uproot ideas burrowed so deeply that they’ve imperceptibly shaped our feelings and beliefs. Sometimes this uprooting will reveal that the lustrous potential of a new idea was a mirage, or that your understanding about someone’s motives were incomplete, maybe even projected. <strong>Writing can be therapeutic.</strong>&nbsp;Sculpting the clay of your thoughts can bring clarity, spark ideas, and tidy mental clutter.</p>
<p>I also believe that <strong><a href="https://jsomers.net/blog/more-people-should-write" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making writing a habit can encourage us to be more playful and attentive</a> as we walk this earth.</strong> Writing is a perfect excuse to do something off-kilter, to experience and document something new.</p>
<p>But writing is daunting. Chaotic and awkward. It’s so off-putting that I rarely encounter people in everyday life who enjoy, or at least don’t loathe, writing.</p>
<p>Our words expose us. Maybe the process of writing even shapes us over time. Even when we’re not writing something personal, our style pervades in the way we choose and arrange words. And this style certainly evolves.</p>
<p>This makes writing difficult, especially in the beginning. It forces us to fall short of our own expectations. <strong>Like the amateur chef trying again and again to emulate a great meal, we can recognize and appreciate good writing while not being able to create it.</strong> That’s frustrating. But that’s how skill development works. To improve, our taste for things must outstrip our ability to create them.</p>
<p>This imbalance between taste and ability also means you’ll encounter people who are eager to find flaws in your writing. Don’t receive negative feedback as an attack. A reader may be able to sense that something could be better, but they may not have the ability to explain it. Embrace scrutiny. Learn to convert critical feedback — and even cynical feedback — into better writing.</p>
<p>I don’t think writing is an isolated skill. Rather, I see it as a non-linear and gangly process of gathering, curating, organizing, creating, and refining ideas and information. It’s easy to overestimate (and romanticize) the role of creativity in the writing process. Creativity is often a byproduct of the other steps listed above. Reading is often the cleanest-burning fuel for this process.</p>
<h2>Writing at Work</h2>
<p>My career path compelled me to become a better writer, and I’m grateful for it. <strong>Writing well is a skill that complements nearly every professional role.</strong></p>
<p>When I cross paths with a skilled writer, I’m delighted, particularly when they can write or edit in ways I cannot. Their ability is easy to recognize. An email, or even a short conversation with no writing involved, can give them away. <strong>Good writers strive for relevance, brevity, and style, in that order.</strong></p>
<p>Writing well is not essential to becoming a leader or high earner. But if you have a white collar job, writing can almost certainly be a force multiplier. And it can be an asset as part of a company’s culture. By knowing how to parse and convey the right information, the good writer can relieve a myriad of headaches. Good writing can connect disjointed perspectives, give direction to a project, sell a service, solidify a shared purpose, document a process, and foster an evergreen knowledge-base.</p>
<p>In my unqualified opinion, good writer are also more likely to be effective generalists. Many of the best writers I’ve worked with were not writers. Several were designers, two were lawyers, one was a pharmacist, and one was a salesperson. These people often worked beyond their job titles and were called in to help untangle sensitive projects.</p>
<p><strong>You should write because it’s a way to help yourself and others.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p><img src="https://esoteric.codes/uploads/e75196b9-42f8-4808-8b8b-9157f238b570/xor.png" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p>Assembly code can appear mysterious to the uninitiated. Aspects of the physical machine abstracted away in higher-level languages are referred to directly in its terse commands.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1502958082" target="">This chapbook</a> of minimal assembly code poems (its author refers to them as "snippets") offers no solutions, context, or explanations to ease this gap, leaving the work of deciphering to the reader. For xorpd, its pseudonymous author, this is exactly the point: to immerse the reader in the machine level of code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When working inside a computer, everything is eventually made of assembly, so this is where you go if you really want to understand how things work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no extraneous word of text in the book to break that context. The title, <code>xchg rax, rax</code>, is a NOP instruction (pronounced no-op, for no operation): xchg exchanges the data of two operands, in this case of rax with itself. The author's name, xorpd, is a bitwise logical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XOR (exclusive or)</a> of packed double-precision floating-point values. <span><br></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The xor logical operation is one of my favorites. It is the foundation for most of our modern cryptography.</p>
<p>The "xorpd" instruction allows xoring 128 bits at a time. It is really the kind of instruction you want to be when you grow up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://www.xorpd.net/pages/xchg_rax/snip_00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full book can be found here</a> but is also available as a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1502958082" target="">lovely printed book</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Initially I wanted to publish the book through a publisher, but no publisher wanted to go with the "minimalistic" design. One publisher said he could publish the book if I added explanations for every code snippet, but I wasn't willing to do so.</p>
<p>Another friend recommended adding QR codes to the pages, linking to explanations, but I wasn't willing to do this either. I remember trying to decipher each of those code snippets myself, and I felt that I could not let my readers down by handing them an easy solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://esoteric.codes/uploads/e6b10eed-c3cc-4f59-afb6-580c6508c5f7/xorpd3.jpg" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p>That lack of explanation, along with the monospaced font, gives the book the feel of conceptual poetry, perhaps an early Vito Acconci piece.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My father opened one of the books and looked at it in amazement. He said something like "There is nothing inside the book, it's all strange short English words, who would want to buy something like this?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, much of the joy of the book comes from discovering the nuances of these tiny programs; many rely on assembly-specific tricks that do not really translate "up" into the virtual machines defined by higher-level programming languages.</p>
<p>Those who have trouble deciphering can view xorpd's video series <a href="https://www.xorpd.net/pages/x86_adventures.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assembly Language Adventures</a>, which teaches assembly programming beginning with the very basics, reaching a level of expertise through 29 hours of instruction. Xorpd created the book as a companion piece while working on the video, pulling his favorite assembly snippets together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of my favorites is:</p>

<div>
<pre>cmp &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;al,0x0a
sbb &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;al,0x69
das</pre>
<p>This snippet converts a nibble (4 bits) into a hex digit with only three instructions. It always takes me a few mintues to understand how it works. From what I know the <code>das</code>​ instruction doesn't work anymore on the x86_64 architecture, but it is a nice reminder of what life used to be.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>How is this accomplished in three assembly instructions? Where is the conversion happening, and how is the 0x0a value used? The author has provided a complete explanation of the code below. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The code converts a hex number (0x0 ... 0xf) into a hex character<br>('0','1','2',...'9','a',...'f').</p>
<p>How it works<br>============</p>
<p>introduction:</p>
<p>This is the relevant part of the ASCII table:</p>
<pre>0x30 0
0x31 1
0x32 2
0x33 3
0x34 4
0x35 5
0x36 6
0x37 7
0x38 8
0x39 9
0x3a :
0x3b ;
0x3c &lt;
0x3d =
0x3e &gt;
0x3f ?
0x40 @
0x41 A
0x42 B
0x43 C
0x44 D ...</pre>
<p>There is an unfortunate gap between the numeric digits and the caps English<br>letters. The code above is meant to overcome that gap.</p>
<p>We want to map a number x to its relevant ASCII number, in the following<br>fashion: If 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 9, then map x to x + 0x30 If 0xa &lt;= x &lt;= 0xf, then map<br>x to x + 0x37</p>
<p>Note that the difference is 0x7. The idea for the code comes from the fact<br>that 7 = (16 - 10) + 1 We get the (16 - 10) difference from the DAS<br>instruction, and the 1 difference from the SBB and CMP instructions.</p>
<p>Intro to binary coded arithmetic<br>-------------------------------------</p>
<p>Most of the magic of this snippet comes from the `das` instruction, so we<br>better start by exploring what it does.</p>
<p>`das` means decimal adjust (al) after subtraction. Together with the rest of<br>the binary coded decimals instructions family, it allows us to perform binary<br>coded decimals arithemtic.</p>
<p>Binary coded decimals are decimal numbers represented in base 16. For<br>example, 0x16 would mean the decimal number 16.</p>
<p>Internally, the `das` instruction observes the flag register, and alters `al`<br>to represent the correct binary coded decimal.</p>
<p>Subtraction example:</p>
<pre>mov al, 0x31
sub al, 0x08
das</pre>
<p>Will result in al = 0x23. Interpreted in the world of decimals, 31 - 8 = 23.<br>Overflow will also happen in the world of decimals (Modulo 100).</p>
<p>Overflow example:</p>
<pre>mov al, 0x15
sub al, 0x16
das</pre>
<p>Will result in al = 0x99, because 15 - 16 = -1, which equals to 99 modulo<br>100.</p>
<p>And finally, an example equivalent to the first subtraction example:</p>
<pre>mov al, 0x31
add al, 0x92
daa</pre>
<p>Which will also result in al = 0x23. This time we add instead of subtract.<br>and we use the instruction `daa`, decimal adjust after addition, instead of<br>`das`.</p>
<p>There is one more delicate point about `das` and `daa` that we will need for<br>our solution. Take a look at this example:</p>
<pre>mov al, 0x31
add al, 0x0a
daa</pre>
<p>The result is al = 0x41. This means that from the point of view of `daa`,<br>0x0a and 0x10 are the same. It also means that 0x0f behaves just like 0x15.</p>
<p>Converting to hex<br>------------------------</p>
<p>We want to use the 16 - 10 difference to our advantage, somehow bridging the <br>gap between the '9' and 'A' characters.</p>
<p>Here is a first attempt that is close to what we want to achieve:</p>
<pre>add al, 0x30
daa</pre>
<p>For every digit between '0' and '9', we will get the correct result.<br>As an example, assigning al = 0x5 will give us the result of al = 0x35, which<br>is the digit '5'. Assigning al = 0x9 will give us the result of al = 0x39.</p>
<p>What about hex digits? When we try to assign al = 0xa, we will get al = 0x40,<br>which means that we missed our target by 1. The character 'A' has the ASCII<br>code 0x41. But we did achieve something interesting here. We managed to take<br>a jump from 0x9 -&gt; 0x39 to 0xa -&gt; 0x40. Our input increased by 1, but our<br>output increased by 7!</p>
<p>We need to somehow add 1 in the case hex digits 'a' - 'f', but not in the<br>case of '0' - '9'. A classic way to achieve this is using the carry flag.<br>Here is a fixed solution:</p>
<pre>cmp al, 0xa ; Check if al is an 'a' - 'f' digit
cmc ; Complement the carry
adc al, 0x30
daa</pre>
<p>So, if we have a numeric digit ('0' - '9') in al, the first two <br>instructions will have no effect. But if our digit is in the 'a' - 'f' range,<br>we will get a carry flag equals 1, and so `adc al, 0x30` is equivalent to<br>`add al, 0x31`. Hence for example, an input of al = 0xa will give an al =<br>0x41 output, as we wanted.</p>
<p>But we could make our code shorter if we could somehow avoid using `cmc`.<br>In order to do this, we could turn to the dual side, knowing that given<br>wraparound, subtraction is equivalent to addition. In other words, <br>`add al, 0x30 // daa` is equivalent to `sub al, 0x70 // das`.</p>
<p>Combining this with the carry flag trick, we finally get:</p>
<pre>cmp al, 0xa
sbb al, 0x69
das</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This gives an idea of how much is packed into these short programs, but don't count on explanations for the other pieces. While the code may have seemed daunting early on, it has been intriguing enough for the book to build an audience slowly over the years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When "xchg rax, rax" was released in 2014, there was no real interest in the book. I hate marketing work, so I never really did anything to attempt to market the book. It is only recently, 6 years later, that people started paying attention.</p>

February 10, 2021 | https://daveeargle.com/2020/09/11/kobayashi-maru-proctorio-version/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://daveeargle.com/2020/09/11/kobayashi-maru-proctorio-version/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>I use a variation of Conti and Caroland (2011)’s “memorize the first 100 digits of pi”
assignment as an in-class learning activity to teach my infosec students how to
cheat, as part of teaching threat modeling. This semester at the beginning was
all-remote for me, though, so I modified it for the zoom teaching session. Instead
of having all students write down the first 100 digits of pi and then submit
their papers to me, I instead told students the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your assignment is to memorize the first 100 digits of pi having been intentionally given so little time to do so that your only chance of
completing the assignment is to cheat. I authorize you to cheat on this assignment and only this assignment, but if I catch you cheating,
you lose.</p>

  <p>It will go something like this (subject to change): at the start of the next class, I will randomly sort the class roster, and then I will
go down the list and call on people one at a time to recite to me the first 100 digits of pi. I may ask you to share your screen, and also
to pan your camera about the room (be prepared!), simulating what proctor-monitoring software would do. The grading is pass/fail.
If we run out of time before you are called on, you pass by default.</p>

  <p>Again, I expect you to cheat. How you choose to cheat is entirely up to you. Collaborative cheating is also encouraged, but everyone
involved will lose the game if caught. At the completion, I will give you opportunities to share-and-tell your cheating techniques with
the class.</p>

  <p>The objective of the exercise is to learn how an adversary thinks and operates by deliberately loosening traditional rules and tapping
personal creativity. It is an exercise in threat modeling.</p>

  <p>I am only permitting you to cheat on this single quiz. You may not cheat on any other assignments for this class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was really fun. Nearly all pressure was off because I changed the language to
say that they would “lose” instead of “fail” if they got caught. In practice,
everyone who made a legitimate good-faith effort “passed.” If they made a legitimate
attempt. When we did it, I invited all other students
to help me try to catch the presenter cheating. They would submit suspicions via
zoom chat. I would interrupt the recitation if I suspected cheating, and sometimes
I asked them to do random challenges such as turn around and continue reciting the numbers,
or re-pan their camera to a certain position in the room. After I announced a pass or
lose, I asked each student to explain their technique, and we discussed. This
interstitial kept engagement high, I think.</p>

<p>Some students still passed. One had taped the numbers in three different places around
the room, anticipating that I might ask her to turn around. Another had taped
the numbers to the back of his laptop, <em>printed in reverse</em>, and had mirrors set
up in several places around the room. One student had an extra pair of earbuds on
under his over-the-ear phones, and had a button on his phone that would play a
recording of the numbers to him. Another student pre-recorded a video of himself
reciting the numbers, which obviously didn’t work well at all with interruptions,
but was still fun.</p>

<p>Pandemic be darned, still gonna have fun and teach things that will get me in trouble!</p>

      <p>I'm seeing a lot of disappointment about the speed of Ruby 3 out there. I think there are a lot of reasons for that, and I think they're worth looking at.</p>

<p>So: why wasn't Ruby 3 faster? Did it break its promise? (Spoiler: <a href="http://codefol.io/posts/is-ruby-3-actually-three-times-faster/">I don't think so</a>, but I understand why some people do.)</p>

<!--more-->

<h2>First: Faster Than What?</h2>

<p>I think some of the problem was misplaced expectations. People didn't understand what <a href="https://blog.heroku.com/ruby-3-by-3">"three times faster"</a> was supposed to mean. I don't think people thought it through, but I also don't think it was communicated very clearly.</p>

<p>So: some people understood what was promised, and some people didn't.</p>

<p>What was promised?</p>

<p>Matz, Ruby's creator and designer, has said many times "Ruby 3 will be three times faster compared to Ruby 2." When he was talking to Ruby implementors, that was clarified as "compared to Ruby 2.0.0 on the day it was released." But it would be easy for a random person to think that meant "compared to Ruby 2 right now." By the time Matz declared that goal there were already a few minor releases of Ruby 2 out there, which increased the speed. And by the time most people had heard about it, Ruby 2.4 was already released.</p>

<p>Ruby 2.4 is already a lot faster than Ruby 2.0. Most of the speed gain from Ruby 2.0 to 3.0 was already there by Ruby 2.4. Which means if you thought Ruby 3 was going to be three times faster than Ruby 2.4, you were pretty darn disappointed. Ruby 3 is maybe 15%-25% faster than Ruby 2.4? But clearly not even 1.5x the speed, except for certain very specific cases with JIT.</p>

<p>If you thought Ruby 3 was going to be three times faster than Ruby 2.4, you were probably very disappointed indeed.</p>

<h2>Aspirational Goals</h2>

<p>Early on, when he was first declaring Ruby 3, Matz described it as an aspirational goal. It was intentionally a stretch. I'm pretty happy with how it came out, but... There's a problem with loud, public stretch goals. They can annoy people who otherwise like you, and for good reason.</p>

<p>I feel like I can <a href="http://codefol.io/posts/is-ruby-3-actually-three-times-faster/">argue with a straight face</a> that Ruby succeeded in that goal, within limits and with footnotes.</p>

<p>But let's be clear: nobody thought that literally every program written with Ruby would be three times faster. In fact, that's completely impossible. Let's talk about why.</p>

<h2>Making Ruby Faster Can Only Make Ruby Faster</h2>

<p>Making <strong><em>anything</em></strong> "X times faster" or "Y percent faster" is at best an oversimplification. That's just not how software works. For an extreme case, think about a script that just sleeps for ten seconds. It's kind of the canonical example where you literally <strong><em>cannot</em></strong> make it faster. At least, not without breaking it.</p>

<p>When we say "make Ruby three times faster" we have to have a long list of caveats in mind, even if we don't say them. A script that queries the database can only get so much faster because it's waiting on the database. Ruby programs that use C extensions have to wait on the C extensions — speeding up Ruby won't, generally speaking, speed up those C extensions.</p>

<p>You can't turn Ruby into magic fairy dust where having your Java program call out to a short Ruby script speeds up your Java by 10%. Ruby can only speed up the part that's calculated in Ruby.</p>

<p>That's hard. </p>

<p>There's an old <a href="https://rubykaigi.org/2016/presentations/MattStudies.html">Matt Gaudet talk from RubyKaigi</a> where he talks about how we should measure 3x. We didn't wind up with that full array of benchmarks, but all his ideas are basically good for measuring. And if we had built all of them, we'd discover that they didn't all speed up by the same amount.</p>

<p>How could they? "Three times faster" is, by its nature, a bit of an abstraction and kind of inexact. What workload <strong><em>exactly</em></strong> is going to be three times faster?</p>

<h2>Incremental Changes, Disruptive Changes</h2>

<pre>    “How did you go bankrupt?” Bill asked. “Two ways,” Mike said. “Gradually and then suddenly.”
    - Ernest Hemingway, The Sun Also Rises
</pre>

<p>Here's a thing: a lot of speedups are incremental. They take some common operation and they make it a little bit faster. It's often a tradeoff: one or more uncommon operations gets a little bit slower. By figuring out new tradeoffs or by carefully measuring which operations are common, you can slightly fine-tune and get a better result.</p>

<p>Ruby has done a lot of this. The core Ruby VM has mostly worked the same way since Ruby 1.9, with a lot of great polish and fine-tuning.</p>

<p>Here's a different thing: many speedups are disruptive instead of incremental. Ruby 1.9 rewrote the VM completely, but took several versions to get stable enough to use. There's a reason almost nobody deployed their production app on Ruby 1.9.1. Ruby 1.9 also made threading work better — and Ruby on Rails took ages to get to where that really worked for most people. We needed new app servers to take advantage of it. And most existing Rails apps needed to find out where they were doing thread-incompatible things and fix that.</p>

<p>Disruptive changes tend to be bigger speedups. But they also require a lot more work.</p>

<p>If you don't change any of your code from Ruby 1.9.3, it will still run on Ruby 3. In fact, it will run significantly better than on Ruby 1.9.3. It's faster, it crashes less often, it will catch more of your bugs. Those incremental changes will give you a significant speedup — say to around double the speed of 1.9.3 on the same hardware. That's not bad.</p>

<p>But you can do better than that. We have <a href="https://github.com/socketry/async">much better evented libraries</a> in Ruby than existed in 1.9.3. We have <a href="https://github.com/puma/puma">faster application servers</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/bootsnap">faster Rails boot time</a> and <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html">better Rails security</a>. All of these require some amount of changing your code or your process around your application. They are <strong><em>disruptive</em></strong> changes, either a little bit disruptive (upgrade to Rails 6 from Rails 3) or very disruptive (switch to Async from non-evented code.)</p>

<p>Ruby 3 has several interesting <strong><em>disruptive</em></strong> changes that will only help you if you use them. And using them may take some work.</p>

<h2>Ruby 3's Disruptive Changes</h2>

<p>One disruptive change is MJIT. You have to turn it on using the command line or an environment variable. It favours short methods and shallow call stacks. It works far better with plain Ruby code than with C extensions.</p>

<p>All of these are changes in the code or the configuration.</p>

<p>Over time I think you'll see more gems adapt to MJIT. There will be cases where the authors say, "if you want maximum performance, use the no-C-extensions version of the gem and turn on MJIT or use JRuby/TruffleRuby." JRuby and TruffleRuby already have JIT, you see, and so they have the same surprising property that Ruby code starts performing better <strong><em>without</em></strong> C extensions.</p>

<p>But we don't live in that world yet. Right now it's easier to skip using JIT and ignore it. And then you don't get the benefit of it, partly because you're waiting on other people.</p>

<p>And so MJIT is a change to speed up Ruby, but the benefits aren't here yet. They need time and work before they arrive. Ruby's MJIT was written incredibly quickly, and the stability was shockingly good. The flip side is that there are a lot of useful optimisations that got lost in the shuffle, and a lot of code that hasn't yet been rewritten to use it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fastruby.io/blog/ruby/performance/how-fast-are-ractors.html">Ractors</a> are the same. Eventually they'll make highly-parallel Ruby code run a lot faster. But you're going to need to learn them deeply, or wait for gem and framework authors to do it for you. Frankly they're also going to need more work in Ruby core before they're fast enough.</p>

<p><a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13618">Autofibers</a>? Yup, same thing. I think those may be the most extreme case of needing big supporting changes, so we'll see if it happens. But they also have a <strong><em>lot</em></strong> of potential to improve Ruby concurrency, especially when combined with Ractors. They'll also require a significant rewrite of a lot of your concurrency code to work well.</p>

<p>I think we'll also see type-based optimisations in at least some of Ruby. Now that we're tracking places where, say, we know an integer will always be used, it becomes easier to do a few TruffleRuby-style optimisations to hardcode integer operations. But that's going to take even longer.</p>

<h2>Did It Basically Fail, Then?</h2>

<p>I think we'll see the public perception that it failed.</p>

<p>More specifically: I can argue, <a href="http://codefol.io/posts/is-ruby-3-actually-three-times-faster/">and I have argued</a>, that Ruby 3 succeeded at being three times faster than Ruby 2.0.</p>

<p>But people were thinking the promise meant "three times faster than Ruby 2.4" and that's a significantly higher bar, one that Ruby 3 <strong><em>does not</em></strong> clear. It was never actually promised, but it's clearly a common public perception.</p>

<p>Most people want to know "will it run my code three times faster?" They not only mean "three times faster than what I'm using now," they also mean with no code changes. And so for most people asking that question, the disruptive changes are probably not useful or relevant.</p>

<p>Ruby 2.0.0 was about eight years ago. With the older and newer disruptive changes, it's actually not hard for the Ruby app you run now to run three times faster than what you were running eight years ago. Puma is <strong><em>good</em></strong>. Bootsnap made bootup much faster. Ruby itself, of course, is significantly better. But a lot of these changes are going to be seen as "not really Ruby changes." Disruptive improvements are like that.</p>

<p>And the most recent disruptive changes are going to take years to bear fruit. Indeed, some of them never will — Autofibers and Ractors, for instance, both have a significant chance of failing, long-term. There may never be any significant type-aware optimisations (or there may be.) I think at least one of those features will do well, and I'm certain at least one of them will basically fail. I just don't know which is which.</p>

<h2>But Did It Fail?</h2>

<p>I don't think it failed. As an aspirational goal, it was a challenge, a bar to try to reach. And I think Ruby <strong><em>did</em></strong> reach that bar. Ruby 3.0 is a lot faster than Ruby 2.0, with both incremental tuning and interesting new disruptive changes. "Three times faster" is hard to define, but <a href="http://codefol.io/posts/is-ruby-3-actually-three-times-faster/">I think it's fair to say it did it</a>.</p>

<p>I think that on its own terms, it succeeded.</p>

<p>I also think that speed isn't a major factor slowing down Ruby adoption. Most people who use …</p></section></div>

<p>Amid Apple pushing mandatory privacy labels, Google is stalling on releasing updates for its iOS apps. Yet Google itself is now telling users that their own apps are out of date.</p>

<p><em>I verified that this warning is showing up for multiple apps (Gmail, Google Photos, and Google Maps). Multiple iPhones on iOS 14.4, owned by separate account holders, were tested. </em></p>



<p>About an hour ago, I opened my Gmail app to find that some of my accounts had been logged out. When I tried logging back in, Google informed me that “This app is out of date.” <em>Indeed! </em></p>



<p>Google has not pushed updates to their flagship apps including Gmail and Google Maps since before a Dec. 8 deadline, imposed by Apple, that mandated all app updates include new privacy labels. The “nutrition labels” describe<strong> </strong>to users all the ways developers collect data about them, which has been awkward for companies like Facebook, whose business model relies on the company knowing as much about its users as possible. Tweets have <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1339174301564604418">gone viral</a> for simply scrolling through the long privacy label section for apps like Facebook. It must be noted that in the past 6 weeks, Facebook’s rivals (especially <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/210112/p32#a210112p32">Signal and Telegram</a>) have had success thanks to users’ privacy concerns, at an unprecedented scale.  Other companies hoping to avoid such shame have allegedly <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/210129/p6#a210129p6">misled users about their collection practices</a>.  </p>



<p>Alphabet/Google has taken a third approach, which is to indefinitely stall on pushing updates to its iOS apps. But the company itself tried to downplay this popular theory. On Jan. 5, it claimed it would add Apple’s privacy labels to its apps <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/210127/p22#a210127p22">“this week or the next week”</a>.  As Macrumors noted, some of its apps like YouTube <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/10/gmail-ios-out-of-date-warning/">have quietly received updates,</a> but not Chrome, Maps, Photos, Drive, Calendar, or Gmail, which is <a href="https://twitter.com/Thomasbcn/status/1356645088697454596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">unusual</a>. While Google stalls on pushing updates to its apps, it’s notable that its rivals like Apple Maps, are continuing to innovate <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=google+maps+ios+update&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=nws&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwis0eqlueDuAhUGna0KHTSVDJsQ_AUoAXoECBUQAw&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=796&amp;dpr=2">with new features in their apps</a>. Google has also been facing rivals that, like Facebook’s rivals, have been having unprecedented levels of success over privacy issues, namely DuckDuckGo, <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/210117/p1#a210117p1">which surpassed 100M daily search queries for the first time on Jan. 11</a>. Privacy is “in” these days.</p>



<p>After saying “This app is out of date”, its warning goes on to say “You should update this app.” <em>We can’t.</em> “The version you’re using doesn’t include the latest security features to keep you protected. Only continue if you understand the risks.” <em>Let’s hope that’s not true! </em>If you visit the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gmail-email-by-google/id422689480">Gmail app’s page</a> directly, you will see its last update was released on Dec. 1. </p>



<p>Presumably, the warning is triggered by an automatic check of how long it has been since the app was last updated. In this case, it’s been over 2 months. But only Google can resolve that situation. Here’s a video of Google’s warning being triggered:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Google itself is now telling users their apps are out of date, despite no updates being available" width="663" height="373" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2rt4ftLVVDQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Looking at the bigger picture: If Google really decided to intentionally delay updating its apps over adding privacy labels, it’s honestly hard to believe that such short-term thinking prevails in its leadership. They inevitably put themselves in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand-effect</a> situation, where in the end they’d attract more attention to themselves. Whereas if they had published early, the media’s attention would have been split across all of Big Tech’s apps. While the alleged decision itself was always doomed to end poorly, this “app out of date” interstitial is just an epic self own. I guess the decision to delay apps was not handled well internally, because such choices are probably uncommon and the processes to carry them out aren’t as battle-tested or familiar. John Gruber <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/10/dailey-google-ios-apps">posited</a> that perhaps Google is attempting to “wait Apple out — that public pressure from iPhone owners who use Google apps will result in Apple conceding to better terms for what Google needs to admit to in its nutrition labels. I don’t see that working.” I don’t either.</p>



<p>There is also a chance that Google is trying to do a cleanup of their back end — removing some data collection from ads systems — before publishing privacy labels.  I really like (and want to believe) this angle, however unlikely, because it would show that Apple’s privacy labels are having a powerful pro-consumer effect on major app developers. </p>



<p>On the matter of <em>if </em>Google is really delaying its apps over concerns about privacy labels: they really <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/google-to-add-app-store-privacy-labels-to-its-ios-apps-as-soon-as-this-week/">want us to believe that’s not the reason</a>, telling Techcrunch that the labels would start rolling out last month. Yet, that did not happen with the lion’s share of its apps. Take a minute to check out this stunning visualization, which illustrates the frequency of its apps’ updates before and after the December 8 privacy label deadline (h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/Thomasbcn/status/1356645088697454596/photo/1">@thomasbcn</a>):</p>

<p>From this blunt visual, one can not only assume that the lack of updates are related to the privacy label deadline, but that most of its apps are in need of bug fixes and aren’t receiving those updates.</p>



<p>I guess we’ll wait and see what happens… </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
	            <p>This is a follow-up to <a href="https://github.com/stefwalter/blog/pull/1">the open-source-as-a-service blog
post</a> of a friend and a colleague of
mine, <a href="https://github.com/stefwalter">Stef Walter</a>.</p>

<p>TL;DR of Stef’s article is that open source services are hard to contribute to.
Any first-time contributor is probably having hard times to try changes locally
in the same way the service is deployed in production.</p>

<p>Imagine that you’d be able to contribute to GitHub and try your change in some
playground moments later you opened your PR. Freakin’ awesome, right?! I
strongly advise you to read Stef’s blog post to understand this concept further.</p>

<p>In this article I’d like to discuss the practical side of this - how can one
actually achieve such glorious service contribution model?</p>



<p>Please don’t expect to get an end-to-end guide here - that would take a book to
write, instead I intend to give you a few advices how to proceed.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-even-start">How do I even start?</h2>

<p>The beginning of your journey should be to set goals: clearly define your
milestones (ideally with acceptance criteria) and start working towards that
goal.</p>

<p>Stef already wrote <a href="https://github.com/stefwalter/stefwalter.github.io/blob/main/playbook.md">a list of well-defined
stages</a>
which you can embrace on your journey. It means that our end-goal then is:</p>

<pre><code>All changes proposed against project's repositories are deployed to a
playground where contributors can try them out.
</code></pre>

<p>One note here is that certain milestones can have requirements: you may state
that a certain container engine needs to be available to achieve a milestone.</p>

<h2 id="asking-again-how-do-i-start">Asking again: how do I start?</h2>

<p>10 stages, sounds pretty intimidating. The technology that helped us to move up
the ladder was <a href="https://openshift.com/">containers and OpenShift</a>. That’s what
the stage 3 is about - be able to build container images of your service no
matter the developer’s OS and deploy them into k8s or OpenShift.</p>



<p>Containers and OpenShift are clear at this point and that should narrow our
scope.</p>

<p>The next main tool which will help you is… Automation!</p>

<p>If you need to do manual steps to achieve parts of the development workflow,
it’s just a burden which is holding you back to progress further. The
automation doesn’t need to be perfect - in fact, it will never be, just make
sure it’s implemented, you can always improve it with spending further
development cycles on it once you are aware of the main drawbacks.</p>

<p>Actual tooling? Whatever fits you and your team: e.g. we are using
<a href="https://ansible.com/">Ansible</a> to achieve most of the automation paired with
<a href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/nodes/jobs/nodes-nodes-jobs.html">OpenShift
Jobs</a>
and expanding into <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub
actions</a>.</p>

<p>Some (Red Hat) teams are using <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/">Argo CD</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/tektoncd">Tekton</a> and <a href="https://kustomize.io/">Kustomize</a>.
Make sure to do your research and pick tooling which is best for your use
cases.</p>

<p>The principle remains the same though: use continuous integration to verify the
change passes automated tests and continuous delivery for users and developers
to try the change before (or after) it’s merged with as little disruption in
production as possible.</p>

<h2 id="last-words">Last words</h2>

<p>This is really hard. We already did <a href="https://github.com/packit/research/tree/main/deploy-packit-pr">an
analysis</a> how to
achieve this contribution model for our project, <a href="https://packit.dev/">packit</a>,
and the task list is pretty long. On the other hand, the payoff is
mind-blowing: anyone can open a PR against a repo in our project and be able
to play with it once it’s deployed - without even knowing how to deploy our
service. I would use it all the time when working on our project.</p>

<p>Happy hacking and best of luck!</p>

February 10, 2021 | http://stef.thewalter.net/open-source-services.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://stef.thewalter.net/open-source-services.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Open Sourcing the code to your SaaS is insufficient to make it
actually be Open Source. Sounds&nbsp;self-contradictory?</p>
<p>Most services that espouse “Open Source”, do so by simply
<a href="https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci">throwing the code over the wall</a>.
It’s better than nothing, but really misses the point that powers
Open Source: enabling users to make a change to the software
they’re&nbsp;using.</p>
<p>Some other popular services powered by Open Source software, such as
<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/community/contribute/development/">GitLab.com</a>
or <a href="https://www.elastic.co/about/free-and-open">ElasticSearch</a> do include
the tools used to operate/deploy their service. Pause for&nbsp;applause</p>
<p>👏👏👏</p>
<p>But that’s also insufficient to actually enable users to become
contributors&nbsp;effectively.</p>
<p>Much of the value of a service comes from things other than the code.
It comes from the infrastructure it runs on, the operational processes,
the monitoring, the backups, the metrics, the high availability, the
scalability. It comes from data, from the network effect, with other users,
with other interconnected services, with integrated tools, from legal
agreements, and so&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>Any non-toy Service is not&nbsp;reproducible.</p>
<p>Launching a clone of the service in order to effectively contribute
is a high barrier. Certain kinds of contributions clearly are possible.
But contributors are essentially asked to “fork” the above non-code
aspects of the service in order to iterate on their changes against
their real world use&nbsp;cases.</p>
<p>What’s more, without true Open Source principles, we are missing a
way to have a community develop with a center of gravity around
the service itself. This leads to companies
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/stepping-up-for-a-truly-open-source-elasticsearch">forking the service</a>
in a way that typical open source projects with a true community
are resilient&nbsp;to.</p>
<p>I believe that if we enable contributions to services, <em>rather than just
the software</em>, we reap the advantages of true Open Source. That means
enabling users to make a change to a running service and experience
that change&nbsp;themselves.</p>
<p>You still with&nbsp;me?</p>
<p>Yes, that means opening a pull request against a running service
and experiencing that change before it’s&nbsp;merged.</p>
<p>This is not as insane as it&nbsp;sounds.</p>
<p>It appears that every technique we need to enable such a capability
is already in use in modern deployment and operations methodology.
We just have to connect the&nbsp;dots.</p>

<p>I’ve been a part of Open Source for over 20 years now. Although I’m
just one contributor, together we’ve changed something fundamental
about the world. Our lives are too short, and software too complex,
to have one company or one individual invent everything from scratch.
So we work together across humanity to accomplish what no
individual team could. This is our legacy, and it has become
common&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>And yet there’s a very simple principle that drives Open&nbsp;Source:</p>
<p>
Open Source thrives when it converts some<br>small percentage of users into contributors.
</p>

<p>If you interrupt that principle, you starve Open Source. Software as a
Service does just that: When someone else runs software for you, the
intuitive mechanisms for users to change that software are&nbsp;unavailable.</p>
<p><img alt="How users become contributors" src="http://stef.thewalter.net/images/funneling-open-source-service.png"></p>
<p><span>“</span>But” you may say, “If the source code for that running service was <strong>open</strong>
then I could still change&nbsp;it.”</p>
<p>Sure you could change the code in some component, but for any reasonably
complex Service you wouldn’t be able to run your changes, experience your
changes against real world workflows, much less iterate on them until
they’re good enough to share with&nbsp;others.</p>
<p>In reality the threat here is far more fundamental: Users of services
cannot readily change something in the service not only because the
processes are operated by someone else … but because such users of
a service have explicitly chosen not to be involved in operating
the&nbsp;software.</p>
<p>If the primary way to use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Postgres was “as a Service”</a>,
then that (fabulous) project would be starved for contributors. This is
because the number of contributors in a such a project are a function
of some small percentage of users deciding to try to make&nbsp;change.</p>
<p>As this mechanism for using software, as a service, takes over the world
the pool of users who can contribute to Open Source shrinks&nbsp;dramatically.</p>
<p>For a long time I saw this as a fundamental threat that would starve
Open Source. I was unable reconcile Software as a Service with a healthy
Open Source&nbsp;ecosystem.</p>
<p>But recently, I’ve become convinced that if we enable an effective
contribution model on a service, one that doesn’t require that the users
themselves become operators of the service … then we can reconcile this
threat and Open Source will thrive on services instead of be starved by&nbsp;them.</p>

<p>To enable contributions by users of a service, users that have explicitly
chosen not to operate the software themselves, we have to set up a process
by which they can make a change to a running service and experience that
change themselves before others&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>For example, a user of such a hypothetical service should be able&nbsp;to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Discover which component of a service to contribute&nbsp;to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a non-sensical change (like add a printf style log statement) or change the spelling of a&nbsp;word.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience that change when they use the service, or when it acts on their&nbsp;data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After discussing this with others, I firmly believe we have all the techniques we need,
whether canary deployments, load balancing, continuous delivery,
infrastructure as code, and so on. It’s been hard to find a single
problem that an existing practice doesn’t&nbsp;solve.</p>
<p>It turns out many experienced engineering teams have come to that same
conclusion. Rapid deployment of changes to services is a powerful
capability highly sought after. For example,
<a href="https://github.blog/2015-06-02-deploying-branches-to-github-com/">GitHub deploys changes before they’re merged</a>.
Whereas
<a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2017/08/31/web/rapid-release-at-massive-scale/">Facebook rapidly deploys changes</a>
to a few canary machines and scales each change up to production.
Everyone has their own version of continuous delivery. It’s hard to
take an engineering team seriously if they haven’t figured out how
their team members can get a change rapidly&nbsp;deployed.</p>
<p>As Open Source, we have all the ingredients to have a decisive
advantage here. To effectively collaborate on  <strong>Open Source Services</strong>,
contributors across&nbsp;humanity.</p>
<p>Lets try to craft a playbook to achieve this basic capability
that drives Open Source Software and apply it to Open Source Services:
The ability to change code and interact with that change … on a&nbsp;service.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Today, I looked up how many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS">floating point operations per second</a> (FLOPS) that an iPhone can do. It turns out the A14 chip in the iPhone <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2020/10/15/apple-claims-the-iphone-12s-a14-bionic-challenges-laptops-but-gives-no-details/">can do about 11 TFlOPS according to Apple</a>. Let's give Apple the benefits of the doubt and not get too deep into how they got that number, and put it to perspective and compare the iPhone with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_supercomputing">Top 500 Supercomputers</a> in the world over the years:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/iphone-vs-supercomputers.png" alt="iPhone vs Supercomputers"></p>
<p>The green line is how much computing power that little phone I'm holding in my hands has. If released in 2009, it would have made it to the list of top 500 supercomputers in the world! It has more computing power than the most powerful computer in the world in 2002. It has the combined computing power of the 1997's top 500 supercomputers in the whole world.</p>
<p>People talked about how the computer on Appolo was so slow. I get it, but I can hardly relate to that. I wasn't born then. However, 2009 was just 12 years ago. I could still remember it vividly. I was a freshman student then.</p>
<p>Reflecting on that, I figured:</p>
<ul>
<li>Something with the form factor and power envelope of the phone alone is already exceedingly powerful. It could potentially do things that humankind couldn't achieve just ten years ago.</li>
<li>On the other hand, I don't need to have the most whizz-bang computer or phone to make programs that do amazing things. Writing programs for older hardware can be a pleasure. Supporting older hardware makes programs I create more accessible to a larger part of the human population.</li>
<li>As a programmer, when I complain about the phone or any computer I have is not powerful enough for whatever I want to do, it's much more likely it's me doing something wrong.</li>
<li>The world changes faster than my mind conceives. I need to be humble about what I know. Things I know to be fast becomes slow sooner than I expect. In the same realm, maybe ideas that I know to be good become bad sooner than I expect. Those ideas are not necessarily limited to technology: Maybe ideas in science, humanities, and society also envolve that way. It is just harder to put into numbers like TFLOPS.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have the most power computer in our pocket. Doing something amazing with that power should constantly be a question on our mind. All that power just to push one more ads is a fucking stupid and disgusting idea.</p>

<p>Cognitive biases are wonderful, awful things. I've spent years referencing various resources with lists of biases, whilst going through information collected in <a href="https://hirund.in/tools/research">ethnographic research</a>. Wikipedia has a good list, but it's not the easiest thing to go use. There's a few other tools out there which do similar things, but none geared up specifically for researchers which have entirely worked for my needs. So at the risk of creating the <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">15th competing standard</a>, I thought I'd take some time, go through all the ones I like, and assemble something which worked for me.</p>
<p>Hopefully you'll find it useful too!</p>

<p>You have to walk before you can run! Start your journey here in <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/rust/syntax">part 1</a>, where we'll learn the basics of Rust's syntax.</p>

<p>One of the things that distinguishes Rust from Haskell is the way it handles memory. Rust is meant to be more performant than Haskell, so it forces us to think more about memory while we're programming. In <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/rust/memory">part 2</a> of the series, we'll see what this looks like.</p>

<p>Data types are one area where Rust borrows some great ideas from Haskell! Take a look at <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/rust/data">part 3</a> to learn more!</p>

<p>Like any good language, Rust comes with a development toolchain for package management and dependency handling. Cargo is very much Rust's equivalent to Stack. And in <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/rust/cargo">part 4</a>, we'll see how to use it.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/rust/lifetimes">fifth and final part</a> of this series, we'll explore a couple more topics that will round out your Rust eduction. We'll first see how to use collection types in Rust. Then we'll see some of the implications of Rust's memory model on these types. This will lead us to an exploration of the concept of lifetimes.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it helps to see things in action, rather than just reading about them! In our <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/rust-video-tutorial">Rust video tutorial</a>, we'll go through all the concepts from this series from scratch, starting with installation! You'll get to see specific examples, and what a general development flow looks like.</p>

Their job title might be data engineer, <a href="https://blog.getdbt.com/what-is-an-analytics-engineer/" target="_blank">analytics engineer</a>, data analyst, data scientist, or not include the word "data" at all. When in doubt, just ask if SQL column names should have periods in them. If you get a strong response, you're probably talking to a data person.</p></div></div></div><div><div><h4 id="quality-problems">Quality problems</h4><p>The problems that data observability tools solve are simple to state:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Time</strong>: Debugging in the dark costs time and peace of mind.</li><li><strong>Trust</strong>: Trust in data, as in all things, is easy to lose and hard to regain.</li><li><strong>Cost</strong>: The cost of bad data is the cost of bad decisions.</li></ul><p>But before getting into how today’s ecosystem addresses these problems, it’s worth exploring how we got here.</p><h4 id="the-big-bang">The Big Bang</h4><p>Market hype can make it seem like databases did not exist before Snowflake, Redshift, and BigQuery. But companies ran for decades (and continue to run) on mainframes from the 1960s, then on the main combatants in the 1990s database wars: Oracle databases, IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server. In this ecosystem, data teams used all-in-one or vendor-specific database integration tools to manage data quality:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://www.informatica.com/products/data-quality/informatica-data-quality.html" target="_blank">Informatica Data Quality</a> - Informatica provides a suite of tools for Doing All The Things with databases, one of which is a Data Quality solution that provides "end-to-end support for growing data quality needs across users and data types with AI-driven automation."</li><li><a href="https://www.talend.com/products/data-quality/" target="_blank">Talend Data Quality</a> - Like Informatica, Talend provides a Data Quality tool to "profile, clean, and standardize data across your systems."</li><li><a href="https://www.oracle.com/middleware/technologies/enterprise-data-quality.html" target="_blank">Oracle Data Quality</a> "provides a comprehensive data quality management environment, used to understand, improve, protect and govern data quality."</li><li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/data-quality-services/data-quality-services?view=sql-server-ver15" target="_blank">Microsoft SQL Server Data Quality Services</a> "enables you to build a knowledge base and use it to perform a variety of critical data quality tasks, including correction, enrichment, standardization, and de-duplication of your data."</li><li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/infosphere-info-server-for-datamgmt" target="_blank">IBM InfoSphere Information Server for Data Quality</a> "enables you to cleanse data and monitor data quality on an ongoing basis, helping to turn your data into trusted information."</li></ul><p>Until the arrival of cloud databases like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2009/10/27/introducing-amazon-relational-database-service/" target="_blank">RDS</a> in 2009 and data warehouses like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2012/11/28/announcing-amazon-redshift/" target="_blank">Redshift</a> in 2012, “data” work within companies was typically done by IT teams using on-premise enterprise software. Transformation was either performed before arrival in the database, or by a downstream business intelligence (BI) application.</p><div><div><p><strong>All warehouses are databases, but not all databases are warehouses. </strong>Unlike transactional databases optimized for reading and writing entries quickly and reliably, warehouses are ideal for running the queries you encounter analyzing data, like getting the average revenue of a customer segment.</p><p>The big three warehouses are Snowflake, Redshift, and BigQuery. Data lakes and data lake houses warrant an article of their own.</p></div></div><h4 id="are-spreadsheets-cool-again">Interlude: Are Spreadsheets Cool Again?</h4><p>Like the color black, spreadsheets will always be in, whether or not they’re the hot new item. In the early 2010s when the “big data” buzzword was taking off, many analysts who bugged their database admins for extracts were confronted with the realization that their data was not clean. Enter the universal API: tabular data.</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://trifacta.com/" target="_blank">Trifacta</a> - Founded in 2012 based on <a href="http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/1005/1/wranglerPaper.pdf" target="_blank">Stanford research</a>, Trifacta is a tool for interactively transforming data that helps you by automatically inferring relevant transformations.

As data warehouses emerged at the top of the food chain, an ecosystem of tools co-evolved alongside them, including easy ways to extract and load data from sources into a warehouse, transform that data, then make it available for consumption by end users.</p><div><div><p>The <a href="https://fivetran.com/blog/modern-data-stack-overview" target="_blank">Modern data stack</a> is a cutting-edge setup for centralizing and using data within a company. Tools move data from sources like Salesforce into data warehouses like Snowflake that make it very cheap to store gobs of data and easy to analyze it quickly. As a result, data teams have the leverage to do more with less.</p><p>The TLDR? Because data storage is dirt cheap, let’s put it all into one place and transform it later.</p></div></div><p>With the adoption of the modern data stack, more and more data is centralized in one place, then being used for critical applications like powering operational analytics, training machine learning models, and powering in-product experiences. And, importantly, we can keep changing the data even after it’s in the warehouse, lending flexibility to data that was once rigid.</p><p>Increasing amounts of data. Increasing importance of data. Increasing fragmentation of vendors. These trends, coupled with investor appetite to fund the next Snowflake, makes it no surprise that we’re witnessing what CEO of Fishtown Analytics calls a <a href="https://blog.getdbt.com/future-of-the-modern-data-stack/" target="_blank">Cambrian explosion</a> of new tools supporting data quality.</p><p>Some of these tools are open source:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/tests/" target="_blank">dbt tests</a> (<a href="https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt" target="_blank">Github</a>) - dbt is a tool for transforming data within warehouses. Described as the "T in ELT", dbt lets you write composable SQL that can be executed in sequence (specifically a DAG). A fan-favorite feature of dbt is the ability to specify tests like ensuring that a column is <span>unique</span> or that every value in one column refers to a value in another (referential integrity). &nbsp;Created by Fishtown Analytics, dbt has seen massive growth in the past year, and we highly recommend checking it out. It just makes sense.</li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/test-data-quality-at-scale-with-deequ/" target="_blank">deequ</a> (<a href="https://github.com/awslabs/deequ" target="_blank">Github</a>) - Created by AWS labs, deequ is a library that lets you define "unit tests for data" that are translated into Spark jobs. The main components are <span>Profilers</span> and <span>Analyzers</span> that compute metrics like <span>Completeness</span> and <span>Uniqueness</span> of a column. These metrics are then verified against constraints, the results of which are stored in a Deequ repository. Deequ is written in Scala, though there is a <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/python-deequ" target="_blank">Python wrapper</a> as well.</li><li><a href="http://greatexpectations.io/" target="_blank">Great Expectations</a> (<a href="https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations" target="_blank">Github</a>) - GE is an open-source Python package for validating data in a declarative and extensible way.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>After having it on my to-do list for several years, I finally got around to trying out a <a href="https://staticsitegenerators.net/">static site generator</a> (SSG). In particular, <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. I decided to take Hugo for a spin, by rebuilding one of my golden oldies, <a href="https://worldtrip.greenash.net.au/">Jaza's World Trip</a>, with it. And, for bonus points, I <a href="https://github.com/Jaza/worldtrip">published the source code</a> on GitHub, and I deployed the site on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. Hugo is <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo">great software</a> with a <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/">great community</a>, however it didn't quite live up to my expectations.
</p>
<p><img src="https://greenash.net.au/media/cache/12/40/124097ee0b5f0c78d99619f81b301f92.jpg" width="720" height="254" alt="Hugo: fast like a... gopher?"></p><p><em>Hugo: fast like a... gopher?</em></p>
<p><em>Image source:</em> <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>
</p>
<h2>Memory lane</h2>
<p>To give you a bit of history: worldtrip was originally built in <a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a> (version <a href="https://www.drupal.org/forum/general/news-and-announcements/2006-05-01/drupal-470-released">4.7</a>), back in 2007. So it started its life as a real, old-school, PHP CMS driven blog. I actually wrote most of the blog entries from internet cafés around the world, by logging in and typing away – often while struggling with a non-English keyboard, a bad internet connection, a sluggish machine, and a malware-infested old Windows. Ah, the memories! And people posted comments too.
</p>
<p>Then, in 2014, I converted it to a "static PHP site", which I custom-built. It was static as in "no database" – all the content <a href="https://greenash.net.au/thoughts/2014/05/database-free-content-tagging-with-files-and-glob/">was in flat files</a>, virtually identical to the "content files" of Hugo and other SSGs – but not quite static as in "plain HTML files". It was still PHP, and so it still needed to be served by a PHP-capable web server (like Apache or Nginx with their various modules).
</p>
<p>In retrospect, maybe I should have SSG-ified worldtrip in 2014. But SSGs still weren't much of a thing back then: Hugo was in its infancy; Netlify didn't exist yet; nor did any of the JS-based <a href="https://gatsbyjs.com/">cool</a> new <a href="https://nextjs.org/">kids</a>. The original SSG, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, was around, but it wasn't really on my radar (I didn't try out Jekyll until around 2016, and I never ended up building or deploying a finished site with it). Plus I still wasn't quite ready to end my decade-long love affair with PHP (I finally got out of that toxic relationship for good, a few years later). Nor was I able to yet embrace the idea of hosting a whole web site on anything other than an old-school box: for a decade or so, all I had known was "shared hosting" and VPSes.
</p>
<h2>Hugo time</h2>
<p>So, it's 2021, and I've converted worldtrip yet again, this time to Hugo. It's pretty much unchanged on the surface. The main difference is that the trip photos (both in the "gallery" section, and embedded in blog posts) are now sourced from an S3 bucket instead of from Flickr (I needed to make this change in order to <a href="https://greenash.net.au/thoughts/2021/02/private-photo-collections-with-awspics/">retire my Flickr account</a>). I also converted the location map from a Google map to a Leaflet / Mapbox map (this was also needed, as <a href="https://www.endpoint.com/blog/2019/03/23/switching-google-maps-leaflet">Google now charges</a> for even the simplest Maps API usage). I could have made those changes without re-building the whole site, but they were a good excuse to do just that.
</p>
<p><img src="https://greenash.net.au/media/cache/c1/dd/c1dd65d7746c00ae9180fe3b59d11742.jpg" width="720" height="378" alt="The Leaflet and Mapbox powered location map."></p><p><em>The Leaflet and Mapbox powered location map.</em></p>
<p>True <a href="https://css-tricks.com/comparing-static-site-generator-build-times/">to its word</a>, I can attest that Hugo is <a href="https://forestry.io/blog/hugo-vs-jekyll-benchmark/">indeed fast</a>. On my local machine, Hugo generates all of the 2,000+ pages of worldtrip in a little over 2 seconds. And deploying it on Netlify is indeed easy-peasy. And free – including with a custom domain, with SSL, with quite generous bandwidth, with plenty of build minutes – so kudos to Netlify (and I hope they keep on being so generous!).
</p>
<p>Hugo had pretty much everything I needed, to make re-building worldtrip a breeze: <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/types/">content types</a>, <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/">front matter</a>, <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/">taxonomies</a>, <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/menus/">menus</a>, <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/urls/">customisable URLs</a>, templating (including <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/">partials</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/shortcode-templates/">shortcodes</a>), <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/pagination/">pagination</a>, and <a href="https://gohugo.io/variables/page/">previous / next</a> links. It didn't support absolutely all of worldtrip's features out-of-the-box – but then again, nothing ever does, right? And filling in those remaining gaps was going to be easy, right?
</p>
<p>As it turns out, building custom functionality in Hugo is quite hard.
</p>
<p>The first pain point that I hit, was worldtrip's multi-level (country / city) taxonomy hierarchy. Others have <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/multi-level-taxonomy/4888/15">shared their grief</a> with this, and I shared mine there too. I got it working, but only by coding way more logic into a template than should have been necessary, and by abusing the s%#$ out of Hugo templating's <a href="https://gohugo.io/functions/scratch/">scratch</a> feature. The <a href="https://github.com/Jaza/worldtrip/blob/master/layouts/partials/countriesandcities.html">resulting partial</a> template is an unreadable abomination. It could have been a nice, clean, testable function (and it previously was one, in PHP), were I able to write any actual code in a Hugo site (in Go or in any other language). But no, you can't write actual code in a Hugo site, you can only write template logic.
</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I just discovered that <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/5783">support for <code>return</code>'ing a value</a> of any type (rather than just rendering a string) <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pull/5788">was added to Hugo</a> a few years back (and is documented, albeit rather tersely). So I could rely on Hugo's scratch a bit less, if I were to instead <code>return</code> the countries / cities array. But the logic still has to live in a template!
</p>
<p>Same with the tag cloud. It's not such a big deal, it's a problem that <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/weighted-tag-cloud/3491/10">various people have solved</a> at the template level, and I did so too. What I did for <a href="https://github.com/Jaza/worldtrip/blob/master/layouts/partials/weightedtags.html">weighted tags</a> isn't totally illegible. But again, it was previously (pre-Hugo) implemented as a nice actual function in code, and now it's shoved into template logic.

<p>The photo gallery was cause for considerable grief too. Because I didn't want an individual page to be rendered for each photo, my first approach was to define the gallery items in <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/data-templates/">data files</a>. But I needed the listing to be paginated, and I soon discovered that Hugo's pagination only supports page collections, not arbitrary lists of data (why?!). So, take two, I defined them as <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/">headless bundles</a>. But it just so happens that listing headless bundles (as opposed to just retrieving a single one) <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/how-to-iterate-over-headless-pages/12536/21">is a right pain</a>, and if you're building up a list of them and then paginating that list, it's also hacky and very inefficient (when I tried it, my site took 4x longer to build, because it was calling <a href="https://gohugo.io/functions/readdir/"><code>readDir</code></a> on the whole photo directory, for each paginated chunk).
</p>
<p>Finally, I stumbled across Hugo's (quite new) <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/build-options/">"no render"</a> feature, and I was able to define and paginate my gallery items (without having a stand-alone page for each photo) in an efficient and non-hacky way, by specifying the build options <code>render = "never"</code> and <code>list = "local"</code>. I also fixed a bug in Hugo itself (my first tiny bit of code written in <a href="https://golang.org/">golang</a>!), to <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pull/8201">exclude "no render" pages from the sitemap</a> (as of writing, the fix has been merged but not included in a stable Hugo release), thus making it safe(r) to specify <code>list = "always"</code> (which you might need, instead of <code>list = "local"</code>, if you want to list your items anywhere else on the site, other than on their parent page). So, at least with the photo gallery – in contrast to my other above-mentioned Hugo pain points – I'm satisfied with the end result. Nevertheless, a more-than-warranted amount of hair tearing-out did occur.
</p>
<p>The worldtrip monthly archive wasn't particularly hard to implement, <a href="https://blog.atj.me/2017/10/generate-yearly-and-monthly-archive-pages-with-hugo-sections/">thanks to this guide</a> that I followed quite closely. But I was disappointed that I had to create a physical "page" content file for each month, in order for Hugo to render it. Because guess what, Hugo <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/pagination-and-group-by-date/1441/10">doesn't have built-in support</a> for chronological archive pages! And because, since Hugo offers <a href="https://forestry.io/blog/hugo-and-jekyll-compared/">no real mechanism</a> for you to write code anywhere to (programatically) render such pages, you just have to hack around that limitation. I didn't do what the author of that guide did (he added a stand-alone Node.js script to generate more archive "page" content files when needed), because worldtrip is a retired site that will never need more such pages generated, and because I'd rather avoid having totally-separate-to-Hugo build scripts like that. The <a href="https://github.com/Jaza/worldtrip/blob/master/layouts/monthly-archive/single.html">monthly archive templates</a> also contain <a href="https://github.com/Jaza/worldtrip/blob/master/layouts/blog/monthly-archive.html">more logic</a> than they ideally should.
</p>

<h2>Mixed feelings</h2>
<p>So, I succeeded in migrating worldtrip to Hugo. I can pat myself on the back, job well done, jolly good old chap. I don't regret having chosen Hugo: it really is fast; it's a well-written (to my novice golang eyes) and well-maintained open-source codebase; it boasts an active dev and support community; <a href="https://gohugo.io/documentation/">its documentation</a> is of a high standard; and it comes built-in with 95% of the functionality that any static site could possibly need.
</p>
<p>I wanted, and I still want, to love Hugo, for those reasons. And just because it's golang (which I have vaguely been wanting to learn lately … although I have invested time in learning the basics of other languages over the past several years, namely Erlang and Rust). And because it really seems like the best-in-breed among SSGs: it's focused on the basics of HTML page generation (not trying to "solve React for static sites", or other such nonsense, at the same time); it takes performance and scalability seriously; and it fosters a good dev, design, and content authoring experience.
</p>
<p>However, it seems that, by design, it's completely impossible to write custom code in an actual programming language (not in a presentation-layer template), that's hooked in to Hugo in any way (apart from by hacking Hugo core). I don't mind that Hugo is opinionated. Many great pieces of software are opinionated – <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, for example.
</p>
<p>But Django is far more flexible: you can programatically render any page, with <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/http/urls/">any URL</a>, that takes your fancy; you can move any presentational logic you want into procedural code (usually either in the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/http/views/">view layer</a>, to populate template variables, or in <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/howto/custom-template-tags/">custom template tags</a>), to keep your templates simple; and you can <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/db/models/">model your data</a> however you want (so you're free to implement something like a multi-level taxonomy yourself – although I admit that this isn't a fair apples vs apples comparison, as Django data is stored in a database). I realise that Django – and <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>, and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a>, and <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> – all generate dynamic sites; but that's no excuse, an SSG can and should allow the same level of flexibility via custom code.

            <p>This is a total break from my usual paleontology content, but bear with me, because I think this topic is really interesting, fun, and useful.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-to-bayess-theorem">Introduction to Bayes’s Theorem</h3>

<p>The Reverend Thomas Bayes was a rather obscure 18th-century Presbyterian minister who made a single, ridiculously important contribution to mathematics: Bayes’s Theorem.  This is a formula for calculating probabilities that takes into account <em>prior knowledge</em>, the things you already know or believe before you do the calculation.  Statisticians who use Bayes’s Theorem for their probability are called Bayesians, while statisticians who don’t are called frequentists.  Here’s a <a href="https://xkcd.com/1132/">relevant xkcd</a> highlighting the difference.</p>

<p>Bayes’s Theorem has important applications in machine learning, since it’s a way of formalizing the process of reasoning with uncertain information–essentially, getting computers to make good decisions even when they’re not totally sure about certain facts.  The theorem is also culturally important in the rationality community, so much so that to many people, “Bayesian” is synonymous with “rationalist”.</p>

<p>Despite all the hype, Bayes’s Theorem is actually pretty easy to reason about and apply to various real-life problems.  In this post, I’ll provide three examples of times I’ve used it in my own life, and hopefully by the end you’ll understand how to apply it to yours too.</p>

<h3 id="example-1-a-tea-party-with-bayes">Example 1: A Tea Party With Bayes</h3>

<p>At work, in the before-time, we used have a tea party every Tuesday from 6 to 6:30.  Before my company was bought by a larger company, it was a scotch party, where a bunch of middle-aged men would get together and taste the scotch of the week and try to guess what it was.  But the larger company has a no-alcohol-on-the-premises policy, so it became a tea party.  It’s kind of funny to see all these middle-aged men drinking tea and eating cookies and strawberries.  It seems a lot more like an old-woman thing to do.  Anyway, the game is that they’ll have some kind of plain tea–white, green, oolong, or black–and you have to guess which it is.  If you’re really good, you’ll also guess what form (leaves, stems, powdered, etc) and what region (China, India, etc) and if you think it’s been served at the tea party in the past.</p>

<p>All this to say I realized I was making an un-Bayesian mistake when guessing tea.  Let’s simplify it for now and just say there’s two kinds of tea, green and white.  And let’s say my tasting skill is not that great yet, so I can distinguish between the two with a 60/40 success rate.  So, 60% of green teas I taste will taste green to me, and 40% of green teas I’ll misidentify as white.  Same thing with white tea: 60% I’ll correctly identify as white, and 40% I’ll wrongly guess green.  One week, I tasted a tea, and it tasted white.  So, stupidly, I guessed white.  I was wrong.  This is stupid because I disregarded my priors.  White tea is way more rare than green, and I would estimate that for every white tea we have, we have nine green teas.  So the <strong>prior probability</strong> of tea being white is 10%.  Instead of <em>shifting</em> this probability when presented with new data, the 60/40 taste of it, I <em>replaced</em> my prior with the new number, and guessed it was 60% likely to be white tea.  However, using Bayes’s equation, the true probability is only 14%, because there are so few white teas to begin with!  Even if I could taste with 90% accuracy, the probability would only be 50% of being white tea.  Let me explain the math:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Out of 100 taste tests of tea, we can expect 90 of them to be green and 10 of them to be white.  Easy so far.</li>
  <li>Out of the 90 green teas, there will be 54 that taste green (60% of 90) and 36 that taste white (40% of 90).</li>
  <li>Out of the 10 white teas, there will be 6 that taste white and 4 that taste green.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, if I want to know the probability of a tea <em>being</em> white given that it <em>tastes</em> white (written mathematically as P(white | tastes white)) you do this:</p><p>

\[P(\text{white} | \text{tastes white})=\frac{\text{number of white teas that taste white}}{\text{total number of teas that taste white}}\]

\[P(\text{white} | \text{tastes white})=\frac{6}{6+36}=14.3\%\]

</p><p>So you can see, the number of <strong>false positives</strong> I get from green teas that taste white is actually <em>larger</em> than the number of <em>true</em> positives, even though the false positives are a smaller proportion of the population.</p>

<p>Another way to visualize this calculation is to make a table:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>Tea tastes white</td>
      <td>Tea tastes green</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tea is white</td>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tea is green</td>
      <td>36</td>
      <td>64</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>A presentation of data that shows the same relationships but looks different is called <strong>isomorphic</strong>.  This table is isomorphic to the bullet points above.</p>

<h3 id="example-2-taking-bayes-on-a-date">Example 2: Taking Bayes On A Date</h3>

<p>Here’s an example from a few years ago, when I was using Tinder, the speed-online-dating app.  I was scoring each suitor in a spreadsheet on a few different categories, like “Musicality” and “Open-Mindedness” and “Attractiveness.”  One time, I went on a date with a boy who got super high marks in all my predetermined categories; he was super smart, went to Harvard for undergrad and Oxford for grad, currently works at Facebook, knew a bit about rationality, had similar musical taste to me, was into climbing, played piano for 12 years, etc.  Basically he was getting 7-9 in every category.  <em>But</em> he seemed like he might be gay (and trying to date girls on Tinder because of familial pressure).  Because of that, I added a new “other” category and scored him low on it, but he still came out with a higher score than any previous candidate.  So then I decided to do a Bayesian calculation of how likely he was to be gay.</p>

<p>I’ve written about the fraternal birth order effect before in my post about <a href="https://obscuredinosaurfacts.com/blog/post/2020/08/12/pregananant.html">strange biological phenomena related to pregnancy</a>.  For some reason, the more older brothers a right-handed man has, the more likely he is to be gay.  For some strange reason, it doesn’t affect women and it doesn’t affect left-handed men.  The prior probability of being gay (equivalent to the prevalence in the population) is about 3%.  For every older brother you have, the probability goes up by 1/3.</p>

<p><strong>STOP PRESS: I have since been informed that this equation is incorrect!  See both my original derivation and the corrected equation in the Appendices to this post.  However, this is what I used at the time, and this part isn’t part of the Bayesian calculation, so I’m leaving it as it was in this section.</strong></p>

<p>The equation can be expressed as follows:</p><p>

\[P_{gay}=1-\left(\frac{97}{100}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n\right)\]

</p><p>Where <em>n</em> is the number of older brothers.  There’s an explanation of where this expression comes from at the end of this post, for those interested.</p>

<p>The suitor in question had one older brother.  So, his prior probability of being gay was:</p><p>

\[P_{gay}=1-\left(\frac{97}{100}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)\right) = 35\%\]

</p><p>I would guess that my gay-dar has an accuracy of 70/30. So, using this information along with the 35% prior probability, we can calculate</p>
<ul>
  <li>Out of 1000 of this suitor,</li>
  <li>350 will be gay and 650 will be straight.</li>
  <li>Of the 350 gay, 245 will seem gay and 105 will seem straight.</li>
  <li>Of the 650 straight, 455 will seem straight and 195 will seem gay. So the probability of him being gay given he seems gay is</li>
</ul><p>

\[P(\text{gay} | \text{seems gay}) = \frac{245}{245+195} = 56\%\]

</p><p>So, even when taking into account the relatively small prior probability of being gay, I thought he was more likely to be gay than not, and I didn’t go on any more dates.</p>

<p>Again, we can represent the data isomorphically in a table:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>Seems gay</td>
      <td>Seems straight</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Is gay</td>
      <td>245</td>
      <td>105</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Is straight</td>
      <td>195</td>
      <td>455</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Being able to draw up a table becomes important when reasoning about more than two variables, as we’ll see in the next section.</p>

<p>Note: you probably have noticed that half of my Bayesian calculation each time comes from making up a number: my tea tasting accuracy of 60/40 and my gay-dar accuracy of 70/30. The point of doing a Bayesian calculation is that it makes you consider your priors and make a real statistical calculation, but once you get the result, you can make the choice to throw out the answer and go with your gut. But by doing this, your gut is much better informed.</p>

<p>Another interesting place the fraternal birth order thing comes into play is in the movie Frozen, in which Prince Hans says that he has twelve older brothers. If you’ve seen the movie, you know that he courts Anna just so he can gain control of her kingdom, so his sexuality isn’t really revealed by the story. Using the fraternal birth order calculation, we find that he has a 99.3% chance of being gay. <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist">Watsonianally</a>, if Anna had known about the fraternal birth order effect, she could have saved herself a lot of trouble.  <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist">Doylistically</a>, I wonder if Disney’s writers knew about the fraternal birth order effect and intentionally invoked it when creating Hans’s backstory, appearance, and mannerisms.</p>

<h3 id="example-3-bayes-in-the-time-of-covid">Example 3: Bayes In The Time Of COVID</h3>

<p>This example is from very recently, and is what inspired me to write this up as a post.  Here’s what happened.</p>

<p>I wanted to visit my parents in person for New Year, so I got a COVID test even though I didn’t know of any particular exposures or have any symptoms.  I had been going to work in person and had been to the doctor a couple times though, so I thought it would be prudent to get tested just in case.  Surprise surprise, the test came back positive (if it didn’t, why would I be telling you this story?), so I cancelled my New Year plans and locked myself in a bedroom for ten days.  However, I’d been living in the same house and sleeping in the same bed as my fiancé up until I received the test result, so for awhile we were worried that we would both get sick.</p>

<p>Thankfully, that didn’t happen: he tested negative twice (once maybe a bit early, but once in the theoretic peak detection time), and neither of us ever experienced any symptoms.  That made me think, is it more likely that my result was a false positive, or that I truly had COVID but somehow didn’t transmit it to him?  Time to …</p></div></div>

Microsoft has to start&nbsp;shipping new stuff that makes AWS RDS &amp; Aurora customers aspire to using the Real Deal SQL Server (and/or Azure SQL DB).</p><p>SQL Server 2017 &amp; 2019 started bringing that with query optimizer improvements such that your code will just run faster – that’s a good down payment, but they gotta keep making those payments. If they don’t, projects like Babelfish will start to win over customers if/when they ship.</p><p><strong>SQL Server on Linux: smart play by MSFT, or failed experiment?</strong></p><p>If you go down the list of popular databases, the only ones that are Windows-only are SQL Server and Access. I think it made sense for Microsoft to hedge their bets and start making the investments necessary to survive in datacenters 10-20-30 years from now. It’s a hedge, though: it shouldn’t be your first default choice for running SQL Server. The full feature capability isn’t there, and the high availability &amp; disaster&nbsp;recovery story is still pretty sketchy.</p><p>I think of SQL Server 2019 on Linux as an alpha release. It’s there if you&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to have it, but otherwise, you should wait for a few years until you really need it. Right now, it’s just kinda there for experiments.</p><p>The one place where you might&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to have it is throwaway environments for continuous integration. If you need to quickly and inexpensively stand up and shut down a lot of temporary SQL Servers to test your code, then sure, it makes sense there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What’s the future of SQL Server in the cloud, anyway? Is it the next Oracle (as AWS is trying to position it), widely disliked and mostly legacy, or can it compete with managed OSS engines like Postgres and MySQL on its own terms?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Don’t think about the dislike &amp; legacy in terms of the name brand of the database engine.</p><p>Think about dislike &amp; legacy in terms of the&nbsp;<em>features</em>&nbsp;that have to be implemented: auditing, fine-grained single sign on security, integration with Active Directory, compatibility with reporting systems, GDPR compliance, encryption, etc. Here’s a great place to start:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.enterpriseready.io/">https://www.enterpriseready.io</a></p><p>Developers HATE those features. That’s why Amazon and others say that Oracle and SQL Server are disliked, legacy applications: they support all the features that enterprise users demand, but developers hate. I hate those features too, but…enterprises demand ’em.</p><p>If you’re not in an enterprise, and you don’t have plans to sell your app to an enterprise, then don’t use an expensive relational database. Use something cheaper and cloud-native like Amazon’s touting. I agree that it’s a better choice.</p><p><strong>Finally, what does a DBA role look like in, say, 2025?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>2025 is just four short years from now, and most orgs still aren’t even&nbsp;<em>planning</em>&nbsp;for a cloud-native future. They’re just talking about it. The DBA job description in 2025 will still look the same as it looks today: managing data stored in a bunch of diverse platforms, all of which have their own management, troubleshooting, and performance tuning.</p><p>If you stretch it out to 2031 or 2036, 10-15 years from now, it’ll be easier. We’ll have less worries around backups, corruption repair, and restores. But you know what we’ll still be dealing with? Troubleshooting (because everybody assumes it’s a database problem first), security, encryption, performance tuning, and architecture.</p><p>The cloud doesn’t architect itself.</p><p><em>This interview is part of ACG’s <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/tag/cloud-conversations">Cloud Conversations</a> series.</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

				<h4><span><span><span></span><span></span></span></span><span><span>How does the APP work?</span></span></h4>
				<div>
			<div>
				
	<div>
		<div>
			<p>When you surf the net, you are constantly sharing data that belongs to you and holds a value.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, every time you use an APP or visit any website, valuable information is being compiled about you, your tastes, purchasing behaviour, lifestyle, etc.</p>
<p>With Tribaldata, this value doesn’t get lost but rather gets transformed into points that can be used for good actions – like planting trees!</p>
<p>By planting trees, you are reducing your digital carbon footprint generated using internet. This means that you are contributing to a more sustainable world effortlessly, without spending a penny, and without giving up on any of your online hobbies, interests or social life.</p>
<p>This is what we call “Good Data”.</p>

		</div> 
	</div> 
			</div>
				</div>

				<h4><span><span><span></span><span></span></span></span><span><span>How do I receive points to plant trees?</span></span></h4>
				<div>
			<div>
				
	<div>
		<div>
			<p>Once you’ve installed the APP, we will ask you some basic information about you and your interests. You can also use cookies to share other information that you already share with other websites and APPs. All this info will feed your anonymous profile (we call it Tribe Card) and help research and advertising entities get more accurate data.</p>
<p>The first time you activate your anonymous profile, you will receive welcome points that you can use to plant your first tree.</p>
<p>Afterwards, you will receive weekly points for keeping your profile active for advertising – whether you see ads or not. We will use notifications to let you know about new points, new opportunities to earn points and how you can use your points for good. You can also use the section “my activity” to stay updated.</p>

		</div> 
	</div> 
			</div>
				</div>

				<h4><span><span><span></span><span></span></span></span><span><span>What is the Tribe Card?</span></span></h4>
				<div>
			<div>
				
	<div>
		<div>
			<p>It is the name we have given to your anonymous advertising digital profile. Each Tribaldata user has its own.</p>
<p>Your profile is the sum of the data that you add and activate on the APP. It is encrypted and store in a safe server in the cloud in line with our <a href="http://www.tribaldata.es/en/privacy-policy">data protection policy</a>.</p>
<p>Only you and Tribaldata know that this profile belongs to you. All other parties will only receive anonymous data for them to use to improve the relevance of their advertising. Cookies only have a lifespan of 60 days, which means that in order to keep earning points and plant tree you will need to reactivate your profile every 60 days. Through the APP, you will be able to control your tribe card and keep it active.</p>
<p>The more data you add to your card, the more valuable for ad campaign it become, and the more points you earn every week.</p>

		</div> 
	</div> 
			</div>
				</div>

				<h4><span><span><span></span><span></span></span></span><span><span>What happens when I activate my Tribe Card?</span></span></h4>
				<div>
			<div>
				
	<div>
		<div>
			<p>Upon activating your tribe card, you are giving your consent for collaborating brands to use your anonymous data. They will use it to better tailor their ad campaign and the ads that you and other users will see on your devices. This is what allows us to generate the money to plant your trees!</p>
<p>To this aim, we need to use your Mobile Device Identification and install cookies in your devices. You can always control the status of your card in “My Tribe Card” section. When your tribe card is green, it means it is active and therefore earning you points. The more data you share, the more points your receive every week.</p>
<p>Every 60 days, your tribe card will need to be re-activated. When it is about to go off, it will turn orange, then red once it becomes inactive. This means you will not be earning points anymore until you re-activate it.</p>
<p>Remember that whatever you do, you are already a part of the digital economy just by using the internet. Nothing is going to change on other sites or platforms. The difference is that Tribaldata gives you back control over that same data so that we can all&nbsp; do something good for the environment – just by using the APP.</p>
<p>Similarly, you will see advertising when navigating the web just as before. The only change is that part of those ads – from those advertisers who are partnering with us – will be more relevant to you and therefore less annoying. Isn’t that great?</p>

				</div>

				<h4><span><span><span></span><span></span></span></span><span><span>What happens when I use my points to plant a tree?</span></span></h4>
				<div>
			<div>
				
	<div>
		<div>
			<p>Whenever you have enough points to plant a tree and decide to use them, these will get added to the points contributed by fellow tree-planters. Periodically, we will donate the monetary equivalent of all points to renown and trusted organizations on the ground that will manage the planting process.</p>
<p>In our web, we provide updated information on our partner organizations. We will also keep you informed on the status of each planting project via emails and within our APP.</p>

		</div> 
	</div> 
			</div>
				</div>

				<h4><span><span><span></span><span></span></span></span><span><span>How can I see the status of the trees I planted?</span></span></h4>
				<div>
			<div>
				
	<div>
		<div>
			<p>In the App, go to the&nbsp; “My achievements” section to check the status of your individual contributions as well as updated information about the impact the whole Tribaldata community is making on the planet. Soon, we will launch a ranking so you can see where you stand in comparison with your fellow tribe members.</p>
<p>Each plantation project is linked to a geolocalized field and all funds are used for reforestation, agro-forestation and extreme poverty reduction projects which involve the local populations.</p>

				<h4><span><span><span></span><span></span></span></span><span><span>What is the digital carbon footprint?</span></span></h4>
				<div>
			<div>
				
	<div>
		<div>
			<p>Every single action you take in the digital world, from sending an email to launching a search in your browser, streaming a show or commenting on social media, generates CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>The servers that are used to allow all these actions consume a huge amount of energy which – in its large majority – is not renewable.</p>
<p>Tribaldata allows you to offset your digital carbon footprint generated by the daily usage of your phone, tablet or computer.</p>

		</div> 
	</div> 
			</div>
				</div>

				<h4><span><span><span></span><span></span></span></span><span><span>How can I plant more trees?</span></span></h4>
				<div>
			<div>
				
	<div>
		<div>
			<p>We are constantly working to improve the Tribaldata APP. As such, we will go on incorporating new data-sharing options for you to build your Tribe Card, increasing its weekly value and thereby the amount of points you will receive. The more you make points, the more trees you can plant.</p>
<p>In addition, you can help generate a snowball effect by sharing the APP with your friends and grow the Tribe. Every time you invite a friend, and they invite their friend, you impact grows from 1 to 7 trees planted!</p>

				<h4><span><span><span></span><span></span></span></span><span><span>What kind of companies will use my Tribe Card?</span></span></h4>
				<div>
			<div>
				
	<div>
		<div>
			<p>Only companies who fulfill the current requirements in terms of data protection will be allowed to process your data and cookies. In any case, remember that you profile always remains anonymous.</p>
<p>This information will mostly be used for “top brands” campaigns during the validity period of your tribe card. Every time you re-activate your tribe card in the APP you will see examples of brands that have been using your data.</p>
<p>You can also check our <a href="https://tribaldata.es/en/cookie-policy/%E2%80%8E">cookie policy</a> and our <a href="https://tribaldata.es/en/privacy-policy/">data protection policy</a> to see what companies we collaborate with.</p>
<p>Remember that you can withdraw consent for the use of the data at any time via “My Tribe Card” section in the APP.</p>

		</div> 
	</div> 
			</div>
				</div>

				<h4><span><span><span></span><span></span></span></span><span><span>How will my Tribe Card be used?</span></span></h4>
				<div>
			<div>
				
	<div>
		<div>
			<p>We combine your tribe card’s data together with the data from other “similar” consumers provided by our partners. This allows us to generate statistically relevant and therefore targetable anonymous consumer profiles that match the main advertising targets.</p>
<p>With better targeting, consumer brands in the UK and Spain can create more efficient and relevant campaigns. The mixing of our users’ data with our partners’ data is what helps us generate the revenues that will be used to plant trees in your name.</p>

		</div> 
	</div> 
			</div>
				</div>

				<h4><span><span><span></span><span></span></span></span><span><span>What about safety and privacy?</span></span></h4>
				<div>
			<div>
				
	<div>
		<div>
			<p>All data is encrypted and anonymized, meaning your name, address or any other personal information will not be visible or understandable to anyone, be it other users, search engines, or any of the companies with collaborate with.</p>
<p>More to it, you control what data to add to your tribe card for advertising use. which is for rent, and to whom.&nbsp; Of course, we comply with all applicable data laws and regulations, but for us following the law isn’t enough. We believe that you need not only to be able to control, but also understand.</p>
<p>That is extremely important to us which is why if you feel that we are providing you with too many privacy notifications in the APP, please bare with us – it’s for a good cause!</p>

				<h4><span><span><span></span><span></span></span></span><span><span>Why do we call it a community?</span></span></h4>
				<div>
			<div>
				
	<div>
		<div>
			<p>Because the more people participate, the more valuable everyone’s data is.</p>
<p>Imagine a bank with one customer, that would be difficult to lend money. But with a million customers it’s another story. It also depends on how much money you put in the bank.</p>
<p>More money, more interest. With the collective power of all our data, we believe we will be so successful renting out your data that we can supply a whole family in Africa with clean water for a year.</p>
<p>Imagine doing that by just tapping on your phone!</p>

				<div>
			<div>
				
	<div>
		<div>
			<p>You can edit your sharing settings and activate or de-activate the information shared at any time in the “My Tribe Card” section. You can also change what you share and how at any time, in accordance with our <a href="http://www.tribaldata.es/en/terms-and-conditions">terms and conditions</a>.</p>
<p>Or if you wish to quit completely, you can request to delete your account and data profile with a click of a button in the “Settings” section. Your data will stay inactive and fully blocked for a while for legal purposes before being definitely erased. In any case your data remain fully encrypted at all time,</p>
<p>The only thing we would like you to do is to tell us why you choose to leave, it would help us a lot. And if you liked it, please tell your friends!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Google’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReCAPTCHA">ReCAPTCHA</a> is often the first tool that many webmasters reach for when confronted with the need to stop spam and automated malicious traffic from harming their services. In this post I explain several reasons why ReCAPTCHA is usually not the best solution to use for this purpose, as it is often unnecessary, inconveniences users, and subjects users to intensive tracking and fingerprinting that they are not able to opt-out of. Several alternative solutions to ReCAPTCHA for various threat models are presented as well as best practices for implementing captchas in general. <br></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="436" height="119" src="https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha.png" alt="" srcset="https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha.png 436w, https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha-300x82.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px"><figcaption>The face of evil</figcaption></figure></div>







<p>ReCAPTCHA is yet another free-of-charge product offered benevolently by Google for any webmaster to implement within their own services. How does ReCAPTCHA differentiate legitimate human users from bots? ReCAPTCHA relies extensively on user fingerprinting, putting emphasis on the question of “Which human is this user?” rather than the ordinary “Is this user human?”. It’s worth noting how much easier it is to successfully solve ReCAPTCHAs when the user is logged into their Google account, thus allowing Google to associate their actions with their real identity. A <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/9vmsyp/google_recaptchas_targeting_firefox_and_other/">similar effect</a> is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20147015">often reported</a> for users of non-Google browsers, who notice ReCAPTCHAs take more time to complete in Firefox over Chrome. This is in-line with <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-mozilla-vp-says-google-intentionally-damaged-firefox/">many other anti-competitive techniques</a> that Google has used over the years to help grow their market share.</p>



<p>Although determining
exactly how ReCAPTCHA works is very difficult, with Google not only
heavily obfuscating its JavaScript, but also implementing an entire
VM in JavaScript with its own bytecode language, there have still
been many attempts to reverse-engineer some of the client-side code,
as well as to theorize about how the server-side logic operates.
<a href="https://github.com/toogle/InsideReCaptcha">Initial attempts</a>
at reverse-engineering ReCAPTCHA show copious amounts of information
belong collected, including but not limited to: plugins, user agent,
IP address, screen resolution, execution times, timezone, language,
click/keyboard/touch information within the frame of the captcha,
test results of many browser-specific functions and CSS evaluation,
information about canvas element rendering, and cookies, including
those affiliated with your Google account that were placed within the
last 6 months.</p>



<p>There is a good reason why ReCAPTCHA uses the google.com domain instead of one specific to ReCAPTCHA. This allows Google to receive any cookies that they have already set for you, effectively bypassing restrictions on setting third party cookies and allowing traffic correlation with all of Google’s other services, which most users use. ReCAPTCHA collects enough information that it could reliably de-anonymize many users that simply wish to prove that they are Not A Robot. As JavaScript is now required to even view a ReCAPTCHA, even a user running software such as TBB (Tor Browser Bundle) may find themselves giving away more information than they intend to, for example if they have resized their browser window (which is discouraged for exactly this reason).</p>



<p>Correspondingly, webmasters that use Google’s ReCAPTCHA on their websites must link to both Google’s <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en">Privacy</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en">Terms</a> pages (included in the form by default in a small 8px style that makes them appear unclickable). Although Google used to have its own privacy and terms pages for ReCAPTCHA, these links are no longer specific to ReCAPTCHA, but rather are the privacy and terms pages for all users of Google services in general, regardless of which service is being used, or if the user has (or even wants) a Google account to begin with. Therefore accepting these terms (implicitly, by attempting to prove you are Not A Robot) grants Google permission to do <strong>everything</strong> that they do to their regular users of their services to you, and little information is available as to what specifically is done (GDPR is likely to be unhelpful here, given ReCAPTCHA’s spam-stopping purpose). Not only are the unhelpful links in the ReCAPTCHA box never opened by users, but there is also no Google logo or visual reference to indicate that ReCAPTCHA is a Google service, so many users have zero indication that they have just consented to all of Google’s tracking just because they tried to leave feedback or create a ticket on your website. If you thought you could use the Internet without using Google’s services, try using the Internet without filling out a single ReCAPTCHA, which for some users is required to pay their bills, file their taxes, and sometimes even use Government websites (if you somehow manage this, next try never sending email to Gmail/Gsuite addresses or using Google APIs for a more exciting challenge). Good luck.</p>



<p>It is worth mentioning that caring about user privacy to this extent is likely to be outside of the scope of concern for most websites. Many websites are already so tightly coupled to Google’s services (commonly including Google analytics, Google ads, Google APIs, Google tag manager, Google static resources, Google OAuth, Google Compute Engine, and many others) that the addition of a Google captcha appears negligible. With that said, different websites have different values and different users, and many do not want to require users to agree to Google’s tracking and labor for basic usage. The level of centralization that ReCAPTCHA forces is not good for anyone except Google.</p>



<p>Apart from the privacy implications of ReCAPTCHA usage, the actual captcha is very tedious for many classes of users, sometimes becoming so difficult that users find themselves unable to to complete the captcha at all. <a href="https://github.com/google/recaptcha/issues/286">Users hate ReCAPTCHA</a>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/8yezeq/fuck_recaptcha/">They</a> <a href="https://devrant.com/rants/1754031/fuck-recaptcha-fuck-google-for-making-recaptcha-fuck-it-dont-be-evil-my-foot">really</a> <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/the-select-all-images-with-a-street-sign-recaptcha-is-a-godless-creation-of-evil.1410504/">hate</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19059390">ReCAPTCHA</a>. <a href="https://recaptcha.sucks/">ReCAPTCHA</a> <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2019/04/make-recaptchas-im-not-a-robot-accurate">is</a> <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/recaptcha-is-uxs-worst-nightmare-c28b7341e88a">so</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/9haexn/googles_recaptcha_needs_to_be_fucking_made_illegal/">hated</a> that <a href="https://www.4chan.org/pass">some websites</a> have a profit model of charging users $20 annually to disable ReCAPTCHA, which <strong>thousands </strong>of users pay for. If this sounds like a great new business model to you and now you want to add ReCAPTCHAs to every page of your website to attempt to maximize profit, I will find you. And I will force you to complete a ReCAPTCHA every time you want food or water until you die from malnutrition after the first week. I have read countless posts from users that became so frustrated with a service that used excessive ReCAPTCHAs that they swore to never use the offending website again. These are often intelligent users with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/#version-2-are-you-a-robot">no disabilities</a> who are simply tired of being treated like dirt and wasting their time. Be kind to your users and help minimize the amount of ReCAPTCHAS that they have to solve just to be allowed to use the Internet.</p>



<p>ReCAPTCHAs become significantly more difficult if the user attempts to ‘opt-out’ of Google’s services and tracking by using software that hinders it, such as VPNs, TBB, and many anti-tracking browser addons and modifications. To demonstrate what is meant by ‘very tedious’, below is a real-time recording of myself solving a single ReCAPTCHA using TBB:</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha-1.webm"></video><figcaption>Spambots are known to give up when forced to be patient</figcaption></figure>



<p>I got lucky and only needed to complete two challenges. Sometimes there are ten or more. Watching the above video, you might think to yourself “I knew the tor network was slow, but I didn’t know it was <em>that</em> slow!”. You would be correct to take note of this discrepancy. If we open up the web developer console, we can see that the HTTP requests for new captcha images only take a few hundred milliseconds. Despite this, Google’s heavily-obfuscated JavaScript intentionally delays the appearance of the new images by several seconds every time, which I’m sure has something to do with the fact that bots give up when forced to wait, probably. This is not a nice way to treat users that don’t want to perform unpaid labor and be fingerprinted by Google. Keep in mind that the above video demonstrates one of the worst possible cases of ReCAPTCHA UX (which some <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/31088-morecaptcha/code">userscripts</a> may improve), and that the average user has a significantly quicker experience, providing that they are not attempting to thwart any of Google’s tracking and don’t make many mistakes.</p>



<p>In addition to this tediousness, the actual labor that the user is performing is directly used to benefit Google. Worry not however, as Google is eager to brag about the selfless humanitarianism that you’re engaging in by choosing ReCAPTCHA, stating the following on their main ReCAPTCHA <a href="https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/">page</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>“Hundreds of millions of captchas are solved by people every day. ReCAPTCHA makes positive use of this human effort by channeling the time spent solving captchas into digitizing text, annotating images, building machine learning datasets.”</p></blockquote>



<p>This
is certainly a very rosy way of convincing
you to feel good about forcing
your users to engage in unpaid labor that directly benefits the
world’s most powerful surveillance corporation. ReCAPTCHA
is free for a reason.</p>



<p>Lastly, ReCAPTCHA is popular. Very popular. While this brings some advantages, it also means that there’s significant efforts to break ReCAPTCHA, and those efforts all potentially affect your website, with your captcha implementation being perfectly identical to a million others. As a result of this, there have been <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-16/materials/asia-16-Sivakorn-Im-Not-a-Human-Breaking-the-Google-reCAPTCHA-wp.pdf">many</a> <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/wangz3/publications/ccs18.pdf">papers</a> <a href="https://uncaptcha.cs.umd.edu/papers/uncaptcha_woot17.pdf">published</a> <a href="https://github.com/ecthros/uncaptcha">that</a> <a href="https://github.com/ecthros/uncaptcha2">break</a> <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/358/6368/eaag2612">ReCAPTCHA</a> over the years, generally with Google making modifications to improve their captcha afterwards. There have also been <a href="https://2captcha.com/">paid-for</a> <a href="https://www.deathbycaptcha.com/">services</a> that use human labor to solve captchas on behalf of a paying client for less than a cent each. For a modern and user-friendly example of bypassing ReCAPTCHA, see Buster. <a href="https://github.com/dessant/buster">Buster</a> is a modern browser extension (Firefox+Chrome+Opera) which helps you to solve difficult captchas by completing reCAPTCHA audio challenges for you by using speech recognition.</p>











<p>Before implementing a captcha, it’s worth considering if one is
necessary to begin with. To help with evaluating this proposition,
consider if your threat model is concerned over <em>customized</em> or
<em>uncustomized</em> spam. Uncustomized spam is pervasive across many
Internet protocols, and you will encounter it quickly after enabling
HTTP, SSH, or …</p></div></div>

                    <p>Nash has upgraded our client protocols to generate signatures with secure multi-party computation (MPC), the technology behind our <a href="https://blog.nash.io/nash-launches-decentralized-api-keys/">decentralized API keys</a>. Our non-custodial blockchain wallets can now offer hardware-level security at no cost!</p><p>This upgrade means that users’ full private keys no longer play a role in signing transactions on Nash. Instead, transactions are co-signed with Nash via MPC, enabling us to enforce security policies like address whitelisting and withdrawal limits.</p><p>Users can still store their seed phrase and private keys offline for use with third-party wallets, giving them full access to their funds if Nash is offline – just like the paper backup of a hardware wallet seed phrase.</p><p>Unlike hardware wallets, however, Nash accounts are completely free and have the look and feel of familiar online platforms. What’s more, with configurable security policies, they are arguably safer than hardware. If your Nash login is hacked, the damage an attacker can do is limited.</p><p>Thanks to MPC, holding the keys to your crypto became safer and easier!</p><h2 id="what-is-multi-party-computation-mpc-">What is multi-party computation (MPC)?</h2><p>A blockchain approves or refuses a transaction by verifying its signature. A private key is one way of generating a valid signature. If you have the private key for an address, you can always sign transactions going out of that address.</p><p>However, there are other ways of generating signatures that do not give one party all the power. By splitting the generation of signatures between two parties, it becomes impossible for one party to approve transactions unilaterally.</p><p>This can be achieved using secure multi-party computation (MPC), where two parties must collaborate to generate a valid blockchain signature. Using our new protocol, both Nash and a user have their own key. These keys each generate what is known as a “pre-signature”. The two pre-signatures are then combined into a single valid signature.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/qdj8LcHfHR_dD0Gr7szIcwvsXPOlRIuHpWOXajqHvKezd93mED2W2Kyb4MY86j7OzFr6PuUlKBKkMzRIX47JHg_Virw4gBZWKtVv5-9h2gx1bUD1cvdkM2rNjJsreTtQEaAgOozt" alt=""></figure><h2 id="advanced-non-custodial-security">Advanced non-custodial security</h2><p>MPC makes it possible for users to set up specific permissions associated with their account – for instance, a withdrawal address whitelist or withdrawal limits. If a user attempts to withdraw too much, or to the wrong address, Nash will withhold its pre-signature and nothing will happen.</p><p>Of course, Nash alone is also unable to issue or authorize any transaction. The system is designed such that the user is the only one capable of initiating transactions. It remains non-custodial.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NC8yRKOPyuevORf2hA1M4psfhACKc3Jl2_S9kpHCF3Ljalo6pSH-E0Y1cuJhoGXgyjkA-Vi6v59s1prOtESSz2Qp3bKwkJkiK7Yd8SA3aC1GrlmykbweaoDMjZ8__3A1KmQcBbCx" alt=""></figure><p>You can hear our Applied Research team – Nash co-founder Ethan Fast and applied cryptographer Robert Annessi – discuss MPC on Episode 1 of our podcast <a href="https://podcast.nash.io/912007/4884014-applied-research-and-cryptography-with-cryptographer-robert-annessi-from-nash"><em>Beyond the Chain</em></a>.</p><h2 id="the-nash-wallet-system-in-detail">The Nash wallet system in detail</h2><p>Here’s a more technical overview of how Nash’s MPC protocol is implemented. First, we describe how keys are set up when the user creates an account, then how they are used on subsequent logins.</p><p><em>Account creation</em></p><ol><li>A<strong> master secret</strong> is generated securely in the user’s browser. This secret is used to derive private keys for all blockchains supported by Nash.</li><li>The user’s login information (email and password) is hashed in the browser and two key pairs are derived, one for authentication (normal login) and one for encryption/decryption. The <strong>encryption/decryption keys</strong> are never sent to Nash but are rederived locally whenever a user logs in – meaning <em>Nash can never decrypt the user’s private wallet information.</em> The <strong>authentication key</strong> is used to authenticate user login with the Nash server, just like a normal password exchange on a typical website.</li><li>The master secret is encrypted using the user’s encryption key. Call this the <strong>encrypted master secret. </strong>A backup of the encrypted master secret is sent to Nash – but <em>Nash cannot decrypt this information, since this would require the user’s decryption key</em>.</li><li>For each blockchain key derived from the master secret, the user’s browser generates <strong>two sub-keys</strong> using a 2-2 MPC key generation protocol. When some data is signed by each of these keys independently, the resulting signatures can be combined to produce a signature as if the original private key signed the information. This kind of protocol is called a <strong>threshold signature protocol,</strong> with the central property that one sub-key alone cannot sign anything, and when co-signing the original private key is never accessed or constructed by either party.</li><li><strong>One sub-key</strong> is sent to Nash to store unencrypted. This is Nash’s key, which can be used to approve future trades and transactions. The <strong>other sub-key</strong> is encrypted with the user’s encryption key and stored by Nash for retrieval by the user’s browser when they next log in. <em>Nash cannot use or access this key because it is encrypted.</em></li></ol><p>So, Nash has access to one sub-key but not the other. The user retrieves their sub-key by logging in, getting an encrypted data package from Nash and decrypting it. This all happens automatically with keys derived from user login information.</p><p><em>Login</em></p><ol><li>The user’s <strong>decryption key</strong> is derived in their browser from their username and password. The <strong>authentication key</strong> is also derived and used to log in, with an optional 2FA check.</li><li>After the user authenticates with their account info, authentication key and optional 2FA, their <strong>encrypted MPC sub-key</strong> is sent from Nash to their browser.</li><li>The user’s browser decrypts the MPC sub-key and uses it to provide signatures for trades or other transactions on the Nash platform. If the activity meets the policy requirements set up by the user, Nash will “complete” these signatures with its own sub-key to produce the signatures required for the user’s activity. For transactions, the resulting completed signature will be sent to the chain. For trades, the signatures will be processed like any other user signatures in the Nash state channels.</li></ol><p>In the event that their sub-key is compromised, a user can log in and revoke it, and an attacker does not have the power to do anything with the blockchain funds in their account. Users can also retrieve their <strong>encrypted master secret</strong> from Nash to recover their full private key information by passing additional 2FA and email verification rounds.</p><h2 id="the-future-of-crypto-funds-management">The future of crypto funds management</h2><p>The Nash wallet system represents a significant advance over current popular solutions for storing cryptocurrency.</p><ul><li>Funds held on centralized exchanges are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2019/08/15/hackers-stole-over-4-billion-from-crypto-crimes-in-2019-so-far-up-from-1-7-billion-in-all-of-2018/?sh=372b8e2255f5">vulnerable to hackers</a> and contradict one of the basic principles of digital assets: self-custody.</li><li>Software wallet solutions, e.g. encrypted private keys, are vulnerable to hacks of user machines. Once a keylogger or phishing website has stolen your password, all your funds can be drained.</li><li>Hardware wallets are an excellent solution for secure long-term storage, but inconvenient for users who make frequent transactions or want a mobile wallet. They are also expensive and too complicated for first-time users.</li></ul><p>Nash’s MPC-based system overcomes all these issues. Nash wallets are fully non-custodial, but at the same time offer advanced security unlike other software wallets, protecting users whose login details are compromised. Moreover, they are completely free and as simple as email – on both desktop and mobile!</p><p>This new system represents the future of crypto funds management: secure, convenient, free and accessible to anyone.</p><hr><p>You can stay up to date with Nash by following our <a href="https://twitter.com/nashsocial">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nashsocial/">Instagram</a>, as well as joining our <a href="https://t.me/nashsocial">official Telegram group</a>.

<div>
<p>This guide will install Crux using the Clojure CLI tools. You can find in the other methods of installing Crux in the <a href="https://opencrux.com/reference/installation.html">Crux installation docs</a>.</p>
<p>If you do not have the Clojure CLI tools installed, installers are available from the <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started#_clojure_installer_and_cli_tools">Clojure Getting Started Guide</a>. Don’t worry, you don’t need to know Clojure or the Clojure toolchain to run Crux. Just copy the commands below.</p>
<p>(1) First, create a directory to house the settings for your new Crux node by running the following in your terminal:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="sh">mkdir crux-cli &amp;&amp; cd crux-cli</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>(2) Next, create two new files within this directory named <code>deps.edn</code> and <code>crux.edn</code> with the following configuration code:</p>
<div>
<p>;; deps.edn</p>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="clojure">{:deps {org.clojure/clojure   {:mvn/version "1.10.1"}
        juxt/crux-core        {:mvn/version "21.01-1.14.0-beta"}
        juxt/crux-http-server {:mvn/version "21.01-1.14.0-alpha"}}}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>;; crux.edn</p>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="clojure">{:crux.http-server/server {:port 3000}} <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><i data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td>
<td>This configuration tells Crux to start an HTTP server on port 3000.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>(3) Last, and still from within <code>crux-cli</code>, run this command in your terminal:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="sh">clojure -M -m crux.main <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><i data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td>
<td>You will probably see a <code>SLF4J: Failed to load class</code> error. Just ignore it.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Two minutes are up and your Crux node is running. Nice work! To check that everything is working, head over to <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000</a> where you should see the Crux console.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>At the moment, the database is empty. Before we can start to play with some of the features that Crux has to offer, we need to add some data. We will be using the <a href="https://opencrux.com/reference/http.html#rest-api">REST API</a> to send and receive JSON via <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a>.</p>
<p>For this guide, we will be working with facts about the current president of the United States.
At the time of writing, the current president is Joe Biden. Lets add that to the database:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="curl">curl -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     -d '{"tx-ops": [
           ["put", { <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b>
                "crux.db/id": "president", <i data-value="2"></i><b>(2)</b>
                "name": "Joe", <i data-value="3"></i><b>(3)</b>
                "last-name": "Biden" <i data-value="4"></i><b>(4)</b>
            }]
         ]}' \
     http://localhost:3000/_crux/submit-tx</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><i data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td>
<td><code>put</code> - The type of operation we are performing</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i data-value="2"></i><b>2</b></td>
<td>The ID for the document we are adding</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i data-value="3"></i><b>3</b></td>
<td>The name to be associated with <code>president</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i data-value="4"></i><b>4</b></td>
<td>The last name to be associated with the <code>president</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>We see that a transaction has been received by our locally running Crux node. Now lets retrieve the entity:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="curl">curl -X GET \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     http://localhost:3000/_crux/entity\?eid=president <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><i data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td>
<td>GET the entity by the same ID we used above</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>We see that the data we just put in the database is successfully showing up at the ID <code>president</code>.</p>
<p>Joe Biden hasn’t always been the president of the United States.</p>
<p>With Crux, we can add data to the past (or the future) by passing a 'valid time' along with the document. Notice that we are using the same ID as before, something that wouldn’t work in a traditional database.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="curl">curl -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     -d '{"tx-ops": [
           ["put", {
                "crux.db/id": "president", <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b>
                "name": "Donald",
                "last-name": "Trump"
            }, "2017-01-20"] <i data-value="2"></i><b>(2)</b>
         ]}' \
     http://localhost:3000/_crux/submit-tx</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><i data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td>
<td>The same ID as our first <code>put</code> operation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i data-value="2"></i><b>2</b></td>
<td>The valid time for the document being added</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>The above <code>put</code> operation places Donald Trump at the ID <code>president</code> from a valid date of <code>2017-01-20</code>, his inauguration date.</p>
<p>Now lets retrieve the <code>president</code> entity again:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="curl">curl -X GET \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     http://localhost:3000/_crux/entity\?eid=president</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>We get the same result - Joe Biden!</p>
<p>The GET request of <code>/entity</code> returns the data that is currently valid for the ID <code>president</code>.</p>
<p>This is the first example of the power of a temporal database. We are able to ingest data to provide a better history of data should we want to look back.</p>
<p>To retrieve the Donald Trump document we just added, we can pass a valid time with our GET request:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="curl">curl -X GET \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     http://localhost:3000/_crux/entity\?eid=president\&amp;valid-time=2020-10-10 <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><i data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td>
<td>We pass a valid time of <code>2020-10-10</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>The above operation allows us to find out who the president was on the date passed. Crux will return Donald Trump for any date between <code>2017-01-20</code> and the valid time on the Joe Biden document.</p>
<p>We can see all of our transactions by passing some more arguments to the same <code>/entity</code> endpoint:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="curl">curl -X GET \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     http://localhost:3000/_crux/entity\?eid=president\&amp;history=true\&amp;sortOrder=desc\&amp;withDocs=true <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><i data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td>
<td><code>history=true</code> returns all historical documents for this entity</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>If you look closely at the Joe Biden document, the <code>validTime</code> is equal to today’s date. This is because we did not explicitly provide a 'valid time' with our initial <code>put</code>. By default, Crux assumes <code>validTime</code> is equal to the current date-time unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>Let’s correct the entry for Joe Biden by passing the correct 'valid time':</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="curl">curl -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     -d '{"tx-ops": [
           ["put", {
                "crux.db/id": "president",
                "name": "Joe",
                "last-name": "Biden"
            }, "2021-01-20"] <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b>
         ]}' \
     http://localhost:3000/_crux/submit-tx</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><i data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td>
<td>Again, <code>"2021-01-20"</code> is our explicit 'valid time' parameter.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>We now have a historically accurate dataset for the last two presidents of the United States that we can query over a temporal plane! You can run the history query again to validate our correction.</p>
<p>Using Crux, we can do powerful queries over the temporal plane and retrieve data as if we had travelled back in time.<sup>[<a id="_footnoteref_1" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup> Crux achieves this by maintaining an immutable (write-only) transaction log. This makes Crux a powerful asset where auditing is important or when looking back at historical data is valuable. Better still, Crux can build on top of many different DB solutions allowing you to retain the infrastructure you already know and love!</p>
<p>In this guide, we used 3 operations: storing documents with <code>submit-tx</code>, retrieving documents with <code>entity</code>, and retrieving document histories with <code>history=true</code>. The complete set of 18 REST operations, including RESTful <a href="https://opencrux.com/reference/http.html#post-query">Datalog queries</a>, are explained in the <a href="https://opencrux.com/reference/http.html#rest-api">Crux REST API documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Crux also supports a number of other protocols and features:</p>

<p>Now that you’ve dipped your toes in the temporal data waters, we encourage you to experiment with the more advanced features of Crux!</p>

    <h2 id="hn-hijacks-your-brain">HN hijacks your brain</h2>
<p>You're an engineer who looks at Hacker News 2-5 times a day. HN is a good way to <em>fill the gaps</em> in time. You scan the front page- repeatedly- for links of interest... reading titles, eyeing scores... often jumping directly to the (overtly contrarian) comments to see if a link is even worth the energy.</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>That cycle hits a sickening <strong>5</strong>/10 of Tristan Harris's <a href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/how-technology-hijacks-peoples-minds-from-a-magician-and-google-s-design-ethicist-56d62ef5edf3">list of mind hijacks</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1)  Control the Menu, Control the Choices</li>
<li>(3)  Fear of missing something important</li>
<li>(4)  Social Approval (upvotes)</li>
<li>(6)  Bottomless bowl</li>
<li>(10) Forecasting</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>These hijacks  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">aren't</a> intentional, they're just a byproduct of link aggregation platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stoics are turning in their graves, where instead of knowing what's important, the links on HN <em>become</em> what's important, no matter how trivial, pedantic, hyped, or irrelevant.</p>
<p>So if you want help breaking this negative feedback loop, I encourage you to reclaim your attention by turning HN into and RSS feed;</p>
<p>Get more <a href="https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13">done</a>. Ignore the comments and the <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/">mooks</a>. Set limits. It's incredibly liberating to finish your RSS feed and think to yourself, <em>now what</em>?</p>

<p>Declaring what deserves your attention is the defining feature of RSS, so it's important to declare what aspect of HN you like. Generally people look at high scores. Fortunately HN already has a url specifically for its most "important" (i.e. upvoted) links: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/best"><code>/best</code></a>.</p>
<p>So if we can subscribe to the links from that page, we'll get the bulk of the links that deserve our attention.</p>
<p>For me, it's critically important for RSS to be a self-hosted solution. No third parties <small>(I'm looking at <em>you</em>, Feedly)</small>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, what's the point of retaking control, you're just shunting control to yet another third party.</p>
<p>My personal setup goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the Raspberry Pi you bought but never used</li>
<li>Install Docker</li>
<li>Run FreshRSS</li>
<li>Add HN <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/best"><code>/best</code></a> as an RSS feed</li>
<li>(Optional) Port forwarding and DNS setup</li>
<li>(Optional) Pick out a smartphone app to sync with</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just the first thing that worked for me, so by no means is it the guaranteed best. Recommendations and alternatives are welcome! You can, of course, tailor the following guide if you'd like to use a VPS.</p>

<h3 id="prepare-the-pi">Prepare the Pi</h3>
<h4 id="install-git">Install git</h4>
<p>Do a standard Raspbian setup the with <a href="https://soapstone.mradford.com/raspberry-pi-automatic-wifi-and-ssh">internet/ssh/hostname</a>. Then install git:</p>
<pre><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get install git
</span></pre><h4 id="install-docker">Install Docker</h4>
<pre><span>curl -sSL</span><span> https://get.docker.com | </span><span>sh
</span></pre><pre><span>sudo</span><span> usermod</span><span> -aG</span><span> docker pi &amp;&amp; </span><span>sudo</span><span> reboot
</span></pre><h4 id="install-docker-compose">Install Docker-compose</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>This method is specifically for Raspbian, if you're using a VPS or non-ARM machine, install docker-compose the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">conventional</a> way.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get install</span><span> -y</span><span> libffi-dev libssl-dev
</span><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get install</span><span> -y</span><span> python3 python3-pip
</span><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get remove python-configparser
</span><span>sudo</span><span> pip3 install docker-compose
</span></pre>
<pre><span>git</span><span> clone https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS

cd FreshRSS/Docker
</span></pre>
<p>We're using a Raspberry Pi, so you'll need to pick out the ARM image! Use your favorite editor to modify these lines of the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file:</p>
<pre><span># docker-compose.yml
</span><span>-    image: freshrss/freshrss:latest
</span><span>+    image: freshrss/freshrss:arm
</span></pre>
<p>Now you're ready to execute FreshRSS:</p>
<pre><span>docker-compose</span><span> up</span><span> -d
</span></pre>
<p>Once that's complete, head to your Pi's IP address (or hostname, if you opted for that) on port <code>8080</code> in your laptop's/desktop's browser (something like http://1.2.3.4:8080), and go through the initial setup.</p>

<p>Add <code>https://hnrss.org/best</code> as an RSS feed (from <a href="https://hnrss.github.io/">hnrss.github.io</a>).</p>
<p>Congratulations! You've officially RSS-ified HN!</p>
<h3 id="optional-port-forwarding-and-dns-setup">(Optional) Port forwarding and DNS setup</h3>
<p>Unless you went with the VPS route, you're probably behind a LAN, so if you want to access your RSS outside your LAN, you'll need to set up port forwarding and/or DNS. That's beyond the scope of this guide, but there are many guides online that can get you there.</p>
<h3 id="optional-pick-out-an-app">(Optional) Pick out an app</h3>
<p>You could just expose the pi to the internet, and read RSS directly from the browser, but I think having an app is a nice touch.</p>
<p>First you'll need to enable API access in FreshRSS. Go to <code>Authentication</code> and check the box to allow API access:</p>
<p><img src="https://soapstone.mradford.com/freshrss-auth.png" alt="fresh-rss-screenshot1"></p>
<p>Then create an API key under <code>Profile</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://soapstone.mradford.com/freshrss-profile.png" alt="fresh-rss-screenshot2"></p>
<p>Now you can use the API url and the API key in your selected app to pull data down locally. Nice!</p>
<p>Here's a non-exhaustive list of open-source (Android) apps to get you started.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/readrops/Readrops">Readrops</a> - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.readrops.app">play store</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/news-android">New Android</a> - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.luhmer.owncloudnewsreader&amp;pcampaignid=MKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1">play store</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nilsbraden/ttrss-reader-fork">ttrss-reader-fork</a> - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.ttrssreader">play store</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/fistons/TinyTinyFeed">TinyTinyFeed</a> - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.poopeeland.tinytinyfeed">play store</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Truth be told, a lot of the closed source RSS apps I've checked out tend to be slightly higher in quality, so if you're willing to compromise on that front then they are worth exploring.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-did-we-gain">What did we gain?</h2>
<p>It may not seem like it, but we've gained a <strong>lot</strong> by doing this!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defeated the mind hijacks</strong>:

<li><strike>(3)</strike> Declared which things are important up front, and view them only <em>once</em></li>
<li><strike>(4)</strike> Ignore comments. Scores only matter in that they are relatively high</li>
<li><strike>(6)</strike> Created a bottom (of the bowl) by grabbing a limited number of links</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><a href="https://etcd.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">etcd</a> is a distributed key-value store designed to be a highly available and strongly consistent data store for distributed systems. In fact, by default Kubernetes itself uses etcd to store all of its cluster data, such as configs and metadata.</p><p>As with designing any system, different architectural decisions lead to different tradeoffs that impact the optimal way a system should be used and operated. In this blogpost, we discuss the inner workings of etcd to help draw conclusions for how you can best use this key-value store in your own application.</p><ol><li>The stability of etcd's Raft cluster is sensitive to network and disk IO. Add robust handling in clients (such as retries) for possible downtime, when the cluster has lost its leadership.</li><li>Carefully tune the number of nodes in your cluster to account for failure tolerance and network utilization.</li><li>If running a large datastore that can't fit into memory, try to run etcd with SSDs to help with reads and general disk latency.</li><li>Range reads will be most efficient if you tend to write and read the same pieces of information together.</li><li>Frequent compactions are essential to maintaining etcd's memory and disk usage.</li><li>For applications with workloads where keys are frequently updated, defrags should be run to free up unneeded space to disk.</li></ol><p>etcd is a key-value store built to serve data for highly distributed systems. Building an understanding of how etcd is designed to support this use-case can help reason through its best use. To do so, we will explore how etcd provides availability and consistency, and how it stores data internally. Design decisions, such as the consensus algorithm chosen for guaranteeing consistency, can heavily influence the system’s operation. Meanwhile, the underlying structure of the datastore can impact how the data is optimally accessed and managed. With these considerations in mind, etcd can serve as a reliable store for even the most critical data in your system. </p><p>In order to provide high availability, etcd is run as a cluster of replicated nodes. To ensure data consistency across these nodes, etcd uses a popular consensus algorithm called <a href="https://raft.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raft</a>. In Raft, one node is elected as leader, while the remaining nodes are designated as followers. The leader is responsible for maintaining the current state of the system and ensuring that the followers are up-to-date.</p><p>More specifically, the leader node has the following responsibilities: (1) maintaining leadership and (2) log replication.</p><h3>Maintaining Leadership</h3><p>The leader node must periodically send a heartbeat to all followers to notify them that it is still alive and active. If the followers have not received a heartbeat after a configurable timeout, a new leader election is initiated. During this process, the system will be unavailable, as a leader is necessary to enforce the current state.</p><p>By effect, the etcd cluster's stability is very sensitive to network and disk IO. This means that etcd's stability is susceptible to heavy workloads, both from itself and other applications running in the environment. <b><u>It is recommended clients use robust handling, such as retries, to account for the possibility of lost leadership.</u></b></p><h3>Log Replication</h3><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/2d03b6eda524ead98d5a6daf0f426dc9/logreplication.png"><figcaption>Screenshot from raft.github.io's helpful Raft Visualization, which demonstrates how Log Replication works. In this screenshot, S2 is the leader and broadcasting the log entries to all followers.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The leader node is responsible for handling incoming write transactions from the client. The write operation is written to a Raft log entry, which the leader broadcasts to the followers to ensure consistency across all nodes. Once a majority of the followers have successfully acknowledged and applied the Raft log entry, the leader considers the transaction as committed. If at any point the leader is unable to receive acknowledgement from the <em>majority</em> of followers, (for instance, if some node(s) fail), then the transaction cannot be committed and the write fails.</p><p>As a result, if the leader is unable to reach a majority, the cluster is declared to have "lost quorum" and no transactions can be made until it has recovered. This is why you should <b><u>carefully tune the number of etcd nodes in your cluster</u></b> to reduce the chance of lost quorum.</p><p>A good rule of thumb is to select an odd number of nodes. This is because adding an additional node to an odd number of nodes does not help increase the failure tolerance. Consider the following table, where the failure tolerance is the number of nodes that can fail without the cluster losing quorum:</p><div><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Cluster Size</th><th scope="col">Majority</th><th scope="col">Failure Tolerance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>4</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>4</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Table borrowed from <a href="https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4.0/faq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4.0/faq/</a>, showing that a cluster’s failure tolerance does not increase for a cluster of size N when compared to a cluster of size N-1, where N is even.</p></div><p>This helps visualize that a cluster of size 4 has the same failure tolerance as a cluster size of 3. Increasing the number of nodes will also result in an increase in network utilization, as the leader must send all log entries to every node. So, in the case of choosing an etcd cluster with 3 vs 4 nodes, 3 nodes will give you the same failure tolerance with less network utilization.</p><p>Now that we understand how etcd maintains high availability and consistency, let's discuss how data is actually stored in the system.</p><h3>BoltDB</h3><p>etcd's datastore is built on top of <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BoltDB</a>, or more specifically, <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBoltDB</a>, a fork of BoltDB maintained by the etcd contributors.</p><p>Bolt is a Go key-value store which writes its data to a single memory-mapped file. This means that the underlying operating system is responsible for handling how the data is cached, typically caching as much of the file in memory as possible. Thus, Bolt shows high memory usage when working with large datasets. However, assuming that the relevant page is in the cache, this method allows for fast reads.</p><p>Bolt's underlying data structure is a B+ tree consisting of 4KB pages that are allocated as needed. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B+ tree</a> structure helps with quick reads and sequential writes. However, Bolt does not perform as well on random writes, since the writes might be made to different pages on disk.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/0b9d9a6c879fc3a79ef726a9a37019e8/bplustree.svg"><figcaption>Bolt stores its data in a B+ tree, a structure that helps with quick reads and sequential writes. Highlighted in green is the path taken to find the data with 4 as the key.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Bolt operations are copy-on-write. When a page is updated, it is copied to a completely new page. The old page is added to a "freelist", which Bolt refers to when it needs a new page. This means that deleting large amounts of data will not actually free up space on disk, as the pages are instead kept on Bolt's freelist for future use. In order to free up this space to disk, you will need to perform a defrag, which we'll discuss later in this post.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/fb222f0306d31ddb48305545eb1d5b07/freelist.png"><figcaption>When data is deleted from Bolt, unused pages are not released back to disk, but kept in Bolt’s freelist for future use.</figcaption></figure></div><h3>etcd's Data Model</h3><p>etcd uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MultiVersion Concurrency Control</a> in order to safely handle concurrent operations. This goes hand-in-hand with the Raft protocol, as each version in MVCC corresponds to an index in the Raft log. To handle MVCC, etcd tracks changes by revisions. Each transaction made to etcd is a new revision. For example, if you were to load up a fresh instance of etcd and ran the following operations, the revision state would look like so:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>By keeping a history of the revisions, etcd is able to provide the version history for specific keys. In the example above, you would just need to read Revisions 4 and 2 in order to see that the current value of <code>foo</code> is <code>updatedBar</code>, and the previous value was <code>bar</code>.</p><p>This means that keys must be associated with their revision numbers, along with their new values. To do so, etcd stores each operation in Bolt as the following key-value pairs:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>Here, <code>rev</code> is the revision, <code>sub</code> is a number used to differentiate keys within a single revision (for example, multiple PUTs in a transaction), and <code>type</code> is an optional suffix, usually used for tombstoning. </p><p>For example, if you ran <code>put foo hello</code> following the above example, the corresponding Bolt entry might look like:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>By writing the keys in this scheme, etcd is able to make all writes sequential, circumventing Bolt's weakness to random writes.</p><p>However, this makes reading keys a little more difficult. For example, to find the current value of <code>foo</code>, you would have to read each entry starting from the latest revision, until finding the revision containing the value for <code>foo</code>. </p><h3>etcd's Key Index</h3><p>To address the key reading problem described above, etcd builds an in-memory <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2012sp/recitations/rec25-B-trees/rec25.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B-tree</a> index which maps each key to its related revisions.</p><p>The actual keys and values of this tree are a little more complex, but the information it provides can most simply be reduced to:</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/db2005cf0e02132e8bddab05f5d4c246/b-tree.svg"><figcaption>A simplified example of etcd’s key index, which maps the keys to their revisions. Highlighted is the path taken to find 'foo3' in the tree.</figcaption></figure></div><p>This index says that <code>foo</code> was updated in revision 4, sub 0, and revision 2, sub 0. <code>foo1</code> was updated in revision 3, sub 0, and so on. Using this information, you can easily find the current value of <code>foo</code>, along with its previous values, in Bolt.</p><p>etcd also supports range reads: "get me the values for <code>foo1</code> to <code>foo3</code>" or "find me all keys and values prefixed with <code>foo</code>". Although these keys are logically sequential, they are not stored in Bolt as so. Performing the range read will require using the key index to find the keys that fall within the range, and then finding their associated revisions in Bolt. Given that these keys could have been written at any revision, these would essentially be random reads on Bolt. Efficiency for this operation heavily relies on the hope that most of Bolt's file is in the cache. If your datastore is large, chances are that the relevant pages will need to be read from disk. <b><u>If you have a large dataset, run etcd with SSDs, as they are much faster than spinning disk.</u></b></p><p>If anything, <b><u>range reads will be slightly more efficient if you tend to read and write the same pieces of information together.</u></b> For example, if you …</p></div></div></div></div>

		<div>

			
<h4>Less than half a decade ago, if you had walked up to someone in the industry and said that in 5 years’ time AMD would have the fastest CPUs, you would have been laughed straight out of the room—but here we are. <p>At the time of writing, AMD <em>does</em> have the fastest CPUs on the market with Zen 3, so let’s see where AMD is heading in the future.</p></h4>



<h2>The Ugly Past</h2>



<p>It’s not a controversial statement for me to say that the Bulldozer family of CPUs was a failure. Not just a commercial failure in a period that eventually saw AMD nearing bankruptcy, but also a technical failure. There are however parts of the Bulldozer core that are good such as the FPU and branch predictor unit. Weaknesses in its shared front-end and poor cache/memory systems meant a 4-module Bulldozer CPU lost to a 4-core Sandy Bridge CPU in most workloads, despite the higher clocks. Insult to injury for AMD was the the fact that a 4-module Bulldozer CPU also consumed more power than a 4-core Sandy Bridge CPU while being slower—in short the architecture was almost universally panned.</p>



<div><p>However, the failure of Bulldozer was not all because of poor CPU design. A lot of Bulldozer’s failures can be traced to its underperforming 32nm node from what was AMD at the time, before its fabs were spun off into Global Foundries. Broadly, the original design goals for Bulldozer were 33% clock speed lift over Phenom on the same 45nm node with no IPC decrease and a release date in 2009. As history shows, this did not happen and so nearly two years later in October 2011, Bulldozer became the product we all know it as: late, hot and slow. </p><p>Thankfully for AMD, when the original Zen architecture released in Q1 2017 it finally showed they weren’t out of the CPU game. Zen 1 had an extremely bullish <strong>40% IPC </strong>increase design goal over Excavator and ultimately delivered an <strong>unheard of 52%</strong> <strong>IPC gain</strong>. AMD was back. Following up with Zen 2 and Zen 3, though they were not the same monstrous uplifts as Zen 1, they represented a respectful 15% and 19% IPC gain over their predecessors respectively. But y’all know that already, so let’s talk about the future of AMD’s CPUs.</p></div>



<h2>A Bright Future</h2>



<p>AMD looks poised for even more continued success with Ryzen, assuming of course that the information and sources that both I and the rest of Chips and Cheese’s staff have access to are accurate. Please take all the following information in this section with the usual cautionary dose of salt. While both the Chips and Cheese team and I have full belief that this information is accurate, that does not mean that this is 100% confirmed and you should not take this as unsalable truth. With this disclaimer out of the way, on to the juicy bits: Zen 3+, Zen 4 and even Zen 5.</p>



<h3>AM5 &amp; DDR5 – New IOD and Future Nodes</h3>



<p>Zen 3+ looks to be a small IPC gain on base Zen 3, having been told “It’s more than Zen+ was [over Zen 1] but not much” which I interpret to mean around a 4 to 7% IPC gain along with customary clock gains moving to the smaller N6 node from TSMC. N6 is a variant of N7 using 5 layers of EUV and is not a true “new node”, more of a refinement. However, the most interesting thing to me is that Zen 3+ on desktop may be the first AM5 CPU. I was told that the IO die for Zen 3+ desktop is using “Not quite [the same] IOD as Zen 4 but uses Zen 4 IP” which I take to mean that it will be using DDR5 and it will be on the same node as Zen 4’s IOD. That’s all I have on Zen 3+, so now on to Zen 4.</p>



<p>Zen 4 is what a lot of people are waiting for, and, if the info I have is accurate, that wait will prove to be even more worth it. It is important to note that the one common thread in all Zen 4 chatter I have heard is resounding positivity. From IPC gains over 25%, a total performance gain of 40%, and even possibly (finally) 5GHz all-core thanks to the new (full node) N5 fabrication at TSMC! Now, I can’t say what is true and what is an over-exaggeration, however I was told from a trusted source that a <strong>Genoa</strong> engineering sample (Zen 4 server chip) was <strong>29% faster</strong> than a Milan (Zen 3) chip with the same core config at <strong>the</strong> <strong>same clocks</strong>. Factor this in with what I have heard about the possible clock gains that N5 will enable over N7 and Zen 4 sounds like it is going to be a <strong>monster</strong> of a CPU.</p>



<p>Now I said I had Zen 5 info, unfortunately this comes from a different, less-proven source than my Zen 4 info, however they have said that the jump [to Zen 5 from 4] from will be about as much as <strong>Piledriver to Zen 1 design goal, which if you recall to earlier in this article was 40%</strong>. I was told from a 3rd source that Zen 5’s original design goal was 2.5 to 3 times the IPC of Zen 1 which roughly lines up with the perspective of a “Piledriver to Zen 1”-like jump.</p>



<h2>Looking Forward… AMD’s Problem is Success</h2>



<p>If this info is all true, then that puts AMD in a very good position from a performance standpoint. However, the biggest problem for AMD of late hasn’t been one of performance but of wafer supply. With Apple moving off of Intel CPUs and onto their own silicon for (gradually) their entire lineup, the supply of N5 wafers from TSMC for AMD will be less than if Apple had stuck with Intel. Being that AMD is always 2nd in line for new nodes at TSMC behind Apple, this may be a cause for concern moving forward. </p>



<h3>Bright Spot: Consoles Out of the Picture with TSMC N5</h3>



<div><p>However, perhaps an even bigger factor for availability on TSMC N5 will be that neither future AMD CPUs nor GPUs will need to compete with console chips as they will remain on N7. Couple this with the rumors that AMD GPUs are also going MCM with RDNA3, and it is possible that Zen 5 and RDNA 3 supply will be better than what we know of the current shortages for Zen 3. This is especially important for the GPU side seeing the current availability issues around RDNA2; the wafer allocation of which has been said to represent low-single digits of TSMC’s N7 supply.  This is all of course, wishful thinking. At this point in time, who knows.</p><p>One thing is certain however: AMD’s future looks bright.</p></div>



<h2>Author’s Note (2/8/21)</h2>



<p>There was a miscommunication between myself and the editor with regards to the performance claims of Zen 4. The only thing that we are claiming with any level of certainty is the claim of a Genoa ES sample being 29% faster then Milan at the same clocks.</p>



<p>We apologise for any confusion this may have caused.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
	
	
	
	<div>
		<h2 id="the-why">The Why</h2>
<p>What made me interested in Clojure was Datomic, I was dealing with a problem at my work and the Datomic idea of insert only with timestamp would easily solve it, I took it as inspiration and did something similar using PostgreSQL. While I was looking and learning about Datomic, I find out some Rich Rickey videos, some of them with Clojure, and well… he got me, I wanted to see all that immutability stuff, and also LISP, I don’t even remember reading much more than a paragraph of LISP at college. “Simple, made easy”.</p>
<p>Then I would be trying something completely different from what I was used to, in the worst case scenario I would be wasting some hours, but I already watched Game of Thrones last season, so I’m quite used to it.</p>
<h2 id="the-how">The How</h2>
<p>Well, at the official Clojure website you have this almost <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started">nothing</a> of documentation. It’s just a small introduction of the language. You pretty much have to buy a book or take a look at <a href="https://www.braveclojure.com/">Brave Clojure</a> free book, it’s truly great, you will have a better overview of the language. I was feeling great after finishing the book, Clojure, LISP, the possibility of writing (-&gt; Macros (never had to touch them (are they even KISS compliant?(wonder if people tried to do some smart things with it)))) such an elegant way of writing.</p>
<h2 id="the-try-to-do">The (Try To) Do</h2>
<p>So I had an idea of a little project for fun, so why not do it in Clojure?
It should be a back-end REST API, which would query and treat and save and transform some government open data with a separated front-end that would ask and display the data.<br>
Easy, I thought, Clojure is quite simple.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.giovanialtelino.com/a-year-clojure/clojure_wall.jpg" alt="the clojure wall"></p>
<p>Well, that wasn’t the case, I hitted a wall, took much longer than I expected, debugging was confusing, at best.
The little errors were annoying, and hard to track, messages were weird, documentation scarce too. I didn’t track the hours, but it took me way longer than I expected.</p>
<p>And the same happened on my second project, which had no front-end but a more complex back-end, the idea would be offer some covid data to be easily accessible to the Zulip Clojure group, but I took too much time and didn’t finished in time for them to use on their project. To be fair, I was quite stressed at the time, mostly due to the state of the world with Covid, and I didn’t work every single day on it.</p>
<p>In those projects I had to move a lot of maps between functions, I understand that Clojure dynamic typing offers the possibility to create maps to move stuff around on the fly, but I think that if they were static typed it would be much easier to have better control over them. I know there are specs to “filter” the data and I didn’t use them, so you can blame me.
I also don’t really see the appeal on specs, because you kinda create an model to follow, wouldn’t it break the dynamic typing idea and without the benefits of a static typed language?</p>
<p>Finally, the grand finale, my best project, my Hacker News clone.<br>
I had the excellent idea to throw a lot of stuff there, GraphQL, JWT, re-frame, Datomic, yep, Datomic with GraphQL. It was quite interesting to finally work with Datomic (remember, this is what brought me here).
But again, I had some issues, first I was using the wrong Datomic Client, that took some time for me to realize, it was also hard do debug the GraphQL queries, as much as the REST ones, and I hit another issue that you can’t query recursively nested items in Graphql, great, don’t remember reading about it in any GraphQL tutorial or introduction I read, re-frame was mostly easy though, I don’t have any complain about it.
This project even ended in the <a href="https://github.com/walmartlabs/lacinia/commit/c54e5a3665562c8e6cd76eda25357d1cd19c1320">Lacinia Official Wiki</a>, I just found out because I have Google Analytics and saw some direct access from Lacinia Docs,I use it just for my curiosity of how many have been here (oh, hello visitor).</p>
<h2 id="the-not-work">The (Not) Work</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/l9dx1j/stop_selling_clojure_as_just_a_learning_experience/">Some people</a> get annoyed that Clojure is recommended mostly as a learning exercise, while I’ve seen some job offers, I ended up failing at them.<br>
I’m in Brazil, Clojure here is mostly (if not only) Nubank, your experience may vary, but at Nubank I got rejected at the first step at the two times I tried, so there is pretty much no work for me locally. I wonder if it’s the lack of developers options, the hard learning curve, LISP, or something else, but no other company looks to be interested in Clojure here.</p>
<p>I ended up getting two, remote, interviews anyways, one due to my Hacker News project, a person called me on Reddit and we started to talk, that was quite nice, since I wasn’t even looking for a job at the time, but anyways, it didn’t work out. And another one in january 2021, which I was looking for. And well, I failed miserably in the technical test, which was quite shocking for myself.<br>
I had four hours to develop a project, and I managed to finish something like 20% of it, I really don’t remember falling any other test as bad as this one, again I had to move and deal with a lot of maps with data, and some file IO operations. I got quite curious if it was too hard, maybe I suck. <br>
But for the sake of my own curiosity, I decided to do the project again using C#, completed in three hours and a half with tests, using C# channels to process the data, which is slightly more complex and take some extra time, I wasn’t even using core.async in the Clojure one.</p>
<h2 id="the-trap-repl">The (Trap) Repl</h2>
<p>The REPL, one of the most loved Clojure tools, when I was doing Clojure development I used it a lot too, all the time, some people call this Repl Driven Development. Only after the test that I failed, and succeeded in C#, I realized, it may be a trap.<br>
It’s nice to prototype some small stuff in the REPL, but it is a waste of time to test and debug in the REPL, and I was testing in the REPL all the time, I was wasting a lot of time all this time without realizing it. Maybe I need more than 20 years of experience.<br>
I’m not even talking about the “real” TDD, that you write your tests before you write your code, I write most of my tests after I wrote my methods and functions, but write the tests in file, and run it with a simple a unique command, all the 10 or more of them, quickly, easily, done.<br>
Debug? Easy, simple, I can easily track back all my objects, and data, line by line.</p>
<p>While simple Clojure is indeed easy, the not so simple is too complex, it escalates too quickly.</p>
<h2 id="the-clojure-future">The Clojure Future</h2>
<p>Nubank bought Cognitec last year, and should inject some cash in Clojure, unless you are a banking competitor I would see it as good news (keep in mind that Rich is still the Clojure owner, so theoretically, even banks should be fine) it’s nice to have a big company behind your OSS, I know there is a lot of talk about “Clojure dying” but it’s hard to predict, as I said, your experience may and will vary, search your job market and most tech take a long time to die, anyways.</p>
<h2 id="the-experience-and-the-learning">The Experience And The Learning</h2>
<p>It was a nice experience, dealing recursively with immutable data with dynamic types.<br>
Now I find to be weird when I have to update a lot of objects after starting them, happily C# introduced Record, which are immutable objects, and I’m using it when possible. I also end more open minded about new languages or ideas, but still more pragmatic after the issues with the Repl.<br>
I believe that knowledge is never a waste, of course you could be doing something to earn you more money, but as long as it’s something that makes you happy and doesn’t hurt you in the long run, I’m fine with it.<br>
And at the end of the day, I would say I’ve become a better programmer, with broader knowledge, so it was worth it.</p>

<p>Well, it has been a nice ride. My Clojure journey has come to an end, at least for now.<br>
But it was a interesting experience, and I’m planning to look deeper in a new language yearly, just for the knowledge, I just haven’t decided what I’ll be doing, I think I should go deeper with functional languages and look at Haskell or maybe F#.</p>

February 10, 2021 | https://muttdata.ai/blog/2020/08/21/a-poetic-apology.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://muttdata.ai/blog/2020/08/21/a-poetic-apology.html">archive.org</a>

      <div>
        <p>If you ever spent some time trying to write a Python application you have probably
experienced Python’s Infamous Dependency Hell at some point. You’ve probably also
gathered by now that it has become a folk tradition to start any piece about such subject
with the following notorious <a href="https://xkcd.com/1987/">xkcd comic</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://muttdata.ai/blog/img/posts/poetry_apology/xkcd.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Luckily for you (and all of us) at the time of writing, there are some good solutions to
the entanglement of pains brilliantly depicted in the image above. In fact, you most likely
already know that if you want to develop against multiple Python versions you can readily
use <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv">pyenv</a> to start unraveling your twisted environment.
You might have also learned that if you happen to be working at the same time on multiple
projects with conflicting dependencies then you can employ <em>virtual environments</em> to
isolate clashing libraries. In this document, we’ll introduce yet another tool,
<a href="https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry">Poetry</a>, and make an argument about why you
should probably add it to your own toolkit.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>Imagine one lonely night you decide to start a simple dummy Python project accurately
named <code>foo</code> with the following structure</p>

<div><div><pre><code>├── foo
│   ├── foo
│   │   ├── bar
│   │   │   └── data.py
│   │   └── constants.py
│   └── README.md
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since this is not your first Python project and you want to avoid spending more endless
nights fixing incompatibilities between your system and project modules, you diligently
initiate a virtual environment from your shell with</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> python <span>-m</span> venv ~/Desktop/venv/foo-venv
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and activate it within the newly created project with</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> <span>source</span> ~/Desktop/venv/foo-venv/bin/activate
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Equipped with an isolated environment, you triumphantly proceed to install the ubiquitous
Pandas data library. To achieve such thing you use Python’s de-facto package manager
<code>pip</code> and carefully pin the library version to ensure replicability</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install </span><span>pandas</span><span>==</span>0.25.3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since you are a bit lazy at doing exploratory data analysis, you also install the nifty
<code>pandas-profiling</code> module to help you with that tedious work</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install </span>pandas-profiling<span>==</span>2.5.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After all this flirting, you finally start coding (assuming that adding the
following lines to the <code>data.py</code> file can, in fact, be called that)</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>pandas</span> <span>as</span> <span>pd</span>
<span>from</span> <span>pandas_profiling</span> <span>import</span> <span>ProfileReport</span>
<span>df</span><span>=</span><span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>DataFrame</span><span>([[</span><span>'a'</span><span>,</span><span>1</span><span>],[</span><span>'b'</span><span>,</span><span>None</span><span>]],</span><span>columns</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>'category'</span><span>,</span> <span>'value'</span><span>])</span>
<span>df</span><span>[</span><span>'category'</span><span>]</span><span>=</span><span>df</span><span>[</span><span>'category'</span><span>].</span><span>astype</span><span>(</span><span>'category'</span><span>)</span>
<span>if</span> <span>__name__</span><span>==</span><span>'__main__'</span><span>:</span><span>ProfileReport</span><span>(</span><span>df</span><span>).</span><span>to_file</span><span>(</span><span>'foo.html'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Given that your days of abusing <code>print</code> statements for debugging purposes are long gone,
you install the beautiful and handy <a href="https://github.com/pdbpp/pdbpp">pdbpp</a> library to
check that these lines work as intended</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install </span><span>pdbpp</span><span>==</span>0.10.2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and run your code in <em>post mortem debugging mode</em> with <code>python -m pdb -cc data.py</code>.</p>

<p>Happy with the clean run, you now realize that in order to ship your voluptuous application
without falling into the “works on my machine” trap you need a way to collect all your
dependencies. A quick Google search will show you that pip’s <code>freeze</code> subcommand allows to
record the current environment package into a <code>requirements.txt</code> file by means of the
following incantation</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip freeze <span>&gt;</span> requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which lets anyone use your project by simply installing the needed dependencies with</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install</span> <span>-r</span> requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just as you are about to reveal your masterpiece project to the world, you become aware
that the improved debugging module is actually only used by you while developing. With the
idea of splitting the frozen requirements into separate production and development files,
you take a peek into the generated file only to discover that each and every
single sub-dependency of your application’s dependencies is listed therein and locked to a
specific version. Foreseeing the nightmare of maintaining this immense list you uninstall
the <code>pdbpp</code> library to ensure a clean requirements file again by means of</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip uninstall <span>-y</span> pdbpp <span>&amp;&amp;</span> pip freeze <span>&gt;</span> requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A quick glance at the modified requirements file, however, shows that things didn’t quite
turn out as expected: <code>pdbpp</code> was indeed removed but its dependencies, such as
<code>fancycompleter</code>, are still installed. Since this seems a dead-end, you choose to start
from scratch by manually creating a <code>requirements.txt</code> file with only production
dependencies</p>

<pre><code>pandas==0.25.3
pandas-profiling==2.5.0
</code></pre>

<p>and an equivalent development file, <code>requirements_dev.txt</code>, solely containing</p>

<pre><code>pdbpp==0.10.2
</code></pre>

<p>Impressed by the cleverness that has seemingly helped you dodge the dreaded Python
dependency hell by keeping a record of isolated top-level packages, you decide to call it a
day and give a final spin to your application the next day.</p>

<p>When you wake up in the morning, the news are all over the place: Pandas v1 is
finally out (after only twelve years!). A couple of hours procrastinating with the
incredibly long changelog makes you conclude that your complex foo-project
will surely gain notable improvements by updating to the brand new version. Now since
you’ve locked Pandas to an exact version, you cannot simply run</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install</span> <span>-U</span> <span>-r</span> requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Instead you must execute</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install </span><span>pandas</span><span>==</span>1.0.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which leads to a particularly bizarre and confusing situation: an error pops in your
terminal</p>

<pre><code>ERROR: pandas-profiling 2.5.0 has requirement pandas==0.25.3, but you'll have pandas 1.0.0 which is incompatible.
</code></pre>

<p>but the installation of <code>pandas 1.0.0</code> nonetheless takes place. Assuming this to be a warning
that <code>pip</code> mistakes for an error, you update your <code>requirements.txt</code> file accordingly and
joyfully proceed to run your <code>data.py</code> module one last time, only to discover that it throws
an enigmatic <code>TypeError</code>. Feeling now betrayed by pip’s apparent inability to resolve
dependencies, you rollback your changes and stick with Pandas’ (now) outdated version.</p>

<p>At this point, you seem to have a working project but i) you are unsure whether reverting
Pandas version might have broken the desired replicability of your application, ii) the
code could definitely look better and iii) after a good night’s sleep you acknowledge that
the overall functionality of your application is not as complex and rich as you thought it
was the night before. To address the first two issues, you first add the <code>black</code> formatter
to your <code>requirements_dev.txt</code></p>

<pre><code>black==19.10b0
</code></pre>

<p>and then within your project directory, you recreate your virtual environment with</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> <span>rm</span> <span>-rf</span> ~/Desktop/venv/foo-venv
<span>$&gt;</span> python <span>-m</span> venv ~/Desktop/venv/foo-venv
<span>$&gt;</span> <span>source</span> ~/Desktop/venv/foo-venv/bin/activate
<span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install</span> <span>-r</span> requirements_dev.txt
<span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install</span> <span>-r</span> requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now you run <code>black</code> in your project root (with <code>black .</code>) and are mostly satisfied with
the prettifying job it did but to abide by Mutt Data’s format style (which is coincidentally
consistent with your dislike of making every single quote a double quote), you add a
<code>pyproject.toml</code> telling <code>black</code> to skip such appalling string normalization default
setting</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[tool.black]</span>
<span>skip-string-normalization</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The code looks great now and a new post mortem debugging run shows that things seem to work
fine in the new (replicable) environment. The only thing left to be done before deploying
the code on the server or sharing it with the world is to avoid having constants, such as
the report name, hardcoded all around the code. You thus
decide to add the following lines to your <code>constants.py</code> empty module</p>



<p>and modify the <code>data.py</code> to import such constant from the relative parent file with</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>..constants</span> <span>import</span> <span>REPORT_FILE</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A new <code>data.py</code> run however now, unfortunately, shows the next error</p>

<pre><code>ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package
</code></pre>

<p>which according to the omniscient SO makes sense since Python relative imports only work
within a package and therefore if you want to import from a parent directory you should
either create such package or hack the <code>sys.path</code>. As a true purist pythonista, you pick
the former path and create a <code>setup.py</code> with the following contents</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>setuptools</span> <span>import</span> <span>setup</span>

<span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'requirements.txt'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span>
    <span>install_requires</span> <span>=</span> <span>f</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>().</span><span>splitlines</span><span>()</span>
<span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'requirements_dev.txt'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span>
    <span>extras_dev_requires</span> <span>=</span> <span>f</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>().</span><span>splitlines</span><span>()</span>

<span>setup</span><span>(</span>
    <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>'foo'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>version</span><span>=</span><span>'0.0.1'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>author</span><span>=</span><span>'Mutt'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>author_email</span><span>=</span><span>'info@muttdata.ai'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>install_requires</span><span>=</span><span>install_requires</span><span>,</span>
    <span>extras_require</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>'dev'</span><span>:</span> <span>extras_dev_requires</span><span>},</span>
    <span>packages</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>'foo'</span><span>],</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now in a brand new virtual env you install your package in editable mode with <code>pip install
-e .[dev]</code>, change the import line in <code>data.py</code> to account for the package structure</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>foo.constants</span> <span>import</span> <span>REPORT_FILE</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and cross your fingers hoping everything finally works…</p>

<p>Everything does indeed (brittlely) work, but somehow all the hoop-jumping to make it
function makes you uneasy. A brief introspection reveals several reasons for the wave of
apprehension:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Since you plan to work on multiples Python projects at the same time, isolation is a
fundamental piece of your workflow. Virtual environments do solve this problem, but
the activate/deactivate process is cumbersome and easy to forget.</li>
  <li>Having dependencies isolated between projects doesn’t address dependency clash within a
project. Proper dependency resolution is the top required feature of any package
manager worthy of respect yet <code>pip</code> will only get such feature by October 2020.
Manually guaranteeing dependency consistency in complex projects is a deadlock.</li>
  <li>If you want to install your application/project as a package, you must go through the
overhead of adding a <code>setup.py</code> on top of your already multiple requirements files.
However, you’ve read PEPs 517-518 and want to try out the simpler and safer build
mechanisms mentioned therein.</li>
  <li>You thought about trying your application on a different machine, but realized it ran
Python 3.7 while your local box runs 3.8. To use <code>pyenv</code> with your isolated virtual
envs, you need an extra plugin,
<a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv">pyenv-virtualenv</a>, which makes managing
venvs even more burdensome.</li>
  <li>You briefly played with <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pipenv">Pipenv</a> which promised to
bring …</li></ol></div></div></div>

Shopify has its own portion of false retailers and fraudulent activity. Here is how to stay safe when using Shopify</strong>.</p>
<p>Ecommerce platforms made it possible for small businesses to have a wider market and reach customers beyond their location and borders through their online stores. At the same time, it made it possible for shoppers to find all sorts of new products with well-organized dropshipping and ease of use that the Shopify platform, eBay, Amazon, and other ecommerce websites offer.</p>
<p>But there are two signs to every coin. The bad news is that store owners and shoppers canâ€™t always escape fraudsters on these platforms. The good news is that <strong>e-commerce platforms have thorough vetting systems and a vast community that shares reviews</strong>, so itâ€™s easy to know the schemes and patterns of ecommerce stores that scam people.</p>
<p>In this article, weâ€™ll focus mainly on Shopify scams. To learn more about the platformâ€™s ins and outs, check out this guide on <a href="https://www.manypixels.co/blog/post/wix-vs-shopify">Shopify vs Wix</a>, as well as this <a href="https://www.manypixels.co/blog/post/shopify-payments">detailed article on Shopify Payments</a>. Now, letâ€™s dig in into Shopify Store scams.</p>
</div><div id="types-of-scams-on-shopify"><h2>Types of scams on Shopify</h2>
<p>In the last year, Shopify <a href="https://www.modernretail.co/platforms/shopify-positions-itself-as-the-coronavirus-and-beyond-platform/">became the most popular ecommerce platform</a> for both shoppers and retailers to keep their business afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic. It unveiled many features and updates to help users have a better experience, from <strong>better algorithms</strong> to a <strong>longer trial period</strong> and <strong>know how resources for new users</strong>. Naturally, this also seemed to attract more fraudsters.</p>
<p>Here are some of the more efficient schemes you should know about.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/tsrsH8jBRLQSSo2z0Syw" alt="la20.48 infographic.png"></p>
<h3>Triangulation scheme</h3>
<p>One of the smartest and most enduring schemes on Shopify and other ecommerce platforms is the so-called triangulation scheme.</p>
<p>Basically, fraudsters create an active Shopify store and market themselves as selling proper products. They then <strong>buy products from online suppliers, acting as the middleman</strong> in shipping the merchandise to the shoppersâ€™ addresses (which is exactly how dropshipping works).</p>
<p>But, hereâ€™s the catch: they buy the merchandise from the suppliers with previously stolen cards. The credit card company will <strong>reject the transaction and initiate a chargeback on Shopify</strong>. When a chargeback occurs, <strong>Shopify doesnâ€™t return the money to the seller, hence they lose both the product and the money</strong>.</p>
<p>The triangulation scheme was especially on the rise in 2016 when the Pokemon Go game came out. Lots of fake stores claimed to sell this game and managed to scam a lot of people.</p>
<h3>Shopify Store duplicator scheme</h3>
<p>The duplicator scheme is so simple, yet itâ€™s hard to believe people can pull it off. Basically, scammers find recently created Shopify Stores and <strong>create one with a similar domain name, claiming to sell the same original product</strong>. All sorts of products have been â€œmirroredâ€� on similar web addresses, from original merchandise t-shirts to branded teabags.</p>
<p>The most famous example of this scheme is when scammers created a duplicate store to Mike Lindellâ€™s MyPillow store with a domain name mypillow.com. In 2018, the merchant noticed a twin storefront to his, registered under the domain name mypillowstore.com. Lindell sued Shopify for failing to spot the scamming sites and bigcommerce trademark infringement.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Shopify took down the fake storefront and added more software tools that cost $30 and up and offer monthly maintenance for merchantsâ€™ transactions. They also have more tech teams dedicated to combing out the fake Shopify sites.</p>
<h3>Switching scheme</h3>
<p>This is one of the more serious schemes since it causes a long-term loss with sellers. It has been prevalent in e-commerce platforms such as eBay before. Basically, what happens is that <strong>a potential buyer will make a purchase on your Shopify store and request a direct invoice from you straight from PayPal</strong>. As a reason for this, they will say they have difficulty and canâ€™t finish a payment because of technical issues on the platform.</p>
<p>After you send them an invoice, <strong>you will get a notification that is allegedly from PayPal</strong>, but actually fake, <strong>that the buyer has paid and is waiting for the product tracking number</strong>. Until you give them the tracking number, <strong>â€œPayPalâ€� checkout has the funds on hold</strong>. Naturally, if a seller falls for the trick, the scammer will get the products for free, since there is no PayPal holding the funds. If weâ€™re talking about a big shipment or a very expensive product, as a seller, you could lose a lot of money.</p>
<h3>Direct Client scheme</h3>
<p>This scam takes some sweet-talking scammers. Basically, a buyer makes a purchase that goes well, and the products are at the right shipping address on time. Then, when <strong>the seller gains the buyerâ€™s trust</strong>, they make a suggestion that next time they should skip the whole hassle and extra costs on Shopify, and <strong>go straight to a direct card payment technique</strong>. Of course, then they have the credit card digits and data, so they can exhaust the buyerâ€™s fund. The buyer, needless to say, doesnâ€™t get the goods this time.</p>
<h3>Fake return ticket</h3>
<p>Yet another slow-burning, but effective method of scamming is the counterfeited return ticket fraud. In this scenario, a buyer purchases goods once. Then they decide to purchase a <strong>similar, but a slightly cheaper product</strong>. <strong>They request a return on the first purchase</strong>, citing the product that was received looks different from the pictures or there is something wrong with it. Then, <strong>they return the second, similar but cheaper product</strong>, which enables them to get the money for the first product back and also keep the good and more expensive product.</p>
<h3>Fake Purchase order</h3>
<p>This is the <strong>scam that requires the most technical knowledge and software skills</strong> to be performed. So itâ€™s rarer but extremely effective, and youâ€™d still need to be wary.  Basically, a scammer that is in the position of a customer will <strong>create a copy of the sellerâ€™s Shopify checkout sheet</strong> in their drive <strong>and alter the submit button link</strong>. Then, they will patch it to their  PHP software or program that enables saving all data saved from your checkout. Afterward, they will modify the data they received and adjust it to send the fake checkout sheet back, at a lower price. You wonâ€™t notice the difference in price without knowing itâ€™s doctored, and approve the transaction.</p>
<p>This scam allows the fraudsters to <strong>get products without the sellerâ€™s consent or with it but for a smaller price</strong>, and before the seller realizes that something is going on they can lose a whole shipmentâ€™s worth of money.</p>
<p>If they donâ€™t successfully doctor the purchase sheet, they have a good plan B: asking for a chargeback, which will still make the seller lose money.</p>
</div><div id="how-to-report-scams"><h2>How to report scams</h2>
<p>As a customer, you can report fraudulent activity or bad experience with a merchant here. The list covers many situations, <strong>from non-delivery of a sold item to restricted items and illegal activity</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/hEpxaGdTRRmNYcmAehnn" alt="report an issue shopify.png"></p>
<p>However, if youâ€™re on the other side of the selling process and being scammed by a customer, apart from having a premium Shopify web store with all maintenance services, itâ€™s mostly up to you to stay careful.</p>
<p>Choosing a secure payment gateway and having a single place for all your transactions with Shopify payments is helpful.</p>
<p>Also, itâ€™s safe to save proof of your transactions, by making screenshots of your communication and transactions that you can later use to prove your case when reporting scams.</p>
<p>Lastly, itâ€™s fair to mention that <strong>Shopify</strong>, no matter the many measures they take with battling scammers, <strong>is still swarming with fraudulent activity</strong>.

Label your data wrong, and your model learns the wrong insights about the world. It may seem simple to get properly labeled data, but anyone who’s spent even a little time in data science knows that good data is hard to come by. There are dozens of things that can go wrong, from loose labels, incorrectly formatted data, outliers, and more.</p><p id="3676">Labeling data is hard to get right. The seemingly trivial task to “draw bounding boxes around the animals” can have numerous outcomes, depending on the human performing the task.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2302/1*hZZbrVMbRJYRQdGe2fZ0IA.jpeg" width="1151" height="255" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*hZZbrVMbRJYRQdGe2fZ0IA.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*hZZbrVMbRJYRQdGe2fZ0IA.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*hZZbrVMbRJYRQdGe2fZ0IA.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*hZZbrVMbRJYRQdGe2fZ0IA.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*hZZbrVMbRJYRQdGe2fZ0IA.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>(Left) One bounding box around the animals. (Middle) One box around the entire dog and a nested box around the cat. (Right) A box around the dog’s face and a separate box around the cat. (Source: Author and European Wilderness Society)</figcaption></figure><p id="0a96">Even experts might disagree on how data <em>should</em> be labeled due to a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359178" rel="noopener nofollow">variety of factors</a>. These difficulties make curating data one of the most expensive and time consuming stages in ML development. Guidelines need to be clearly defined and constantly redefined to build a highly accurate, production machine learning model.</p><p id="6a1f">It takes time to apply our human expertise and understanding of the world to individual data points. Every label captures our understanding at the time of labeling. Every action is a product of the data points we’ve seen before. The more we see, the more we understand the landscape of our data.</p><p id="72e3">Our understanding changes over time, and the dynamic nature of our data affects how we need to manage it. In order for our datasets to be reliable and trustworthy, we need to version them, iterate on them, and evaluate the effects of our changes on our model’s predictions.</p><p id="e5d6">For such a crucial step in the machine learning loop, we have very few tools and platforms that focus exclusively on data labeling and data management. Even fewer are open source.</p><p id="5b5f">Worst of all, none of them seem to have strong data versioning and data lineage baked into them. That means mistakes are much harder to correct, and as we’ve already seen that mistakes are virtually inevitable in labeling pipelines. You need a quick way to go back in time and correct mistakes or branch off to try a new strategy for getting those tricky labeling tasks right.</p><p id="4330">That’s why in this blog I’m going to help you bring together two powerful open source machine learning platforms to help you get your labeling right. In this article we’ll combine the labeling prowess of <a href="https://labelstud.io/" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Label Studio</strong></a> and the robust data versioning and lineage capabilities of <a href="https://pachdm.com/3a0uOfh" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Pachyderm</strong></a>.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1800/1*GA8XSpz_GlNdvADnUewb6w.gif" width="900" height="500" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*GA8XSpz_GlNdvADnUewb6w.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*GA8XSpz_GlNdvADnUewb6w.gif 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*GA8XSpz_GlNdvADnUewb6w.gif 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*GA8XSpz_GlNdvADnUewb6w.gif 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*GA8XSpz_GlNdvADnUewb6w.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Label Studio annotation examples (Source: Label Studio)</figcaption></figure><p id="bea5"><a href="https://labelstud.io/" rel="noopener nofollow">Label Studio</a> is an open source data labeling environment for image, audio, text, time series, and many other data types. It’s a self-contained web application that facilitates labeling and exploration of your data, and can even be extended for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning_(machine_learning)" rel="noopener nofollow">Active Learning</a> or <a href="https://labelstud.io/guide/ml.html" rel="noopener nofollow">Online Learning</a>.</p><p id="89fe">All you need to get started labeling and annotating your data is to set up a project in Label Studio.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1080/0*YB1_DnucvcQQs8N4.jpeg" width="540" height="614" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*YB1_DnucvcQQs8N4.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1080/0*YB1_DnucvcQQs8N4.jpeg 540w" sizes="540px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/52/0*YB1_DnucvcQQs8N4.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption>Pachyderm overview (Source: Pachyderm)</figcaption></figure><p id="01e1">Pachyderm is a data science and processing platform with built-in versioning and lineage. It gives you an immutable, copy-on-write file system that fronts on object stores like S3, which allows you to keep all changes to your data as they happen. It also keeps track of the journey of that data, recording a git-style commit with each transformation that allows you to roll out and roll back every single step of your data transformation from beginning to end.</p><p id="9293">What makes Pachyderm unique among all other ML platforms is that immutable file layer. It keeps every single change to your data. Other versioning systems are limited because they don’t enforce immutability, which can easily leave you in a bad state when your underlying data changes. Imagine you overwrote a bunch of your labeled images with new labels and didn’t save the originals. Now every single experiment that points to the original set of files can no longer be recreated. The commits point to a state that doesn’t exist. Pachyderm keeps every change and that means you can always roll back in time if you find an earlier version of your files was the one you really need to train your production model right.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3742/1*svuzd0SmpiEqHiNW9Jlcpw.jpeg" width="1871" height="883" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*svuzd0SmpiEqHiNW9Jlcpw.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*svuzd0SmpiEqHiNW9Jlcpw.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*svuzd0SmpiEqHiNW9Jlcpw.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*svuzd0SmpiEqHiNW9Jlcpw.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*svuzd0SmpiEqHiNW9Jlcpw.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Diagram of the label studio integration. Label Studio is using Pachyderm’s S3 gateway as the source and target locations for raw and labeled data respectively. (Source: Image by author)</figcaption></figure><p id="9561">Combining these two platforms is straightforward. We use Label Studio to interact with data that gets stored and versioned in Pachyderm. Pachyderm handles changes submitted to it from Label Studio, versioning them and running pipelines to kick off new training iterations in your machine learning loop.</p><p id="88bd"><strong>Label Studio</strong>’s<a href="https://labelstud.io/blog/release-070-cloud-storage-enablement.html" rel="noopener nofollow"> cloud storage interoperability</a> means that Label Studio can read data from and write labeled data to cloud storage. We can configure Label Studio to read source data from an Amazon S3 bucket, automatically pulling in new data to be labeled whenever it’s added to the bucket. We can also write our annotated data to a “target” S3 bucket, still retaining a reference to the original data.</p><p id="3d93"><strong>Pachyderm</strong> does many powerful things to manage and version data, while also providing a clean <a href="https://pachdm.com/2N35a0q" rel="noopener nofollow">S3 gateway</a>. This means we can treat Pachyderm as a cloud storage system. When we put files into Pachyderm’s “buckets” (versioned data repositories), we are actually committing files to be versioned. Versioned files ensure that if we delete or change a file in Pachyderm, the new state of the bucket reflects the change, while the old file still exists in a previous commit that can always be recovered.</p><p id="152d">Label Studio continually pulls new data from its source bucket, so whenever we commit data to our source repository in Pachyderm, Label Studio imports it as tasks to be labeled. After a task is completed (labeled), Label Studio writes the completion to our target bucket location, which commits the completion file to the target data repository.</p><p id="f83c">Later, If we decide to change a task’s label, Label Studio modifies the existing completion file. Pachyderm treats this change as a new commit to our labeled data repository, giving us a record of any changes that were made.</p><p id="9461">In a more mature use case, we would also use Pachyderm’s repository branches, so we can iterate on our data in a development branch without impacting pipelines that may depend on the master branch of our labeled data. This serves a highly useful purpose, allowing us to test a new version of our dataset before releasing/promoting it as the master version.</p><h2 id="3fbc">Run It Yourself</h2><p id="cfef">Find a full example of Label Studio configurations for Pachyderm in this <a href="https://pachdm.com/36U10iG" rel="noopener nofollow">GitHub repo</a>. The example configurations show you how to incorporate Label Studio for labeling text data for a sentiment classification task, but can easily be extended and configured for any labeling project. You can also add Pachyderm pipelines for pre-processing or even to <a href="https://pachdm.com/3jtyQ2M" rel="noopener nofollow">automate data ingestion</a>. The general setup requires:</p><p id="3b1d">1. Give Label Studio access to Pachyderm. Generate a Pachyderm security token (not necessary if running locally), configure the S3 gateway endpoint, and create an <a href="https://pachdm.com/3p1Aaey" rel="noopener nofollow">environment file</a> with the configuration. A sample .env file is shown below:</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Example .env file for configuring the Endpoint URL.</figcaption></figure><p id="58b8">2. Edit the source and target buckets in the Label Studio configuration to point to the Pachyderm versioned data repositories. The bucket names follow the convention <code>&lt;repo_branch&gt;.&lt;data_repo&gt;/&lt;file_name&gt;</code> . An example configuration is shown below.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Label Studio config with Pachyderm’s S3 backend.</figcaption></figure><p id="86d6">Data labeling and data versioning provide a rock solid bedrock to build your machine learning models on now and in the future. On their own, versioning and labeling are useful but when you bring them together, Label Studio and Pachyderm can dramatically increase the efficiency and dependability of the labeling cycle in your machine learning loop. That means better models, faster and more reliably and that’s what every data science team on the planet is pushing towards. The stronger their foundation, the more they can focus on making their models better rather than wrangling data.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-24326897=""><p data-v-24326897="">Instead of relying heavily on analytics, we collaborate with our community and read every piece of feedback to figure out what to build next. Here is what we've learned so far.</p><div data-v-24326897=""><!----><p><span data-v-24326897="">Published on</span><span data-v-24326897="">February 10, 2021</span></p></div></div><div><p>The first two pieces of advice you get after joining a YC batch are <em>launch early</em> and <em>talk to your users</em>. Both will help you to make something people want. At Raycast, we’re obsessed with user feedback. We read and answer each message that we receive. We value it more than metrics, and it’s one of our ways to collaborate with our community to shape Raycast.</p><blockquote><p><em>"Amazing response speed. You are the only app I write feedback for. You are actually listening and helping."</em> - by <a href="https://twitter.com/antoniostoilkov" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Antonio Stoilkov</a></p></blockquote><p>For us being obsessed with user feedback doesn’t mean to collect and instantly forget about it. It means treating feedback as a conversation, act on it and close the loop. In this post, I’ll outline how we run our feedback loop at Raycast and what we’ve learned so far.</p><h2 id="make-it-easy-to-reach-you">Make it easy to reach you</h2><p>It should be easy and quick for a user to send feedback. Nobody wants to go through a five-step questionnaire to report a small bug. Instead, we provide a command to send feedback from within Raycast. During onboarding, we hint the <em>Send Feedback</em> command to new users to make sure they know how to contact us.</p><p>The command is a simple form with a plain text description and an optional email address. We don’t differentiate bugs, feature requests or general feedback. This is on purpose. We want to make it as seamless as possible to reach us. The email allows us to respond, ask follow-up questions and keep a history of previous submissions. </p><p>In addition to our built-in feedback form, we use our <a href="https://raycast.com/community" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Slack community</a> to collect feedback. Usually, users join our community after they’ve used the app for a few days. They are motivated to exchange ideas and Slack makes it easy to add more context. However, communication in Slack is different. People expect quick responses, and it’s no-longer a 1-to-1 conversation. Other community members can chirp in to upvote feedback or provide answers. Played well, this can foster a feeling of belonging.</p><p>Slack offers direct messages which are great to deepen the relationship with your power-users. I chat with <a href="https://twitter.com/tholanda" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Thiago</a>, one of our early community members, at least once a week. Many ideas pop up during these chats. One idea was to generate the documentation of our <a href="https://github.com/raycast/script-commands" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">script commands</a>. Eventually, Thiago went ahead and built it himself. This isn’t so much about bug reports or feature requests any more. This is more about how can community members contribute from the outside to Raycast. And this benefits the community as a whole.</p><p>There is a caveat of having a community on Slack: People expect quick responses which can easily distract the team. For this, we’ve introduced an on-call rotation to sort out and respond to feedback.</p><h2 id="act-on-feedback">Act on feedback</h2><p>Each week, another person of the team reads, filters and replies to every piece of feedback. All messages from the app get send to a shared inbox in <a href="http://frontapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Front</a>. This allows the on-call to collaborate with the feature owner on a response. Additionally, we persist each feedback to a database in <a href="http://airtable.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Airtable</a>. This allows us to query it later. </p><p>At the beginning, we sent everything in real-time to a Slack channel. It turned out that this was very distracting for our team. Now, we batch the feedback of the last 24 hours in a daily digest. The digest is automatically posted in the morning. This way, everybody can stay on top of the received feedback without getting distracted throughout the day. It’s important to us, that every team member has access to the feedback for two reasons: </p><ol><li>Feature owners should know when something is broken in order to decide if it should be fixed in the next release, or if a fix can be prioritized later.</li><li>The constant stream of feedback makes us aware of what’s missing, which then influences our work for the next month (<a href="https://raycast.com/blog/focus-document" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">See previous blog post about how we plan our work</a>). </li></ol><p>Some of our most-used features are based on feedback from our community members. For example, many users asked for a global hotkey to toggle the clipboard history. They were used to it from other apps. After hearing this feedback over and over again, we addressed it in a generic way. Now, users can assign global hotkeys to perform a command or open an app. </p><h2 id="close-the-loop-with-the-sender">Close the loop with the sender</h2><p>Don’t treat feedback as one way! When somebody takes the time to send you a bug report or suggest a new feature, you should respond. Our on-call’s job is to respond to feedback within 48 hours, even quicker in Slack. We want to make our users feel heard and encourage them to keep providing feedback. </p><p>It’s crucial to be honest with your users. If we receive a suggestion that we won’t build, we let them know. We want to set the right expectations. If they share our opinion and adopt the tool, that’s great. If they stop using the tool, that’s fine as well. You can’t build for everyone but you can stay flexible. We declined some suggestions initially, and after they came up more often, we decided to build them anyway. </p><blockquote><p><em>"Awesome shipping tempo, keep it up!"</em> - by <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_lovin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Brian Lovin</a></p></blockquote><p>In addition to responding to the feedback directly, we have a few other mechanisms to close the loop. We keep a <a href="https://raycast.com/changelog" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">changelog</a> that lists new features, improvements and bug fixes for each update. We share each changelog entry in our <a href="https://raycast.com/community" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Slack community</a> and on <a href="https://twitter.com/raycastapp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>. This makes it easy to follow our progress on the channels that our users already use. And for the folks that prefer email, we send a semi-regular newsletter that highlights recently released features and other tips.</p><h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2><p>As mentioned in a <a href="https://raycast.com/blog/focus-document" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">previous blog post</a>, we don’t keep a backlog or have a roadmap.  We try to stay flexible to fulfil the needs of our users. The user feedback guides us what to build in the short term. Our limited set of metrics help us go in the right direction in the long term.</p><p>A working feedback loop is based on trust. The quicker you address a bug report, reply to a feature suggestion or answer a support question, the more trust you gain. You build more trust with every positive interaction, and at some point you have collected enough to become friends with your user. And if that happens, you won somebody that cheers for you and spreads the word about you but also tells you when you screwed up.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
   <article>

        

        <section>
            <div><p>I wanted to write to you all and share that I've launched my first eBook called <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/serverless-for-everyone-else">"Serverless For Everyone Else"</a> - within the first three hours of launch, nobody bought a single copy and I thought that I'd got it all wrong.</p>
<p>The "everyone else" is a reference to how complicated and difficult cloud-based and Kubernetes-based FaaS has become. The eBook sets out to help indie developers, and individuals within corporations build and deploy functions using a new version of OpenFaaS (<a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a>) which is open source and can run on a single VM or VPS without much overhead.</p>
<p>The real power of functions comes in extending existing systems through webhooks, polling, or querying and updating state. I'll share some of these use-cases below including how I used functions to extend how the Gumroad marketplace worked.</p>
<h2 id="whywriteanebookanyway">Why write an eBook anyway?</h2>
<p>Why did I decide to write an eBook? If you've ever written about tech or spoken at a conference, then Packt has probably approached you on LinkedIn about writing for them. From what I hear, that kind of arrangement means writing in a word doc, with tight deadlines and cranking out 300+ pages. It wasn't for me.</p>
<p>I'd seen <a href="https://twitter.com/dvassallo">Daniel Vassallo</a> create an eBook about AWS and Twitter. Daniel had really good results using Gumroad to sell his self-published eBooks. Then there's <a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">Adam Wathan</a> who built Tailwind CSS and trained himself up as a UI designer. He wrote his own eBook and in his yearly review mentioned that it did 600k USD in passive sales, without any promotion.</p>
<p>Whilst I didn't expect to get anywhere close to those numbers with a specialist topic, I did want to know if people would buy something from me.</p>
<h2 id="thetiersatlaunch">The tiers at launch</h2>
<p>I launched with three tiers, with names and clear differentiation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimalist - 25 USD - just the eBook</li>
<li>DevOps PRO - 50 USD - the eBook, plus a Grafana dashboard and the YAML for faasd to enable it</li>
<li>The learner - 99 USD - the eBook, plus a Grafana dashboard,  the YAML for faasd to enable it and a video workshop ready in 7 days</li>
<li>The team player - the learner, but for 5 people in your company</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as your options add some value, it seems that people enjoy the choice and are willing to pay a little more.</p>
<p>So I tweeted about the eBook and then nothing happened for three hours.</p>
<p>I interpreted this as a failure. I'd been reading <a href="https://amzn.to/38N5uZy">"The Right It: Why So Many Ideas Fail and How to Make Sure Yours Succeed"</a>, and had convinced myself that this was a sign that nobody wanted the material.</p>
<p>Then I got my first sale, and felt a little relief, maybe I was wrong?</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6358735/104810538-27b57080-57ed-11eb-905b-d042d3046adf.png" alt="Sale email"></p>
<p>My sales graph had one initial spike on the Friday, and kept going into the Sunday. What had happened? My Twitter audience and GitHub Sponsors came to lend their support.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErzMnuOXMAA_REk?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="Initial spike"></p>
<p>Then things died down, and over the course of the week I wondered if I'd failed to find market fit. <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a> was sending me almost no organic traffic, and nobody was landing on the page via SEO.</p>
<p>It was still more money than I had expected to earn from the eBook within the first week, but I felt like with so much interest in OpenFaaS, that there was a broader audience to reach.</p>
<h2 id="gettingasecondpeak">Getting a second peak</h2>
<p>After the first week, I released the video workshop to the people who'd purchased that tier (99USD), and to get some feedback, I offered a free upgrade to the workshop for the tier just below (50USD). That resulted in another large spike in interest.</p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4e204e93dcfc33679c997c739fbf4f651fdf268d23961bae6f9b4c25ad4ec145/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f45735a3372753258634155513451673f666f726d61743d6a7067266e616d653d6d656469756d" alt="Video workshop"></p>
<p>How did I fulfil the upgrade / discount? I did it by writing a function and deploying it to my Raspberry Pi, so that Gumroad would send a webhook, my code would query the dollar amount, and then send out an email to the customer over AWS SES.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EscxNxbXAAEHD8z?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="The function running"></p>
<p>Get the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/gumroad-responder">alexellis/gumroad-responder</a></p>
<p>After the second peak, I saw a complete drop-off again - and started to wonder why?</p>
<p>99% of referrals came from Twitter and email, so had I exhausted my network?</p>
<p>I went ahead and added a link on openfaas.com and on my blog at the end of each post, to try and get more views on the eBook. It's too early to tell if that is going to work out, but has resulted in a few conversions already.</p>
<p>One of the bits of feedback I got on the eBook was how users enjoyed the use-cases, and practical examples. I'd recently started video streaming, so invited a friend to my YouTube channel to talk about serverless use-cases.</p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/544dffaf339a4ff44439db1c14cd953de385640b99231688f8a49db61294a02e/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f457378444745505841415968724c4f3f666f726d61743d6a7067266e616d653d6c61726765" alt="Video on use-cases"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzuXVuccaqI&amp;feature=youtu.be">Watch the recording</a></p>
<p>The recording generated a lot of interest and engagement for existing eBook customers, but no additional sales.</p>
<p>You can get the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alexellis/c72d7a385f801cc9b8deb7fcaa531b69">show notes</a> here which have lots of links for use-cases from hobbyists, indie devs and corporate users of OpenFaaS.</p>
<h2 id="mynextmilestone">My next milestone</h2>
<p>I am pleased with the results so far, and have learned a lot along the way. I also had a few people reach out to me directly asking for help who had taken inspiration from seeing someone actually go ahead and take a calculated risk.</p>
<p>I haven't quite got to 10k USD, which is a nice round number to aim for, but I can roughly understand what each peak means here, and whether they are repeatable.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtARGclXMAg7nJ-?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="Approaching 10k"></p>
<p>Once the sales do cross that threshold, I'll write-up a how to guide and share the command lines and tools I used to generate the eBook.</p>
<h2 id="whatsnext">What's next</h2>
<p>I committed to providing free updates - because the eBook was partially experimental and I wanted to validate that it was useful. Using the <a href="https://slack.openfaas.io/">OpenFaaS Slack</a> helped here - I opened a new channel for people who'd bought the book, and enjoyed the feedback and engagement from this.</p>
<p>Some people charge extra for community, but it felt too hard to enforce the access for this.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6358735/104810333-b628f280-57eb-11eb-8be9-a2f6c773346b.png" alt="Original cover"></p>
<p>I generated my own eBook cover originally and then only later, got a professional designer involved.</p>
<p><img src="https://static-2.gumroad.com/res/gumroad/2028406193591/asset_previews/741f2ad46ff0a08e16aaf48d21810ba7/retina/social4.png" alt="New design"></p>
<p>It turns out that the cover may not matter with Gumroad, as long as it's not awful. Since changing cover, I've only seen two new sales.</p>
<p>Now that I have some initial feedback and have learned that people will buy things from me, I want to let goodwill rebuild, and my audience "recover" before launching a second eBook. I've done a lot of free blog posts and writing on Kubernetes, Docker, Golang and Raspberry Pi and analytics from my blog shows me what's popular.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 14 days, I've received more money than OpenFaaS corporate users have paid into the project over 4 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just because something you give away for free is popular, doesn't mean that anyone will be willing to pay for it. OpenFaaS itself is testament to that, with many corporations using it in production, without contributing code or finances back.</p>
<p>The Right It has taught me not to invest too much effort up front in any one idea - as it's likely to fail. Instead I'll be testing ideas - getting feedback by investing a few hours or days, not weeks.</p>
<p>I am sure I've missed out lots of details here, so feel free to ask me questions.</p>

<p>Monte Carlo Simulations are a series of experiments that help us understand the probability of different outcomes when the intervention of random variables is present. It’s a technique you can use to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty in prediction and forecasting models.</p>



<p>Although Monte Carlo Methods can be studied and applied in many ways, we’re going to focus on:</p>



<ul><li>What Monte Carlo Simulation/Method actually is, along with some examples and few experiments.</li><li>Simulating the game of <em>Roulette</em> with methods of Monte Carlo and inferential statistics.</li><li>Understanding areas where it finds its application other than gambling.</li></ul>



<h2>Why should you learn about Monte Carlo Simulation?</h2>



<p>Monte Carlo Simulations utilize something called the Monte Carlo Sampling technique, which is randomly sampling a probability distribution. We’re going to see a simulation based around this technique later in the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since business and finance are plagued by random variables, Monte Carlo simulations have a vast array of potential applications in these fields. They’re used to estimate the probability of cost overruns in large projects, and the likelihood that an asset price will move in a certain way.</p>



<p>Telecoms use them to assess network performance in different scenarios, helping them to optimize the network. Analysts use them to assess the risk that an entity will default, and to analyze derivatives such as options.</p>



<p>Insurers and oil well drillers also use them. Monte Carlo simulations have countless applications outside of business and finance, such as in meteorology, astronomy, and particle physics.</p>



<p>In machine learning, Monte Carlo methods provide the basis for resampling techniques like the <em>bootstrap method</em> for estimating a quantity, such as the accuracy of a model on a limited dataset.</p>



<blockquote><p>The bootstrap method is a resampling technique used to estimate statistics on a population by sampling a dataset with replacement.</p></blockquote>



<h2>History</h2>



<p>A mathematician who goes by the name Stanislaw Ulam started playing solitaire while recovering from an illness. He wondered what’s the probability of winning this game. So, he spent a lot of time trying to work the odds and combinatorics of the game, but despite being a great mathematician (he also took part in the Manhattan project), he failed! Which you can understand if you’ve played solitaire. There are tons of combinations which makes the combinatorial calculation super complicated.</p>



<p>To tackle this he thought of going the experimental route, counting the number of hands won / number of hands played. But he had already played a lot of hands without a win, so it would take him years to play enough hands to actually get a good estimate. So instead of playing all the hands, he thought of simulating the game on the computer.</p>



<p>He consulted his computer geek friend John von Neumann, who agreed on running the experiment on his new ENIAC machine, which would take a couple of hours to run the experiments (microseconds for a machine this age). And thus, Monte Carlo Simulation was born!</p>



<h2>What is Monte Carlo Simulation?</h2>



<p>Monte Carlo Simulation is a method of estimating the value of an unknown quantity using the principles of <strong>inferential statistics</strong>.</p>



<p>Inferential statistics corresponds to applying statistical algorithms on a sample/random variable, drawn from a sample that tends to exhibit the same properties as the population (from which it is drawn).</p>

<p>In the case of solitaire, the population is the universe of all possible games of solitaire which could be possibly played, and the sample is the games we played (&gt;1). Now, the inferential statistics tells you that we can make inferences about the population based on the statistics we do on the sample.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Note: The statement of inferential statistics will only hold true when the sample is sampled <strong>randomly</strong>.</em></p>



<p>A major part of inferential statistics is decision making. But to make a decision you must know the combinations of outcomes that might occur, and in what variation.</p>



<p>Let’s take an example to understand this better. Let’s say you’re given a coin and you have to estimate the fraction of heads you would get if you flipped the coin a certain number of times. How confident would you be to say that all flips will turn heads? Or that heads will come up the (t+1)th time? Let’s weigh in some possibilities to make it interesting:</p>



<ul><li>Flipped a coin 2 times. Both were heads, will you weigh in this if you were to predict the outcome of the 3rd toss?</li><li>What if there are 100 trials and all come up heads, will you feel more comfortable thinking 101st flip will be heads? (nowhere is it mentioned that it’s a fair coin, might as well be weighted)</li><li>Now, what if out of 100 trials, 52 came up heads? Will your best guess be 52/100?</li></ul>



<p>For t=2 times you’d be less confident to predict the third one head, and for t=100 you’d be more confident to predict 101st flip to be heads when all are heads than the case where 52 flips were heads.</p>



<p>The answer to this is <strong>variance</strong>. The confidence in our estimate depends on two things:</p>



<ul><li>Size of the sample (100 vs 2)</li><li>The variance of the sample (all heads vs 52 heads)</li></ul>



<p>As the variance grows, we need larger samples to have the same degree of confidence. When almost half are heads and half are tails, the variance is high, but when the outcome is always <em>heads,</em> the variance is almost 0.</p>



<p>Let’s now see some experiments based on Monte Carlo methods in action.</p>



<h2>Monte Carlo Simulation experiments</h2>



<p>One of the most popular games that’s common among statisticians and gamblers is<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roulette" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> <strong><em>Roulette</em></strong></a>! Of course, for various different reasons we’re gonna see the Monte Carlo simulation in action by running over the game of roulette.</p>



<p>To make this fun, we’re gonna divide this into 3 experiments influenced by each other:</p>



<ul><li>Fair Roulette: Expected value for the return of your bets should be 0%.</li><li>European Roulette: Expected value for the return of your bets should be ~-2.7%</li><li>American Roulette: Expected value for the return of your bets should be ~-5.5%.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Fair Roulette</strong></h3>



<p>Let’s define a simple python class to simulate the game:</p>



<pre><span>import</span> random
random.seed(<span>0</span>)
<span><span>class</span> <span>FairRoulette</span><span>()</span>:</span>
   <span><span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(self)</span>:</span>
       self.pockets = []
       <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(<span>1</span>,<span>37</span>):
           self.pockets.append(i)
       self.ball = <span>None</span>
       self.pocketOdds = len(self.pockets) - <span>1</span>
   <span><span>def</span> <span>spin</span><span>(self)</span>:</span>
       self.ball = random.choice(self.pockets)
   <span><span>def</span> <span>betPocket</span><span>(self, pocket, amt)</span>:</span>
       <span>if</span> str(pocket) == str(self.ball):
           <span>return</span> amt*self.pocketOdds
       <span>else</span>: <span>return</span> -amt
   <span><span>def</span> <span>__str__</span><span>(self)</span>:</span>
       <span>return</span> <span>'Fair Roulette'</span>
</pre>



<ul><li>There are 36 pockets numbered from 1–36</li><li>Initially, the ball is at None. The wheel is spun and the ball lands on one of these pockets randomly</li><li>If the pocket number on which the ball landed matches with the number you bet on priorly, you win the game. So if you bet $1 at the start and you win the hand then you end up with $36. Amazing, isn’t it?</li></ul>



<p>Now a function to put all instructions and rules together:</p>



<pre><span><span>def</span> <span>playRoulette</span><span>(game, numSpins, pocket, bet, toPrint)</span>:</span>
   totalPocket = <span>0</span>
   <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(numSpins):
       game.spin()
       totalPocket += game.betPocket(pocket, bet)
   <span>if</span> toPrint:
       print(f<span>'{numSpins} spins of {game}'</span>)
       print(f<span>'Expected return betting {pocket} = {str(100*totalPocket/numSpins)}% \n'</span>)
   <span>return</span> (totalPocket/numSpins)
</pre>



<p>The code is pretty much self-explanatory. <em>totalPocket</em> is a variable that keeps the sum of the money you won/lost. <em>numSpins</em> is how many times you placed a bet or spun the wheel.</p>



<p>Now let’s run this thing for 100 and 1 million spins.</p>



<pre>game = FairRoulette()
<span>for</span> numSpins <span>in</span> (<span>100</span>, <span>1000000</span>):
   <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(<span>3</span>):
       playRoulette(game, numSpins, <span>2</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>True</span>)
</pre>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="394" height="402" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Fair-rulette-results.png?resize=394%2C402&amp;ssl=1" alt="Fair rulette results " srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Fair-rulette-results.png?w=394&amp;ssl=1 394w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Fair-rulette-results.png?resize=294%2C300&amp;ssl=1 294w" sizes="(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p>You can see in the image above</p>



<ul><li>For 100 spins you’ve got a 44% positive return followed by a negative 28%, and again a positive 44%, much higher variance but things get interesting when you look at the bigger picture.</li><li>For a million spins the returns always hover around the mean 0 which is what we started with. The variance is low.</li></ul>



<p>One must be wondering why bother with a million spins? A gambler might not, but a casino surely will. For a gambler, it’s harder to predict how much he’ll win or lose that day, given that he can play 100 games on that particular day. But a casino has to run for years with millions of gamblers playing tens of millions of hands.</p>



<p>So what’s going on with the experiment is something called the <strong>law of large numbers</strong>. According to the law of large numbers:</p>



<p>the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value and will tend to become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed.</p>



<p>That means if we spun the roulette wheel an infinite number of times, the expected return would be zero. A million is closer to the infinite than 100, so we got the result much closer to zero when spun a million times than a hundred.</p>



<p>This law is often miscued with any game of chance. Take an example of a fair coin. If 10 consecutive heads appear (highly unlikely, p=1/1024) then a person would think the next 10 flips would result in &gt;5 tails (more tails than heads) just to even things out. This is called <strong>Gambler’s Fallacy</strong>. A more constructive approach to look at this would be <strong>regression to the mean, </strong>which says “following an extreme event (highly unlikely), the next random event is likely to be less extreme”. In the coin case, it’s likely that in the next 10 flips you’ll get fewer than 10 heads followed by an extreme heads event.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, if you look at the average of 20 flips, it will be closer to the expected mean of 50% heads than to the 100% of the first 10 flips.</p>



<p>Let’s get back to our roulette experiment, and now run European and American roulette. You see, casinos are not in the business of being fair. After all, they have to stick up to the phrase “the house always wins!”. In …</p></article></div></div>

    <p>From the Linux kernel to Firefox and Wordpress, Open Source is changing the world for the better. But how to achieve financial sustainability when you produce something that can legally be copied, by design, at zero cost?</p>
<h2 id="revenue-models-for-open-source">Revenue models for Open Source</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23218943">lot</a> has been written about <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/open-source-funding">achieving profitability</a> for open source projects, still it’s not a solved problem. Here are the most common ways for open source projects to generate profit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hosting: where you offer a fully-managed version of your project. It’s certainly the easiest way to scale revenues but it’s not appropriate for all products.</li>
<li>Paying support: popularized by Red Hat and other Linux distributions, this model is hard to scale and create bizarre incentives.</li>
<li>Patronage: patrons are helping artists make a living since forever. Unfortunately as you are depending on the goodwill of your patrons, it’s an extremely precarious way of life without a huge audience.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital">VC</a>: According to my empirical study, it’s extremely hard to create a long term business whose interests are aligned with those of its users going this way.</li>
<li>Having a real job™ beside: but is your project worth sacrificing all your free time for it?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bloom">Bloom</h2>
<p>Early in 2019, I innocently started working on <a href="https://github.com/skerkour/bloom">Bloom</a> with one mission: putting an end to digital feudalism (Why? How? What? 👉 <a href="https://kerkour.com/blog/bloom-a-free-and-open-source-google">You can read the launch post here</a>).
The idea resonated with a lot of people and I received more positive feedback than I would ever have imagined.</p>
<p>But the path to success was still not clear: I launched the project as a self-hostable web application with a plan to create native applications with end-to-end encryption later. It quickly turned into a full-time R&amp;D project as end-to-end encryption is not yet a totally solved problem (especially its key distribution part) and neither is native applications distribution (App stores being controlled by two companies that are more and more user hostile).</p>
<p><img src="https://kerkour.com/blog/valley_of_death.jpg"></p>
<p>So, how to survive the valley of death and stay alive enough time to reach product-market fit and turn Bloom into a sustainable open source project?</p>
<h2 id="black-hat-rust">Black Hat Rust</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/skerkour">
    <img src="https://kerkour.com/blog/github_contributions.png">
</a></p><p>While developing Bloom, I have written and deleted a hundred thousand lines of code of Rust, if not more. From achieving great development speed to designing and implementing an en-to-end encrypted synchronization protocol, passing by handling millions of HTTP requests a day, I’ve learned a few things along the way. <br>
Why not turn these thousand hours of experience into a profit which will allow me to arrange free hours during the week to work on Bloom? <br>
Some friends suggested that I launch an Udemy course, but I was not a fan of the idea because I find the ratio of information / time of these video courses too low compared to a good old book.</p>
<p>So I decided to write a book about Rust. As I had experience with offensive security (developing an automated vulnerability scanner, reverse engineering applications and helping plenty of companies to secure their assets) I narrowed the scope of the book to offensive security programming with Rust. <br>
Rust is not only a great fit for offensive programming, but the only one-size-fits-all programming language able to meet all the needs of this field: from shellcodes and exploits to servers, RATs and phishing pages in WebAssembly, Rust is polyvalent enough to shine in all those tasks. <br>
<em>Black Hat Rust - Deep dive into offensive security with the Rust programming language</em> was born!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/lcow5j/black_hat_rust_im_writing_a_book_about_offensive">I announced the (extremely) early-access edition of the book on Reddit</a> last week and received a lot of positive feedback. <br>
Idea validated. Funding secured. 🥳 <br>
Even if the hardest part is yet to come, I just want to say a big <strong>THANK YOU</strong> to all the people who are making this possible. <br>
Since this Monday I have started to work 4 days a week on the book and 2 days on Bloom (yes, as an indie hacker my workweek is 6 days long 🤷‍♂️).</p>
<p>If you find the idea compelling and want to be part of the adventure, here is a coupon to save 10€ on the book: <a href="https://academy.kerkour.com/black-hat-rust?coupon=BLOG">https://academy.kerkour.com/black-hat-rust?coupon=BLOG</a>.</p>

        <p>A company that will remain nameless (unless someone convinces me otherwise) recently sent me this email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks so much for agreeing to your virtual on-site interview for a position in the &lt;redacted&gt;!</p>

  <p>Beforehand, please take a look at the comments below:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Your presentation is expected to be in front of a fairly diverse audience.  Members of the interview panel are going to be there, and members from other functions, such as marketing, may attend as well.  Prepare with this in mind.</li>
    <li>For your presentation, you may want to begin with a brief introduction of who you are and where you have been in your career.  Consider giving the audience a sense of who you are and what has motivated you in your career development.</li>
    <li>From previous experiences, there will likely be questions and interruptions during your presentation.  Some questions may be general, and some may be specific and technical.  Manage your time wisely.</li>
    <li>Choose 1-2 projects that you have worked on in-depth and personally; you would know these projects well and be excited to talk about them.  Convey your excitement to the audience.  Talk about recent (rather than old) projects if possible.</li>
    <li>Be prepared to go into details on the projects you will present.  Do give a high-level overview of the project (e.g., What is the problem?  Why is it important?) . Do go into some level of technical specifics.  What have you done?  How have you done it?</li>
    <li>Give the audience a sense of <em>how</em> you think.  What were the factors you considered when you approached the problem?  What were the challenges?  How did you overcome them?  Provide specific examples whenever possible.</li>
    <li>You may present your slide deck directly from your laptop or send me a copy and I will flip thru the deck for you during the presentation.  It is your choice.</li>
    <li>Please install Zoom and Microsoft Teams on your laptop prior to the seminar.  We will use Microsoft Teams as default and Zoom as backup.
We greatly look forward to meeting you!</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>They wanted me to make a hour long presentation as part of the interview.
The last time I made a talk that long, I practiced it for weeks.
Given that they gave me a week’s heads-up total, I took the weekend and put together what I could.
I’d say I put in a dozen hours, realistically.
I was pretty excited about the final product and was kinda looking forward to giving the talk.
The day before my interview, I got this email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Good Morning Jessime,</p>

  <p>I must inform you, that your Zoom Interview for tomorrow, Wednesday, February 10th got canceled.  Our recruiter will give you a call for more information.
Have a great day and stay safe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The recruiter called me and we talked briefly.
They said that I interviewed extremely well, but that they decided to go with another candidate.
That’s fair, I suppose.
They were looking for someone with a few years of experience working with a specific technology I had never used.
But… they knew that from my resume.</p>

<p>And from my first interview.</p>

<p>And from my second interview.</p>

<p>And when they told me that I needed to prep a talk.</p>

<p>The recruiter told me, “Don’t be shy about reapplying for another position.”
Thank you, but I’m probably good.</p>

<p>Anyway, I wanted to share my presentation somewhere, so I guess I’ll share it here.</p>

<p><em>Because we’ve run the numbers, and shit’s not great</em>.</p>







<p>Four years ago, Crystal and I retired from venture capital to carve out more time for things that matter, with Earth’s climate disaster at the top of the list. Why? The situation is much worse than it seems. The planet is warming faster than experts predicted. Rising temperatures fuel lethal heat waves, year-round fires, destructive storms, and epic droughts that are already killing thousands of people around the globe, displacing millions more, and sowing the seeds of famine, disease, and war. Heavy stuff.</p>



<p>Academic debates about exactly how many degrees the planet will warm, which species will go extinct, how many millions of people will be killed by extreme weather, which wars and refugee crises will result from drought, and whether sea levels will rise 10, 20, or 30 feet all miss the point. The bottom line is the planet is becoming unlivable. If you’re the quantitative type, well, we drew some samples, crunched a few numbers and, according to our exact scientific calculations: A lot of shit will be pretty fucked up.</p>



<p>In simplest terms, more carbon equals more heat, and more heat equals more death. This is an established and unavoidable fact. Today, the levels of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere are higher than at any point in at least 800,000 years (and arguably as far back as 23 million). Pumping all this CO<sub>2</sub> into the sky is like locking ourselves in a car on a sunny day.</p>







<h2><span>What will it take to get us out of this nightmare? </span></h2>



<p>Electric cars and solar panels are awesome but only a part of the picture. To bring down CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere it will take:</p>



<blockquote><p><span><span>01</span></span>   Slashing new emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gases to zero.</p><p><span><span>02</span></span>   Sucking up at least a trillion tons of carbon already swirling around the sky.</p><p><span><span>03</span></span>   Buying all of humanity, including those most vulnerable, more time by actively cooling the planet.</p></blockquote>



<p>I am not new to this challenge. Way back when I was at Google, I was tasked with leading many of the company’s clean energy deals, repping execs in meetings with policy groups and think tanks, and exploring innovative ways to use technology to reduce the carbon footprint of a company that was, at the time, rumored to the be the largest individual power consumer in two or three US states. (If saying that violates my Google NDA, then no, we definitely weren’t a massive user of electrical power. Nothing to see here.)</p>



<p>In the years that followed, Crystal and I have been active supporters of legislative and regulatory efforts to address the problems, as well as funders of philanthropy and activism in the climate space. We’ve been poking around academic labs, comparing notes with environmental non-profits, briefing political leaders, cajoling philanthropists, sponsoring research and primers, and advising companies concerned about the climate emergency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After almost 20 years of this work, here is what we know to be true:</p>



<p><strong>Policy change alone ain’t gonna get us there.</strong> High fives to everyone who is working on clean tech regulatory initiatives. This vital work brings down real costs, creates research breakthroughs, and keeps urgent climate issues front and center. But even the most aggressive ideas on the table today fall short of the drastic action needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Guilt and shame don’t and won’t change anything at scale. </strong>There simply aren’t enough people willing to buy more expensive products nor companies on board with overpaying for sustainable materials just because they feel bad. Cheers to consumers and companies that spend a little more to choose options with climate in mind. You’ve undoubtedly helped create a new generation of climate friendly companies. However, we need about seven billion more of you to get on board before the impact will be meaningful enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Philanthropy is way too small and cautious</strong>. For the better part of twenty years, climate philanthropy has been overwhelmingly focused on consumer awareness campaigns to persuade people that climate change is real and to turn out their lights. But there’s been too little appetite to invest in hardcore, massive change. Bless you and those paper straws, but unless we zero out the billions of tons of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from huge sectors like aviation, steelmaking, industrial chemicals, building, and farming, we are screwed.</p>



<p>So, policy, philanthropy, and individual behavior do have roles to play, but the real solutions to the carbon nightmare will win because they’re cheaper, better, faster, stronger, simpler, and just plain cooler than what’s available today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Markets already understand that it’s too damn expensive to keep powering our economy by digging up and burning old dinosaur bones. In most places today, solar and wind are cheaper and scale faster. What you might not know yet is that technologies that grow chemicals in bioreactors or boost crop yields are already outperforming 100-year-old industrial processes that are dirty and dangerous. We see this happening in protein, transportation, chemicals, building materials, and even mining too. This radical shift isn’t just because of some warm and fuzzies. These are real businesses, with insane growth, and some posting nine-figure revenue run rates.</p>



<p>We’re on a clear trajectory to 8.5 billion people on this planet. I’m going out on a limb and predict they’ll want to eat, build houses, go places, buy stuff, and enjoy life. Fair to say? The most profitable companies meeting this demand will be those that sell products and services that use less carbon because they are ultimately the cheapest to offer. In simple terms, cutting gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub>, mass market adoption, and generating piles of money will go hand-in-hand.</p>







<h2><span>Who knew we would look forward to email?</span></h2>



<p>When the word got out that we were starting to dig into climate tech, our inboxes blew up. Notes came in from very small and unreasonably ambitious teams taking on intimidatingly large projects to slash CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and suck carbon right out of the air. Frankly, we’ve never felt so energized reading our email. It was everything we loved about startups colliding with all of the urgency we felt for helping a planet on fire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is also a dynamic that makes climate tech today different from clean tech 15 years ago. It reminds me of the dramatic shift in startup economics that made YCombinator and its companies possible. Back then, the rise of open-source coding tools, cloud hosting, and the elimination of legal and financing friction empowered a new type of company and a new type of company-builder. The old way required millions of dollars and a rash of bankers and lawyers to even consider writing the first line of code. Suddenly startups had tiny, ragtag teams, usually without any fancy MBAs on board, raising tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars for services and apps that they built and launched within weeks.</p>



<p>In climate tech, we have seen the same evolution. I appreciate the investors who have been plowing money into this stuff for decades and I admire their passion and commitment to doing the right thing. But, too often low-carbon businesses were among the most expensive to start. CapEx was bonkers right out of the gate, and most companies relied upon government intervention to even approach viability.</p>



<p>Are we excited to see the Biden/Harris administration finally at the wheel? Hell yes. They believe in science and have made climate a priority across the entire federal government. We have the deepest respect for Secretary Kerry and Gina McCarthy, and we admire the depth of expertise and hustle we are seeing across the staffers accepting roles to serve the USA to advance climate work. As members of Climate Leaders for Biden, and as a consequence of our involvement across the industry, we have already been in close touch with the administration and we are beyond heartened to see how serious they are about climate. Multiple times, Crystal and I have spoken directly with President Biden about climate and I can assure you he gets the gravity and urgency of the moment. Yet, despite all that, we aren’t counting on the government’s direct help in our investment thesis. Why?</p>



<p>Today, with shared lab space, massive computing clusters available for rent, proliferation of machine learning, cheap renewable electricity, the discovery of CRISPR/Cas9, breakthroughs in electrochemistry, and more streamlined tech transfer from universities, true seed-stage climate tech startups are possible at scale. Some benefit from grants and government investment, and no doubt healthy public investment in research and science lifts all boats, but barely any of these climate tech companies count on governments for handouts because they increasingly can rely upon free markets to reward them with customers. Add to this what might be the first generation of hard science engineers who, inspired by a prior, similar shift in computer science academia, now go to school knowing from day one they want to graduate to directly become company founders. These teams are taking their innovations straight to consumers and enterprises who may not vote for the same people nor share the same climate values, but who buy their products and services because they are just simply cheaper and better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<h2><span>We call this thing Lowercarbon Capital.</span></h2>



<p>It wasn’t in the master plan to get back into the investing world full-time. But after a few years of doing this work, we picked up our heads and realized we now have a portfolio of over 30 climate teams and growing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our startups straddle a delicate line between, “Whaaa? That’s absolutely bananas!” to, “No way. Are you f’ing kidding me?!” You know, chill stuff like confining plasma that’s hotter than the sun or growing full-on real meat steaks in a vat. Maybe using microbes to make hundreds of millions of dollars of industrial chemicals is your thing, or you’re into kelp-growing robots in the high seas. I’m kinda partial to …</p></div></div></div>

February 10, 2021 | https://brennan.io/2021/02/09/so-python/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://brennan.io/2021/02/09/so-python/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

  
<p><em>Stephen Brennan • 09 February 2021</em></p><p>INTERNET – Stack Overflow users today rejoiced at the prospect of Python’s
upcoming 3.10 release including the controversial new pattern matching feature
described in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0634/">PEP 634</a>.</p>

<p>“Python 3 has been out for a while, and the goldmine of Python 2 to 3 migration
questions has started to run dry since January 2020,” said one user, referring
to the end of life for the Python 2.x release series. “We were starting to
worry that we would run out of major language changes to confuse new developers.
But thanks to pattern matching, we should be set for another 5-7 years!”</p>

<p>The question answerers on the popular site, <a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, were commenting
on the upcoming Python 3.10 language feature of pattern matching, which allows
syntax such as the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>match</span> <span>status_code</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>200</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"OK!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>404</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"HTTP Not Found"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>_</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Some other shit, sorry!"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Stack Overflow users gushed over its similarity to C’s <code>switch</code> statement. “New
users will see the <code>case</code> keyword and instantly feel comfortable based on their
knowledge of C,” one SO answerer remarked. “But that’s when we get them! <code>match</code>
is about subverting expectations, by assigning to variables when the programmer
expects a comparison. We’re going to earn so many Stack Overflow reputation
points this way.”</p>

<p>This user’s comments referred to the unexpected behavior of the match statement
when used with identifiers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>NOT_FOUND</span> <span>=</span> <span>404</span>
<span>match</span> <span>status_code</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>200</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"OK!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>NOT_FOUND</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"HTTP Not Found"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case, rather than matching <code>status_code</code> against the value of
<code>NOT_FOUND</code> (404), Python’s new <del>SO reputation machine</del> match syntax would
assign the value of <code>status_code</code> to the variable <code>NOT_FOUND</code>. Another Stack
Overflow user explained:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think the core developers finally looked at the numbers, and saw how few
questions Python 3.x was getting on Stack Overflow. Here’s a language that has
finally matured, and it really strikes a balance between usability and
predictability. When we reached out to the core development team about the
dire situation, the developers knew they had to step in and add an
unpredictable feature to rectify things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last time the Python language conspired so strongly to confuse new users was
the controversial “mutable default argument” feature:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>def</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[]):</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"myfunc({})"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>))</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>l</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>" l={}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>l</span><span>))</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
 <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
 <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, some Stack Overflow users were not so rosy about the future of Python 3
questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sure, Python 3.10 is going to trigger a massive influx of questions. But that
doesn’t mean we’ll get more reputation points! Most mods are just going to
mark all the questions as duplicates, even if they don’t have good answers
yet. Pattern matching may be a beautifully booby-trapped new feature, but it’s
not going to save us from bad moderation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, the Perl community rallied in support of the latest developments in
the Python language. Said one Perl developer: “Honestly, I’m just glad Python
has finally given in to gratuitous new features, and Perl 7 is now the language
of reason and moderation. I can’t wait until they realize how many operators
they can overload.  Maybe Python 2.7 can make a comeback after all?”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developing and testing software on Kubernetes usually means building and moving container images from the developer workstation to a container registry, and ultimately, Kubernetes. When considering all the moving parts, the complexity and context switches break the development flow. Gone are the days where developers just hit a command and a few seconds later the newly built software is ready for testing.</p><p>What if there was some magical tool that you could simply feed instructions like: “Build this Dockerfile <em>here</em> and replace any existing image on <em>that</em> Kubernetes cluster with the results!” ASAP. Spoiler Alert! That is exactly what BuildKit CLI for kubectl is there to do.</p><p>Building container images with Docker is the typical method for most users, but it is not the only option to build container images. In situations in which the workload is already running in a container, like Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipeline or a serverless function, it is not always possible to run Docker.</p><p>Where the required Docker features may not have been available historically, alternative approaches emerged that only replicated the required functionality. In this post, we not only introduce a unique method for building container images with BuildKit CLI for kubectl, but we will also discuss two solutions that are sure to save developers hours of time and a much cleaner CI/CD pipeline.</p><p>Before we dive into the details, let’s break down Docker into its different functionalities. Docker as an application serves multiple purposes and in essence is a monolithic application holding multiple functionalities. This overview shows Docker’s functionalities and their single-purpose alternatives, allowing us to determine where BuildKit CLI for kubectl fits.</p><ul><li>Container engine: <a href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a></li><li>Container runtime: <a href="https://containerd.io/">containerd</a>, <a href="https://cri-o.io/">CRI-O</a></li><li>Image Build: <a href="https://github.com/moby/buildkit">BuildKit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko">Kaniko</a>, <a href="https://buildah.io/">Buildah</a></li><li>Inspection: <a href="https://github.com/wagoodman/dive">dive</a>, <a href="https://github.com/containers/skopeo">Skopeo</a></li></ul><p>Depending on the case, multiple single-purpose tools carved out of Docker exist that help replicate some needed Docker functionality. Even better, these tools usually work well together as <a href="https://opencontainers.org/">Open Container Initiative (OCI)</a>-conformant runtimes.</p><h2 id="buildkit-cli-for-kubectl">BuildKit CLI for kubectl</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/buildkit-cli-for-kubectl">BuildKit CLI for kubectl</a> is a plugin for kubectl the Kubernetes command-line tool. The plugin extends the functionality of kubectl, allowing to build container images without a local Docker installation.</p><p>VMware <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/opensource/2020/11/17/buildkit-cli-for-kubectl/">open sourced</a> BuildKit CLI for kubectl in 2020. The initial product announcement sums up pretty well the purpose of the tool:</p><blockquote><p>A key feature of this new tool is that it strives to make the images you build immediately available in the container runtime of your Kubernetes cluster so you can “bounce” your pod(s) to pick up a freshly built image with virtually no overhead.</p></blockquote><p>BuildKit CLI for kubectl has the following key features:</p><ul><li>Dockerfiles are parsed the same way as with the existing <code>docker build</code></li><li>Container images are built within Kubernetes, to leverage the power of your Kubernetes cluster</li><li>Builds OCI compatible images</li><li><a href="https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/buildkit-cli-for-kubectl/blob/main/docs/multiarch.md">Supports building multi-architecture images</a></li><li>No local registry needed for local Kubernetes development</li></ul><h2 id="inner-loop-productivity-flow">Inner-Loop Productivity Flow</h2><p>As developers, we spend a significant amount of time in the so-called “Inner Loop.” This is an iterative process where code is written, built, and tested repeatedly. All this takes place before we share our work with the team and the rest of the world, hence the need for code reviews and a CI workflow prior to pushing our completed work. The tight loop is the productive phase of the development process, therefore we want to spend as much time in the iterations as possible.</p><p>Iterations should be fast and with minimal friction. For example, if it takes 30 minutes to complete one loop, we can average around 10-12 loops a day. By shrinking that time to three minutes, we can theoretically make over 100 iterations of writing and testing code in a single day. That’s a huge productivity boost without “context switches” while waiting for your code to compile and deploy.</p><p>Mitch Denny has written an accurate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201107102000/https://mitchdenny.com/the-inner-loop/">summary about the inner-loop</a> and how to tune it.<br></p><figure><img src="https://container-registry.com/posts/productivity-lift-buildkit-cli-for-kubectl/Inner-loop-outer-loop.svg" alt="Inner Loop and outer Loop Development Workflow" width="100%"></figure><p>There are two ways to speed up the inner-loop. More hardware power to reduce the time it takes to build and deploy, or take some shortcuts by skiping steps in the cycle. BuildKit CLI for kubectl falls into the latter category. It allows us to skip superfluous steps, allowing us to reduce context switches to decrease wait time resulting in more iterations. The diagram above illustrates the two methods of deploying an application to Kubernetes. The common practice today is:</p><ul><li>Compile the code and package the artifacts</li><li>Build the container image locally</li><li>Push the container image to a container registry</li><li>Execute the deployment</li><li>Let Kubernetes pull the container image from the container registry</li><li>Start the application</li></ul><p>With BuildKit CLI for kubectl, the need to repeat all the steps every time we want to test our changes is no longer there. After the initial full cycle we only need our Kubernetes cluster to build the new image and restart the pods requiring updates. By mastering the lean image build workflow, it all should take less than a few seconds.</p><figure><img src="https://container-registry.com/posts/productivity-lift-buildkit-cli-for-kubectl/workflow-with-buildkit-cli-for-kubectl.svg" alt="Common practice workflow with and without BuildKit CLI for kubectl" width="100%"></figure><p>Enough theory! Let us examine this workflow in practice and replace our local <code>docker build</code> with <code>kubectl build</code> for our Kubernetes development workflow.</p><h2 id="installation">Installation</h2><p>Download the binaries for your platform from github on <a href="https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/buildkit-cli-for-kubectl/releases">vmware-tanzu/buildkit-cli-for-kubectl/releases</a>.</p><p>The best way to work with kubectl plugins is to use <a href="https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/">Krew</a> the plugin manager for kubectl. Unfortunately, at the moment of writing, buildkit-cli-for-kubectl is <a href="https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/buildkit-cli-for-kubectl/issues/5">not supported yet</a>. Once the buildkit-cli-for-kubectl Krew plugin is available, the installation will be simple:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">kubectl krew install buildkit-cli-for-kubectl
</code></pre></div><p>After downloading the binary for and extracting it:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">cat darwin-*.tgz | tar -C /usr/local/bin -xvf -
<span>#This is an example for MacOS &amp; Linux</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We can verify the successful installation and the plugin registration with <code>kubectl</code></p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">kubectl build --help
or
kubectl buildkit --help
</code></pre></div><p>The buildkit-cli-for-kubectl package contains two binaries: <code>buildkit</code> and <code>build</code> which is simply an alias for <code>buildkit build</code>.
Now that we have installed buildkit-cli-for-kubectl and verified its functionality, we can try to make something useful.</p><h2 id="example-application">Example Application</h2><p>For our example, we are going to use a simple Hello-World Go application.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>React revolutionized front end development as most people knew it when it was first released. This new approach to writing code triggered incredible innovation in how to handle state changes and UI updates.</p><p>This revolution had its downsides, too. One of them was a culture of over-engineering solutions to challenges that could be solved in simpler ways. A typical example of this is how state has been managed in React applications.</p><p>Redux has become a hallmark of many React applications created in the last couple of years. The allure of having a single state object, available everywhere in your application sure sounds nice. But has its time passed? Has React evolved to a point where these kinds of state management tools add more complexity than they solve?</p><p>This article aims to give you a deeper understanding of which situations warrants state management tools like Redux. We’ll discuss the reasons behind the rise of Redux, and what has changed in the last couple of years - both in React and in Redux. Finally, we’ll look into what might be coming in the future.</p><h2 id="redux---and-why-people-started-using-it">Redux - and why people started using it</h2><p>When it was first released , React didn’t have an officially supported way to pass data far down the component tree. If you had some kind of shared state, configuration or other information you would like to use anywhere in you application, you had to pass it down from parent to child to sibling to another child. There <em>was</em> a way to avoid it, but that way - the “legacy context API” was never officially supported, and was documented with a warning that it should not be used.</p><p>About the same time React was released to the public, some other Facebook engineers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS188xDYE-u1ShQmFFGbrk0v&amp;v=nYkdrAPrdcw&amp;feature=emb_title" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">introduced a blueprint</a> for how they created front end applications - the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Flux architecture</a>. It complimented React’s component-centric design by having a unidirectional data flow, which made things both easy to follow and simple to understand.</p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/176421ef1740882c46b0283385b27764/ff5cf/d97c68cc0c034806aa6ff882a5f51995.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/176421ef1740882c46b0283385b27764/ff5cf/d97c68cc0c034806aa6ff882a5f51995.png 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" alt="Flux Architecture">
<em>(photo borrowed from <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview</a>)</em></p><p>While many famous open sourcerers were busy fighting over which slightly different implementation of this was the best, a young Russian developer named Dan Abramov introduced an implementation based on the <a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Elm architecture</a>, called Redux.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/xsSnOQynTHs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://youtu.be/xsSnOQynTHs</a></p><p>Redux was a pretty simple system, with a single state object, encased in a “store”, which could be updated by dispatching actions on it. The actions were sent to a “reducer” function, which returned a brand new copy of the entire application state, which would then propagate across your application.</p><p>Another great feature of Redux was how easy it was to use with React. Not only was it a great match with the programming model of React, it also solved the prop drilling issue! Just “connect” whatever component you want to a store, and you had access to any part of the application state you wanted. It was like magic!</p><h2 id="context-hooks-and-why-it-solved-much-of-what-redux-did">Context, hooks, and why it solved much of what Redux did</h2><p>With all its elegance and popularity though, Redux did have a few major downsides. For each new way of changing the state, you had to add a new action type and action creator, probably a dispatcher and a selector, and then you’d have to handle that new state change in an existing reducer, or create a new one. In other words - lots and lots of boilerplate.</p><p>When the 16.3 version of React was released, it finally shipped with a fully redesigned context API. With this new feature, prop drilling was suddenly as easy as wrapping any subsection of your application in a context provider, and fetching it again with a context consumer component.  Here’s an example of how that could be done:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>UserContext</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>createContext</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>MyApp</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>Component</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  state </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> user</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>null</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  </span><span>componentDidMount</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>    myApi</span><span>.</span><span>getUser</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>      </span><span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>setState</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> user </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>  </span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>UserContext</span><span>.</span><span>Provider</span><span> value</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>user</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>SomeDeepHierarchy</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>UserContext</span><span>.</span><span>Provider</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span>    </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>14</span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>UserGreeting</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>18</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>UserContext</span><span>.</span><span>Consumer</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>19</span><span>      </span><span>{</span><span>user</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>20</span><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Hello</span><span> there</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span> </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>'customer'</span><span>}</span><span>!</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>21</span><span>      </span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>22</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>UserContext</span><span>.</span><span>Consumer</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>23</span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>24</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>At ReactConf in 2018, now React Core team member Dan Abramov and boss Sophie Alpert <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-QO-KO90iQ&amp;t=5s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">introduced a new feature</a> in React - hooks.

The elegance of reducers were suddenly built into React itself, and prop-drilling was a solved challenge. New projects were started without having Redux in the stack - a previous no-brainer - and more and more projects started to consider moving away from Redux altogether.</p><p>As a response, the team currently maintaining Redux (led by a gentleman named Mark Eriksson) started two different efforts. They introduced an opinionated toolkit named <a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Redux Toolkit</a> that did away with most boilerplate code through conventions, and they added a <a href="https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">hooks-based API</a> for reading state and dispatching actions.</p><p>Together these two new updates simplified Redux codebases substantially. But is it really enough to defend introducing the added complexity of the concepts in Redux to a new project? Is the value Redux adds more than the added cost of teaching new employees about Yet Another Tool?</p><p>Let’s look at where React does a great job by itself, and in what cases the tradeoff of complexity vs power is worth it.</p><h2 id="when-react-is-enough">When React is enough</h2><p>Most React applications I’ve worked with have been pretty small in scope. They’ve had a few global pieces of state that was used across the application, and some data that was shared across a few different views.</p><p>Besides from this though, many React applications don’t have a lot of shared state. Most state  like the content of input fields or whether a modal is open, is only interesting to the component that contains them! No need to make that state globally available. </p><p>Other pieces of state might be shared, but only by a part of the application. Perhaps a particular page requires a piece of state to be shared across several of its components, or a sidebar needs to expose some remote status to all of its children. Either way, that’s not global state - it’s state scoped to a part of the application.</p><p>By keeping state co-located, or as close to its dependents as possible, you ensure that it’s deleted whenever the feature requiring it is deleted, and that it’s discoverable without leafing through tens of different reducers.</p><p>If you need to share app-wide settings that rarely change, React’s context API is a great tool to reach for. One example of this is what locale is currently active:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>LocaleContext</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>createContext</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  locale</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"en-US"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  </span><span>setLocale</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>LocaleProvider</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>locale</span><span>,</span><span> setLocale</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>"en-US"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>LocaleContext</span><span>.</span><span>Provider</span><span> value</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>{</span><span> locale</span><span>,</span><span> setLocale </span><span>}</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>...</span><span>props</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>useLocale</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useContext</span><span>(</span><span>LocaleContext</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>Other use cases can be what color theme is active, or even what experiments are active for a given user.</p><p>Another very useful approach is using a small data-fetching library like <a href="https://swr.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SWR</a> or <a href="https://react-query.tanstack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">React-Query</a> to handle fetching and caching your API responses for you. To me, cached data isn’t really global state - it’s just cached data. This is much simpler to handle with these small single-use libraries, than introducing async thunks or sagas to your Redux rig. Also, you don’t have to handle all the complex variations of isLoading, hasError and what not. With these libraries, it works out of the box.</p><p>A thing these context use cases have in common is the fact that they represent data that rarely updates. Rarely in the context of computer science is a bit vague, but in my mind, less than a couple of times every second is pretty rare. And as it turns out, that’s the way the React Context API works best!</p><p>The use cases summarized above covers most of the situations I’ve met in real world applications. Actual global state is rare and far between, and is often better off being co-located with the code that actually uses it, or provided through the context API.</p><h2 id="situations-where-redux-might-be-warranted">Situations where Redux might be warranted</h2><p>With all that said, Redux is still a great product. It’s well documented, adopted by many, and can be combined with the approaches posted above. But what use cases warrants the added complexity and learning curve of adding Redux to your stack in 2021?</p><p>One of the use cases I see most in the projects I’m involved with is when you have advanced data fetching scenarios that requires a lot of cascading network communication. One might argue that this is best done on the server side, but there are definitely use cases where handing this on the client is warranted. Redux, particularly in combination with so-called thunks, is extremely versatile and flexible when it comes to such orchestration.</p><p>Another use case is for very interdependent states, or states that are derived from several other states. This is possible to handle in React as well, but the end result is still much easier to both share, reuse and reason about in Redux.</p><p>A third use case is for those where the state of your application can change very rapidly. The lead architect of React, Seb Markbåge, stated a few years ago that the current …</p></div></article></div>

<p>If you do not already have an Azure Databricks environment, you will need to spin one up:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to the Azure Portal and search for “Azure Databricks”</li>
<li>When the page comes up, click the <strong>+Add</strong> button</li>
<li>Choose the subscription that you want the instance to be in (if it isn’t already filled in)</li>
<li>Choose the Resource Group that you want the instance to be in, or click <strong>Create new</strong> and give it a name</li>
<li>Enter a name for the Azure Databricks workspace</li>
<li>Select the region that you want the workspace to be created in</li>
<li>Select your pricing tier—you can select <strong>Trial</strong> to get 14 days of free Azure Databricks units</li>
<li>On the networking page, you can choose whether or not to deploy in your own VNet (deploying in your own VNet is recommended for instances that you intend to use long term; however, if you are spinning it up just to follow this blog example. Keep the default “No” selected and Azure Databricks will spin up a VNet)</li>
<li>Enter in any required tags</li>
<li>Click <strong>Review + create</strong>; if everything comes back as valid, then click the <strong>Create</strong> button to spin up the workspace</li>
</ol>
<p>When the Azure Databricks instance finishes deploying, you can navigate to it in the Azure Portal and click <strong>Launch Workspace</strong>. Alternatively, if you already have the URL for an Azure Databricks workspace, you can go to the URL directly in your browser.</p>
<h4 id="databricks-cluster"><a id="databricks-cluster"></a>Spin up and configure an Azure Databricks cluster</h4>
<p>Once you’re logged in to the Azure Databricks workspace, you will need a running cluster. If you do not already have a cluster that you would like to use for this example, you can spin one up by following these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the <strong>Clusters</strong> icon in the left sidebar</li>
<li>Click <strong>+Create Cluster</strong></li>
<li>Give the cluster a name</li>
<li>Keep all the rest of the defaults and click Create Cluster</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the cluster is spun up, you will need to add an additional library to it. This example is for Python, but if you need this functionality in Scala, there is also an example Scala notebook that details which libraries are needed, you can find both in the <a href="#downloadable-notebooks">downloadable notebooks</a> section.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the name of the cluster that you want to use</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Libraries</strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Click <strong>Install</strong> to have the library installed on your cluster. You’re now ready to run the example.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="create-notebook"><a id="create-notebook"></a>Create a new notebook</h4>
<p>Once your cluster is spun up, you can create a new notebook and attach it to your cluster. There are multiple ways to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Azure Databricks symbol</strong> in the left menu to get to the initial screen in the Azure Databricks workspace. The “New Notebook” link is listed under “Common Tasks.”</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Or, you can click on the <strong>Home</strong> icon, which will take you to your home directory. Next, right-click under your account name and select <strong>Create &gt; Notebook</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/alt-create-notebook.png" alt="Alternate way to create a notebook" width="800" height="644" srcset="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/alt-create-notebook.png 1962w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/alt-create-notebook-300x242.png 300w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/alt-create-notebook-1024x825.png 1024w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/alt-create-notebook-768x618.png 768w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/alt-create-notebook-1536x1237.png 1536w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/alt-create-notebook-325x262.png 325w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/alt-create-notebook-600x483.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<p>Once you’ve clicked on either <strong>Create Notebook</strong> or <strong>Create &gt; Notebook</strong>, the following screen appears:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/name-your-notebook.png" alt="Name your new notebook" width="533" height="307" srcset="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/name-your-notebook.png 1122w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/name-your-notebook-300x173.png 300w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/name-your-notebook-1024x590.png 1024w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/name-your-notebook-768x442.png 768w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/name-your-notebook-350x202.png 350w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/name-your-notebook-600x345.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px"></p>
<p>Give your notebook a name, pick your default language (select Python to follow the example below), and then select the cluster that you just spun up. From there, click <strong>Create</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="example-notebook"><a id="example-notebook"></a>Example notebook</h4>
<p>The example for this tutorial uses Python, but there is also a Scala notebook available that enables the same functionality. The example below uses the sample clickstream data provided from Confluent Cloud’s Datagen Source Connector.</p>
<p>Below are the steps needed to successfully read, parse, and store Avro data from Confluent Cloud.</p>
<h3 id="step-5"><a id="step-5"></a>Step 5: Gather keys, secrets, and paths</h3>
<p>Using the following information, connect to the topic that you created in Confluent Cloud from Azure Databricks:</p>
<ul>
<li>The name of the Kafka cluster</li>
<li>The Kafka API key for the cluster that you generated earlier</li>
<li>The Kafka API secret for the cluster that you generated earlier</li>
<li>The bootstrap server for the cluster, which you can find in your Confluent Cloud instance starting from the home screen by clicking on the cluster and then clicking on <strong>Cluster settings</strong> in the left sidebar</li>
<li>The name of the Kafka topic</li>
</ul>
<p>To connect to the Schema Registry, which you will need in order to pull the schemas for parsing your Avro data, you need the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Schema Registry URL, which you can find in your Confluent Cloud instance by starting from the home screen and clicking on Settings and then Schema Registry API Access</li>
<li>The Schema Registry API key that you generated earlier</li>
<li>The Schema Registry API secret that you generated earlier</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, to write the result to a Delta table, you need to specify the ADLS Gen2 path, a Data Bricks File System (DBFS) mount pointing to the ADLS Gen2 path, or a local DBFS location (such as <code>dbfs:/delta/mytable</code> and <code>dbfs:/delta/checkpoints/mytable</code>, which are not recommended for production jobs; however, they don’t require any additional authentication) where your Delta table and streaming checkpoint will be located.</p>

					<p>Your brain has been altered, neurologically re-wired as you acquired a particular skill. This renovation has left you with a specialized area in your left ventral occipital temporal region, shifted facial recognition into your right hemisphere, reduced your inclination toward holistic visual processing, increased your verbal memory, and thickened your corpus callosum, which is the information highway that connects the left and right hemispheres of your brain.</p>
<p>What accounts for these neurological and psychological changes?</p>
<p>You are likely highly literate. As you learned to read, probably as a child, your brain reorganized itself to better accommodate your efforts, which had both functional and inadvertent consequences for your mind.</p>
<p>So, to account for these changes to your brain—e.g, your thicker corpus callosum and poorer facial recognition—we need to ask when and why did parents, communities, and governments come to see it as necessary for everyone to learn to read. Here, a puzzle about neuroscience and cognition turns into a historical question.</p>
<p>Of course, writing systems are thousands of years old, found in ancient Sumer, China, and Egypt, but in most literate societies only a small fraction of people ever learned to read, rarely more than 10%. So, when did people decide that everyone should learn to read? Maybe it came with the rapid economic growth of the Nineteenth Century? Or, surely, the intelligentsia of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, imbued with reason and rationality, figured it out?</p>
<p>No, it was a religious mutation in the Sixteenth Century<em>. </em>After bubbling up periodically in prior centuries, the belief that every person should read and interpret the Bible for themselves began to rapidly diffuse across Europe with the eruption of the Protestant Reformation, marked in 1517 by Martin Luther’s delivery of his famous ninety-five theses. Protestants came to believe that both boys and girls had to study the Bible for themselves to better know their God. In the wake of the spread of Protestantism, the literacy rates in the newly reforming populations in Britain, Sweden, and the Netherlands surged past more cosmopolitan places like Italy and France. Motivated by eternal salvation, parents and leaders made sure the children learned to read.</p>
<p>The sharpest test of this idea comes from work in economics, led by Sascha Becker and Ludger Woessmann. The historical record, including Luther’s own descriptions, suggest that within the German context, Protestantism diffused out from Luther’s base in Wittenberg (Saxony). Using data on literacy and schooling rates in nineteenth-century Prussia, Becker and Woessmann first show that counties with more Protestants (relative to Catholics) had higher rates of both literacy and schooling. So, there’s a correlation. Then, taking advantage of the historical diffusion from Wittenberg, they show that for every 100-km traveled from Wittenberg, the percentage of Protestants in a county dropped by 10%. Then, with a little statistical razzle-dazzle, this patterning allows them to extract the slice of the variation in Protestantism that was, in a sense, caused by the Reformation’s ripples as they spread outward from the epicenter in Wittenberg. Finally, they show that having more Protestants does indeed cause higher rates of literacy and schooling. All-Protestant counties had literacy rates nearly 20 percentage points higher than all-Catholic counties. Subsequent work focusing on the Swiss Reformation, where the epicenters were Zurich and Geneva, reveals strikingly similar patterns.</p>
<p>The Protestant impact on literacy and education can still be observed today in the differential impact of Protestant vs. Catholic missions in Africa and India. In Africa, regions with early Protestant missions at the beginning of the Twentieth Century (now long gone) are associated with literacy rates that are about 16 percentage points higher, on average, than those associated with Catholic missions. In some analyses, Catholics have no impact on literacy at all unless they faced direct competition for souls from Protestant missions. These impacts can also be found in early twentieth-century China.</p>
<p>The Protestant emphasis on Biblical literacy reshaped Catholic practices and inadvertently laid the foundation for modern schooling. Forged in the fires of the Counter-Reformation, the Jesuit Order adopted many Protestant practices, including an emphasis on schooling and worldly skills. Analyses of an indigenous population at the junction of Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil reveal that the closer a community is to a historical Jesuit mission (which existed from 1609 to 1767), the higher its literacy rate today. By contrast, proximity to one of the Franciscan missions in the same region is unrelated to modern literacy—the Franciscans formed three centuries before the Reformation and hadn’t internalized Protestant values.</p>
<p>The notion of universal, state-funded schooling has its roots in religious ideals. As early as 1524, Martin Luther not only emphasized the need for parents to ensure their children’s literacy but also placed the responsibility for creating schools on secular governments. This religiously inspired drive for public schools helped make Prussia a model for public education, which was later copied by countries like Britain and the U.S.</p>
<p>When the Reformation reached Scotland in 1560, John Knox and his fellow reformers called for free public education for the poor and justified this with the need for everyone to acquire the skills to better know God. Having placed the burden for delivering schooling on the government, the world’s first local school tax was established in 1633 CE and strengthened in 1646 CE. This early experiment in universal education may have mid-wifed the Scottish Enlightenment, which produced intellectual luminaries ranging from David Hume to Adam Smith. A century later, the early intellectual dominance of this tiny region inspired France’s Voltaire to write, “we look to Scotland for all our ideas of civilization.” Voltaire, who grew up in a region controlled by Huguenots (French Calvinists), was educated in Jesuit schools, along with other Enlightenment luminaries like Diderot and Condorcet. Rousseau, for his part, likely learned to read from his Calvinist father in the Protestant city-state of Geneva.</p>
<p>The story of literacy, Luther, and your left ventral occipital temporal region is but one example in a much larger scientific mosaic that is just now coalescing. Our minds, brains, and indeed our biology are, in myriad ways, substantially shaped by the social norms, values, institutions, beliefs, and languages bequeathed to us from prior generations. By setting the incentives and defining the constraints, our culturally-constructed world shape how we think, feel and perceive—they tinker with and calibrate the machinery of our minds.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-name="content">
<p><time>February 7, 2021</time></p><p>TL;DR: Most companies use the wrong metrics during software engineering
interviews. That makes them both brutal for the candidates and inefficient for
the companies. Both sides suffer as a result. In this blog post, we propose how
to improve your hiring loop by using the right metric.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-of-using-the-wrong-metric">The problem of using the wrong metric</h2>

<p>Before we dive in, let’s recap how a typical hiring loop looks and the
rationale behind it. It usually consists of several technical interviews,
followed by “meet the CEO” ones. The technical interviews can take different
forms: from universally loathed on-site whiteboarding to pairing sessions using
online coding solutions. The unifying theme in all those forms is that the
candidate must solve all the puzzles the interviewers could come up with for
the interview and do that under pressure. Ultimately the decision of whether to
extend the offer depends on the candidate not making any technical mistakes.</p>

<p>In other words: can the candidate survive the interview.</p>

<p>The metrics one would get from such interviews are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The ability to recall the implementation details of some algorithms or data
structures. A rarely used trait outside of the interview because you can
always look those things up. Some companies are outright recommending “Cracking
The Coding Interview” as a pre-interview practice. Let’s face the facts: how
many times have you referred to that book while working? This ability is not a
good predictor of whether the candidate will generate value. Learning recipes
by heart doesn’t guarantee a good chef. Memorizing traffic laws doesn’t make
you a safe driver. Why do you think remembering programming puzzles will
produce a great software engineer?</p></li>

<li><p>The ability to imagine outcomes. Questions like: what if the app has 10x more
clients? What if memory pressure increases? What interviewers hope to measure
is building or system design skills. Instead, they measure imagination, which
is an entirely different trait. Of course, experienced candidates can share
more war stories of things going wrong. But, unless you test the candidate’s
design with an actual 10x load, all you get is speculation.</p></li>

<li><p>How much the candidate’s thinking process aligns with that of an interviewer.
They ask the same questions to many candidates and expect the usual answers.
If they encounter a unique solution, they have to counteract their confirmation
bias. As a brilliant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer_question">Barometer</a> legend shows, this spawns further than software
engineers’ interviews. And thus, the candidate’s ability to deliver value
remains unmeasured.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Typical hiring loops can generate a sporadic great hire or two, but they are
not consistent in doing so. Like a coin toss, sometimes they yield the opposite
results, and making a bad hire is an expensive mistake. Burned by it, the
company will invest more resources trying to protect itself. The common-sense
approach is to pause and investigate why the hiring loop produced the mistake
in the first place. However, the hiring loop is usually the last to suspect –
after all, it brought the company to its current state, so it must be working,
right? That simple conclusion cloaks the hiring loop from improvement, and it
remains deficient. Instead of implementing the constructive changes, the
company raises the bar to entry. They start using trickier puzzles or asking
the candidates to design more complicated systems, sometimes while still
operating within the time frame of a typical one-hour on-site interview. That
undoubtedly makes interviews more brutal and harsh. Fewer candidates survive
them, and the company sees it as a positive change.</p>

<p>But that neither improves their filtering nor protects them from bad hires.
They get the same data points, again and again, never improving the signal to
noise ratio. If they raise the bar too high, they throw the baby out with the
bathwater as they start to pass on talent. All those metrics from the above
become a single one: can the candidate avoid making mistakes. Errare humanum
est, remember?</p>

<p>If the company does that for too long, then the hiring decisions become
protective and based on fear. Instead of highlighting the value that the
candidate brings to the table, the interviewers will seek a reason to reject
them. If they couldn’t find it, they will resort to biases and personal
inclinations. Training interviewers to reject the candidates will only produce
more efficient rejections.</p>

<blockquote>Tell me how you measure, and I will tell you how I will behave.
<p>Eli Goldratt, The Haystack Syndrome</p></blockquote>

<p>Improper metrics at the core of your hiring loop will make it yield inefficient
results. To fix that, we need to address the root cause and base the loop on a
better set of metrics.</p>

<h2 id="a-better-set-of-questions">A better set of questions</h2>

<p>We have refined three questions that determine a practical hiring decision for
a software engineer:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Can the candidate do the actual work?</li>
    <li>Can we work together?</li>
    <li>Does the candidate want to work with me?</li>
</ol>

<p>This set is not a silver bullet that will drive your hiring loop from zero to
success. It is neither a secret knowledge nor a magic trick. Instead, it is the
common sense behind a hiring loop based on a proper metrics. Let’s explore them
in-depth so that you can build a similar hiring loop at your company.</p>

<h3 id="can-the-candidate-do-the-actual-work">Can the candidate do the actual work?</h3>

<p>Or, as we prefer to frame it: can the candidate deliver something that works in
production.</p>

<p>As simple as it looks, this is the main and the first thing you need to measure
about the candidate. Your company is there to build your product, not solve
riddles on a whiteboard. Your hiring loop should select for the ability to
contribute to the former, not the latter.</p>

<p>It is hard to measure the ability to perform without letting candidates do the
actual work. Companies that can’t measure it resort to proxy metrics and
instead try to predict the future. They check what they can, and they hope the
correlation will be on their side. Google used to ask ridiculous brain teasers
(and disgorged a horde of imitations). They stopped doing it because it turned
out to be <a href="https://qz.com/96206/google-admits-those-infamous-brainteasers-were-completely-useless-for-hiring/">completely useless</a> for hiring. Surprise? No, not at all. Just
another example that using improper metrics will yield unsatisfactory results.</p>

<p>The best way to check that someone can do real work is to allow them to do real
work. That is also the first thing you need to check before you engage in more
expensive interviews. The good news is that it is possible to do both.</p>

<h3 id="can-we-work-together">Can we work together?</h3>

<p>Or, in other words, the cultural fit question.</p>

<p>This metric is orthogonal to the previous, and you should measure it
separately. There will be candidates who can deliver exceptional code but who
can’t cooperate. And there will be candidates who fit your culture like a glove
yet can’t ship a single line of code to production. An efficient hiring loop
accurately handles both of those extremes and anything in between.</p>

<p>Companies usually try to measure this trait with “meet the CEO” style
interviews. That is not enough, as it is prone to unconscious biases of the
person performing the interview. To measure this metric correctly, you would
need to do some self-reflection first. You will need to understand what is the
culture that you are trying to build.</p>

<blockquote>Culture is the Behavior You Reward and Punish
</blockquote>

<p>The tough aspect of this measurement is that it is difficult to automate. It
will likely involve expensive human time, which is expensive to scale with the
demand. Therefore, we recommend performing this measurement at the end of your
hiring pipeline. This way, it will not become a costly bottleneck.</p>

<h3 id="does-the-candidate-want-to-work-with-me">Does the candidate want to work with me?</h3>

<p>The ultimate decision to join your company belongs to the candidate. They are
the ones who will accept the offer or reject it. Interviews work both ways, and
this phase of the loop is when the candidate measures your company. The
experience you provide to them during the interview will be with them for a
long time. They will share it with their friends and colleagues, tweet about
it, and discuss it online.</p>

<blockquote>They may forget what you said, but they will never forget how you
made them feel.<p>Carl W. Buehner</p></blockquote>

<p>Invest in giving them the best experience possible. Your company will stand out
by being friendly, transparent, and approachable. If you want to be bold, allow
them to interview you, and do not judge their questions, but answer them
truthfully. Let them relax and be themselves, and you will help them picking
you for their next adventure.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Basing your hiring loop on the right metric could be what turns a stagnating
company into a thriving one. That will allow you to start bringing the best
talent aboard consistently. At this point, you no longer bet on a coin toss.</p>

<p>The next step is to automate the assessment and put it at the beginning of your
hiring loop. That will allow your interviewers to focus only on candidates that
can deliver. At this point, you no longer waste resources.</p>

<p>What’s left is to concentrate on building the best culture you aim to have and
stand out.</p>

</ul><p>The Indian government might soon allow companies to go ahead with a four-day work week. The Union Ministry of Labour and Employment is working on new labour codes which will make way for a three-day weekend, but will keep the </p><keyword keytype="person" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="working-hours" keynameseo="Working-hours" actualkeyword="Working hours">working hours</keyword><p> at 48 hours a week, which means employees might be subject to long days. 
</p><p>
“Companies will have to give three days’ of paid leaves and 12 hours of work per day to their employees with the consent of the workers. We are not forcing employees or employers. It gives flexibility. It’s an enabling provision in sync with the changing work culture. We have tried to make some changes. We have tried to give flexibility in working days,” said

Especially, given that employees, in many cases, are made to work beyond five days in a week currently.
</p><p>In India, employees work way beyond 48 hours a week – crossing the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) norms of working. According to the labour standards. “the general standard is 48 regular hours of work per week, with a maximum of eight hours per day.” says the ILO website.
</p><p>
    The changes will be a part of the new labour codes, whose draft rules are being formulated by the government. It will also provide free medical check-ups to workers through the Employees State Insurance Corporation, according to 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/new-labour-codes-to-allow-4-day-work-week/article33784975.ece" rel="nofollow">reports.</a></p><p>
The four-day work week is not a new topic. It started off as a debate in Germany when the country’s largest trade union – IG Metall, called for a four-day week in 2020. And this, even when Germany already has the lowest working hours in a week at 34.2 hours.
</p><p><span>Advertisement</span></p><figure><div></div></figure><hr><p>Then came Microsoft's experiment in 2019 in its Japan office, where 
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/microsoft-experimented-with-a-4-day-work-week-in-its-japan-office-and-productivity-jumped-by-40/articleshow/71901595.cms">productivity jumped by 40%,</a> as a four-day week made for the perfect work-life balance. And it wasn’t just great for the employees; the number of pages printed was down, electricity consumption was a lot less as well. 
</p><p>
A World Economic Forum survey of businesses that had implemented the policy showed that it can help companies “make savings of almost £92 billion (around 2% of total turnover) each year”.
</p><p>
    But there are also challenges said the WEF survey, especially, in the service sector where four days might not be enough to meet consumer expectations and demands.

        <p><em>Hey! Today I have something different for you. Itâ€™s a piece about the weird world of LinkedIn â€” from celebrity </em>workfluencers<em> to the strange social features that feel out of place. This is a guest essay from <a href="https://twitter.com/fadeke_adegbuyi">Fadeke Adegbuyi</a>, senior marketing manager at Doist and a fan of all things internet culture. I think youâ€™re going to like it! ðŸ˜†</em></p><p><em>- Nathan</em></p><p><em> </em>LinkedIn is the fucking worst.</p><p>Despite our collective confusion about the platform, its enthusiastic embrace by HR departments and recruiters has ensured its success. Even though it was <a href="https://news.linkedin.com/2020/july/a-message">forced to lay off 1,000 employees</a> because of the pandemic, they still increased their&nbsp;Q<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2020-Q4/press-release-webcast">4 revenue by 10%.</a> As of Q3 of 2020, the company has over 722 million users and is truly internationalâ€“â€“just 26% of their members are based in North America. With revenue largely powered by recruiting solutions, paid job listings, and advertising, LinkedIn knows how to appeal to businesses at scale. LinkedIn doesnâ€™t need <em>you</em> to like it.</p><p>But, the companyâ€™s consumer-side remains in the midst of a long-standing identity crisis. Feature bloat and odd idiosyncrasies make the site a superbly strange social network. Many of us have profiles but donâ€™t log in for months at a time. Our â€œAboutâ€� sections point to better ways to be reached. Others, seemingly alive and well, have claimed on their pages to have died.</p><p>LinkedIn bills itself as an online destination, like a conference held at a 5-star hotel where big thinkers give big speeches, deals get made in private corners, and you can â€œbuild and engage with your professional network.â€� But many of us see it as a not-so-funhouse, with wacky mirrors, jumpout surprises, and peculiar attractions. Can I interest you in a tour?</p><h2>Copy-Cat Cemetery&nbsp;</h2><p>LinkedIn recently released Stories, a vertical video feature copied from Instagram, who better stole it from Snapchat. LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/119760/linkedin-stories-overview?lang=en#:~:text=LinkedIn%20Stories%20enable%20members%20and,of%20their%20everyday%20professional%20moments.&amp;text=LinkedIn%20shares%20Stories%20that%20you,recent%20version%20of%20the%20app.">suggests</a> users â€œshare images and short videos of their everyday professional moments.â€� Released in the midst of a global pandemic during a mass migration to remote work, itâ€™s unclear whether we should showcase cramped work setups on kitchen tables or restless kindergarteners interrupting the 143rd minute of a Zoom.&nbsp;</p><p>Available only on LinkedIn's iOS and Android apps, this begs the question...<em><strong>Who is using LinkedIn on their phone?</strong></em> The platform would like you to believe that celebrities are. A permanent Story from LinkedIn shows a reel of workfluencers â€“â€“Mark Cuban, Arianna Huffington, Deepak Chopra â€“â€“ posting professionally shot high-definition videos of their work days.</p><p><a href="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_40ac9496-fcd6-4638-9b55-64f17ba91976_1600x1067.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_40ac9496-fcd6-4638-9b55-64f17ba91976_1600x1067.png"></a></p><p>A tagline ends the montage: â€œShare your story.â€� At last glance, only a single one of my 1000+ connections is using the feature.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast, Twitter is seeing early success with Fleets, their own copy-cat story feature that users have been receptive to, posting baby photos and dog pictures in between subtweets and shitposts. Feature imitation isnâ€™t a bad strategy. But LinkedIn Stories was dead on arrival. No one in the boardroom asked the critical question: <em>Who cares?</em></p><h2>The Audio Trolls</h2><p>Audio apps, like Clubhouse, Chalk, and Rodeo point to the power of sound-based social. Twitter released voice tweets earlier this spring and is currently working on an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">audio spaces feature</a>. LinkedIn has taken their own steps into voice with a handful of audio features. Like most things on the platform, they feel out of place.&nbsp;</p><p>The sentiment behind their name pronunciation feature on personal profiles is a positive one, but hasnâ€™t seen wide adoption for its intended purpose. Since the feature was launched, Iâ€™ve heard people with the most pronounceable of names use the feature for anything from inserting a 10-second clip from The Office to playing a song snippet at 2x speed. A now common but unintended use case is delightful trolling:</p><ul><li>At one point, Jeff Hui used the feature to ironically <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffistyping/status/1304947619651817477?s=21">shout an elevator pitch at recruiters</a></li><li>On Riva-Melissa Tezâ€™s profile, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/riva-melissa-tez-661a0aab/">she declares herself â€œQueen Beeâ€�</a></li><li>Ben Taylor, who includes â€œclick 4 soundâ€� in his name, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bentaylordata/">rickrolls his profile visitors</a></li></ul><p>On a site where people declare Ivy League associations, summa cum laude status, and internships at investment banks, cheeky irreverence for work culture warps the throughline of respectability that LinkedIn intends. Trolling LinkedIn, while on LinkedIn, is a break from the BusinessTM of polished headshots and corporately crafted â€œExperienceâ€� sections. Itâ€™s ironic participation on a platform where youâ€™re <em>meant</em> to be performing professionalism.&nbsp;</p><p>At times, it feels like LinkedIn is actively building features for the intended purpose of trolling. Within LinkedIn messages, users can hold down a microphone icon to record their voice. An audio snippet is an oddly intimate option for starting a professional conversation with a stranger. Perhaps thatâ€™s the point. But attempting to speed up relationships with overly familiar features is a â€œpersonal touchâ€� unwelcome in the world of networking, already so fraught with faux pas.</p><p>An innocent but outlandish 39-second audio message, sent by â€œ<a href="https://twitter.com/okcandice_/status/1285956830045380608?s=21">Jimmy from LinkedIn</a>â€� went viral as a case of networking-gone-not-quite-right:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>â€œHello Candice, how are you doing and good morning. How have you been? Hey Candice, this is me, Jimmy from LinkedIn. And the reason I was giving you this quick voice message call was to say thank you so kindly. I really appreciate that you have accepted me here on the LinkedIn platform. What we will do is learn from each-other. I appreciate your kindness. Jimmy from LinkedIn.â€�</blockquote><p>Though it doesnâ€™t feel malicious, itâ€™s just <em>off</em> to encounter this kind of weirdness in the same space you seek new job opportunities and professional updates from former colleagues and classmates. Itâ€™s the stuff that makes you pause and say, <em>Where am I?</em></p><h2>InMail Infinity</h2><p>The premise of the platform, bringing professionals together, is a challenging one from the start. People hate networking. Also, theyâ€™re bad at it.&nbsp;</p><p>For users, LinkedIn â€œnetworkingâ€� often means receiving a barrage of InMail and connection requests. You might recognize some or all of these:</p><ol><li><strong>The bad sales pitch</strong>: Sales people and business development people will slide into DMs to peddle their companyâ€™s products, whether youâ€™re the right person to buy or not. Usually not.</li><li><strong>The professional neg</strong>: Recruiters ask senior level employees if theyâ€™re interested in entry level roles or, better yet, internships.</li><li><strong>The just-in-case connection</strong>: Industry peers will suggest itâ€™s â€œmutually beneficialâ€� to connect, but donâ€™t specify these benefits up front.</li><li><strong>The endangered business school</strong>: Admissions teams are now online shilling once-coveted seats in their dwindling MBA programs. Based on your profile and experience, they think youâ€™re a â€œgreat fitâ€� and want you to apply.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The eager seeker</strong>: Some people see LinkedIn messages as an alternative resume and cover letter submission portal. This is why that endless string of people in your messages inquire about roles outside your departmentâ€¦ or outside your company.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The LinkedIn team</strong>: If their emails notifying you about connection requests wasnâ€™t enough, LinkedIn also maintains a direct line to your InMail. Expect prompts to try Premium, credits to advertise your company, and messages about whatever else theyâ€™re feeling.</li><li><strong>The proposition</strong>: Linkedin stands in the long-tradition of <em>every</em> site becoming a dating site. Or, er, a place to sexually harass people. If you havenâ€™t gotten one of these messages in your InMail, you know someone who has.</li></ol><p><a href="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_de8db43f-b1b6-454a-83a2-fe92f9bed869_1600x480.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_de8db43f-b1b6-454a-83a2-fe92f9bed869_1600x480.png"></a></p><p>Overfull InMail and random connection requests feels like a never-ending chore. You get enough work emails and donâ€™t need any more. LinkedInâ€™s constant drip of communication is just more work on top of the real work you have to do.&nbsp;</p><p>Linkedinâ€™s inbox infinity isnâ€™t just annoyingâ€”it detracts from the usability of the platform. Unless youâ€™re embracing a new position of processing and answering everything that comes through, if a real connection came along, how would you know?</p><h2>The Cursed Timeline</h2><p>At any given point on your LinkedIn timeline, youâ€™ll see a corporate blog post shared by someone you know, a marketing sales pitch from someone you donâ€™t, and a news story about COVID-19. Their timeline is similar in this way to other social networks, where you see posts made or liked by your connections, people and brands you follow, and promoted posts that people pay to get in front of you. This cacophony of content is bizarre, but not atypical â€“â€“ social feeds optimize for engagement, here as everywhere.&nbsp;</p><p>Whatâ€™s uniquely odd about LinkedIn is that it is not unique. â€œThe professional networkâ€� is still just a social network. Though the topics of the posts in your timeline may be on the world of work, diving into the comments, you can see polarization in action. Inspirational posts on giving parents grace while working from home during the pandemic have angry rants suggesting that kids are a personal choice and their burden shouldnâ€™t be foisted upon colleagues. Beneath articles on workplace harassment, sympathetic discussions ensue on why someone might naturally retaliate after being romantically rebuffed. A political article about the 2020 US presidential election draws comments on whether former President Barack Obama was really Black.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_96580804-aafd-41cc-896c-028a895490d6_1600x272.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_96580804-aafd-41cc-896c-028a895490d6_1600x272.png"></a></p><p>In a time when the collective conversation is consumed by the topic of human cancellation, people readily post things on LinkedIn that make them fireable or unhireable.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_758c1270-4c2a-4e06-8dbc-7dc0e356a568_1600x540.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_758c1270-4c2a-4e06-8dbc-7dc0e356a568_1600x540.png"></a></p><p>While these comments are nothing new in terms of online culture, they feel out of bounds on a professional website where people use their full names and disclose precisely where they work and the city they live in. In the alternate universe of LinkedIn, cancel culture either doesnâ€™t exist, its inhabitants are blissfully unaware, or they simply donâ€™t care.</p><p><a href="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_befe2496-abfd-4e7a-a29f-8dc8a3889521_1600x259.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_befe2496-abfd-4e7a-a29f-8dc8a3889521_1600x259.png"></a></p><h2>The Rockstar Recruiters</h2><p>The strangest of Linkedinâ€™s features isnâ€™t a feature at all; itâ€™s a specific set of power users.&nbsp;</p><p>Every platform has its royalty.

<p>A few weeks ago Tesla/SpaceX CEO Elon Musk announced on Twitter that he is donating <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2021/01/23/elon-musk-donating-carbon-capture-technology/">$100M for innovating the best carbon capture technology</a>. At the time, it was just an announcement, now further details and how to apply for the grant have emerged.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/musk-foundation/">The Musk Foundation</a> has selected XPRIZE.org to manage this fund which is the largest-ever prize for the cause donated by an individual. </p>



<p>XPRIZE will open registrations for the competition starting this year’s Earth Day (April 22nd, 2021) and the competition will run continuously for four years to find the best carbon capture solution. Currently, XPRIZE is only taking the email addresses of the interested persons or companies on the <a href="https://www.xprize.org/prizes/elonmusk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">organization’s website</a> that will keep you updated with the happenings and notify you as soon as the application date arrives.</p>

<p>XPRIZE and Elon Musk will most likely be considering teams that are able to showcase the ability to reduce the carbon footprint on Gigaton levels. A technology capable of making a ‘truly measurable impact’ is what Musk and XPRIZE tea is looking for. </p>



<p>Gigaton (or gigatonne) is a unit of measuring mass that equals a billion metric tons. In other words, if an aircraft is able to carry 1 ton, it will take 10,000 aircraft carriers to lift a gigaton. The website of NASA <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2933/visualizing-the-quantities-of-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">visually explains</a> ‘how big is a gigaton’, roughly equal to a sheet of ice placed on top of Central Park in Manhattan stacked 1,119 feet high.</p>



<p>The solutions presented by the participating teams will also have to be scalable and cost-effective in order to win the grant, says XPRIZE.</p>



<h2>How To Win</h2>



<p>XPRIZE web page for Elon Musk’s $100M donation details the following key points that can help a team win the prize.</p>



<blockquote><p>To win the competition, teams must demonstrate a rigorous, validated scale model of their carbon removal solution, and further must demonstrate to a team of judges the ability of their solution to economically scale to gigaton levels. The objective of this XPRIZE is to inspire and help scale efficient solutions to collectively achieve the 10 gigatons per year carbon removal target by 2050, to help fight climate change and restore the Earth’s carbon balance. </p><p>Teams can submit entries across natural, engineer and hybrid solutions.&nbsp; Judges in the competition will evaluate the teams based upon four basic criteria:</p><p>– A working carbon removal prototype that can be rigorously validated and capable of removing at least 1 ton per day.</p><p>– The team’s ability to demonstrate to the judges that their solution can economically scale to the gigaton level.</p><p>– The main metric for this competition is fully considered cost per ton, inclusive of whatever considerations are necessary for environmental benefit, permanence, any value-added products; and</p><p>– The final criteria is the length of time that the removed carbon is locked up for. A minimum goal of 100 years is desired.</p><cite>Source: <a href="https://www.xprize.org/prizes/elonmusk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XPRIZE</a></cite></blockquote>

        How does one reliably display digital artwork originally created by Andy Warhol on the Amiga 1000 in the 80s? This was the challenge laid out for Iontank by The Andy Warhol Museum after Cory Arcangel and a team from Carnegie Mellon University’s Computer Club successfully recovered digital Warhol images from floppy disks that had gone overlooked in the museum’s archives. <p> Iontank proposed creating Amiga replicas out of decommissioned Amiga 1000s. All internal components were replaced with new solid-state hardware so the units would be more stable as they toured the globe, but Iontank also took great care to restore and integrate the original mice and keyboards so they would work with the new systems. Even the lights on the monitor and case illuminate as intended. </p><p> Replacements for the antique CRT screens were also prototyped. Promising projection tests were ultimately abandoned in favor of an industrial LCD screen, but it still lacked the dimensionality of a CRT. The solution was for Iontank to mill a clear acrylic lens that mated perfectly with the original monitor housing and matched the original screen curvature. To complete the illusion, Iontank created a custom Amiga 1000 emulator and file system to allow users to explore the images themselves. The emulator even recreated the slow disk access and lag of the beloved Amiga.</p><p> A second version of the Warhol Amiga system was also commissioned that allows users to experiment with a simulation of the GraphiCraft application Warhol had used. This Amiga lets visitors capture images using a digital camera and try their hand at creating Warhol-inspired artworks of their own.

      <p><span>For Jayson DeMers, tracking his employees’ productivity was an obvious choice when the pandemic hit. As the CEO of a productivity monitoring software company himself, DeMers was ahead of the curve. “We use Hubstaff here at EmailAnalytics for tracking hours,” he told the Business of Business. Hubstaff tracks the amount of time contractors spend on tasks, taking random screenshots as evidence. “And for email productivity, we use our own app, EmailAnalytics.”</span></p>
<p><span>EmailAnalytics silently tracks employees’ email activity and displays it in&nbsp;interactive tables and graphs. Employers can track average email response time, top senders and recipients, and email activity by hour of the day or day of the week. In 2020, two years after its launch, demand in DeMers’ product grew with the widespread shift to work-from-home. From January to December of last year, EmailAnalytics’ organic users per month increased from a little under 10,000 to nearly 25,000.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“People behave differently when they know they're being monitored or held accountable for their on-the-clock activity,” DeMers says. “I've had unfortunate experiences in the past, before implementing monitoring tools, so these days I just get ahead of the problem and prevent it before it can start.”</span></p>
<p><span>Hubstaff and EmailAnalytics are far from the only productivity monitoring software companies benefitting from the COVID crisis. Awareness Technologies, the parent company of InterGuard, a market leader in employee monitoring software, claimed the company had seen three to four times growth in its customer base during the first two months of the pandemic. (Hubstaff made a similar </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/13/employee-monitoring-tools-see-uptick-as-more-people-work-from-home.html"><span>claim</span></a><span>, saying the number of companies trialing its technology grew by two to three times in the same period.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>Competitors in "bossware" battle it out&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;use&nbsp;of productivity monitoring software, or “bossware,” has been&nbsp;growing&nbsp;for years, and WFH accelerated and normalized the trend.&nbsp;A 2019&nbsp;Gartner <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-future-of-employee-monitoring/">survey</a> of 239 corporations found that more than half were already employing “nontraditional monitoring techniques.” The&nbsp;market's&nbsp;expansion reveals itself in some of the key players’ web traffic data.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Workpuls’ daily pageview count shot up over 1000% from 2019 to 2020, reaching an average of 1.9 million in December. Time Doctor, yet another competitor in the productivity monitoring software space, hit 5.9 million average daily pageviews in July after hovering around 2 million throughout 2019.</span></p>
<p><span>Over the past two years, ActivTrak’s daily average has soared over 200%. The company’s web traffic has been climbing since 2019, when it hit 3.9 million daily pageviews. From March to July of last year, pageviews increased by 153% to a daily average of 5.6 million.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Teramind, a computer monitoring software company that specializes in workplace productivity tools, peaked at 9.9 million daily pageviews last July, up from July 2019’s 1.1 million average. That’s a whopping 800% increase.</span></p>

<p><span>According to </span><a href="https://honestlydebatable.substack.com/p/ethical-musings-on-bossware-and-its"><span>data gathered by Elise DeCamp</span></a><span> of the early stage VC firm Bloomberg Beta,&nbsp;most&nbsp;bossware companies lack any major venture capital. Veriato, Hubstaff, Vericlock, and Interguard have not listed raising any capital on Crunchbase. ActivTrak, Teramind, and Workpuls are the lone leaders, the only ones that have raised capital. ActivTrak recently raised $70 million in a Series B, Teramind has raised $6 million since its 2014 launch, and Workpuls launched in 2016 with seed funding.</span></p>
<p><span>Some of the biggest companies in the world use bossware, DeCamp points out. Instacart, Groupon, and Ring all use Hubstaff. Time Doctor counts 83,000 customers, including Allstate, Ericsson, Verizon, and Re/Max. ActivTrak is used by over 6,500 organizations, including Arizona State University, Emory University, and the cities of Denver and Malibu.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Taking pageviews, clientele, and funding into account, ActivTrak seems to be the present winner. What’s more? ActivTrak partners with Okta, the cybersecurity unicorn that’s publicly traded with a $34 billion market cap.</span></p>
<h2><span>Typical features&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>Bossware collects basically everything that happens on a device. The most common feature is “activity monitoring," which includes a log of applications and websites that workers use. Sometimes it will keep track of who they contact via email and posts on social media. Many tools&nbsp;record&nbsp;how much a user types and clicks to provide&nbsp;<span>minute-by-minute productivity reports and charts</span>. Most services&nbsp;take frequent screenshots of workers' screen and display them on daily timelines. Keylogger functions record&nbsp;workers' keystrokes, including unsent emails, private passwords, and other personal data. Some&nbsp;services&nbsp;go as far as tracking employees' GPS&nbsp;locations and activating webcams and microphones on worker devices.</p>
<p>Below is a breakdown of leading surveillance services' main features,&nbsp;based on research done by the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/06/inside-invasive-secretive-bossware-tracking-workers">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>.</p>

<h2>Inherent risks for&nbsp;all parties&nbsp;</h2>
<p><span>Some employers will be transparent with their workers about using productivity monitoring services. “What I have learned is that it's crucial to let employees know they're being monitored,” DeMers says. “That creates accountability, eliminates performance lapses, and boosts productivity.” Other companies, of course, make this information private, and&nbsp;the&nbsp;surveillance software&nbsp;helps them keep the secret.</span></p>
<p>Teramind and Time Doctor<span>&nbsp;</span>design&nbsp;their software&nbsp;to be as difficult to detect and remove as possible,&nbsp;similar<span>&nbsp;</span>to stalkerware.&nbsp;<span>InterGuard’s </span><a href="https://www.interguardsoftware.com/employee-monitoring-software/"><span>website</span></a><span> advertises that its “employee monitoring software can be silently and remotely installed, so you can conduct covert investigations [of your workers] and bullet-proof evidence gathering without alarming the suspected wrongdoer.”&nbsp;</span><span>This evidence can be used to “fight wrongful termination suits.” In other words, employers can secretly collect their workers' private information</span><span>&nbsp;to use against them and deflect blame if a worker were to&nbsp;</span><span>take legal action against unfair treatment</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Employers’ use of surveillance software is technically legal and specific rules vary from state to state. But laws around consumer data privacy are evolving alongside productivity monitoring tools. The potential future risk for these software companies and the organizations using their services is uncertain.&nbsp;</span><span>And while many employers using the software report positive feedback, the lack of privacy doesn’t just threaten the workers’ security, it could work against the companies’ bottom line.</span></p>
<p><span>“The irony of it is [productivity monitoring software] is going to lead to less productivity, because there's less trust...it creates more resentment,” Josh Davies, CEO at the Center for Work Ethic Development, says.&nbsp;</span>“I think it truly has to be a human solution. People forget the things that are most effective in managing people are still high touch skills. Rather than having an electronic watchdog, we can build the trust that the work is going to get done. The idea that you're constantly checking in only further erodes the trust that you need to have as an organization during this time of remote work.”</p>
      

      
      <h3>About the Data:</h3>
      <p>
        Thinknum tracks companies using the information they post online, jobs, social and web traffic, product sales, and app ratings, and creates data sets that measure factors like hiring, revenue, and foot traffic. Data sets may not be fully comprehensive (they only account for what is available on the web), but they can be used to gauge performance factors like staffing and sales.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div id="ExplainGitCommit-Container">
      <p>
        We are going to skip instructing you on how to add your files for commit in this explanation.
        Let's assume you already know how to do that. If you don't, go read some other tutorials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pretend that you already have your files staged for commit and enter <span>git commit</span>
        as many times as you like in the terminal box.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitTag-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git tag name</span> will create a new tag named "name".
        Creating tags just creates a new tag pointing to the currently checked out commit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tags can be deleted using the command <span>git tag -d name</span> (coming soon).
      </p>
      <p>
        Type <span>git commit</span> and <span>git tag</span> commands
        to your hearts desire until you understand this concept.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitBranch-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git branch name</span> will create a new branch named "name".
        Creating branches just creates a new tag pointing to the currently checked out commit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Branches can be deleted using the command <span>git branch -d name</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Type <span>git commit</span> and <span>git branch</span> commands
        to your hearts desire until you understand this concept.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitCheckout-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git checkout</span> has many uses,
        but the main one is to switch between branches.<br>
        For example, to switch from master branch to dev branch,
        I would type <span>git checkout dev</span>.
        After that, if I do a git commit, notice where it goes. Try it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to checking out branches, you can also checkout individual commits. Try it.<br>
        Make a new commit and then type <span>git checkout bb92e0e</span>
        and see what happens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Type <span>git commit</span>, <span>git branch</span>,
        and <span>git checkout</span> commands to your hearts desire
        until you understand this concept.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitCheckout-b-Container">
      <p>
        You can combine <span>git branch</span> and <span>git checkout</span>
        into a single command by typing <span>git checkout -b branchname</span>.
        This will create the branch if it does not already exist and immediately check it out.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitReset-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git reset</span> will move HEAD and the current branch back to wherever
        you specify, abandoning any commits that may be left behind. This is useful to undo a commit
        that you no longer need.
      </p>
      <p>
        This command is normally used with one of three flags: "--soft", "--mixed", and "--hard".
        The soft and mixed flags deal with what to do with the work that was inside the commit after
        you reset, and you can read about it <a href="http://git-scm.com/2011/07/11/reset.html">here</a>.
        Since this visualization cannot graphically display that work, only the "--hard" flag will work
        on this site.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ref "HEAD^" is usually used together with this command. "HEAD^" means "the commit right
        before HEAD. "HEAD^^" means "two commits before HEAD", and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that you must <b>never</b> use <span>git reset</span> to abandon commits
        that have already been pushed and merged into the origin. This can cause your local repository
        to become out of sync with the origin. Don't do it unless you really know what you're doing.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitRevert-Container">
      <p>
        To undo commits that have already been pushed and shared with the team, we cannot use the
        <span>git reset</span> command. Instead, we have to use <span>git revert</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>git revert</span> will create a new commit that will undo all of the work that
        was done in the commit you want to revert.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitMerge-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git merge</span> will create a new commit with two parents. The resulting
        commit snapshot will have the all of the work that has been done in both branches.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there was no divergence between the two commits, git will do a "fast-forward" method merge.<br>
        To see this happen, checkout the 'ff' branch and then type <span>git merge dev</span>.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitRebase-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git rebase</span> will take the commits on this branch and "move" them so that their
        new "base" is at the point you specify.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should pay close attention to the commit IDs of the circles as they move when you do this exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason I put "move" in quotations because this process actually generates brand new commits with
        completely different IDs than the old commits, and leaves the old commits where they were. For this reason,
        you never want to rebase commits that have already been shared with the team you are working with.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitFetch-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git fetch</span> will update all of the "remote tracking branches" in your local repository.
        Remote tracking branches are tagged in grey.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitPull-Container">
      <p>
        A <span>git pull</span> is a two step process that first does a <span>git fetch</span>,
        and then does a <span>git merge</span> of the remote tracking branch associated with your current branch.
        If you have no current branch, the process will stop after fetching.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the argument "--rebase" was given by typing <span>git pull --rebase</span>, the second step of
        pull process will be a rebase instead of a merge. This can be set to the default behavior by configuration by typing:
        <span>git config branch.BRANCHNAME.rebase true</span>.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitPush-Container">
      <p>
        A <span>git push</span> will find the commits you have on your local branch that the corresponding branch
        on the origin server does not have, and send them to the remote repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        By default, all pushes must cause a fast-forward merge on the remote repository. If there is any divergence between
        your local branch and the remote branch, your push will be rejected. In this scenario, you need to pull first and then
        you will be able to push again.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitClean-Container">
      <p>
        One simple example of the use of <span>git reset</span> is to completely restore your local repository
        state to that of the origin.<br>
        You can do so by typing <span>git reset origin/master</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that this won't delete untracked files, you will have to delete those separately with
        the command <span>git clean -df</span>.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitFetchRebase-Container">
      <p>
        Below is a situation in which you are working in a local branch that is all your own. You want to receive the latest code
        from the origin server's master branch. To update your local branch, you can do it without having to switch branches!
      </p>
      <p>
        First do a <span>git fetch</span>, then type <span>git rebase origin/master</span>!
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitDeleteBranches-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git branch -d</span> is used to delete branches.
        I have pre-created a bunch of branches for you to delete in the playground below.
        Have at it.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitFree-Container">
      <p>
        Do whatever you want in this free playground.
      </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The more complex your system gets, the more we need to lean on the correct abstractions to keep things maintainable. This principle helps you keep your methods and functions focused, cohesive, and easy to understand in a system with several abstractions.</p></div><div id="html-wrapper"><div><p>Some people think programming is similar to story-telling. If that's the case, then <strong>good code is an incredibly boring and one-dimensional story</strong>. </p>
<p>Here are two stories.</p>
<p><img src="https://khalilstemmler.com/img/blog/design-principles/maintain-a-single/two-stories.png" alt="Two stories - mixed abstractions"></p>
<p>Be honest. Which of those two stories did you finish reading? <strong>The first one, right</strong>? </p>
<p>But why? </p>
<p>Well, the <em>first story</em> is quick and succinct. We get a birds-eye view of what's going on, and if we're curious to know more, we can ask and go a level deeper. The <em>second story</em> gives us everything. And it's pretty fatiguing.</p>
<hr>
<p>The more complex your system becomes, the more you need to lean on abstractions to keep code readable and maintainable.</p>
<p>Since much of software development is <strong>reading code</strong>, using encapsulation and information-hiding to abstract away complexity and lower-level details becomes critical. </p>
<p>Used correctly, the plus side of this is that we end up with code that's easier to read, easier to ramp up and learn the domain, and it <em>can</em> — along with tests, even act as the primary form of documentation.</p>
<p>Used <em>incorrectly</em>, or <em>not at all</em>, we end up with <a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/wiki/leaky-abstraction">leaky abstractions</a>, poor cohesion, and (since "we're always building an API") poor APIs for our fellow teammates and future maintainers to build on top of. </p>
<p>Therefore, the object-oriented design principle in question is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maintain a Single Layer of Abstraction at a Time (or <em>in other words,</em> Don't Mix Different Levels of Abstractions)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By maintaining a single layer of abstraction at a time, we write <strong>more</strong> <strong>cohesive</strong> and <strong>loosely coupled</strong> functions, methods, classes, and modules, which in turn improves the <em>readability</em> and <em>maintainability</em> of your code.</p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at this and how it works.</p>
<h2 id="Prerequisite-reading">Prerequisite reading<a href="#Prerequisite-reading" aria-label="Prerequisite reading permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Before reading this article, I highly recommend the following. I've noted the relevant takeaways from each, but I recommend reading them if you find yourself confused or you don't find yourself aggressively nodding your head in agreement.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/wiki/coupling-cohesion-connascence">Coupling, Cohesion &amp; Connascence</a> — Entropy (complexity) is at the heart of what makes it hard to write software. To tame complexity, we decompose the problem into smaller parts. But software is only useful when those parts are connected. Coupling and cohesion are the two best measurements of the quality of our decomposition attempts. We should strive for <strong>loose coupling</strong> and <strong>high cohesion</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>(Abstraction) Layers | Wiki</strong> — We use layers (domain, application, infrastructure, and adapter) to decompose a web application's complexity into separate concerns. The introduction of layers means more classes (and evidently, the coupling between layers of classes  — though we can use <a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/tutorials/dependency-injection-inversion-explained/">Dependency Inversion</a> to mitigate this). Still, <strong>it can bring the benefit of higher cohesion within classes</strong>.</li>
<li><a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/wiki/leaky-abstraction">Leaky abstractions</a> — If we need to know about an object's internals to use it correctly, depending on the layer of abstraction, we may be leaking implementation details. This leads to <strong>lower cohesion</strong> and <strong>tighter coupling</strong> between components.</li>

<h3 id="Whats-happening-here">What's happening here?<a href="#Whats-happening-here" aria-label="Whats happening here permalink"></a></h3>
<p>The <code>habitsPage</code> is an abstraction over a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer">Puppeteer</a> instance that loads and stores habits from my Notion habits page. We then create a <code>CalendarService</code> (domain service) by passing in both a <code>habits</code> collection and a <code>calendar</code> object.</p>
<p>We then run a series of <code>Promise.all</code> statements, passing the create, update, and delete actions to the correct <code>googleCalendar</code> method.</p>
<p>Finally, we tell the <code>habitsPage</code> to clean up — and by this, we're really telling the Puppeteer instance to destroy itself to free up resources.</p>
<h2 id="Problems">Problems?<a href="#Problems" aria-label="Problems permalink"></a></h2>
<p>There are some subtle issues.</p>
<h3 id="Application-layer-responsibilities">Application layer responsibilities<a href="#Application-layer-responsibilities" aria-label="Application layer responsibilities permalink"></a></h3>
<p>Let's first remember the responsibilities of a use case in the <a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/software-design-architecture/organizing-app-logic/#3-Application-Logic--Use-Cases">application layer</a> in a layered (clean, hexagonal, etc.). Regarding the application layer:</p>
<ul>
<li>It contains the features — the <em>use cases</em>, of our application</li>
<li>It is concerned with the rules that govern the application itself. For example, in a pet grooming application, a <a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/software-design-architecture/organizing-app-logic/#Domain-Layer">domain layer</a> business rule might state that <strong>a pet must have an owner</strong>. Such invariants could be enforced within <a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/typescript-domain-driven-design/entities/">entities</a>, <a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/typescript-value-object/">value objects</a>, and <a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/typescript-domain-driven-design/aggregate-design-persistence/">aggregates</a> within the domain layer. Conversely, an application layer rule might enforce the fact that you can only <strong>edit a grooming appointment</strong> <strong>if you're one of many owners of the pet (authorization logic)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And <a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/enterprise-typescript-nodejs/application-layer-use-cases/">use cases</a> (one of the main implementation patterns from the application layer) primarily exist to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retrieve domain objects from IO (using <a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/typescript-domain-driven-design/repository-dto-mapper/">repositories</a> to databases or adapters to external APIs) so that it orchestrate the execution domain objects' encapsulated business rules and persist any events or state changes they create.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://khalilstemmler.com/img/blog/design-principles/maintain-a-single/application-layer.svg" alt="Application layer"></p>
<p>With that in mind, we can call out a few <em>leaking abstractions</em> in the first attempt of this design.</p>
<h3 id="Problem-1-Leaking-abstraction-Calling-load-on-the-habits-page">Problem #1: [Leaking abstraction] Calling <code>load</code> on the habits page<a href="#Problem-1-Leaking-abstraction-Calling-load-on-the-habits-page" aria-label="Problem 1 Leaking abstraction Calling load on the habits page permalink"></a></h3>
<p>Notice that the first thing we do in the <code>execute</code> method of the <code>SyncHabitsToCalendar</code> use case is to call <code>load(waitTimeInMilliseconds: number)</code> on the <code>habitsPage</code> object?</p>
<p>useCases/syncHabitsToCalendar.ts</p>
<div data-language="tsx"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>SyncHabitsToCalendar</span> <span>implements</span> <span>UseCase</span><span>&lt;</span><span>void</span><span>,</span> <span>void</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Why should the use case need to know that we need to <code>load</code> the <code>habitsPage</code> before fetching something from it? If we didn't call <code>load</code> and instead just called <code>getAllHabits</code>, what would happen? </p>
<p>We'd always get an empty list back. Behind that <code>load</code> method is the process of:</p>
<ul>
<li>starting up a puppeteer browser instance</li>
<li>going to the page to load the habits</li>
<li>using cheerio.js to scrape the habits and parse them into domain objects</li>
</ul>
<p>Needing to call <code>load</code> before we can call <code>getAllHabits</code> is an example of a <a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/wiki/leaky-abstraction">leaky abstraction</a>. We <em>appear</em> to abstract away the complex details of getting all the habits from my Notion page. Instead, we've shifted the knowledge required to utilize this object's API onto the user (which, in the real world, could be a coworker or a future maintainer). That's not great. </p>
<p>A leaky abstraction like this can lead to a lot of bugs, and evidently — frustration. </p>
<p><b>Bonus (aside)</b>: Mark Phillips (Supreme Dreams) has a really funny video that almost perfectly demonstrates the idea of a leaky abstraction in real life. <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/SupremeDreams_1/status/1294011465259790339">Check it out</a>.</p>
<p>To fix this problem, we could relocate the logic to a better place: inside the <code>HabitsPage</code> class. Here, we encapsulate knowing when to call <code>load</code> in <code>HabitsPage</code> with the following:</p>
<p>services/HabitsPage.ts</p>
<div data-language="tsx"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>HabitsPage</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
	<span>public</span> <span>async</span> <span>getAllHabits</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Promise</span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Habits</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>	  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>hasLoadedHabits</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><span>	    <span>await</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>5000</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><span>	  <span>}</span></span>	
	  <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>habits<span>;</span>
	<span>}</span><span></span>
<span></span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Client usage in the use case looks like this now:</p>
<p>useCases/syncHabitsToCalendar.ts</p>
<div data-language="tsx"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>SyncHabitsToCalendar</span> <span>implements</span> <span>UseCase</span><span>&lt;</span><span>void</span><span>,</span> <span>void</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2>The Labeling Problem</h2><p>The efficacy of a machine learning model is limited to the quality and quantity of data being used to train the model. The most powerful models typically require massive amounts of data to train. If the target variables in the model are categorical, there is an equally massive amount of labels in the dataset. Unfortunately, most of these labels are done by hand-- a painstakingly slow and resource intensive process. The time and resources that come with labeling datasets by hand creates inefficiencies in many machine learning pipelines. The categorical datasets that data scientists and programmers often learn from – such as those hosted on the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php">UCI Machine Learning Repository </a>or those preprocessed and uploaded to <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">Kaggle</a> – are idealized cases that do not reflect the typical reality of handling categorical data. In these datasets, someone has already taken the time to clean and process the data, providing the labels needed to train machine models. In real-life cases, this is usually not the case.</p><p>The origin of the categorical data labels often varies with the type of data in question. For example, pattern-recognition algorithms are often trained on labels provided through crowdsourcing. An algorithm trying to distinguish dogs from cats in images relies on humans to label each image beforehand. In ambiguous images, multiple people can assign different labels, resulting in a lower confidence for each category. On the other hand, medical diagnoses are often given in degrees of confidence either by some predefined test or by the doctor themselves. Similarly, natural language processing algorithms use confidence metrics to evaluate which definition of a word to employ (and, therefore, which meaning is intended) based on the context in which it is used. Despite the apparent categorical nature to these use cases, the reality can be quite the opposite.</p><p>Common in all of these cases is the association of a <em>probability </em>with the label. Whether the probability is simply an ensemble of multiple labels or intrinsic to the labeling methodology, the machine learning algorithms that train on these datasets must be able to handle probabilistic data labels. In some sense, the probability of a label is more informative than the label itself, as it also conveys the degree of confidence for a given observation. Understanding how to take advantage of this, and which approaches to handling these probabilistic data labels produce better models is a practical skill for data scientists and programmers encountering real-world categorical datasets. Additionally, tools that speed up or automate the labeling process in the machine learning pipeline resolve the inefficiencies that come with human labeling. Programmatically labeling is one such approach to do so.</p><p>In this tutorial, I use Python to walk through several different approaches to using probabilistic data labels to train machine learning models. I use a dataset that has both probabilistic labels and true labels to show that, if the probabilistic labels are of high quality, they are more than sufficient in constructing high performance machine learning models.</p><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>To follow along with the code in this tutorial, you’ll need to have a recent version of Python installed. I use the <a href="https://anaconda.org/">Anaconda Navigator</a> for all my programming needs, but the code used in this tutorial is generalized to work with any Python 3.7 distribution. To install Anaconda, go <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/">here</a>. &nbsp;You can find all of the code and data used on my <a href="https://gitlab.com/dsblendo/prob_data_labels">GitLab repository</a>.</p><p>All of the packages I will be using are prebuilt into the Anaconda distribution, except for the <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras package</a>. Keras provides us with the building blocks to construct our neural nets. To install for use in Anaconda, we can use <a href="https://conda-forge.org/">conda-forge</a> (you may also have to <a href="https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/introduction.html">install conda-forge</a>):</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;conda install -c conda-forge keras&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><p>Alternatively, if you are using another Python distribution, you can install Keras with pip:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;pip install keras&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><p>To import the necessary packages and functions that we will use, in Python run:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;<strong>import</strong> numpy <strong>as</strong> np<br><strong>import</strong> pandas <strong>as</strong> pd<br><strong>import</strong> matplotlib.pyplot <strong>as</strong> plt<br><strong>from</strong> sklearn.metrics <strong>import</strong> accuracy_score<br><strong>from</strong> sklearn.metrics <strong>import</strong> precision_recall_fscore_support <br><strong>from</strong> sklearn.model_selection <strong>import</strong> train_test_split<br><strong>from</strong> sklearn.feature_extraction.text <strong>import</strong> TfidfVectorizer<br><strong>from</strong> keras.models <strong>import</strong> Model<br><strong>from</strong> keras <strong>import</strong> optimizers<br><strong>from</strong> keras.layers <strong>import</strong> Input, Dense, Dropout&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><p>If any error indicates that a package cannot be found, simply install it using the same syntax as above, switching out the package name as needed. <br>‍</p><p>The data I will be working with is the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/wanderfj/enron-spam">Enron Spam classification dataset</a> from Kaggle. The dataset contains the text from 33,715 emails that are classified as either wanted (ham) or unwanted (spam). &nbsp;As can be seen below, the &lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; column contains the text of each email. We will use this text to train our model to classify the email as either ham or spam. </p><p>The &lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;Spam_Gold&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt; column contains the ‘gold’ labels included in the original <em>.csv</em> file from Kaggle: 0 for ham and 1 for spam. There is an additional column that is not in the original Kaggle dataset: the &lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;Spam_Pred&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;<em> </em>column<em>.</em> This column contains probabilistic labels from 0 to 100 (rather than the binary labels in the &lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;Spam_Gold&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt; column) that indicate the probability of each email belonging to the spam class. </p><p>These probabilities were programmatically labeled using <a href="https://www.watchful.io/">Watchful</a>, without looking at the original gold labels. It would take days for a human to label each email to by hand, while Watchful accomplished this in around 3 hours. &nbsp; </p><p>To import the dataset, we can use the<em> </em>&lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; package:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;file_path = 'watchful_export.csv'<br>email_df = pd.read_csv(file_path)<br>email_df.head()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><p>The output should look something like this:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c4e081336a4_lMVu2dmf4RMJnd1IEucaulz17cuRIdK4qweUknWLuduEplP55gg4a9TYNu-OtnZW5uvadw8pTtl3fFnq3gPXhlkg4zbzD2azXTUmdcV5YOBF1R5BYANjItlhYmXjNmjbbkUR0zJD.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>All set? Let’s go.</p><h2>Exploring the Data</h2><p>Before we get to the model implementation, it is always a good idea to explore the data we are working with. We can also compare the probabilistic data labels provided by Watchful with the original gold labels and evaluate how well the algorithm did. In most real-life cases, this is not possible, as the true labels are either limited to a few observations, not known at all, or have poor quality. </p><p>First, it is worth looking at the distribution of spam and ham emails in the gold labels and the probabilistic labels. This gives us an idea of the balance of the dataset, as well as how well the probabilistic labels match up to the gold labels. &nbsp;</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;gold_col_name = 'Spam_Gold'<br>pred_col_name = 'Spam_Pred'<br>text_col_name = 'Text'<br>pct_spam = email_df[gold_col_name].sum() / email_df.shape[0]<br>pct_ham = 1 - pct_spam<br>pct_spam, pct_ham&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c78a41336c8_VtYibTj6IYwpv8vQnofsEzLXZknIAdMi-NyTfM8ep6hDCBAIm1-nF7ZJGwK2hGhgq-Kv2n4XKObnIri8Nd9vTg8g8Jocgok0BPzgRvey6eUbl1xuCBdEanlQdeESi2KdGvf7yHlK.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>So, the dataset has nearly an equal distribution of spam and ham emails. Dealing with sparse data is not trivial for most machine learning algorithms. Fortunately, we don’t have to worry about it. As, expected, the histogram of gold labels is nearly equal in height:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;plt.hist(email_df[gold_col_name])<br>plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c35f4133692__jnMfpcDBpKOL_PUwnyz0kWOWBaZaRA2v8hf5CsFdfQBMSTqqmR7qFd2chzDdjsKYgwmaUqsF_EZ_wPPfgxwp-Ylb0Y6IW8y8XqSSVaEPKIk63E6mKwMKt2rC4cdQXP9nrCRJ-Fp.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>And for the probabilistic labels:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;plt.hist(email_df[pred_col_name])<br>plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551ccb721336ec_fcbwX4G08cR9jGH2dHljz611Pmh4PXe1xLE_1hRmApL3Bx-qTG5nMZwTQS9g141qSpW2Bk6JktXXrvBjayV8Hw41vqpGso3MBR8Hi8Lni2nwtlaObjuu2IbQKwr_Y6NCP_Hs-dGc.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The distributions are pretty similar. This is an indication that the probabilistic labels assigned by Watchful are well aligned with the gold labels – a promising sign for being solely generated by the email text. </p><p>‍</p><p>From a qualitative perspective, certain characteristics of the emails are bound to correlate with either being spam or ham. For example, one could imagine that curt, plain text is probably not an advertisement for some product and is therefore an indicator of a ham email. On the other hand, text that is long and superfluous is generally more common in advertisements, and may indicate a spam email. </p><p>To get an idea of the distribution of the number of words used in the emails, we can take advantage of Python’s list comprehension syntax:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;lengths = np.array([len(doc.split()) <strong>for</strong> doc <strong>in</strong> email_df[text_col_name]])<br>pd.DataFrame(lengths).describe()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c243c1336b6_EYN_5xU56hJ15QgNOLP3EmEqd6gF-mP-PgWbdv-JyDiBLvPYUFapSe0m5yP1tZ_gS-OeoWU-JQrhyjCf04-MSbqO0DO30rd-X22ToTLL8M9bcYFkRTxlua8mGFmeB31oa226knO9.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>And to visualize the email length distribution:</p><p>&lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;plt.hist(lengths[lengths &lt; 1000])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><p>&lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c99b21336da_yrc6gT2jZBziyvh20WyReaApqY-f8qhxSmFPhCQCQI6wuX7bouHAKja3bGZlMy8knBZcVrh-9Qtlgnmc6GWxyv61Fz5YEGbK5DniKzEJmf7_wLRdUg3eSbGHnqk8JbGX-od97H__.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The distribution is heavily skewed, as expected for a text-based communication medium – most emails are relatively short, and the probability of a longer email scales inversely with the length. It is also worth looking at the number of unique words used in each email. This distribution should mimic the right-skewed distribution of the email word length. </p><div><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;vocabs = np.array([len(set(doc.split())) <strong>for</strong> doc <strong>in</strong> email_df[text_col_name]])</p><p>pd.DataFrame(vocabs).describe()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p></div><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c88f91336fd_X4k57jF3VKR00pfNdxr0-ORZUR-251vs9tYtt_a1eS0qHzaZzbYzd70XF8woxKHUTIK8WWiXVT8fKhkhz2zU-DU0a6zWgIjreGsU3UJU1Y_HIekb1m_LuiOrrrVKstQwOdaxXXs5.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;plt.hist(vocabs[vocabs &lt; 500])<br>plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c5422133707_or_uT0Z79lUjkht-xysIgvUqg6HoUvC-9EeyNSthoNmR_MvnxdxNlfhNDsi8d3ZyLcOYOglhndXgBIA9Zi3bmADhcXj4qcPMP1rOot2lrsndJ4u7THPsbl58L1RnIpAKUUrMVCNc.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The distribution is reasonable relative to the email length distribution. One would expect that common articles (‘a’, ‘the’, ‘and’, etc.) &nbsp;are repeated several times in a given email, and the true number of unique words is 2-4x lower than the total number of words. We can also check how well the probabilistic labels align with the gold labels, assuming a probability higher than 50% indicates a spam. &nbsp;</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;email_df[pred_col_name] = email_df[pred_col_name].apply(<strong>lambda</strong> r: 0 <strong>if</strong> r &lt; 50 <strong>else</strong> 1)<br>accuracy_score(email_df[gold_col_name], email_df[pred_col_name], <strong>True</strong>)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c6a16133706_Q83d1T3H5OHW4HC4iQ84zH8JVqFP9q83zDKUmhtQL21ZHkoJSBBmY5dXGJKjksN-Lt1Uvue8HguhFTD327Aziu14VYr25kjDwhiyvxUZzUDuqRoxqw3GGRW_I6RIyWhcCNm2Adts.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The agreement is pretty good assuming a simple 50% threshold.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>In this blog post we’ll investigate certain advanced concepts related to Kubernetes init containers, sidecars, config maps, and probes. We’ll show you how to implement these concepts in your own cluster, but more importantly how to apply these to your projects in <a href="https://releaseapp.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Release</a>&nbsp;for both fun and profit.</p><p>We’ll start with a brief introduction to pods and containers in Kubernetes, and then show specific examples of each item listed above. Below you will find a drawing of these examples to keep yourself oriented during our bumpy ride ahead.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qf96nnjfyr2y/5StzQNBGjSiQRmuBATNdH1/c58328398227bd62299b87e5b70ed280/Understanding_Advanced_Kubernetes_Concepts.jpg" alt="Advanced Kubernetes Pod Concepts"></p><h2 id="key-kubernetes-pod-concepts">Key Kubernetes Pod Concepts</h2><p>Before we begin, let’s get a brief overview of some key concepts.</p><h3 id="container">Container</h3><p>In Docker, a container is an image that bundles layered filesystems which can be deployed as a runnable bundle. This container is usually built with a Dockerfile and has a startup binary or executable command.</p><h4 id="sidecar-container">Sidecar Container</h4><p>A <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/#how-pods-manage-multiple-containers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">sidecar container</a>&nbsp;is simply a container that runs alongside other containers in the pod. There’s no official definition of a sidecar concept. The only thing that distinguishes a container as a sidecar container is that you consider it ancillary or secondary to the primary container. Running multiple sidecar containers does not scale well, but does have additional advantages of being able to reuse configuration files and container images. The reason sidecars do not scale well is that they may be overprisioned or wasteful based on the performance of the main application container. However, the tradeoffs can make sense in legacy applications or during migrations toward truly cloud-native designs.</p><h4 id="init-container">Init Container</h4><p>An <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">init container</a>&nbsp;is simply a container that runs before any other containers in the pod. You can have several init containers that run sequentially. As each container finishes and exits properly (with a zero!), the next container will start. If an init container exits with an error or if it does not finish completely, the pod could go into a <a href="https://releaseapp.io/blog/kubernetes-how-to-debug-crashloopbackoff-in-a-container" title="Read our other blog post on debugging the dreaded CrashLoopBackoff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">dreaded CrashLoopBackoff</a>. All of the containers share a filesystem, so the benefit here is that you can use or reuse container images to process, compile, or generate files or documents that can be picked up later by other containers.</p><h4 id="probes">Probes</h4><p>Although the word “probes” may stir up visions of Alien tools used for discovery and investigation of humans, fear not. These probes will only make your services run better! Kubernetes has <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">several probes</a>&nbsp;for defining the health of containers inside a pod. A startup probe allows the scheduler to tolerate delays in a slow-startup container. A liveness probe allows Kubernetes to restart a faulty or stalled container. A readiness probe allows a container to receive traffic only when it is ready to do so.</p><h3 id="pod">Pod</h3><p>You may harbour some fear in the back of your mind of “pod people” or vegetable clones grown to replace humanity with mindless zombies who hunt and destroy mankind. However, in Kubernetes, the smallest managed unit is the pod. But a pod could be composed of several containers that run in a single process space and filesystem. A pod is usually composed of one container that runs a single process as a service. However, there are several advanced usage examples we will go into that run multiple containers for expanded options and use cases.</p><h3 id="node">Node</h3><p>A Kubernetes node is ultimately a physical machine (which can have several layers of virtualisation) that runs the pod or pods, providing the critical CPU, memory, disk, and network resources. Multiple pods can be spread across multiple nodes, but a single pod is contained on a single node.</p><h3 id="volumes">Volumes</h3><p>Volumes are simply abstractions of filesystems that can be mounted inside containers. You cannot overlap or nest volume mounts. However, there are several mount types that might be very useful to your use case.</p><h4 id="configmap">configMap</h4><p>A <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#configmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">configMap</a>&nbsp;is a so-called “blob” of information that can be mounted as a file inside your container. Remember, that this is not an evil, destructive blob out to devour our planet! It is a batch of text that is treated amorphously, like a… well… blob. The usual use case here is for a configuration file or secrets mount.</p><h4 id="emptydir">emptyDir</h4><p>An <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">emptyDir</a>&nbsp;is an empty filesystem that can be written into and used by containers inside a pod. The usual use case here is for temporary storage or initialization files that can be shared.</p><h4 id="hostpath">hostPath</h4><p>A <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#hostpath" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">hostPath</a>&nbsp;is a filesystem that exists on the Kubernetes node directly and can be shared between containers in the pod. The usual use case here is to store cached files that could be primed from previous deployments if they are available.</p><h4 id="persistent-volume-claim-pvc">Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)</h4><p>A <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">persistent volume claim</a>&nbsp;is a filesystem that lasts across nodes and pods inside a namespace. Data in a PVC are not erased or destroyed when a pod is removed, only when the namespace is removed. PVCs come in many underlying flavors of storage, depending on your cloud provider and infrastructure architecture.</p><h3 id="namespace">Namespace</h3><p>A Kubernetes namespace is a collection of resources that are grouped together and generally have access to one another. Multiple pods, deployments, and volume claims (to list a few) will run together, potentially across multiple nodes.</p><h2 id="sidecars-and-init-containers">Sidecars and Init Containers</h2><p>The first use case we will cover involves running several containers inside a single pod. Once again, a pod here refers to one or more containers grouped together in Kubernetes, not vegetable human clones grown for evil reasons. In the following scenario, we will examine how multiple containers can share a single process space, filesystem, and network stack.</p><p>Keep in mind that most docker and Kubernetes purists will tell you that running more than one process in a container, or having more than one container in a pod is not a good design and will inevitably lead to scalability and architectural issues down the road. These concerns are generally well founded. However, careful application of the following supported and recommended patterns will allow you to thrive either during your transition from a legacy stack to Kubernetes or once you are successfully running your application in a cluster.</p><p>One particular use case we encounter with customers is that their application has a backend container that requires a reverse proxy like Nginx to perform routing, static file serving, and so forth. The best method to achieve this objective would be to create a separate pod with Nginx (for example) and run the two service pods in a single namespace. This gives us the flexibility to scale the backend pods and Nginx pods separately as needed. However, typically the backend service or application needs to also serve static files that are located inside the container filesystem and would not be available across the pod boundary. We agree this is not a preferred pattern to use, but it is common enough with legacy applications that we see it happen.</p><p>In this scenario, we often recommend a sidecar container running Nginx which can be pulled directly from Docker Hub or a custom image can be created. We also recommend that customers reuse their backend application container as an init container that starts with a custom command for creating any initialization or other startup tasks that need to be completed before the application itself starts.</p><p>One feature of this multi-container setup is that the Nginx container can use the “localhost” loopback to communicate with the backend service. Of course the sidecar container might be a logging or monitoring agent, but the principle is the same: the containers can speak with each other over a private network that is potentially not available outside of the pod, unless you make it available. In our Nginx example, the backend could be isolated so that all communication traffic inbound to the service container must be routed to the Nginx proxy.</p><p>The other nice feature of this configuration is that the containers all share a common file system so that the Nginx container can access static files generated by (or stored on) the backend service container.</p><p>Here is a link to our documentation that shows an example of running <a href="https://docs.releaseapp.io/reference-guide/application-settings/application-template#sidecar-containers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">sidecar</a> and <a href="https://docs.releaseapp.io/reference-guide/application-settings/application-template#init-containers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">init</a>&nbsp;containers on Release.</p><h2 id="probes-1">Probes</h2><p>As we have noted, probes are not just for Aliens! Kubernetes uses them to test your application stack and report on its health. Kubernetes will also take action based on these probes, just like an Alien might. There are several probes that are supported natively by Kubernetes. The main use cases we support for our customers are the liveness probe and readiness probe.</p><p>The liveness probe is a way to test whether a container is “alive” or not, and if it fails the probe, then Kubernetes will restart the container. We usually recommend that your application not freeze up or have memory leaks and so forth so that a liveness probe should not be necessary. This “reboot your app to fix the problems” philosophy is not generally considered good practice. However, perfect code is impossible and when services are running in a production container environment, we know that almost anything can (and will) happen.</p><p>The readiness probe is a way to test whether a container is capable of serving traffic or not, and if it fails the probe, then the service port will be removed from the ingress controller. Contrary to our stance on the liveness probe, we strongly encourage and recommend that customers implement a readiness probe on any service that receives inbound traffic. In some sense, we consider a readiness probe mandatory for your production services.</p><p>Here is a link to our documentation that shows an example of using a <a href="https://docs.releaseapp.io/reference-guide/application-settings/application-template#readiness-and-liveness-probes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">liveness and readiness probe</a>&nbsp;for services running in Release.</p><h2 id="volumes-1">Volumes</h2><p>This section gets a bit technical and tricky. Of course, no actual customer stacks would use every single type of volume, container, and probe listed in this article. But we do hope this overview shows all the features that are possible. You should carefully consider the use cases presented below and choose the one that best fits your use case.</p><p>Here is a link to our documentation that shows options for our <a href="https://docs.releaseapp.io/reference-guide/application-settings/application-template#resources" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">storage volume types</a>.</p><h3 id="configmap-just-in-time-file-mounts">configMap (Just in Time File Mounts)</h3><p>A …</p></div></article></div>

<p><span>With Manta Ray, DARPA hopes to field a payload-capable UUV able to operate for long-duration, long-range missions in ocean environments. One of the most critical components of Manta Ray is the development of new undersea energy harvesting techniques that could end up having an immense impact on all sectors of the naval and maritime industry.&nbsp;</span></p>

Some of DARPA’s requirements for Manta Ray are classified and remain unknown. The initial proposers day session was classified at the SECRET level, and potential proposers had to hold, at minimum, an active SECRET clearance to attend.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After reviewing submitted proposals, in March of 2020, </span><a href="https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2020-03-10"><span>DARPA awarded contracts</span></a><span> to four companies to work on the Manta Ray program. Three of the awardees – Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories, Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, and Martin Defense Group, LLC (then Navatek, LLC) – were selected to work on the overall Manta Ray platform. A fourth company, Metron Inc., was chosen to work specifically on undersea energy harvesting technologies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This week, DARPA announced the completion of preliminary design reviews and that three of the previously selected four companies were chosen to advance their Manta Ray concepts. In an </span><a href="https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2021-02-05a"><span>announcement, </span></a><span>DARPA said Northrop Grumman and Martin Defense Group were chosen to move forward with overall vehicle design in preparation for vehicle fabrication and testing. Additionally, Metron, Inc. will continue working on energy solutions for the prototype UUVs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“The goals of this new class of undersea vehicle and its critical component technologies are to inform, as well as transition into, future Navy UUV efforts,” said CDR Kyle Woerner, program manager for Manta Ray.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The Department of Defense has identified the development of both underwater and </span><a href="https://thedebrief.org/ghost-fleet-overlord-passes-latest-sea-trials/"><span>surface unmanned vehicles</span></a><span> as a pressing need for the U.S. Navy right now. A </span><a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/R45757.pdf"><span>Congressional Research Service report,</span></a><span> issued in late December 2020, notes the Navy’s desire to rapidly field unmanned vehicles into its fleets “can be viewed as an expression of the urgency that the Navy attaches to meeting future military challenges from countries such as China.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The U.S. Navy has a couple of different large-scale underwater drones currently in development. The </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hisutton/2019/12/17/the-us-navys-new-orca-drone-submarine-could-get-offensive-role/?sh=32821fc60ca9"><span>Boeing Orca</span></a><span> intends to be an “extra-large” UUV, capable of launching from a forward operating port or pier and capable of deploying modular payloads, including underwater mines. Meanwhile, another program, code-named “</span><a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/38443/snakehead-will-be-the-largest-underwater-drone-that-u-s-nuclear-submarines-can-deploy"><span>Snakehead</span></a><span>,” will be a large-displacement unmanned undersea drone that can be carried and deployed by nuclear-powered submarines.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>A June 2020 </span><a href="https://www.defensenews.com/naval/2020/06/01/to-compete-with-china-an-internal-pentagon-study-looks-to-pour-money-into-robot-submarines/"><span>study of future Navy force-level requirements</span></a><span> by the DoD recommended, among other things, a future Navy would need as many as 50 extra-large unmanned underwater vehicles or XLUUV.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>&nbsp;Manta Ray Could Be a Renewable Energy Game Changer</h2>
<p><span>DARPA aims to add UUV capable of persisting underwater for extremely long durations to the Navy’s emerging unmanned fleet. To accomplish this, the most critical goal of Manta Ray involves advancing undersea energy management techniques.</span></p>
<p><span>To date, renewable naval propulsion has either involved human-propelled vessels or sail-powered ships. One is extremely labor-intensive, the other uncontrollable and dependent on when and where the breeze blows. Modern alternative methods, such as coal and oil, are costly, require frequent refueling, and negatively impact the environment. Meanwhile, advanced techniques involving nuclear reactors require large vessels, are expensive, and pose potential hazards to the crew and environment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For small underwater drones, which cannot carry a nuclear reactor or large-capacity batteries, to carry our long-term underwater missions, the development of novel energy technologies is an absolute necessity. As a </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2019/03/f61/Chapter%203.pdf"><span>Department of Energy (DOE) report</span></a><span> on underwater vehicle charging notes, “Although AUVs [autonomous underwater vehicles] are a cheaper alternative to traditional vessels, power capacity of the vehicle’s battery remains a limiting factor and keeps their missions limited in range and duration, often as little as 24 hours.”&nbsp;</span></p><div><div id="block-wrap-85348" data-id="85348"><div><div><div>		<article>

<p><span>Underwater docking and recharging stations could extend mission duration for UUVs. However, as the DOE notes, “underwater docking stations are under development and not yet available commercially as they lack a practical power generation source.”</span></p>
<p><span>With Manta Ray, DARPA plans to advance critical technologies that could ultimately benefit future UUV designs, including the development of:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Novel energy management techniques for UUV operations and undersea energy harvesting techniques at operationally relevant depths.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Low-power, high-efficiency undersea propulsion systems.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>New low-power means of underwater detection and classification of hazards or counter detection threats;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Mission management approaches for extended durations while accounting for dynamic maritime environments;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Unique approaches for leveraging existing maritime data sets and exploiting novel maritime parameters for high-efficiency navigation and/or C3; and</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>New approaches to mitigate biofouling, corrosion, and other material degradation for long-duration missions.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Ultimately, Manta Ray and the development of new novel underwater energy methods could end up being one of the biggest game-changers in modern naval history. “If successful, this new class of UUV will give the combatant commander an amplification of capacity without disrupting current operations by remaining independent of manned vessels and ports once deployed,” notes a </span><a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/manta-ray"><span>statement</span></a><span> provided by DARPA.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In hopes of discovering a breakthrough undersea energy solution, Manta Ray program participant Northrop Grumman </span><a href="https://www.northropgrumman.com/what-we-do/sea/mission-unlimited-inventing-autonomous-recharging-of-unmanned-underwater-vehicles/"><span>announced a partnership</span></a><span> with </span><a href="https://seatrec.com/contact/"><span>Seatrec</span></a><span>, a California company that focuses on harvesting renewable energy for underwater drones. Seatrec holds </span><a href="https://seatrec.com/technology/"><span>multiple patents and has invented several products</span></a><span> that extract energy from the ocean’s thermal gradient – the difference in temperature between warmer mixed water near the surface and colder water below — and converting it to electricity.</span></p>
<p><span>Later this year, the three selected contractors will advance their Manta Ray designs toward maturity before an anticipated “Phase 2” involving fabrication and testing will begin.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Manta Ray performers have each taken unique approaches to solving the wide range of challenges related to UUV endurance,” said CDR Woerner. “To me, this is a clear sign we are tackling a complex problem without a clear ‘one size fits all’ solution.”</span></p>

For a company that is building products based on a more inclusive future, this investment is a step on that journey.”<br></p><h3>PayPal Furthers Understanding and Acceptance of Crypto</h3><p>In late 2020, Another U.S.-based financial services provider, PayPal, launched a new feature enabling users to buy, hold, and sell crypto (namely Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin for now) from their PayPal accounts.<br></p><p>By legitimizing crypto as a funding source for purchases at any of the 26 million merchants around the world where PayPal works, <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2020-10-21-PayPal-Launches-New-Service-Enabling-Users-to-Buy-Hold-and-Sell-Cryptocurrency" target="_blank">the company aims to “significantly increase cryptocurrency's utility”</a> as well as consumer understanding of the digital currency.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Fidelity First of Its Kind to Go Digital (Assets, That Is)</h3><p>In the first quarter of 2019, one of the largest asset management firms in the world with approximately $3.3 trillion in assets under management — Fidelity Investments Inc. — started offering Bitcoin custody services via their subsidiary, Fidelity Digital Assets.<br></p><p>Since then, <a href="https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2020/12/09/fidelity-digital-assets-now-allows-bitcoin-as-collateral/" target="_blank">Fidelity graduated from just custody operations</a> to launch a Bitcoin mutual fund that’s available to accredited investors. In addition, there’s Fidelity Charitable, which accepts donations in the form of digital currencies.&nbsp;<br></p><p>These developments make Fidelity, founded in 1946 in Massachusetts, one of the first among “traditional” financial firms to dive into the world of alternative assets.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Cambridge Associates Encourages Crypto Exploration</h3><p>In a 2019 report aptly titled “Cryptoassets: Venture into the Unknown,” the widely-trusted global investment and advisory firm <a href="https://medium.com/@HuttCapital/reflecting-on-cambridge-associates-blockchain-investment-research-piece-d06bc3af0469" target="_blank">Cambridge Associates recommended that institutional investors start exploring digital assets</a> such as crypto.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And exploring they are.&nbsp;<br></p><figure id="w-node-cbf9a7f1-26c6-7b12-ee8a-199aab191383-ac468d02"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ded36b5e942e74b13468d23/601862c7623399e336716e88_vZliBvVna390iTpE6RPBeYNkYAtJhtHY_Zc5tsRZQois0d2ijFclg9fdamUMoMGbjAXS8zjeibDjWv1IqZANfh70GK2-nhHhIQN2jC-UU_R4zKoNna1x2TJZIYA5DkKERl6fhoTZ.png" alt="Cambridge Associates Encourages Crypto Exploration"></p></figure><p>According to a study by the relatively new subsidiary Fidelity Digital Assets, nearly 80% of the 774 American and European <a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/digital-asset-investment">institutional investors they surveyed found digital assets “appealing.”</a>‍</p><p>In fact, close to 40% had already invested in digital assets and 60% said it was only a matter of time before they’d be adding digital assets to their portfolios. Bitcoin was the most popular digital asset among respondents.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“These results confirm a trend we are seeing in the market towards greater interest in and acceptance of digital assets as a new investable asset class,” <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200609005138/en/Growing-Number-Institutional-Investors-Digital-Assets-Part" target="_blank">added president of Fidelity Digital Assets, Tom Jessop</a>. “This is evident in the evolving composition of our client pipeline, which spans from crypto native funds to pensions.” <br></p><h2>2021 Trends That May Further Crypto’s Acceptance</h2><p>As if major money authorities entering the crypto space isn’t enough, there are even more trends that show how crypto will continue to grow in mainstream acceptance in 2021 and beyond.<br></p><h3>A New American Administration Could Propel Crypto Forward</h3><p>January 20, 2021, marked a drastic shift in American politics as Joe Biden became the 46th president of the United States.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Crypto enthusiasts are hopeful this new party will be more welcoming of digital currency, of which <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-i-am-not-a-fan-of-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-105950093.html" target="_blank">the previous administration was “not a fan.”</a>&nbsp;<br></p><p>“I think we have opportunity in a Biden administration,” <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/11/11/biden-presidential-win-seen-as-a-good-thing-for-cryptocurrency/" target="_blank">said Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“I think what we see with a Biden administration is an opportunity to get some fresh faces into the key regulatory agencies that might be more willing than some of the other regulators that we have today to move forward on policies that would be good for crypto.”<br></p><p>One such fresh face is Gary Gensler — former investment banker; current leader of the Biden–Harris transition's Federal Reserve, Banking and Securities Regulators agency review team; and <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/gary-gensler-nominated-chair-sec-0119" target="_blank">nominee for the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The fact that Gensler teaches courses on global economics and financial technologies at the MIT Sloan School of Management is an indication that his involvement, as well as the involvement of others like him, mean good things for crypto’s advancement in American over the four years, at least.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Your Own Bank Might Even Get On Board With Crypto</h3><p>In the fall of 2020, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/kraken-crypto-exchange-secures-bank-charter-under-wyoming-law" target="_blank">Kraken was the first cryptocurrency firm in the U.S. to become a bank</a>, thanks to the special purpose depository institution (SPDI) charter granted by the state of Wyoming — a surprising early supporter in the mainstream adoption of crypto.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Then in January of 2021, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency made a big move in the banking-digital currency relationship by <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/crypto-prices-jump-after-u-s-regulator-says-banks-can-use-stablecoin-connect-to-blockchains-11609811050#" target="_blank">releasing a letter to U.S. financial institutions permitting them to use stablecoins</a> (a type of cryptocurrency) and participate as nodes in a blockchain.<br></p><p>Translation? U.S. banks are officially legally authorized to deal in crypto-based transactions.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We’re happy to agree with the Blockchain Association, <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockchainAssn/status/1346233501604052992" target="_blank">which called the announcement</a> “ … a giant advance for crypto because it paves the way for these networks to be a formal part of the [U.S.] financial infrastructure.”<br></p><h3>Digital Currency Competitors Are Likely to Rise&nbsp;</h3><p>Noting the gradual — and recently, more meteoric — growth in the value of Bitcoin since it entered the spotlight, it’s only a matter of time before large companies get into the digital currency market.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And we think that’s a good thing. In addition to the options that more digital currencies introduce to consumers, they also put pressure on expensive and time consuming traditional transactions to do better.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Facebook’s (newly-named) <a href="https://www.bitrates.com/news/p/facebooks-diem-will-the-global-cryptocurrency-go-live-in-2021#:~:text=Facebook%20and%20the%20Diem%20Association,plans%20have%20been%20made%20official." target="_blank">Diem cryptocurrency is already slated to launch early in 2021</a>. And there are the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/google-coin-within-2-years-as-fangs-will-go-crypto-say-winklevoss" target="_blank">rumors among crypto insiders</a> that several of the other tech leaders are or will soon be working on their own digital currencies.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If companies with the budget and reach of these global giants can get their digital currencies off the ground, we expect to see an explosion of interest in, understanding of, and eventual adoption of cryptocurrencies.<br></p><p>To sum it up very, very briefly: Crypto is going mainstream. That means it’s likely going to make up some element of your investment portfolio soon.<br></p><p>The problem? Your traditional financial tracker isn’t equipped to stay on pace with these rapid developments.<br></p><p>Here’s everything you need to know to keep up.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>What Makes Kubera the Best Financial Tracker in a World That’s Going Crypto</h2><p>If you’re like the vast majority of modern investors who need (or will soon need) their traditional portfolio management tools to work with alternative investments — you’re in for a bad ride.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It’s time to switch over to a financial tracker that’s built to manage all your assets, from the traditional to the alternative to the digital, in one place.<br></p><p>Kubera is a modern financial tracking app that was created by a small team of investors who needed a tool that could keep up with their portfolios, which consisted of a healthy mix of assets including different fiat and crypto currencies.<br></p><p>So that’s exactly what we built.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Intrigued? Here are the key features that we added into Kubera to make it an ideal tool for investors in an increasingly crypto world.<br></p><h3>We’re Always Building New Integrations with Leading Crypto Exchanges and Wallets</h3><p>Kubera was constructed with the belief that crypto is just as important to a portfolio as any other asset type, <em>not</em> an afterthought or add-on.<br></p><p>That’s why we’re able to integrate with more financial institutions than most other financial trackers.&nbsp;<br></p><p><a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/bank-investment-portfolio-auto-update">We already work with the leading aggregators</a> like Plaid, Yodlee, Salt Edge, and Zabo to connect with bank accounts, brokerages, financial apps, and crypto wallets and exchanges around the world.

<i id="2019-08-17">2019-08-17</i> Final report.
</p>
<p>
The goal of this 2019 Google Summer of Code project is to develop a tool with which to transparently proxy applications that use the Wayland protocol to be displayed by compositors. Unlike the original X protocol, only part of the data needed to display an application is transferred over the application's connection to the compositor; instead, large information transfers are made by sharing file descriptors over the (Unix socket) connection, and updating the resources associated with the file descriptors. Converting this side channel information to something that can be sent over a single data stream is the core of this work.
</p>
<p>
The proxy program I have developed for the project is called Waypipe. It can currently be found at <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mstoeckl/waypipe/"><code>gitlab.freedesktop.org/mstoeckl/waypipe</code></a>. (I am currently looking for a better stable path at which to place the project; the preceding URL will be updated once this is done.) A few distributions have already packaged the program; see <a href="https://repology.org/project/waypipe/versions">here</a>; alternatively, to build and run the project, follow the instructions in the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mstoeckl/waypipe/blob/master/README.md">README</a> and the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mstoeckl/waypipe/blob/master/waypipe.scd">man page</a>. My work is clearly identified by the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mstoeckl/waypipe/commits/master">commit logs</a>, and amounts to roughly ten thousand lines of C code, and a few hundred of Python. 
</p>
<h4>General overview</h4>
<p>
The following image shows the typical setup for the proxy. Two instances of the program must be run, a <code>waypipe server</code> on the remote system, and a <code>waypipe client</code> on the local system. The <code>waypipe server</code> pretends to be a Wayland compositor, and offers a Unix socket over which applications can connect. When they do so, a the <code>waypipe server</code> creates a new connection handling process, whose task it is to convert the Wayland protocol messages (and file descriptor updates) made by the application to a single data stream. The connection handler then connects to a Unix socket that is forwarded (via <code>ssh</code>) from a socket created by the <code>waypipe client</code> process. Messages to the communication channel are then decoded by another connection handler, which connects to the local Wayland compositor and pretends to be the remote application.
</p>
<img src="https://mstoeckl.com/notes/gsoc/processes.svg" width="80%">
<p>
The individual connection handlers leave the wire format of the Wayland protocol messages mostly unchanged, prefixing collections of messages with a lightweight header. Some editing is done, for instance to strip out messages advertising capabilities that can or should not be proxied (privileged graphics card access). File descriptors provided by either the application (or the compositor), on the other hand, are replaced by messages that tell the remote Waypipe instance to create a file descriptor with matching properties, and send it on to the compositor (or the application.) Additional messages are sent to replicate any changes to the local file descriptors.
</p>
<img src="https://mstoeckl.com/notes/gsoc/converter.svg" width="60%">
<p>
As the vast majority of file descriptor updates are changes to shared memory buffers (or <a href="https://01.org/linuxgraphics/gfx-docs/drm/driver-api/dma-buf.html">DMABUFs</a>) containing image data, I will only describe the main mechanism used to replicate changes. It is a standard technique for distributed shared memory; instead of sending the entire memory region when the Wayland protocol messages indicate that there is a change, Waypipe maintains a private copy of the each shared memory region, and only sends the data which has changed since the last time the private copy was synchronized with the shared memory region. The format used to track the changes is illustrated in the following image; it consists of a series of runs of changed data, prefixed by the range in the buffer to which the run corresponds.
</p>
<img src="https://mstoeckl.com/notes/gsoc/diff_routine.svg" width="80%">
<h4>Highlights, challenges, and more</h4>
<p>
Waypipe supports many quality of life features, including a user-friendly command line wrapper for ssh, hardware accelerated video encoding, transfer compression with either <a href="https://lz4.github.io/lz4/">LZ4</a> or <a href="https://facebook.github.io/zstd/">Zstd</a>, and a method to reconnect applications when the ssh connection breaks. With more recent kernels and versions of <a href="https://www.mesa3d.org/">Mesa</a> that support DMABUFs (GPU-side buffers), it can proxy programs that render images using OpenGL.
</p>
<p>
The most difficult technical challenge with Waypipe so far has been the buffer management logic, and the way this interacts with multithreading and reconnection support. In addition to the expected overflow and race conditions bugs involved, it's been surprisingly difficult to find a simple way to satisfy all the requirements without performing extra memory copies or using dynamic memory allocation for <i>every</i> file descriptor update message sent over the communication channel. I've chosen to use <code>malloc</code> all over the place, and deal with all the error checking that involves. Due to the complexity involved (and the fact the decompression is generally faster than the network), I still don't have a multithreaded message decompression pathway.
</p>
<p>
There are a few things that I may yet implement in Waypipe over the next few months. As much of the code was written under the assumption that it would soon be rewritten, many of the error checking paths, especially those related to memory allocation failure, are incomplete or untested. There are also a few performance optimizations with the buffer change detection mechanism that I'd like to try, most notably using a fast hash function to <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mstoeckl/waypipe/issues/13">reduce memory bandwidth consumption</a>. It would also be nice to use the C11 atomic operations to reduce the amount of code in lock-protected critical sections, since lock holder preemption contributes to worst-case latency.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
<i id="2019-08-10">2019-08-10</i> As this GSOC project approaches its end, I've been testing and refactoring the code for <code>waypipe</code>. The only new feature of note is a <code>waypipe bench</code> subprogram, which makes it easier to estimate which compression settings, precisely, are appropriate for a combination of bandwidth and machine performance. The bandwidth must be specified on the command line, since real network stacks include buffering that would make online measurements very difficult. (The benchmark design implicitly assumes that decompression time on the remote machine never delays the critical path for a transfer, or at the very least, is far less significant than the compression algorithm and level settings.) The results of this program are mostly predictable. Because frames containing text tend to compress better than frames containing rendered 3d scenes or pictures, the compression level which minimizes transfer latency, at high bandwidths, is typically higher for text heavy images, since even fast compression methods offer significant space reduction. At low bandwidths, the reverse holds, since beyond a point images require enough transfer time that there is enough time for very high levels of compression.
</p>
<!--<p>
As for refactoring, I have been very slowly reorganizing the code for <code>waypipe</code> to improve modularity. (Slowly, because quite a few dependencies are unavoidable.) The source for <code>waypipe</code> is roughly organized into three groups of functions. First, there a core that deals specifically with file descriptor replication. Next, a ring of main loop code, which manages data transfers, parses the Wayland protocol and a number of auxiliary messages, and uses the results to call the core functions. Third, there is user interface code, which provides the file descriptors with which the main loop code communicates with the Wayland application and the other <code>waypipe</code> instance. The following diagram (produced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxygen">Doxygen</a>) shows a subset of the <code>struct</code>s used by <code>waypipe</code>, specifically the ones visible from the protocol handling code; the bundles on the left side, centered around <code>struct shadow_fd</code> and <code>struct thread_pool</code>, are used mostly by the core code; those close to <code>struct globals</code>  and <code>struct message_tracker</code> are more closely tied to the main loop code.
</p>
<img src="usage_graph.svg" width="70%"/>-->
<p>
The remaining changes are varied. I've also extended support for DMABUFs to include some older versions of Mesa whose backends don't yet support the GBM modifier code. A crash or two introduced over the last few weeks has been fixed. The headless testing script now also checks that the reconnection support added a few weeks ago works. <code>waypipe</code> now compiles with <code>-Wconversion</code>, and some unnecessary wire format padding has been removed.
</p>

<p>
<i id="2019-08-03">2019-08-03</i> The result of all the diff construction testing and sample implementations ... is an unchanged diff format. In my opinion, the scenario that most needs optimization is when a small change is made to a large buffer, and detailed damage tracking is unavailable. Then the main source of delay in the program is the time needed to scan through the unchanged portion of the buffer. On the other hand, when most of the buffer has changed, the data transfer time (and any compression/decompression stages) will take enough time that a 5% increase in diff runtime will be hidden by the other operations. In essence, it's better to optimize the diff for text input than for games. Based on the target scenario, the <i>bitset</i> format was ruled out, because a 1/64th control data overhead is huge when only 1/1000th of the buffer changed, and the time needed to convert the bitset to another format added too much slowdown, even in the case where no data changed.  The <i>split</i> variation on the standard diff format was also discarded, as it required a bit more complexity to manage two buffers, while not significantly improving performance.
</p>
<p>
A key optimization used by the standard diff method is "windowing": small unchanged gaps in the data stream are still copied into the diff. This speeds up diff application, by reducing the number of chunks that must be <code>memcpy</code>'d, as well as the number of branch mispredictions, and makes it possible to limit the number of times that the diff construction routine must switch between copying data and not copying data. The maximal size gap to be skipped is still kept relatively small, to minimize both the total diff size and the total amount of data written. (It's currently at 256 bytes, and can't go any lower than 64 bytes without breaking a key optimization for the SIMD diff routines.)
</p>
<p>
A common optimization which does <i>not</i> work for the diff construction methods is to run the method fully branchlessly with a single loop. While this approach is probably worth it when just constructing a diff given two buffers, <code>waypipe</code>'s diff construction method also requires that the second buffer be updated to match the first. The fastest way to update the reference buffer, without introducing conditional code, is to mix a copy of the entire modified buffer into the diff routine. (Using masked writes to avoid actually rewriting the unchanged data is slower, due to high instruction latency.) As interleaving a data copy is still ≥ 10% slower than having a specialized loops to scan changed and unchanged data, with additional slowdown expected in conjunction with hyperthreading, the fully "branchless" approach is not worth it.
</p>
<p>
In other news, as I didn't have an AAarch64 system on hand, I upgraded a Raspberry Pi 4 from a 32-bit kernel and 32-bit userland to a 64-bit kernel and a mixture of 32-bit and 64-bit packages, with development tools consisting solely of the latter. From an existing Raspbian image, I first installed a <a href="https://github.com/sakaki-/bcm2711-kernel">64-bit …</a></p></div>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction:</h2>
<p>In this post, which can be read as a follow-up to our <a href="https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/web-scraping-without-getting-blocked">ultimate web scraping guide</a>, we will cover almost all of the tools Python offers to scrape the web. We will go from the basic to advanced ones, covering the pros and cons of each. Of course, we won't be able to cover every aspect of every tool we discuss, but this post should give you a good idea of what each tool does, and when to use one.</p>
<p><em>Note: When I talk about Python in this blog post you should assume that I talk about Python3.</em></p>
<h2 id="0-web-fundamentals">0. Web Fundamentals</h2>
<p>The internet is <strong>complex</strong>: there are many underlying technologies and concepts involved to view a simple web page in your browser. I don’t have the pretension to explain everything, but I will explain the most important to understand for extracting data from the web.</p>
<h3 id="hypertext-transfer-protocol">HyperText Transfer Protocol</h3>
<p>HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) uses a <strong>client/server</strong> model. An HTTP client (a browser, your Python program, cURL, Requests…) opens a connection and sends a message (“I want to see that page : /product”)to an HTTP server (Nginx, Apache…). Then the server answers with a response (the HTML code for example) and closes the connection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HTTP is called a <em><strong>stateless protocol</strong></em> because each transaction (request/response) is independent. FTP, for example, is stateful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, when you type a website address in your browser, the HTTP request looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">GET /product/ HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q<span>=</span>0.9,image/web<span>\
</span><span></span>p,*/*;q<span>=</span>0.8
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, sdch, br
Connection: keep-alive
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 <span>(</span>Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_6<span>)</span> AppleWebKit<span>\
</span><span></span>/537.36 <span>(</span>KHTML, like Gecko<span>)</span> Chrome/56.0.2924.87 Safari/537.36
</code></pre></div><p>In the first line of this request, you can see the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The GET verb or method: This means we request data from the specific path: <code>/product/</code>. There are other HTTP verbs, and you can see the full list <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp">here</a>.</li>
<li>The version of the HTTP protocol: In this tutorial we will focus on HTTP 1.</li>
<li>Multiple headers fields: Connection, User-Agent… Here is an exhaustive list of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers">HTTP headers</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the most important header fields :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Host:</strong> This is the domain name of the server. If no port number is given, it is assumed to be <strong>80</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>User-Agent:</strong> This contains information about the client originating the request, including the OS. In this case, it is my web browser (Chrome) on macOS. This header is important because it is either used for statistics (how many users visit my website on mobile vs desktop) or to prevent violations by bots. Because these headers are sent by the clients, they can be modified (<em>“Header Spoofing”</em>). This is exactly what we will do with our scrapers - make our scrapers look like a regular web browser.</li>
<li><strong>Accept:</strong> These are the content types that are acceptable as a response. There are lots of different content types and sub-types: <strong>text/plain, text/html, image/jpeg, application/json</strong> …</li>
<li><strong>Cookie</strong> : This header field contains a list of name-value pairs (name1=value1;name2=value2). These session cookies are used to store data. Cookies are what websites use to authenticate users and/or store data in your browser. For example, when you fill a login form, the server will check if the credentials you entered are correct. If so, it will redirect you and inject a session cookie in your browser. Your browser will then send this cookie with every subsequent request to that server.</li>
<li><strong>Referrer</strong>: The Referrer header contains the URL from which the actual URL has been requested. This header is important because websites use this header to change their behavior based on where the user came from. For example, lots of news websites have a paying subscription and let you view only 10% of a post, but if the user comes from a news aggregator like Reddit, they let you view the full content. They use the referrer to check this. Sometimes we will have to spoof this header to get to the content we want to extract.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the list goes on…you can find the full header list <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields">here</a>.</p>
<p>A server will respond with something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">HTTP/1.1 <span>200</span> OK
Server: nginx/1.4.6 <span>(</span>Ubuntu<span>)</span> Content-Type: text/html; charset<span>=</span>utf-8 &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset<span>=</span><span>"utf-8"</span> /&gt; ...<span>[</span>HTML CODE<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div><p>On the first line, we have a new piece of information, the HTTP code <code>200 OK</code>. This means the request has succeeded. As for the request headers, there are lots of HTTP codes. They are split into four common classes: 2XX for successful requests, 3XX for redirects, 4XX for bad requests (the most famous being “404 Not Found”), and 5XX for server errors.</p>
<p>Then, if you are sending this HTTP request with your web browser, the browser will parse the HTML code, fetch all the eventual assets (Javascript files, CSS files, images…), and render the result into the main window.</p>
<p>We will go through the different ways to perform HTTP requests with Python and extract the data we want from the responses.</p>
<h2 id="1-manually-opening-a-socket-and-sending-the-http-request">1. Manually Opening a Socket and Sending the HTTP Request</h2>
<h3 id="socket">Socket</h3>
<p>The most basic way to perform an HTTP request in Python is to open a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sockets.html">socket</a> and manually send the HTTP request.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> socket

HOST <span>=</span> <span></span><span>'</span><span>www.google.com</span><span>'</span>  <span># Server hostname or IP address</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Now that we have the HTTP response, the most basic way to extract data from it is to use regular expressions.</p>
<h3 id="regular-expressions">Regular Expressions</h3>
<p>A regular expression (RE or regex) is a search pattern for strings.</p>
<p>With regex, you can search for a particular character/word in a bigger body of text.</p>
<p>For example, you could identify all phone numbers in a web page.</p>
<p>You can also replace items with a regex. For example, you could replace all uppercase tags in a poorly formatted HTML with lowercase tags.</p>
<p>You can also validate some inputs …</p>
<p>The pattern used by a regex is applied from left to right, and each source character is only used once.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why it is important understand regular expressions when doing web scraping.</p>
<p>After all, there are many different Python modules to parse HTML, with XPath and CSS selectors.</p>
<p>In an ideal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">semantic world,</a> data is easily machine-readable, and the information is embedded inside relevant HTML elements, with meaningful attributes.</p>
<p>But the real world is messy. You will often find huge amounts of text inside a p element. For example, if you want to extract specific data inside a large text (a price, a date, a name…), you will have to use regular expressions.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Here is a great website to test your regex: <a href="https://regex101.com/"></a><a href="https://regex101.com/">https://regex101.com/</a>. Also, here is an <a href="https://www.rexegg.com/">awesome blog</a> to learn more about them. This post will only cover a small fraction of what you can do with regex.</p>
<p>Regular expressions can be useful when you have this kind of data:</p>
<p>We could select this text node with an Xpath expression and then use this kind of regex to extract the price:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">    <span>^</span>Price\s:\s(\d<span>+</span>\<span>.</span>\d{<span>2</span>})\<span>$</span>
</code></pre></div><p>To extract the text inside an HTML tag, it is annoying but doable to use a regex:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> re

html_content <span>=</span> <span></span><span>'</span><span>&lt;p&gt;Price : 19.99$&lt;/p&gt;</span><span>'</span>

m <span>=</span> re<span>.</span>match(<span></span><span>'</span><span>&lt;p&gt;(.+)&lt;</span><span>\</span><span>/p&gt;</span><span>'</span>, html_content)
<span>if</span> m:
	<span>print</span>(m<span>.</span>group(<span>1</span>))
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, manually sending the HTTP request with a socket and parsing the response with regular expression can be done, but it's complicated and there are higher-level API that can make this task easier.</p>
<h2 id="2-urllib3--lxml">2. urllib3 &amp; LXML</h2>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: It is easy to get lost in the urllib universe in Python. The standard library contains urllib and urllib2 (and sometimes urllib3). In Python3 urllib2 was split into multiple modules and urllib3 won't be part of the standard library anytime soon. This confusing situation will be the subject of another blog post. In this section, I've decided to only talk about urllib3 because it is widely used in the Python world, including by Pip and Requests.</p>
<p>Urllib3 is a high-level package that allows you to do pretty much whatever you want with an HTTP request. We urllib3 we could do what we did in the previous section with way fewer lines of code.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> urllib3
http <span>=</span> urllib3<span>.</span>PoolManager()
r <span>=</span> http<span>.</span>request(<span></span><span>'</span><span>GET</span><span>'</span>, <span></span><span>'</span><span>http://www.google.com</span><span>'</span>)
<span>print</span>(r<span>.</span>data)
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, this is much more concise than the socket version. Not only that, the API is straightforward. Also, you can easily do many other things, like adding HTTP headers, using a proxy, POSTing forms …</p>
<p>For example, had we decided to set some headers and use a proxy,
we would only have to do the following (you can learn more about proxy servers at <a href="https://www.bestproxyreviews.com/proxy-server/">bestproxyreviews.com</a>):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> urllib3
user_agent_header <span>=</span> urllib3<span>.</span>make_headers(user_agent<span>=</span><span></span><span>"</span><span>&lt;USER AGENT&gt;</span><span>"</span>)
pool <span>=</span> urllib3<span>.</span>ProxyManager(f<span></span><span>'</span><span>&lt;PROXY IP&gt;</span><span>'</span>, headers<span>=</span>user_agent_header)
r <span>=</span> pool<span>.</span>request(<span></span><span>'</span><span>GET</span><span>'</span>, <span></span><span>'</span><span>https://www.google.com/</span><span>'</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>See? There are exactly the same number of lines. However, there are some things that urllib3 does not handle very easily. For example, if we want to add a cookie, we have to manually create the corresponding headers and add it to the request.</p>
<p>There are also things that urllib3 can do that requests can't: …</p></div></div>

	<p>Clubhouse is a new social media app entirely based on audio-chat, where users enter â€˜roomsâ€™ where they can listen to a group of people talking to each other and possibly take part in the discussion. Clubhouseâ€™s terminology and structure are extremely reminiscent of text-based chats, especially IRC. The rooms, according to the developers of the app, encourage open conversations and the exchange of ideas. In fact, the rooms are often the broadcast channels of a few (sometimes supposed) celebrities, experts, and personalities from all walks of life who chat while a bunch of users listens to them without intervening.Â&nbsp;The app is also filled with chats among friends who discuss the most diverse topics.</p>
<p>The success of Clubhouse is very similar to that ofÂ&nbsp;PokÃ¨monÂ&nbsp;Go. When Nianticâ€™s game came out, it was summer, and millions of people were bewitched by the idea of hunting for little monsters in augmented reality. With the excuse of playing the game, people ended up walking for miles, thus using its health benefits to justify the digital neurosis. Today, on the contrary, we are isolated and locked inside our homes, and our social life has been reduced to a bare minimum. It seems unreal to us that we can open an app, join a conversation, have the impression of taking part in a symposium, and engage with a group of other faceless and disembodied voices â€“thus without the burden of Instagramâ€™s aesthetic comparisons, or Facebookâ€™s forced relationships.Â&nbsp;</p>

<article>
	<p>How did Clubhouse ascend so quickly to the Empyrean of social networks? Quite simply, by getting dozens of celebrities to talk about their own business or explain how they became successful thanks to their smartphones â€“ itâ€™s the Masterclass model â€“ and, as a result, convincing thousands of millennials, tired of the most popular social media apps, to join this manufactured pseudo-elite. A banal invite-only sign-up system managed to convince even the most skeptical, including those who see Facebook and Instagram as pure evil, to devote hours of their day to yet another creature of Silicon Valleyâ€™s billionaireÂ&nbsp;elites.</p>
<p>Clubhouse also has the advantage of appearing to be an independent app that has nothing to do with the profiling empires of Mr. Zuckerberg and his associates, a breath of fresh air in a market dominated by large groups and apps with billions of users. But thatâ€™s not quite right. The initial investment of ten million dollars came from Andreessen-Horowitz, also known as a16z, the Goldman Sachs of Silicon Valley startups. Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz have become billionaires by investing in companies such as Facebook (Andreessen is still a member of the board chaired by Mark Zuckerberg), Instagram (before Facebook bought it), Pinterest, and many other successful social and digital ventures. In January of this year, the firm led a new $100m funding round, making Clubhouse reach a valuation of $1 billion.</p>

</article>
</div>

<div>

<article>
	<p>This makes us understand two things. Firstly, if you really wanted to feel like hipsters thanks to this new audio social network, well, this ship has long sailed. The pioneering era of Clubhouse has been over for at least a few months. The Android app is coming soon (for now, Clubhouse is only available for iOS), and one would think that the invitation system might also be removed (after all, you need a lot of users and their data to justify a $1 billion valuation). Secondly, Clubhouse is not an alternative to social networking sites such as Facebook and Instagram, but rather a complementary service.</p>

		The result â€“ now that the elites have given way to mass invitations â€“ are random and disorganisedconversations that are only rarely interesting, and more often a source of unmoderated disinformation, similar to a background buzz, or improvised talk shows devoid of substance.
	</blockquote>

</div>
<div>

<article>
	<p>The new app, if anything, is bad news for the podcast market, which has been on the rise in recent years, and for those who have invested heavily in it â€“ like Spotify, for example. The ease with which you can create a room and start talking, in fact, is nothing more than a rapid disintermediation of the audio tool and a disruption of the only mainstream news sector that seemed to have withstood the impact of social media â€“ voice and radio. And what we are witnessing on Clubhouse is the prelude of aÂ&nbsp;trivialisationÂ&nbsp;of audio that will soon pass the point of no return. Whatâ€™s the point of investing in a good microphone, learning how to edit audio content, or â€“ God forbid â€“ thinking of something interesting to say? Just log in to Clubhouse, and off you go â€“ with bad but sufficient quality, you can immediately be part of an audience made of avatars, have the illusion of participating in a debate ignoring its ephemeral nature, and feel part of a crowd of opinion leaders (or an audience that has the illusion of being able to get in touch with theirÂ&nbsp;favourite celebrities). If you think this sounds like an exaggeration, maybe it's better to read what Andreessen-Horowitz has to say about that:</p>
<p>â€œIn a social media landscape that typically compels you to spend hours staring at a screen â€” often distractedly flitting between multiple screensâ€” Clubhouse lets you multitask while you listen. Like podcasts, you can listen while you take a walk, fold laundry, or work out. It can also be the centerpiece of your evening, like attending a lecture or talk. But itâ€™s also interactive, so if you have something to say, you can raise your hand and chime in. Because youâ€™re listening to people talk, Clubhouse is about a real-time exchange of ideas, not just consuming highly-edited, static content. Itâ€™s a fresh experience that brings humanity and context to online social engagementâ€�.Â&nbsp;</p>

	<p>The result â€“ now that the elites have given way to mass invitations â€“ are random andÂ&nbsp;disorganised conversations that are only rarely interesting, and more often a source of unmoderated disinformation, similar to a background buzz, or improvised talk shows devoid of substance. The experts are multiplying, and everyone suddenly has something to say and could go on for hours and hours about it. In the Italian rooms, everyone is an expert in digital ventures, journalism, new media, coaching, business development, or influence marketing. Nobody really bothers to check the qualifications or the credibility of the person speaking. Most people just listen and delude themselves into thinking theyâ€™ve learnt something new from a conversation they barely paid attention to while walking their dog.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Clubhouse has already proved to be a successful experiment, notwithstanding what it will become with the arrival of the multitudes â€“ or, to quote Byung-ChulÂ&nbsp;Han, the bulk of the swarm. With a $1 billion valuation, it is already another â€“ of the many â€“ Silicon Valley projects to which we willingly accept toÂ&nbsp;devoteÂ&nbsp;our time, our mental resources, and our precious attention. Attracted by gratuitousness, novelty, and an exclusivity that is not such, once again we gladly turn ourselves into products, contributing toÂ&nbsp;centralisingÂ&nbsp;value and money towards the usual small circle of rich and privileged male-dominated tech elites.Â&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>curl is an internet transfer engine. A rather modular one too. Parts of curl’s functionality is provided by selectable alternative implementations that we call <em>backends</em>. You select what backends to enable at build-time and in many cases the backends are enabled and powered by different 3rd party libraries.</p>



<h2>Many backends</h2>



<p>curl has a range of such alternative backends for various features: </p>



<ol><li>International Domain Names</li><li>Name resolving</li><li>TLS</li><li>SSH</li><li>HTTP/3</li><li>HTTP content encoding</li><li>HTTP</li></ol>



<h2>Stable API and ABI</h2>



<p>Maintaining a stable API and ABI is key to libcurl. As long as those promises are kept, changing internals such as switching between backends is perfectly fine.</p>



<p>The API is the armored front door that we don’t change. The backends is the garden on the back of the house that we can dig up and replant every year if we want, without us having to change the front door.</p>



<h2>TLS backends</h2>



<p>Already back in 2005 we added support for using an alternative TLS library in curl when we added support for GnuTLS in addition to OpenSSL, and since then we’ve added many more.  We do this by having an internal API through which we do all the TLS related things and for each third party library we support we have code that does the necessary logic to connect the internal API with the corresponding TLS library.</p>



<h2>rustls</h2>



<p>Today, we merged support for yet another TLS library: <strong><a href="https://github.com/ctz/rustls">rustls</a></strong>. This is a TLS library written in rust and it has a C API provided in a separate project called <a href="https://github.com/abetterinternet/crustls/">crustls</a>. Strictly speaking, curl is built to use crustls.</p>



<p>This is still early days for the rustls backend and it is not yet feature complete. There’s more work to do and polish to apply before we can think of it as a proper competitor to the already established and well-used TLS backends, but with this merge it makes it much easier for more people to help out and test it out. Feel free and encouraged to join in!</p>



<p>We count this addition as the <strong>14th</strong> concurrently supported TLS library in curl. I’m not aware of any other project, anywhere, that supports more or even this many TLS libraries.</p>



<figure><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot_2021-02-09-curl-Project-status-dashboard.png"><img loading="lazy" width="2523" height="1419" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot_2021-02-09-curl-Project-status-dashboard.png" alt=""></a></figure>



<h2>rustls again!</h2>



<p>The TLS library named <a href="https://mesalink.io/">mesalink</a> is actually already using rustls, but under an OpenSSL API disguise and we support that since a few years back…</p>



<h2>Credits</h2>



<p>The TLS backend code for rustls was written and contributed by Jacob Hoffman-Andrews.</p>

	<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Microsoft’s portable system’s logo was a Windows flag within a circle. <em>Yuri Litvinenko / 30pin</em> </p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>If we chronicled every move Microsoft has made to capture markets beyond general computing, the record would span 30 years of one-offs, obscurities, and commercial flops. While the company did secure its position in the gaming market with the Xbox, its other home appliances and personal gadgets were far less successful.</p><p>Microsoft can’t be blamed for not trying hard enough, though—at least, if we are talking about the sheer variety of approaches. They tried both <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/zune-13-years-old-and-long-gone-it-left-impression-me-forever">following</a> the leader and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/09/lessons-learned-from-microsofts-pioneering-and-standalone-smartwatches/">coming up</a> with novel concepts; <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/compcol/082697compcol-manes.html">collaborating</a> with household brands or <a href="https://www.marketingweek.com/microsoft-to-axe-nokia-brand-in-favour-of-microsoft-lumia/">dismissing</a> them aggressively; <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/1997/04/06/microsoft-to-acquire-webtv-networks/">acquiring</a> companies or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2007-05-08-microsoft-portable-media-center-rip-2004-2006.html">licensing</a> technologies to them.</p><p>One of the things Microsoft had to offer to gadget makers was an operating system which, at a glance, closely resembled their most famous creation: Windows. In the late 1990s, the four-color flag, already synonymous with PCs by that point, appeared on the predecessors of modern phones and tablets. That system continued to be in use decades after its first release, but with none the public recognition Microsoft was once pushing for. What happened?</p><h2 id="-why-are-we-doing-this-">“Why Are We Doing This?”</h2><p>If memories of going shopping for groceries aren’t completely forgotten in this lockdown-induced haze, you might recall the industrial-looking interface of a cashier’s terminal, or a barcode scanner mounted in the aisles. And at many points on their way to the store—or your home, if we are talking about deliveries—those products were scanned using a clunky, sometimes gun-shaped mobile computer.</p><p>Chances are high that all of these devices, no matter if they were made five or fifteen years ago, are running Windows CE, a low-profile system licensed to embedded hardware manufacturers. It was developed in parallel to the desktop Windows, rather than being derived from it as the name suggests.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://www.30pin.com/content/images/2021/01/wince2_hpc2000.JPG" width="1678" height="1080" alt="" srcset="https://www.30pin.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/wince2_hpc2000.JPG 600w, https://www.30pin.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/wince2_hpc2000.JPG 1000w, https://www.30pin.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/wince2_hpc2000.JPG 1600w, https://www.30pin.com/content/images/2021/01/wince2_hpc2000.JPG 1678w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.30pin.com/content/images/2021/01/wince2_scanner-1.jpg" width="1620" height="1080" alt="" srcset="https://www.30pin.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/wince2_scanner-1.jpg 600w, https://www.30pin.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/wince2_scanner-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.30pin.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/wince2_scanner-1.jpg 1600w, https://www.30pin.com/content/images/2021/01/wince2_scanner-1.jpg 1620w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div><figcaption>A personal handheld computer made in 2000 and an industrial data scanner used in 2017. Windows CE powers both. <em>Dado Ruvic / Reuters; Anindito Mukherjee / Bloomberg / Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><p>Since the mid-1990s, PC manufacturers licensing Windows have been barred from modifying its interface or hiding defining features like the Start menu. In contrast, Windows CE licensors are allowed to pick and choose what they need from the system and put their own user interface over it. That renders the system featureless by design.</p><p>This approach differs from the way Microsoft treated Windows CE in its early years. Most Windows CE devices had the system’s logo “emblazoned right on the plastic case,” <a href="https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1998/07/20/245707/index.htm"><em>Fortune</em></a> reported in 1998, noting that “Microsoft wants consumers and businesses to think of Windows as ubiquitous—not just a figment of the PC screen.” While the system could be licensed by hardware companies only, Microsoft was running <a href="https://guidebookgallery.org/ads/magazines/windowsce">magazine ads</a> for it, promising that Windows CE-powered handheld computers were like “having the essence of your PC at your fingertips.”</p><p>To push the adoption of Windows CE, Microsoft brought their main asset into action: a Windows 95 user interface, fresh off a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/longterm/microsoft/stories/1995/debut082495.htm">reported</a> $300 million marketing campaign. While Windows CE did not sport an exact copy of the desktop’s interface, there were enough elements of it, from icons and taskbar buttons to the bezel-rich nature of each interface element, to evoke familiarity. With the initial batch of Windows CE devices, the effect was highlighted by the hardware design: so-called “Handheld PCs” were designed to look like miniaturized copies of contemporary notebook computers.</p><figure><img src="https://www.30pin.com/content/images/2021/01/wince2_hpad-1.jpg" alt="The HP 320LX ad reads, “So exactly where does a palmtop end and a laptop begin?”" srcset="https://www.30pin.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/wince2_hpad-1.jpg 600w, https://www.30pin.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/wince2_hpad-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.30pin.com/content/images/2021/01/wince2_hpad-1.jpg 1080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A wide screen, like this one marketed by HP, became the norm for Handheld PCs shortly after their launch. <em>HP / <a href="https://guidebookgallery.org/ads/magazines/windowsce/hp320lx">GUIdebook Gallery</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>The idea of an ultraportable computer aiming for continuity with a desktop was novel. Every other mobile computing platform of its time, from Apple’s intelligent notebook to General Magic’s collection of “virtual rooms,” was rejecting associations with desktop computing as much as they could. The idea behind Windows CE was to “prevent users from having to learn a completely new paradigm,” explained Sarah Zuberec, Microsoft’s User Research Manager, in Eric Bergman’s <em>Information Appliances and Beyond. </em>(Zuberec was researching and overseeing Microsoft’s mobile platforms from 1994 to 2005.)</p><p>Windows CE was Microsoft’s third attempt to make a dedicated mobile computing platform, and the first one which reached the market. Before that, the company had been simultaneously working on two other projects, codenamed WinPad and Pulsar. Both concepts were previewed in 1993 by Bill Gates, Microsoft’s co-founder and then-chairman, with the work on the former beginning a year prior.</p><p>The WinPad was a part of the “Microsoft At Work” architecture which aimed to provide a unified way for office equipment to talk to each other. The main focus of the platform was to let PCs send documents to printers and faxes and get data back from them—say, a real-time printout status. But the wider concept also included portable devices and networked landline phones. “The idea is wherever there is a screen… you are to be able to call up the directory and see who’s who and get the information about them,” young Gates is seen promising in archival footage published by Microsoft’s <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/History/The-History-of-Microsoft-1993"><em>Channel 9</em></a>.</p><p>“Microsoft At Work for Handhelds,” which WinPad was called in the media, was based on the same instruction set as Windows 3.1, a 16-bit operating environment and a predecessor of modern Windows versions. Its later editions, meant for software developers who tested prospective platforms, were found alongside pre-release versions of a 32-bit Windows 95. Both systems were designed for ordinary PCs, and the WinPad device had to be a PC as well—not a trivial task at the time when notebooks were just starting to be reasonably-sized. The software project was built around a chip set made by Intel and VLSI, codenamed “Polar,” which was supposed to replicate the desktop 80386 processor in a low-power package. The joint hardware project was canned before any WinPad device came close to being shipped.</p><p>While WinPad and the At Work initiative were created for Microsoft’s business clientele, the Pulsar project was meant to have mass appeal. Gates publicized the so-called “wallet PC” concept, describing a small portable computer which would replace IDs and credit cards with messaging and organizer capabilities, in 1993. Nathan Myhrvold, founder of Microsoft’s Research division had <a href="https://mensjournal.tumblr.com/post/21029153925/nathan-myhrvold">pitched</a> him the concept in 1991. “There is no reason why you can’t just carry a single little PC about the size of a wallet—a little flat-screen device that has all your authentication credentials,” as Gates explained in his speech at the University of Washington (as quoted in <a href="https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19930202&amp;slug=1683214"><em>The Seattle Times</em></a>).</p><p>Pulsar was the first attempt at implementing Gates’ vision of a wallet PC, said Harel Kodesh, Microsoft’s former VP of Consumer Appliances, in an email interview with <em>30pin</em>. “It didn’t look like Windows; it didn’t share the same API as [the 16-bit] Windows… The team had a feeling something big was happening.”</p><p>Gates described the wallet PC numerous times, referring to it as a vision of the not-so-distant future rather than a project in development. Gates’ 1995 bestseller <em>The Road Ahead</em> (which Myhrvold co-authored) laid out one of the most detailed descriptions of the wallet PC. Today, this account reads like an eerily accurate description of a modern phone, made long before even basic cell phones were commonplace. “Your wallet will link into a store’s computer to allow money to be transferred without any physical exchange at a cash register,” said Gates in a passage which would fit modern tap-to-pay systems like Apple Pay. At a later point, he imagines a wallet PC user asking the device for directions to the nearest Chinese restaurant, just like one would ask Google today.</p><p>Microsoft was not working on Pulsar by the time <em>The Road Ahead</em> hit store shelves. WinPad was no longer in development either, as both teams were reorganized in 1994. In John Murray’s <em>Inside Microsoft Windows CE, </em>Robert O’Hara, a WinPad development lead, said Gates was disappointed with the lack of shared direction. “I’ve got WinPad and Pulsar working on handheld computing, doing two completely different things. Why are we doing that?” he said, quoting Gates.</p><p>Brad Silverberg, Microsoft’s Senior VP of Personal Systems, was tasked with building a single team. “Neither [project] to me seemed like it was on a path to success, though each had some good ideas,” recalls Silverberg, famous for shipping Windows 95, in an email interview with <em>30pin</em>. To him, Pulsar was “a long way from being a product.” (Murray’s book quotes more direct criticism of the project, with Silverberg reportedly blaming the Pulsar team for not doing the market research and comparing their creation to a student project.) However, he appointed Kodesh, who oversaw Pulsar, as a leader of the merged team. “I chose Harel and a number of WinPad people left the project, which is understandable in these situations,” Silberberg says.</p><h2 id="-fortunately-the-products-sucked-">“Fortunately, the Products Sucked”</h2><p>The principal hardware design was one of the first things agreed on, as requested by Microsoft’s existing partners. “In 1994, HP and Compaq started to ask us to build a professional device,” Kodesh recalls. The former had already been making their “palmtop PC” mini-notebooks, and the new handheld PCs inherited the same clamshell design. “The form factor was considered a winner among knowledge workers who wanted a keyboard and ability to type fast.”</p><figure><img src="https://www.30pin.com/content/images/2021/01/wince2_hp-1.jpg" alt="John Arifin, HP’s Asia-Pacific product manager for handhelds, with the 1995 lineup." srcset="https://www.30pin.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/wince2_hp-1.jpg 600w, https://www.30pin.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/wince2_hp-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.30pin.com/content/images/2021/01/wince2_hp-1.jpg 1153w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>HP’s clamshell handhelds accounted for 43% of the market in 1995. <em>Martin Chan / South China Morning Post / Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><p>Before the team settled on a desktop interface, the new system “did not have the affinity necessary to identify itself as a Microsoft Windows product,” wrote Zuberec.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imagine you’re a developer who mainly works with Go. You go to an event and, while chatting with some people, you decide to share with them the news that you wrote a small tool that does <em>something</em>. You claim that since you wrote it in Go, it’s fairly fast, it’s a single binary, etc. The group seems pleased with your recount and you start feeling good, but then you notice a stranger approaching from behind. A bone-chilling wind blows and you hear: “Why Go and not Rust?”</p>
<p>You start feeling less good. Well, you could answer that Go is what you know, so that’s what you used to solve your problem, but that’s probably not going to be a satisfactory answer. You were pridefully talking about how fast your tool was in the first place, and it’s obvious that the stranger is going to counter your simplistic excuse with all the great benefits that Rust brings over Go.</p>
<p>You start feeling bad. Why did you choose to learn Go in the first place? You were told that Go is fast and that it has great concurrency primitives, and now Rust comes along and everybody is saying that Rust is better in every aspect. Were they lying before or are they lying now? While there is no single language to rule them all, you know that it’s still possible to make bad choices and end up in a technological cul de sac. After all, you did choose Go over <em>that</em> other language a few years ago and you were pretty pleased with the routine of joining circles to ask “Why <em>that</em> and not Go?”</p>
<hr>
<p>While the story above is 100% the result of my imagination, it’s no secret that the Rust fandom has a few <em>overexcited</em> members who feel compelled to enlighten every lost soul about the virtues of the Crab-God. This isn’t really Rust’s fault, every successful project will have misbehaving followers, it’s inevitable. While everyone has to deal with these people, I feel that Go developers are particularly susceptible to their behavior because of how much Rust’s and Go’s <a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/ivytech-mktg101-master/chapter/reading-defining-the-message/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">messaging</a> overlap.</p>
<p>Go is fast, but Rust is faster.  </p>
<p>Go has an efficient garbage collector, but Rust has static memory management.  </p>
<p>Go has great concurrency support, but Rust has provably-correct concurrency.</p>
<p>Go has interfaces, but Rust has traits and other zero-cost abstractions.</p>
<p>If you’re a Go developer you might feel a bit cheated. In contrast, Python developers are not particularly fazed by Rust. They know that Python is in many ways slow and inefficient, and they’re fine with that because they know Python’s role: make the code easy to write and offload to C when performance matters.</p>
<p>What about Go? </p>
<h2 id="go-is-very-good-for-writing-services"><a href="#go-is-very-good-for-writing-services" aria-label="go is very good for writing services permalink"></a>Go is very good for writing services</h2>
<p>Go was created at Google to solve Google problems, which mostly involves dealing with networked services. Go’s concurrency model is a good fit for server-side applications that must primarily handle multiple independent requests, rather than participate in complex result-passing schemes. This is one reason why you’re given <code>go</code> and not <code>await</code>.</p>
<p>Go has great support for HTTP and related protocols and it doesn’t take long to write a satisfactory web service. In my personal projects, Go proved to be a good alternative to Node.js, especially in situations where I wanted to pin down the interfaces between different components more explicitly than you would do while writing idiomatic JavaScript.</p>
<p>On top of that, it has great tooling to diagnose concurrency and performance problems, and cross-compilation makes deploying on whichever platform a breeze.</p>
<h2 id="go-is-unapologetically-simple"><a href="#go-is-unapologetically-simple" aria-label="go is unapologetically simple permalink"></a>Go is unapologetically simple</h2>
<p>Go takes great pride in offering a limited set of features built-in the language. This makes Go easy to learn and, even more importantly, it ensures that Go projects remain understandable even when growing in size.  The creators of Go like to call it a “boring” language. While we could debate whether the language could use one or two extra things, the idea of forcing people to “do more with less” has proven to be very successful.</p>
<p>Rust can indeed be as good as Go at doing web services, or even better, but it really cannot beat Go in terms of simplicity. And it’s not just simplicity, Go is also strict about things that other languages are usually more lax about. Go doesn’t want unused variables or imports, files belonging to different packages in the same directory, etc. It even used to complain about projects saved outside of <code>GOPATH</code> (thankfully that’s not the case anymore). </p>
<p>Go also doesn’t want any “fingerprints” in the code, so it enforces a single, universal style via <code>go fmt</code>.</p>
<p>In truth, none of these things alone is particularly  impressive, but they do describe the mindset that Go wants to impose. Many don’t like it but, in my opinion, it’s a killer feature for some types of development, like enterprise software.</p>
<h2 id="go-is-great-for-enterprise-software"><a href="#go-is-great-for-enterprise-software" aria-label="go is great for enterprise software permalink"></a>Go is great for enterprise software</h2>
<p>As I already mentioned, Go was created to solve Google problems, and Google problems are definitely enterprise-scale problems. Whether this was the direct aim of the creators or just the natural result of using it at a Big Corp, Go is indubitably an amazing breath of fresh air in enterprise software development.</p>
<p>If you have experience in writing enterprise software and tried Go, you probably know what I mean. Here’s a quick summary for everyone else.</p>
<p>Enterprise development is a very weird beast compared to other kinds of development. If you’ve never done it, you might ask yourself “What the hell is even enterprise software?” I did that kind of development as a consultant for a bit, so here’s my take on the subject.</p>
<h4 id="enterprise-software-development-is-about-scale"><a href="#enterprise-software-development-is-about-scale" aria-label="enterprise software development is about scale permalink"></a>Enterprise software development is about scale</h4>
<p>Not in terms of total number of users, or amount of data. Often that’s the case too, but the defining characteristics are scale of <strong>scope</strong> and <strong>process</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Enterprise software always has a big scope.</strong> The domain can be big and wide, or narrow but stupidly complex. Sometimes it’s both. When creating software to model such domains, normal programming wisdom falls incredibly short because non-technological concerns out-weight most technological ones. </p>
<p><strong>To unravel complex domains you need a well-structured process.</strong> You need domain experts, analysts, and a mechanism that lets stakeholders gauge how much progress is being made. It’s also often the case that you, the technologist, don’t know the domain very well. Stakeholders and domain experts often won’t understand technology very well either. </p>
<p>This pushes further down technological concerns such as efficiency, <strong>and even correctness.</strong> Don’t get me wrong, the business does care about correctness, but they have a different definition for it. When you’re thinking about algorithmic correctness, they are thinking about a reconciliation back-office for the operations team they keep in a country where labor is cheap.</p>
<p>Because of the environment resulting from this general premise, a few well-known enterprise development “quirks” have emerged over time. I’ll name three relevant to my point.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>There are a lot of junior developers</strong> who learn on the job how to program and most are not lucky enough to find a job that will truly teach them anything. In some places, after you’re hired, you are stationed for one week in front of PluralSight and then you’re considered ready to go.</li>
<li><strong>Software projects quickly become huge and complex for all the wrong reasons.</strong> Big projects take time to build and people (or whole teams) will come and go in the meantime. Constant refactoring is never an option so each will leave behind a lot of code written with very varying levels of quality. Multiple teams working in parallel will produce redundant code. The domain shifts over time, inevitably invalidating older assumptions and consequently causing abstractions to leak. The more sophisticated an abstraction is, the higher the risk that it will become a problem when business comes back with a serious change request.</li>
<li><strong>The toolchain is very often lousy and/or dated.</strong> This is pretty much the inevitable result of all that I described so far. Huge amounts of old code tie you down to a specific toolset, junior developers will learn the status-quo at best, and the people on top (managers and stakeholders) are extremely often not prepared for making technological decisions based on first-hand experience, the general nature of the endeavor makes them risk-averse, causing them to mainly mimic what other successful players in their space do or, more precisely, what analysts <em>claim</em> other successful players do.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="go-is-about-suppressing-complexity-at-scale"><a href="#go-is-about-suppressing-complexity-at-scale" aria-label="go is about suppressing complexity at scale permalink"></a>Go is about suppressing complexity at scale</h4>
<p>Go makes teams more successful, partially by giving them more than what they would get with other ecosystems, and partially by taking tools away from them, to prevent common pitfalls.</p>
<p><strong>Go is much easier to learn than Java or C#.</strong> A faster ramp-up is generally good, but it becomes fundamental when the project is lagging behind, the deadline is approaching, and management inevitably resorts to hiring more people, hoping (in vain) to speed things up.</p>
<p><strong>The Go community regards as anti-patterns many abstractions regularly employed by Java / C#</strong>, like IoC containers, or OOP inheritance, for example. There are only two levels of visibility for variables, and the only concurrency model is CSP. It’s way harder to fall into incomprehensible pitfalls when writing in Go than it is in Java / C#. </p>
<p><strong>The Go compiler is fast.</strong> Which means that running tests is going to be faster in general, that deployments will take less time, increasing the overall productivity.</p>
<p>With Go, it’s easier as a junior developer to be more productive, and harder as a mid-level developer to introduce brittle abstractions that will cause problems down the line.</p>
<p>For these reasons, Rust is less compelling than Go for enterprise software development. That doesn’t mean that Go is perfect, or that it’s not true that Rust has some advantages over Go. Rust has many advantages over Go, but more than anything, I would say that it’s the common perception of Go that is wrong.</p>
<p>Go is not blazing-fast. Go is not super memory-efficient. Go doesn’t have the absolutely best concurrency model. </p>
<p>Go is faster than Java / C#, more memory-efficient …</p></div></div>

		<p>Today we're excited to announce that Always On repls are available to all hackers! Anyone with <a href="https://repl.it/pricing">Hacker plan</a> can choose up to 5 repls and keep them running all the time. With Always On, you can for example spin up and host an app like a Discord bot in 30 seconds:</p>

<p>As a reminder, Replit gives you most of what you need to rapidly build and ship apps in the cloud -- at lightning speed:</p>
<ul>
<li>A blazing fast <a href="https://repl.it/site/ide">online IDE</a></li>
<li>Automatic <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/packages">Package Management</a></li>
<li>Automatic <a href="https://repl.it/site/hosting">hosting</a></li>
<li>Automatic <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/web-hosting">SSL/HTTPS</a></li>
<li>Domain <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/web-hosting">linking</a></li>
<li>A simple and fast <a href="https://docs.repl.it/misc/database">Database for persistence</a></li>
<li>A secure way to <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/secret-keys">store secrets</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The one missing piece was a reliable way to keep your apps from going to sleep. Always On means we host your code and keep it running even if you close your Replit browser tab.</p>
<p>Prior to Always On, you might have noticed that when your repl is inactive for a little while it automatically goes to sleep. Because Replit wants to give everyone in the world the ability to code and access cloud computing, this has been a super important cost-saving mechanism and vital to the design of our infrastructure (you can read about the technical details <a href="https://blog.repl.it/killing-containers-at-scale">here</a>). As much as we'd like it to, hosting 100 million repls all the time for free just wouldn't work out. Instead we've invested in getting really fast at starting repls when they're needed and pretending like they were up the whole time. It has served us and our users well, but doesn't work in every use-case. </p>

<p>Some repls expect to be running all the time (things like cron or Discord bots), and some apps can't afford to drop some requests as the repl wakes up. As our users built increasingly ambitious apps, the need for a repl to keep running all the time has become apparent. With Always On your repl will function mostly like before, but now it won't stop running when you close the workspace.</p>
<p>Always On repls can be incredibly useful for a variety of programs and unlocks many long-requested features. The most obvious and commonly requested is for web servers to stay up. If you're tired of waiting for your webserver to wake up every time you visit, Always On is a great way to fix that. But Always On isn't just for web repls, regular old repls work too! If you have a cron job you'd like to run on a schedule, Always On makes it super easy. Discord bots, Slack bots, and other chat bots with a persistent outbound connection are another great use for Always On. And if you have a workload that's taking a long time (like say scraping a site), you can Always On the repl and go one with your life.</p>
<p>Of course, it's worth noting a few limitations of Always On </p>
<ul>
<li>Your repl will be occasionally restarted as it is migrated between physical servers.</li>
<li>Changes your program makes to the filesystem won't persist, so we suggest you use <a href="https://blog.repl.it/database">Replit Database</a> rather than, for example, writing to text files.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/database/database1.gif" alt="Database"></p>
<p>We also want to make it clear that the use of pinging services will continue to work just as before.</p>
<p>Happy coding! If you create something interesting or novel using this technology then make sure to <a href="https://repl.it/talk/ask/Share-your-Always-On-repls/120784">share it with us</a>.</p>
<h2 id="one-more-thing">One more thing</h2>
<p>Oh one more thing. right now replit doesn't differentiate between dev and prod apps. We're going to fix that too, and it will be epic. Stay tuned.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<div>
						<p>The Bay Area has some of the most expensive property in the world. It has some of the worst local government. For years techies complained about the situation yet little was accomplished. There is a sense that things have started to change in the last year. Elon Musk moved to Austin. Keith Rabois moved to Miami.	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[1]">[1]</sup>
	<span>Beyond these higher profile cities, other holiday destinations like Lake Tahoe or Hawaii are receiving an influx of temporary and permanent migrants in search of more space and an easier ability to live with the restrictions imposed by the pandemic and policy responses.</span>
	 While the recent approval and deployment of vaccines herald the end of the Covid-19 fears and restrictions that are surely driving some of the flight, the pace of relocations is increasing.</p>
<p>It would be premature to count the Bay Area out. It still offers major benefits (its temperate climate, world-class restaurants, easy access to nature, and the persisting agglomeration effects) despite the drawbacks (rent, taxes, space). But this wave of migration is an acceleration of a trend that was already happening before. There is some reason to think it will continue.</p>
<p>For one thing, anti-tech politicians in California are, if anything, ramping up their efforts to push residents associated with tech away through symbolic measures like <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/12/3/22151273/mark-zuckerberg-general-hospital-san-francisco-naming-vote">condemning the naming of hospitals after Mark Zuckerberg</a> and policy proposals like <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-california-plan-to-chase-away-the-rich-then-keep-stalking-them-11608331448">a wealth tax</a>. But these more dramatic flare-ups are minor compared to the most harmful failure of contemporary economic policy: the restrictions on home-building driving the housing shortage in California.</p>
<p>While cities like Austin still offer cheaper rents and a lower cost of living, at least for those departing the Bay Area, familiar tensions over densification, gentrification, and transit <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/start-up-city-accelerated-growth-strains-austin-11609093013?s">are appearing</a>. Even before Covid, the types of cities most likely to attract highly skilled workers and the companies that hire them were becoming less and less accessible.	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[2]">[2]</sup>
	<span>In addition to Austin and Miami, other cities that have been most heavily discussed include Boston, Seattle, Nashville, and Portland. All of these cities are already expensive or getting much more expensive.</span>
	 Without policy changes, these cities, like San Francisco before them, will become ever more expensive as they gain new highly-skilled residents.</p>
<h2><b>Are these cities really cheap?</b></h2>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/california-love-it-and-leave-it-11605472619">op-ed</a> for the Wall Street Journal, Palantir co-founder, venture capitalist, and newly minted Austinite Joe Lonsdale describes his reasons for picking up and leaving California. Among the benefits he sees in Texas is that, “California’s restrictive zoning laws make it nearly impossible for many essential low- and middle-income workers to live anywhere near major cities. In Texas, permissive zoning allows every member of our staff to live close to work and spend time with friends and family instead of enduring grueling commutes.”</p>
<p>While he is correct that Austin is much cheaper than California (and that zoning and other land use rules are less restrictive in Texas than in California), home prices are rising dramatically in Austin. On top of a decade of rising home prices, Austin had the <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/zillow-hottest-markets-2021-28667/">largest increases</a> in home prices of the top fifty U.S. markets in 2020 with the median list price growing by 23.6% year-over-year.</p>
<p>Austin may have more liberal housing regulations than California but much of its growth so far has mostly relied on ‘sprawl’ or horizontal growth. This model&nbsp; <a href="https://www.manhattan-institute.org/lone-star-slowdown">will begin to break down</a> as the physical distance of new exurbs and congestion steadily increases.	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[3]">[3]</sup>
	<span>California itself shows the limits of this type of development as exurbs more and more remote from the Bay Area and Los Angeles/San Diego have sprung up in the Central Valley and Inland Empire.</span>
	 It is already 38 miles from the North of the built up area to the South. Residents complain about the congestion caused by the increase in population from 675,000 in 2000 to over 1 million now. At the low density Austin is currently built at, it would take only another million or so Joe Lonsdales before outer Austin would cease to be in reasonable commuting distance of the center. The natural market remedy to these problems is to densify, through some combination of building taller and by building on smaller lots.</p>
<p>Before widespread planning,	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[4]">[4]</sup>
	<span>Prior to the early 20th century, many, but not all land use decisions were left to the market and law. Regulation of land use decisions impedes the ability of land owners and developers to respond to price signals. Rules setting out maximum allowable units per acre, minimum lot size, floor area ratio, and the like prevent densification and calcify neighborhoods.</span>
	 this was more easily accomplished, but in some areas of the country this still occurs on a large scale. Most notably, in Houston just a few hours away: A city that famously has no zoning but less famously has all sorts of important private and public land use rules. The system, in part due to changes discussed below, has led to a steady densification ripple from the center outwards. Areas that were mostly made up of small bungalows on large lots have become rowhouses, duplexes and triplexes, or narrow four-story townhomes.</p>
<p>Austin’s suburbs and exurbs do not live under such rules meaning that, like the Bay Area, it will eventually bump up against the physical limits to sprawl. If Austin wants to continue attracting Bay Area emigrants, it must ensure it can build up as well as out. This means allowing denser developments by liberalizing <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/publications/urban-economics/do-minimum-lot-size-regulations-limit-housing-supply-texas">minimum-lot-size</a> requirements and other rules. While there has been some densification of existing neighborhoods it has occurred only after much difficulty.&nbsp; Places like East Austin, a fashionable area within a short walk of downtown, are still dominated by one and two story buildings spread out from one another on large lots. In other words, places ripe for densification. The political economy of densification has proven difficult thus far. While at a policy level the answer to the continued affordability of Austin is density, the bigger question is to figure out ways to change the rules that currently prevent densification.</p>
<h2><b>The economic implications of housing supply</b></h2>
<p>House prices can be high, or low, due to a range of factors. If house prices go up because cheaper interest rates make mortgages more affordable, this does not in itself indicate that there is a housing shortage. Similarly, in some places density is extremely high, and adding more housing is costly. Hong Kong housing is mostly expensive because building 40 storey towers is difficult, not because rules restrain what they can do with land. Therefore, we need to be careful before judging that any house price that seems ‘high’ to us is actually evidence of a shortage.</p>
<p>There is a way round this problem. Firms produce goods when they think they can sell them for more than they cost to make. Housing developers are no different. Therefore, economists tend to measure whether there is a housing shortage due to supply restrictions by looking at the ratio of the production cost of a house to the price of one.</p>
<p>As Edward Glaeser and Joseph Gyourko show in a <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/jep.32.1.3">2018 review essay</a>, even in places like New York City and coastal California the price of housing largely reflected the cost of building until the recent past. When economic success drew new residents in, new houses were built for them. Higher productivity led to more homes and more workers, not higher home prices.</p>
<p>More recently, as existing land use regulations began to bind (and new regulations were enacted) the ratio of price to production cost has increased: construction cost explains a smaller portion of the market price and the cost of regulatory permission explains more of the sales price.	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[5]">[5]</sup>
	<span>An important topic beyond the scope of this piece is research into why construction costs are so high and possible ways to lower them whether in the form of materials science research or institutional reforms.</span>
	 <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/jep.32.1.3">Glaeser and Gyourko</a> view the ratio as a measure of the regulatory tax of building. While California has grown much more productive, it produces <a href="https://wordpressstorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/wp-media/wp-content/uploads/sites/833/2019/07/CIRB-Historical-Data-1954-2019.pdf">fewer homes per year</a> than it did decades ago. Furthermore, many of the homes that are built are <a href="https://lao.ca.gov/reports/2015/finance/housing-costs/housing-costs.aspx">far from the top productivity clusters</a>.</p>
<p>As a result of this policy choice to limit homebuilding, the increases in productivity are captured by landowners. More worrying than the boon to existing owners are the dynamic effects of the price: new residents are prevented from moving to more productive labor markets and growth is reduced.	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[6]">[6]</sup>
	<span>Hsieh and Moretti (2019) estimate that housing restrictions had <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20170388">a huge negative effect</a> on US growth between 1964 and 2009.</span>
	</p>
<p>Just a few decades ago this supply-driven housing crisis was limited to a few cities in the United States, but many other cities have followed suit. Even before years of dramatic price increases the data from 2013 used by Glaeser and Gyourko estimates that Austin had a ratio above 1. While construction costs have increased, home prices are increasing even faster leading that ratio to increase significantly. While Austin is building, the fact that the ratio is above one and rising means that it is not building enough to keep up with demand in a more clear cut way than just looking at the rising prices alone.</p>
<h2><b>Costs of reform: high and rising&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p>Liberalization of rules around development may benefit society as a whole but would hurt homeowners in destination areas, many of whom bought their home for a price above its construction cost and would stand to lose out if prices fell. The higher that home prices are above the construction cost (and the more harmful the regulations likely are), the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3003249?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">more difficult</a> we should expect reforms to be.

				<p>In today’s post I want to start a conversation around the tradeoffs of using <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/typespecs.html">Typespecs</a> and <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/dialyzer.html">Dialyzer</a> use in your Elixir code.</p>

<p>Elixir is a dynamic, not a statically-typed language – and just to preemptively avoid the programming wars that might ensue, the given type system of a language is not a “good” or “bad” attribute by itself, but it will none-the-less influences the code we write.</p>

<p>For those who prefer or come to Elixir from a statically-typed language background you may be interested in learning more about <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/typespecs.html">Elixir Typespecs</a>, described in the documentation as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Elixir comes with a notation for declaring types and specifications. Elixir is a dynamically typed language, and as such, type specifications are never used by the compiler to optimize or modify code. Still, using type specifications is useful because:</p>

<ul>
<li>they provide documentation (for example, tools such as  <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc">ExDoc</a>  show type specifications in the documentation)</li>
<li>they’re used by tools such as  <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/dialyzer.html">Dialyzer</a> , that can analyze code with typespec to find type inconsistencies and possible bugs</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>While I have done some limited work with typespecs in my side projects, in my current client project the decree has been made we will define typespecs for all functions, both public and private, and we have dialyzer checks built into the CI to report any reported issues.</p>

<p>On the face of this requirement I do not have a problem, it is very well meaning towards building a stable codebase. Who can disagree with such a goal? The realties however of seeing it through day-to-day are more complex. First, let’s talk about how dialyzer errors can sometimes be hard to debug.</p>

<p>One recent error I got back from dialyzer was something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">:0:unknown_type
Unknown type: Widget.t/0.</code></pre></div>
<p>There was no function name, nor file name, nor line number to help me understand where this error was coming from. I was on my own. Luckily I knew the dialyzer check was clean before my I started my branch so I could at least look at my git diff for some ideas. This was not fun.</p>

<p>Another time I had a whole list of dialyzer errors reported back to me. Now if I was dealing with traditional complier errors I would work from the top of the list down, since sometimes when those first complier issues are resolved the later issues will disappear. Sadly when it comes to dialyzer errors that first error need not be what actually needs to get fixed. Many times you need to fix issues from the middle of the list first and knowing what to fix from that list is a learned art with its own dedicated learning curve.</p>

<p>Obtuse errors are bad enough but the second big issue for me is time. On a bigger project like ours it can sometime takes 10+ minutes to do a full dialyzer check the project. That long feedback loop can really slow down your day.</p>

<p>So where do we find the balance?</p>

<p>When it comes to Elixir code, my priorities of practices to enable a stable code base are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>First, write tests. Validate your code behaviors and assumptions. Check the happy paths and check the sad paths. Do this for every project you ever write.</li>
<li>Second, use <a href="https://github.com/rrrene/credo">credo</a>. Credo can analyze your project for Elixir style and consistency. Credo is extremely fast with helpful error messages that teach you not only how to fix something but why it should be fixed. Use this on any project that you work on for more than a few days.</li>
<li>Finally, use typespecs and dialyzer, but only for your public functions, and with a heavy leaning towards your own contexts and not the Phoenix-based modules that will be called based on dynamic behaviors like routes calling controllers. Use dialyzer for customer facing apps or anything open source.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course every project has unique needs and tradeoffs, but this is where I land in the general case.</p>

<p>I’d love to hear your thoughts on typespecs and dialyzer.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Memgraph’s biggest new feature in the <a href="https://memgraph.com/blog/memgraph-1-3-release">v1.3 release</a> is the support for replication.</p>
<p>Although replication isn’t a new idea in the database world, it’s a great example to illustrate how often, a simple solution can be the best one.</p>
<p>In this post, we will discuss the concept of replication, and explain how Memgraph implements essential replication capabilities. We will discuss our approach, the challenges we faced, and how we overcame them. Finally, we’ll explain in detail how do we allow you to pick what property should the replication satisfy for each replica you connect to an instance of Memgraph.</p>
<h2>A Brief Introduction to Data Replication</h2>
<p>Uninterrupted data and operational availability in production systems is critical and can be achieved in many ways.</p>
<p>In distributed systems theory, we talk about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem">CAP theorem</a> (Consistency, Availablity, Partition Tolerance). Out of the three, a distributed system can simultaneously satisfy at most two. Modern systems often implement a hybrid approach where some systems ensure consistency and push availability as high as possible, and others are eventually consistent but available at all times, etc.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/j4V5nAT.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Algorithms like <a href="https://raft.github.io/">Raft</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">Paxos</a> are well known to ensure CAP properties. E.g., Raft provides consistency, partition tolerance, and availability if the majority of the cluster is healthy. It also comes with many complexities, which produces performance issues and introduces complexity not required for most known Memgraph use-cases. Mostly running analytical graph workloads on real-time data.</p>
<p>You can achieve those properties by using a much simpler concept called replication. It basically consists of replicating the data from one storage to other storages.
Because the concept is simple, achieving all three of the CAP properties at the same time is not possible. Having a combination of two of those three properties, on the other hand, is achievable.</p>
<h2>Implementing Data Replication</h2>
<p>Even though the idea of replication is simple, trying to add it to a system that has been in development for a few years, is not a trivial task. When the database was designed, the replication hadn’t been taken into consideration, so the biggest challenge was to implement the replication while minimizing the changes to the current implementation of the database.</p>
<p>First, let’s see what are the specifications of the replication we wanted to implement.</p>
<h3>What Can you do with Memgraph’s Data Replication?</h3>
<p>Before we started with the development we had worked out what do we want from our replication feature. As always, that specification evolved throughout the development, even forcing us to delay some features for future releases. We ended up with these basic key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every instance can take the role of MAIN or REPLICA, where the MAIN instance is replicating its data to its replicas.</li>
<li>The MAIN instance can register and drop a replica by specifying its
endpoint.</li>
<li>The MAIN instance can have multiple replicas registered.</li>
<li>Only the storage is replicated.</li>
<li>Write queries are forbidden on replicas.</li>
<li>The MAIN instance can replicate its data in three ways or, as we call them, modes:
<ul>
<li>SYNC - The MAIN instance cannot commit a transaction until the replica has confirmed it received the same transaction.</li>
<li>SYNC WITH TIMEOUT - Same as sync but waits for some set time for confirmation. If the response timeouts, the replica is demoted to an async replica.</li>
<li>ASYNC - The MAIN instance can commit a transaction without waiting for the replica to confirm that it received the very same transaction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Using Multiple Data Replication Modes</h2>
<p>As we said before, satisfying all three properties of the CAP theorem is practically impossible. But, using these modes, you can pick which of these properties you would like to have for each of your replicas. By replicating the data using the SYNC mode you achieve consistency, by using the ASYNC mode you get availability, and by using SYNC WITH TIMEOUT you try to hold the consistency until something unexpected happens forcing you to give up and accept that availability is good enough.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/orD51qo.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Replication, no matter how simple the idea is, introduces a great number of edge cases that need to be handled in some way or another. This makes it hard to be confident in your implementation (we will never be 100% confident, which is practically a law for multithreaded and distributed applications).</p>
<p>In the next section, we will discuss the basic idea behind our implementation of the replication feature and some of the interesting challenges we faced.</p>
<h2>Data Replication Implementation Basics</h2>
<p>The information necessary to implement replication is contained in transaction timestamps and so-called durability files (snapshot files and WALs).</p>
<p>Timestamps allowed us to establish a way of communication between two instances as it represents the current state of an instance. Using the timestamp, the MAIN instance can know what is the current state of the REPLICA and send the correct data for synchronization.</p>
<p>When you apply some changes to the MAIN instance, all those changes are represented by a “delta”. The concept of deltas is not new as we use them for our WAL files. Those deltas contain enough information to be sent to the replicas and be applied correctly.</p>
<p>What if a REPLICA is trailing behind the MAIN instance?</p>
<p>We simply use the durability files to “recover” the REPLICA to the state of MAIN instance. This is more or less how we implemented the replication.</p>
<p>Now, let’s delve into some specific parts!</p>
<h2>Understanding Different Data Replication Modes</h2>
<p>Supporting different replication modes means supporting different ways of waiting for the response after transaction deltas were sent to the REPLICA.</p>
<p>The most straightforward mode is the <em>SYNC</em> mode as the main storage thread simply waits for the response and cannot continue until the response is received.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/09ueVPp.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Next in line is the <em>ASYNC</em> mode. Okay, we don’t wait for the response in the main thread but in some other thread and we’re done.</p>
<p>Well, there are multiple possibilities here. We can create a thread every time we want to replicate a transaction to the REPLICA, or we can use a single thread every time and simply queue a task that will be executed on that thread. Since creating a thread is not cheap and committing transactions is not something that happens once in 100 years we picked the latter.</p>
<p>The only problem was that we hadn’t implemented something like that.</p>
<p>The idea of creating a thread once and dispatching tasks on it isn’t something new. It’s one of the most popular patterns in multithreaded applications, also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool">thread pool</a>. So, to support the <em>ASYNC</em> mode we had to add a thread pool implementation. Although we could’ve used an off-the-shelf threading library, like <a href="https://github.com/facebook/folly">folly</a>, we didn’t need all the functionality provided by one so we decided to write our own.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CgEK0q6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Finally, we have the <em>SYNC WITH TIMEOUT</em> mode. Things are not so simple here. We have a main thread that wants to commit a transaction, but first, it needs to wait for the REPLICA to commit the same transaction, BUT only for some time after which it should continue replicating the transaction and any future transactions in the background. Let’s split that sentence into 3 key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wait for a REPLICA to commit a transaction.</li>
<li>If the timeout triggers, commit the transaction on the MAIN instance regardless and switch the REPLICA to <em>ASYNC</em> mode.</li>
<li>Don’t stop the replication of the current transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>The third point tells us to wait for the REPLICA’s response in a background thread so that the main thread can continue its execution even if the replication is not done.</p>
<p>The first point tells us that the main thread needs to wait for a certain time. Now our threads need to communicate somehow. Of course, we use a condition variable that can be notified by a background thread.</p>
<p>And the second point means that we need to have an additional background thread containing a timer that can also notify the main thread.</p>
<p>At first, it seemed easy, but it wasn’t. Our implementation of this looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>active = true
replication_background_thread({
  replicate...
  active = false
  notify main thread
})
 
timeout_thread({
  finished = false
  while (active &amp;&amp; not timeouted)
      sleep for some time
      
  finished = true
  active = false
  notify main thread
})
 
while (active) 
  wait
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NJkwQg9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>By using only 3 threads, we already had many interesting edge cases.</p>
<p>For example, we introduced the finished flag because the timeout thread sleeps for some time while it’s active so it doesn’t register immediately that the replication thread finished. During that time another transaction can come in and try to replicate something to the same REPLICA, queue the timeout task, and after that anything is possible because the previous timeout task needs to finish first. This means that it can execute the lines after the while loop at any time which notify the main thread that the response timeouts.</p>
<p>To have things consistent we keep the sleep time at a reasonable value and before waiting for the response we wait for the previous timeout task to finish.</p>
<p>This was really important to do because we want to have the timeout time as exact as possible. If the user-specified the timeout to be 5 seconds, timing out after 10 milliseconds would probably result in angry questions on StackOverflow and/or our Forum.</p>
<p>We also wondered if using concurrency concepts like semaphore would make our lives easier in these cases while not sacrificing the performance.</p>
<h2>How Should the REPLICA Catch up to the MAIN?</h2>
<p>If the MAIN instance concludes that the REPLICA is missing some earlier transactions, the REPLICA goes into a <code>RECOVERY</code> state and remains in this state until it catches up with the MAIN instance.</p>
<p>There are 2 ways of sending the missing data to the REPLICA. The first one is by sending a snapshot, and the second one is by sending the WAL files. One important difference between those 2 files is size. Because snapshot files represent an image of the current state of the …</p></div></div>

<p><span>B</span>y the time Mudassir Azeemi wrote to Apple CEO Tim Cook in 2014, he’d tried everything he<em> </em>could think of to make it easier to type in his native language, Urdu. In 2010, the now 42-year-old Pakistani-American developed a keyboard app you could use on iOS devices; within two years, it had been downloaded over 165,000 times. But even with an Urdu-language keyboard, the characters appeared on the screen in an entirely different font.</p>



<p>“Dear Mr Tim Cook,” he wrote. “Urdu language’s beauty lies in the typeface.”</p>



<p>Spoken by nearly 170 million people in South Asia and the South Asian diaspora, Urdu is written in an alphabet derived from Arabic. But while Arabic is written in a script called <em>naskh</em>, simpler and more linear in its appearance, many other people — including Iranians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Urdu-speakers in India, and Uighur-speakers in parts of China — employ an ornate style of writing that originated in 14th-century Persia called <em>nastaʿlīq</em>. When Azeemi sat down to write his letter to Cook, nastaʿlīq was almost nowhere to be found online. To communicate in Urdu, you either had to type in naskh or spell words phonetically in Latin script.</p>



<p>Azeemi, a software developer now working and living in Silicon Valley, grew up in Pakistan’s sprawling seaside city, Karachi. As a teenager during the days of dial-up, he once racked up an internet bill that cost half of his father’s monthly salary; in his early 20s, he learned to code on one of those old calculator-sized computers called palmtops. He didn’t give much thought to Urdu’s digital future until he moved to California and became a father. Watching his children learn English through songs on YouTube, he’d felt a pang of loss — the anxiety that they might never speak or appreciate Urdu the way he does. One of the earliest apps Azeemi developed, even before the keyboard, was for nursery rhymes in Urdu.</p>



<p>These early attempts at yanking Urdu on to the internet hadn’t been particularly profitable — Azeemi says he lost over $50,000 in the process. He remained determined. In 2013, Apple introduced an Urdu keyboard for iOS devices, but, much to the chagrin of Urdu users, the default font was still naskh, the Arabic font. In Azeemi’s eyes, the solution was now pretty straightforward: operating systems — Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others — had to be persuaded to adopt nastaʿlīq.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His open letter, addressed to Cook and Apple’s chief design officer at the time, Jonathan Ive, described the need for a nastaʿlīq font on iOS platforms. “The only hurdle for us is to bring the typeface that truly represent[s] the language,” wrote Azeemi. “And every language, when it is written, shines when using the typeface which it truly presented in the world.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Urdu calligraphers speak of nastaʿlīq, it is with deep reverence. In the subcontinent, it was the script that disseminated the Quran, considered the word of God. Mir Ali of Tabriz, a 14th-century Persian calligrapher known as the father of the script, is said to have developed it after a dream in which Ali, son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad, instructed him to draw letters that looked like “the wings of flying geese.” Squint at an Urdu verse in nastaʿlīq, and it might very well begin to resemble a flock of birds taking flight, or a branch in bloom. Nastaʿlīq characters, <a href="https://archive.org/stream/fromconcepttocon00fush/fromconcepttocon00fush_djvu.txt">per one observation</a>, appear to “swing from the upper right to the lower left of each word as if suspended by an imaginary line.”</p>



<p>In some ways, this emphasis on the <em>form</em> of writing a language runs contrary to conventional wisdom. We tend to think of text as a means to an end, that the characters depicted are there only to convey meaning. If you could write the same Urdu word in the Arabic naskh script, even if it looked a little different — naskh is smaller, simpler, and sans serif — wasn’t the demand for digitized nastaʿlīq just a minor typographical quibble?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nastaʿlīq, after all, is a nightmare to code. It moves right to left, like all Arabic scripts, but also slopes downward: the longer the word, the steeper the slope. The shape of each letter changes, depending on the letter that comes before and after; in a 39-letter alphabet, there are thousands of permutations. Its multifaceted nature is precisely why coders haven’t developed nastaʿlīq fonts as easily as, say, Cyrillic.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>We tend to think of text as a means to an end, that the characters depicted are there only to convey meaning.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>It didn’t have to be this way. As early as 1951, just four years after wresting off British rule, Pakistan — where Urdu is both the official language and played a key role in the movement for independence — set up a national printing press that could compose in both English and Urdu, a substantial investment for the young, cash-strapped country and an indication, perhaps, of Urdu’s importance for its nation-building project. But even though Monotype and Linotype, the predominant printing technology firms of the time, kept developing typefaces for the Urdu market, local publishers kept rejecting them because they just didn’t match up to the local nastaʿlīq aesthetic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Part of the reason nastaʿlīq ran into trouble was because the technology at the time — specifically the typewriter — was built with English in mind. Subsequently, as historian Thomas S. Mullaney notes in his book, “The Chinese Typewriter,” all other languages are seen as permutations from that norm. Hebrew is English but backward. Arabic is English backward and in cursive. Russian: English with different letters. Siamese: English with too many letters. Perhaps the only major language to escape the thumb of Latin hegemony was Chinese, a script that is neither alphabetic nor syllabic, and thus <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/wubi-effect">had to be imagined entirely outside the box of existing technology</a>. But nastaʿlīq, presumably not quite significant enough to send typographers back to the drawing board, remained stalled until the 1970s, its mechanical rendering nowhere close to the sweep and flourish of the handwritten script.</p>



<p>In modern-day Iran, where nastaʿlīq originated, the font changed to meet the limitations of the existing technology. Over the years, Farsi slowly developed a typographical identity that worked within the constraints of the block printing press but was stylistically different enough from the Arabic naskh to feel sufficiently “Persian.” If you pick up a newspaper in Tehran today, it looks significantly different from a paper in Karachi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why didn’t Urdu, and Pakistan, go down a similar typographical route as Farsi did in Iran? Stubborn fidelity to nastaʿlīq aside, one reason may be the ways in which Urdu differed from other nastaʿlīq-favoring languages. One letter, “the <em>baṛī ye</em> (ے), is particularly influential on the look of written Urdu,” writes typographer and historian Titus Nemeth in “Arabic Type-Making in the Machine Age” (2017), “and its typographic rendering is among the most challenging design questions in an Arabic font.”</p>



<p>The baṛī ye, which resembles a bent elbow, produces all sorts of mechanical obstacles with regard to kerning and the placement of dots and diacritics. Baṛī ye and letters like it posed a problem that seemed so insurmountable, in fact, that, in the 1960s — mimicking Mustafa Kemal Atatürk’s <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2013-06-25/some-turks-reconsidering-arabic-connection-turkish-language">mission to convert Turkish script into a Latin alphabet</a> — Pakistan’s military ruler Ayub Khan proposed officially writing Urdu in Latin letters. He was met with near-instant pushback: the nastaʿlīq script, protested local religious leaders, was an essential marker of Pakistan’s Islamic identity. Without meaningful progress in the printing process, Urdu publications in Pakistan, including dailies, continued to be written by hand well into the 1980s, armies of calligraphers scribbling furiously day and night.</p>

<p><strong>Ahmed Mirza Jamil,</strong> owner of a printing business in Karachi, inherited his love for nastaʿlīq from his father, who, in his later life, took up the daunting task of writing the Quran in his own hand. He’d completed only a third of the holy book before he fell ill and died, but his sons vowed to finish his cherished project. They photographed their father’s nine handwritten chapters, then cut and pasted his letter formations to piece together — like a jigsaw puzzle — the remaining two-thirds of the Quran. It was a staggeringly elaborate labor of love that took 14 years to complete. And it sowed the seeds for a long-awaited breakthrough in Urdu typesetting.</p>



<p>In 1980, Mirza Jamil wrote out every combination of Urdu letters that he could think of — roughly 20,000 by most accounts. These combinations, known as ligatures, became the basis of a new Urdu typeface: Noori Nastaliq, a font Jamil named after his father. It solved the difficulty posed by the shape-shifting nature of nastaʿlīq: instead of representing letters, it represented entire <em>combinations</em> of letters written together. The 20,000 ligatures were by no means exhaustive, but the chances of any other combination cropping up, Mirza Jamil reckoned, were negligible. He’d been inspired to address Urdu typographical troubles after encountering a Chinese keyboard, a 48-inch contraption with up to 500 characters, on a trip to Singapore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I thought, if the Chinese could do it,” he told a journalist in 1996, “so could we.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the advent of Noori Nastaliq, Mirza Jamil was hailed as Pakistan’s Gutenburg and bestowed with state honors. Urdu’s path to progress, <a href="http://elite.com.pk/epl/portfolio/noori-nastaliq/revolution/">one writer wrote</a>, “will be lit with the candle of Noori Nastaliq.” Still, adoption was tentative: for a while, according to the historian Nemeth, the country’s largest national newspaper, <em>Daily Jang,</em> carried typographically composed text alongside columns that were still handwritten, hoping to convince the nastaʿlīq purists that their beloved font could be printed too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For decades, Noori Nastaliq remained the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><p>TLDR: Hopsworks Feature Store provides an open ecosystem that connects to the largest number of data storage, data pipelines, and data science platforms. You can connect the Feature Store to Amazon Redshift to transform your data into features to train models and make predictions.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Amazon Redshift is a popular managed data warehouse on AWS. Companies use Redshift to store structured data for traditional data analytics. This makes Redshift a popular source of raw data for computing features for training machine learning models.</p><p>The <a href="https://hopsworks.ai/">Hopsworks Feature Store</a> is the leading open-source feature store for machine learning. It is provided as a managed service on AWS and it includes all the tools needed to transform data in Redshift into features that will be used when training and serving ML models.</p><p>In this blog post, we show how you can configure the Redshift storage connector to ingest data, transform that data into features (feature engineering) and save the pre-computed features in the Hopsworks Feature Store.</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>To follow this tutorial users should have an Hopsworks Feature Store instance running on <a href="https://hopsworks.ai/">https://hopsworks.ai</a>. You can register for free with no credit-card and receive 4000 USD of credits to get started.</p><p>Users should also have an existing Redshift cluster. If you don't have an existing cluster, you can create one by <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/event-publishing-redshift-cluster.html">following the AWS Documentation</a>&nbsp;</p><h2>Step 1 - Configure the Redshift Storage Connector</h2><p>The first step to be able to ingest Redshift data into the feature store is to configure a storage connector. The Redshift connector requires you to specify the following properties. Most of them are available in the properties area of your cluster in the Redshift UI.<br></p><figure id="w-node-b7490abf-482a-50ff-a1bf-f54e1504520c-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/602234d0a3b70153cb637d34_xIgpoz4HkI5nYiN2izzA3-UYqQZS6HImR-D2_U5SdOzsXeURiaX5ihMkiKyAw6iHJK4k8ZFPMBhTEiNBe2t4X-Vq7yYgpAXO2dxw73z0rkMeELNX9TZx9uvVrhwA2seJ-BPZxAap.png" alt=""></p></figure><ul role="list"><li>Cluster identifier: The name of the cluster</li><li>Database driver: You can use the default JDBC Redshift Driver `com.amazon.redshift.jdbc42.Driver` (More on this later)</li><li>Database endpoint: The endpoint for the database. Should be in the format of `[UUID].eu-west-1.redshift.amazonaws.com`</li><li>Database name: The name of the database to query</li><li>Database port: The port of the cluster. Defaults to 5349</li></ul><p>There are two options available for authenticating with the Redshift cluster. The first option is to configure a username and a password. The password is stored in the secret store and made available to all the members of the project.</p><p>The second option is to configure an IAM role. With IAM roles,&nbsp;Jobs or notebooks launched on Hopsworks&nbsp; do not need to explicitly authenticate with Redshift, as the HSFS library will transparently use the IAM role to acquire a temporary credential to authenticate the specified user.&nbsp;</p><p>In Hopsworks, there are two different ways to configure an IAM role: <a href="https://docs.hopsworks.ai/hopsworksai/aws/restrictive_permissions/#step-2-create-an-instance-profile">a per-cluster IAM role</a> or a <a href="https://hopsworks.readthedocs.io/en/stable/admin_guide/cloud_role_mapping.html?highlight=federated%20iam">federated IAM role (role chaining)</a>. For the per-cluster IAM role, you select an instance profile for your Hopsworks cluster when launching it in <a href="https://hopsworks.ai/" target="_blank">hopsworks.ai</a>, and all jobs or notebooks will be run with the selected IAM role.&nbsp; For the federated IAM role, you create a head IAM role for the cluster that enables Hopsworks to assume a potentially different IAM role in each project. You can even restrict it so that only certain roles within a project (like a data owner) can assume a given role.&nbsp;</p><p>With regards to the database driver, the library to interact with Redshift *is not* included in Hopsworks - you need to upload the driver yourself. First, you need to download the library from <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/configure-jdbc-connection.html#download-jdbc-driver">here</a>. Select the driver version without the AWS SDK. You then upload the driver files to the “Resources” dataset in your project, see the screenshot below. </p><figure id="w-node-a31e49a7-7b96-c50f-59b9-bd30224ff164-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/6023c30543ea2172d0111008_screesnshot_01.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Upload the Redshift Driver (jar file) from your local machine to the Resources dataset.</figcaption></figure><p>Then, you add the file to your notebook or job before launching it, as shown in the screenshots below.</p><figure id="w-node-_1da7fb89-28a9-62a6-0cef-fb3d8267376d-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/6023c33ec4463ca75c8c4db9_screesnshot_02.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Before starting the JupyterLab server, add the Redshift driver jar file, so that it becomes available to jobs run in the notebook.</figcaption></figure><h2>Step 2- Define an external (on-demand) Feature Group<br></h2><p>Hopsworks supports the creation of (a) cached feature groups and (b) external (on-demand) feature groups. For cached feature groups, the features are stored in Hopsworks feature store. For external feature groups, only metadata for features is stored in the feature store - not the actual feature data which is read from the external database/object-store. When the external feature group is accessed from a Spark or Python job, the feature data is read on-demand using a connector from the external store. On AWS, Hopsworks supports the creation of external feature groups from a large number of data stores, including Redshift, RDS, Snowflake, S3, and any JDBC-enabled source.&nbsp;</p><p>In this example, we will define an external feature group for a table in Redshift. External feature groups in Hopsworks support “provenance” in the Hopsworks Web UI, you can track which features are stored on which external systems and how they are computed. Additionally HSFS (the Python/Scala library used to interact with the feature store) provides the same APIs for external feature groups as for cached feature groups.</p><p>An external (on-demand) feature group can be defined as follow:</p><p>
    -- CODE language-bash --
# We named the storage connector defined in step 1 telco_redshift_cluster
redshift_conn = fs.get_storage_connector("telco_redshift_cluster")

telco_on_dmd = fs.create_on_demand_feature_group(name="telco_redshift",
                            	version=1,
                            	query="select * from telco",
                            	description="On-demand feature group for telecom customer data",
                            	storage_connector=redshift_conn,
                            	statistics_config=True)

telco_on_dmd.save()
</p><p>When running `save()` the metadata is stored in the feature store and statistics for the data are computed and made available through the Hopsworks UI. Statistics helps data scientists in the quest of building better features from raw data.</p><h2>Step 3 -&nbsp; Engineer features and save to the Feature Store</h2><p>On-demand feature groups can be used directly as a source for creating training datasets. This is often the case if a company is migrating to Hopsworks and there are already feature engineering pipelines in production writing data to Redshift.</p><p>This flexibility provided by Hopsworks allows users to hit the ground running from day 1, without having to rewrite their pipelines to take advantage of the benefits the Hopsworks feature store provides.</p><p>
    -- CODE language-bash --
telco_on_dmd\
	.select(['customer_id', 'internet_service', 'phone_service', 'total_charges', 'churn'])\
</p><p>On-demand feature groups can also be joined with cached feature groups in Hopsworks to create training datasets. This <a href="https://docs.hopsworks.ai/generated/query_vs_dataframe/">helper guide</a>&nbsp; explains in detail how the HSFS joining APIs work and how they can be used to create training datasets.<br></p><p>If, however, Redshift contains raw data that needs to be feature engineered, you can retrieve a Spark DataFrame backed by the Redshift table using the HSFS API.<br></p><p>
    -- CODE language-bash --
spark_df = telco_on_dmd.read()
</p><p>You can then transform your `spark_df` into features using feature engineering libraries. It is also possible to retrieve the dataframe as a Pandas dataframe and perform the feature engineering steps in Python code.&nbsp;<br></p><p>You can then save the final dataframe containing the engineered features to the feature store as a cached feature group:<br></p><p>
    -- CODE language-bash --
telco_fg = fs.create_feature_group(name="telco_customer_features",
                            	version=1,
                            	description="Telecom customer features",
                            	online_enabled=True,
                            	time_travel_format="HUDI",
                            	primary_key=["customer_id"],
                            	statistics_config=True)
spark_df = telco_on_dmd.read()
</p><p>Storing feature groups as cached feature groups within Hopsworks provides several benefits over on-demand feature groups. First it allows users to leverage Hudi for incremental ingestion (with ACID properties, ensuring the integrity of the feature group) and time travel capabilities. As new data is ingested, new commits are tracked by Hopsworks allowing users to see what has changed over time. On each commit, statistics are computed and tracked in Hopsworks, allowing users to understand how the data has changed over time.<br></p><p>Cached feature groups can also be stored in the online feature store (`online_enabled=True`), thus enabling low latency access to the features using the online feature store API.<br></p><h2>Get started</h2><p>Get started today on Hopsworks.ai by configuring your Redshift storage connector and run <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/hops-examples/blob/master/notebooks/featurestore/aws/redshift/Redshift_pyspark.ipynb">this notebook</a>.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

		<em>A most likely naive suggestion.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		A few years ago, my mother (born 1940) went to Paris on vacation with her older sister. She was a little concerned if she'd be able to navigate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_M%C3%A9tro">Métro</a>, so she asked me to print out all sorts of maps in advance. I wasn't keen on another encounter with my nemesis, the printer, so I instead showed her how she could use Google Maps to get on-demand routes. Google Maps now include timetables and line information for many metropolitan subway lines around the world. I've successfully used it to find my way around London, Paris, New York, Tokyo, Sydney, and Melbourne.
	</p>
	<p>
		It even works in my backwater home-town:
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="https://blog.ploeh.dk/content/binary/cph-metro-map.png" alt="Snapshot of Copenhagen Metro route generated by Google Maps.">
	</p>
	<p>
		It's rapidly turning into indispensable digital infrastructure, and that's beginning to trouble me.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can still get paper maps of the various rapid transit systems around the world, but for how long?

	<p>
		If you're old enough, you may remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_directory">phone books</a>. In the days of land lines and analogue phones, you'd look up a number and then dial it. As the internet became increasingly ubiquitous, phone directories went online as well. Paper phone books were seen as waste, and ultimately disappeared from everyday life.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can think of paper phone books as a piece of infrastructure that's now gone. I don't miss them, but it's worth reflecting on what impact their disappearing has. Today, if I need to find a phone number, Google is often the place I go. The physical infrastructure is gone, replaced by a digital infrastructure.
	</p>
	<p>
		Google, in particular, now provides important infrastructure for modern society. Not only web search, but also maps, video sharing, translation, emails, and much more.
	</p>
	<p>
		Other companies offer other services that verge on being infrastructure. Facebook is more than just updates to friends and families. Many organisations, including schools and universities, coordinate activities via Facebook, and the political discourse increasingly happens there and on Twitter.
	</p>
	<p>
		We've come to rely on these 'free' services to a degree that resembles our reliance on physical infrastructure like the power grid, running water, roads, telephones, etcetera.
	</p>

		TANSTAAFL <a href="#bf364e0f0ca84fbbb0536b462743993b" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a> coined the phrase <em>There ain't no such thing as a free lunch</em> (TANSTAAFL) in his excellent book <a href="https://amzn.to/3pWi7aM">The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</a>. Indeed, the digital infrastructure isn't free.
	</p>
	<p>
		Recent events have magnified some of the cost we're paying. In January, Facebook and Twitter suspended the then-president of the United States from the platforms. I've little sympathy for Donald Trump, who strikes me as an uncouth narcissist, but since I'm a Danish citizen living in Denmark, I don't think that I ought to have much of an opinion about American politics.
	</p>
	<p>
		I do think, on the other hand, that the suspension sets an uncomfortable precedent.
	</p>
	<p>
		Should we let a handful of tech billionaires control essential infrastructure? This time, the victim was someone half the world was glad to see go, but who's next? Might these companies suspend the accounts of politicians who work against them?
	</p>
	<p>
		Never in the history of the world has decision power over so many people been so concentrated. I'll remind my readers that Facebook, Twitter, Google, etcetera are in worldwide use. The decisions of a handful of majority shareholders can now affect billions of people.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you're suspended from one of these platforms, you may lose your ability to participate in school activities, or from finding your way through a foreign city, or from taking part of the democratic discussion.

	</h3>
	<p>
		In this article, I mainly want to focus on the free-speech issue related mostly to Facebook and Twitter. These companies make money from ads. The longer you stay on the platform, the more ads they can show you, and they've discovered that nothing pulls you in like anger. These incentives are incredibly counter-productive for society.
	</p>
	<p>
		Users are implicitly encouraged to create or spread anger, yet few are held accountable. One reason is that you can easily create new accounts without disclosing your real-world identity. This makes it difficult to hold users accountable for their utterances.
	</p>
	<p>
		Instead of clear rules, users are suspended for inexplicable and arbitrary reasons. It seems that these are mostly the verdicts of algorithms, but as we've seen in the case of Donald Trump, it can also be the result of an undemocratic, but political decision.
	</p>
	<p>
		Everyone can lose their opportunities for self-expression for arbitrary reasons. This is a free-speech issue.
	</p>
	<p>
		Yes, free speech.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm well aware that Facebook and Twitter are private companies, and no-one has any <em>right</em> to an account on those platforms. That's why I started this essay by discussing how these services are turning into infrastructure.
	</p>
	<p>
		More than a century ago, the telephone was new technology operated by private companies. I know the Danish history best, but it serves well as an example. <a href="https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTAS">KTAS</a>, one of the world's first telephone companies, was a private company. Via mergers and acquisitions, it still is, but as it grew and became the backbone of the country's electronic communications network, the government introduced legislation. For decades, it and its sister companies were regional monopolies.
	</p>
	<p>
		The government allowed the monopoly in exchange for various obligations. Even when the monopoly ended in 1996, the original monopoly companies inherited these legal obligations. For instance, every Danish citizen has the right to get a land-line installed, even if that installation by itself is a commercial loss for the company. This could be the case on certain remote islands or other rural areas. The Danish state compensates the telephone operator for this potential loss.
	</p>
	<p>
		Many other utility companies run in a similar fashion. Some are semi-public, some are private, but common to water, electricity, garbage disposal, heating, and other operators is that they are regulated by government.
	</p>
	<p>
		When a utility becomes important to the functioning of society, a sensible government steps in to regulate it to ensure the further smooth functioning of society.
	</p>
	<p>
		I think that the services offered by Google, Facebook, and Twitter are fast approaching a level of significance that ought to trigger government regulation.
	</p>
	<p>
		I don't say that lightly. I'm actually quite libertarian in my views, but I'm no anarcho-libertarian. I do acknowledge that a state offers essential services such as protection of property rights, a judicial system, and so on.
	</p>
	<h3 id="f4c78c79e1eb46d2941611d443f89ea1">
		Accountability <a href="#f4c78c79e1eb46d2941611d443f89ea1" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		How should we regulate social media? I think we should start by exchanging accountability for the right to post.
	</p>
	<p>
		Let's take another step back for a moment. For generations, it's been possible to send a letter to the editor of a regular newspaper. If the editor deems it worthy for publication, it'll be printed in the next issue. You don't have any right to get your letter published; this happens at the discretion of the editor.
	</p>
	<p>
		Why does it work that way? It works that way because the editor is accountable for what's printed in the paper. Ultimately, he or she can go to jail for what's printed.
	</p>
	<p>
		Freedom of speech is more complicated than it looks at first glance. For instance, censorship in Denmark was abolished with the 1849 constitution. This doesn't mean that you can freely say whatever you'd like; it only means that government has no right to <em>prevent</em> you from saying or writing something. You can still be prosecuted after the fact if you say or write something libellous, or if you incite violence, or if you disclose secrets that you've agreed to keep, etcetera.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is accountability. It works when the person making the utterance is known and within reach of the law.
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice, particularly, that an editor-in-chief is accountable for a newspaper's contents. Why isn't Facebook or Twitter accountable for content?

		These companies have managed to spin a story that they're <em>platforms</em> rather than publishers. This argument might have had some legs ten years ago. When I started using Twitter in 2009, the algorithm was easy to understand: My feed showed the tweets from the accounts that I followed, in the order that they were published. This was easy to understand, and Twitter didn't, as far as I could tell, edit the feed. Since no editing took place, I find the platform argument applicable.
	</p>
	<p>
		Later, the social networks began editing the feeds. No humans were directly involved, but today, some posts are amplified while others get little attention. Since this is done by 'algorithms' rather than editors, the companies have managed to convince lawmakers that they're still only platforms. Let's be real, though. Apparently, the public needs a programmer to say the following, and I'm a programmer.
	</p>
	<p>
		Programmers, employees of those companies, wrote the algorithms. They experimented and tweaked those algorithms to maximise 'engagement'. Humans are continually involved in this process. Editing takes place.
	</p>
	<p>
		I think it's time to stop treating social media networks as platforms, and start treating them as publishers.

	<p>
		Facebook and Twitter will protest that it's practically impossible for them to 'edit' what happens on the networks. I find this argument unconvincing, since editing already takes place.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'd like to suggest a partial way out, though. This brings us back to regulation.
	</p>
	<p>
		I think that each country or jurisdiction should make it possible for users to opt in to being accountable. Users should be able to verify their accounts as real, legal persons. If they do that, their activity on the platform should be governed by the jurisdiction in which they reside, instead of by the arbitrary and ill-defined 'community guidelines' offered by the networks. You'd be accountable for your …</p></div></div>

          <p><small>Posted by Matthew Wild on February 9 2021</small></p><p><em>There is a significant difference between developing and promoting a
protocol (such as XMPP) and a product (such as Signal). Both approaches
have their advantages and disadvantages. This post details how and why
Snikket aims to strike a balance between the two.</em></p>
<h2 id="products-vs-protocols">Products vs Protocols</h2>
<p>This past weekend I gave a talk at the (virtual) FOSDEM conference about
a topic I’ve been thinking about a lot the past few years - the differences
between developing a product and developing a protocol.</p>
<p>You can watch the talk <a href="https://peertube.thepacket.exchange/videos/watch/96e35d83-e70c-4a87-868b-f9cbeb48e1d0">here</a>, but there were many things I
wanted to touch upon that wouldn’t fit into the 20 minute slot. This post
will cover the same topics, but expands on some of the points I
discussed.</p>
<h2 id="previously-in-open-protocols">Previously, in open protocols…</h2>
<p>I’ve been involved with <a href="https://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a> (once known as Jabber) for over 15
years. It is now over 20 years since XMPP’s inception, and over this
time XMPP, along with the rest of the tech industry, has seen significant
change.</p>
<p>XMPP began life in the late 1990s, as an attempt to break into the
messaging silos of that era. The names and logos may have been different,
but it was a very similar landscape to today - oversized tech companies
fighting each other for control over people who simply want to use the
internet for what it was designed, communicating with one another.</p>
<p>Email got lucky. A standard protocol managed to break down the walls of
even the final fortress of resistance, AOL. This was achieved largely
because the adoption of standard protocols by smaller providers allowed
them to form a network together that began to threaten even America’s
largest ISP.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we never quite reached that point with instant messaging.
However that hasn’t stopped many of us from continuing to strive for a
similar outcome even as our symbol of hope, the open email network, is
under threat today more than ever before.</p>
<p>Despite numerous projects, communities and organizations campaigning for
decades in favour of open messaging systems, the space is still
dominated by large silos. The largest the world has ever known. WhatsApp
alone has over <em>2 billion</em> users. That means a significant portion of
the world’s communications are flowing through a single company. A
company that has a simple business model - amassing data about people
and leveraging that data to help their actual customers (other
businesses) influence the beliefs, biases and behaviour of the users of
their platforms.</p>
<h2 id="the-slippery-slope">The slippery slope</h2>
<p>Despite the dizzying numbers associated with WhatsApp today, it had more
humble beginnings. Founded by two ex-Yahoo employees, Brian Acton and
Jan Koum, it began as a simple messaging app for iPhones. The server was
originally based on an <a href="https://www.process-one.net/blog/whatsapp-facebook-erlang-and-realtime-messaging-it-all-started-with-ejabberd/">open-source XMPP server</a>, and
used the XMPP protocol. However the goal of WhatsApp was not openness
and federation, and they soon diverged far from standard XMPP.</p>
<p>As WhatsApp grew, early users may recall that they also began charging a
small fee for accounts ($1/year). Their reasoning was simple:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>â€œRemember, when advertising is involved <strong>you the user</strong>
    are the product.</p>
    <p>Your data isn't even in the picture. We are simply not interested in any of it.</p>
    <p>When people ask us why we charge for WhatsApp,
    we say â€˜Have you considered the alternative?â€™â€œ</p>
    <p><a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/why-we-don-t-sell-ads">
         <strong>WhatsApp blog post â€œWhy we don't sell adsâ€œ, June 2012</strong>
       </a>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, just two years later it was announced that WhatsApp had
been acquired by the internet’s fastest-growing advertising platform,
Facebook.</p>
<p>Despite declaring to the EU competition commission that linking an
individual’s data between WhatsApp and Facebook was not technically
feasible this is exactly what they went on to do, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/18/facebook-fined-eu-whatsapp-european-commission">leading to a â‚¬94
million fine</a>. Little by little, Facebook has been
loosening their privacy policies to allow them to absorb WhatsApp data
into their daily operations.</p>
<p>So when, in early 2021, the latest update to the privacy policy gave users
of the platform a clear ultimatum to allow this sharing or close their
account, many users wisely began to seek alternatives. Finally, the
moment we had been waiting for had arrived.</p>
<p>Many of us advocates of open communications seized the opportunity, and
recommendations were soon flying around for the wide range of alternative
messaging systems we’ve been building these past years. “Use XMPP!”,
“Use Matrix!”, “Use Signal!”, to name a few.</p>
<p>Despite a marked increase of signups on XMPP and Matrix servers, of
these three it was Signal that won by far the largest share of new users.
Millions of people flocked from WhatsApp and overloaded Signal’s servers,
resulting in disrupted message delivery across Signal’s service for days.</p>
<p>This service disruption was possible because, unlike XMPP and Matrix,
Signal is centralized, and all messages flow through a single set of
servers, the same model as WhatsApp.</p>
<p>XMPP and Matrix are both federated networks. Rather than a single entity
controlling the network, there are many servers to choose from, run by
many different independent providers. Even with a server down,
overloaded or closed to new users, the rest of the network continues
functioning.</p>
<p>So why did Signal receive millions of users, and XMPP/Matrix did not?</p>
<h2 id="signal">Signal</h2>
<p>At this point it’s impossible not to reference <a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/">The Ecosystem is Moving</a>,
a 2016 blog post by Signal’s founder and CEO, Moxie Marlinspike. In this
post Moxie details all the problems he sees with protocols becoming
open internet standards. In particular, that they lose their ability to
evolve, and that evolution is vital to compete in our industry’s “moving
ecosystem”.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>We got to HTTP version 1.1 in 1997, and have been stuck there
       until now. Likewise, SMTP, IRC, DNS, XMPP, are all similarly
       frozen in time circa the late 1990s.</p>
    <p><a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/">
         <strong>Signal blog post â€œThe ecosystem is movingâ€œ, May 2016</strong>
       </a>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well. Far from being frozen in time, XMPP has changed significantly in the past
20 years.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://snikket.org/blog/products-vs-protocols/xmpp_2004_2021.png"> 
</figure>

<p>Just some of the things we have now that we didn’t have in the beginning:</p>
<ul>
<li>End-to-end encryption using OMEMO (based on Signalâ€™s protocol and
audited), with multi-device and offline capabilities</li>
<li>Audio/video calling (now 2nd generation, encrypted, WebRTC-compatible)</li>
<li>Mobile optimizations (bandwidth, connectivity, push notifications)</li>
<li>Full cross-device message synchronization</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these things didn’t even exist as concepts back when XMPP began.
Adding them was only possible due to XMPP’s smart design: a core
protocol, with a <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/">suite of extensions</a> (known as XEPs). New
extensions are added as needed, and irrelevant ones get deprecated.</p>
<p>To help keep everyone on the same page as the protocol evolves, the XMPP
Standards Foundation (XSF) annually publishes the recommended XEPs that
different classes of software (e.g. instant messaging,
<a href="https://xmpp.org/uses/social.html">social networking</a>, or <a href="https://xmpp.org/uses/internet-of-things.html">smart devices</a>) should be
implementing. These round-ups are known as <a href="https://xmpp.org/about/compliance-suites.html">compliance suites</a>.</p>
<p>The documentation site <a href="https://docs.modernxmpp.org/">Modern XMPP</a> also serves as a useful reference
guide for modern XMPP implementations (including UI/UX considerations,
which are not covered by the protocol-level documentation).</p>
<h2 id="the-unfortunate-truth">The unfortunate truth</h2>
<p>The effort required in advancing the protocol <em>is</em> significant. And that’s
not even counting the implementation work. XMPP has a diverse and open
ecosystem. There is no single “XMPP client”, instead the ecosystem is
composed of… just about anyone who decides to write XMPP software. The
vast majority of this software is free/open-source, and developed by
volunteers and communities.</p>
<p>Publishing protocol updates does not magically mean the changes are
implemented in all XMPP software overnight. Some projects are more active
than others, and each contributor is an individual with their own life
and work schedule. Unfortunately this means that it’s very difficult to
evolve the protocol and keep everyone 100% in sync. Luckily XMPP’s
modular design makes it easy for some software to advance ahead of others
without having to lose backwards compatibility with the rest of the
network. If we didn’t have this feature, we would always be in a state where
half of the network is unable to communicate with the other half of the
network, or more likely we would be stuck with the initial set of
features because nobody would want to be the first ones to become
incompatible with everyone else.</p>
<p>But Moxie is right. We could move <strong>much</strong> faster if we didn’t care about
interoperability, software diversity, and decentralization.</p>
<p>And that is the approach Signal is taking.</p>
<h2 id="product-or-protocol">Product or protocol?</h2>
<p>It’s clear that there are trade-offs to be made here. Signal’s
product-led development excludes others from participating in the Signal
network. But it allows them to remain agile, and implement new features
as fast as they can write and ship code.</p>
<p>I put together some of the trade-offs into the following table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Building an ecosystem</th>
<th>Building a product</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Focus on protocol</td>
<td>Focus on implementation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mostly documentation</td>
<td>Mostly code</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cross-project collaboration</td>
<td>Single project/team</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Building for developers</td>
<td>Building for end-users</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Slow evolution</td>
<td>Evolves as fast as you want</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Achieve diversity</td>
<td>Achieve a monoculture</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Robust</td>
<td>Single point of failure</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I think that Signal’s approach is laudable for the number of people that
they have helped divert from data-mining platforms, and helping to remind
people that surveillance capitalism isn’t the only way to do things.</p>
<p>They’ve built a good user-friendly product, and they have done it with
security and privacy at its heart.</p>
<p>But we have to aspire to more than this. Signal is a centralized, closed
system. That means to communicate with your contacts who use Signal, you
must also consent to their terms, their software, their US jurisdiction.
You have to be okay with their servers being hosted with large cloud
providers such as Amazon and Google.</p>
<p>But one thing the past has shown us is that things change. Technologies
evolve, business leaders come and go, motives adjust. Signal today may
be as benign as WhatsApp before its acquisition by Facebook. But …</p></div></div>

		<div>

			
<p>A few years ago, when the IETF’s Crypto Forum Research Group was deeply entrenched in debates about elliptic curves for security (which eventually culminated in RFC 7748 and RFC 8032), an IT Consultant <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/VXLC6cj2KwecsWRhp0yJXLF9jEw/">showed up on the mailing list</a> with their homemade cipher, Crystalline.</p>



<p>Mike Hamburg <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/4c-nx0N9YGh6Qb3SBmM-B6ICaA8/">politely</a> informed the consultant that the CFRG isn’t the right forum for proposing new symmetric ciphers, or even new modes for symmetric ciphers, and invited them to email them off-list.</p>



<p>If you’re not familiar with the CFRG, let me just say, this was on the more patient and measured responses I’ve ever read.</p>



<p>Naturally, the author of Crystalline responded with this:</p>



<blockquote><p>I’m somewhat disappointed in your reply, as I presumed that someone with a stated interest in ciphers would be eager to investigate anything new to pop up that didn’t have obvious holes in it. It almost sounds like you have had your soul crushed by bureaucracy over the years and have lost all passion for this field.</p><cite>Full quote available <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/4c-nx0N9YGh6Qb3SBmM-B6ICaA8/">here</a>. It doesn’t get much better.</cite></blockquote>

(Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/lynxvsjackalope">Khia</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The discussion continued until Tony Arcieri dropped <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/e-jEGddvSbManBMppC8XAc5i8GY/">one of the most brutal takedowns</a> of a cryptographic design in CFRG history.</p>



<blockquote><p>I think the biggest problem though is all of this has already been pointed out to you repeatedly in other forums and you completely refuse to acknowledge that your cipher fails to meet the absolute most minimum criteria for a secure cipher.</p><cite>Tony Arcieri, landing a cryptographic 360 no-scope on Crystalline.</cite></blockquote>



<p>In spite of this mic drop moment, the author of Crystalline continued to double down and insist that a symmetric cipher doesn’t need to be indistinguishable from randomness to be secure (which, to severely understate the affairs, is simply not true).</p>



<p>Normally, when a cipher fails at the indistinguishable test, it’s subtle. This is what Crystalline ciphertexts look like.</p>

<p>Modern ciphers produce something that will look like white noise, like an old TV without the cable plugged in. There should be no discernible pattern.</p>



<p>Crystalline’s author remained convinced that Crystalline’s “131072-bit keys” and claims of “information-theoretic security” were compelling enough to warrant consideration by the standards body that keeps the Internet running.</p>



<p>This was in 2015. In the year 2021, I can safely say that Crystalline adoption never really took off.</p>



<h2>Against Crackpot Crypto</h2>



<p>Instances of Crackpot Cryptography don’t always look like Crystalline. Sometimes the authors are more charismatic, or have more financial resources to bedazzle would-be <s>suckers</s>^<sup>investors</sup>. Other times, they’re less brazen and keep their designs far away from the watchful gaze of expert opinions–lest their mistakes be exposed for all to see.</p>



<p>Crackpot cryptography is considered dangerous–not because we want people to avoid encryption entirely, but because crackpot cryptography offers a false sense of security. This leads to users acting in ways they wouldn’t if they knew there was little-to-no security. Due to the strictly performative nature of these security measures, I also like to call them <strong>Security Theater</strong> (although that term is more broadly applicable in other contexts).</p>



<p>The Cryptology community has a few defense mechanisms in place to prevent the real-world adoption of crackpot cryptography. More specifically, we have pithy mottos that distill best practices in a way that usually gets the intent across. (Hey, it’s something!) Unfortunately, the rest of the security industry outside of cryptology often weaponizes these mottos to promote useless and harmful gatekeeping.</p>



<p>The best example of this is the, “Don’t roll your own crypto!” motto.</p>



<h3 id="roll-your-own">They See Me Rollin’ [My Own Crypto]</h3>



<p>Crackpots never adhere to this rule, so anyone who violates it immediately or often, with wild abandon, can be safely dismissed for kooky behavior.</p>



<p>But if taken to its literal, logical extreme, this rule mandates that nobody would ever write cryptographic code and we wouldn’t <em>have</em> cryptography libraries to begin with. So, clearly, it’s a rule meant to be sometimes broken.</p>



<p>This is why some cryptography engineers <a href="https://www.cryptofails.com/post/75204435608/write-crypto-code-dont-publish-it">soften the message a bit</a> and encourage tinkering for the sake of education. The world needs more software engineers qualified to write cryptography.</p>



<p>After all, you wouldn’t expect to hear “Don’t roll your own crypto” being levied against Jason Donenfeld (WireGuard) or Frank Denis (libsodium), despite the fact that both of those people did just that.</p>



<p>But what about <a href="https://dholecrypto.com/">a high-level library that defers to libsodium for its actual crypto implementations</a>?</p>







<p>In a twist that surprises no one, lazy heuristics have a high false positive rate. In this case, the lazy heuristic is both, “What qualifies as rolling one’s own crypto?” as well as, “When is it safe to break this rule?”</p>



<p>More broadly, though, is that these knee-jerk responses are a misfiring defense mechanism intended to stop quacks from taking all the air out of the room.</p>



<p>It doesn’t always work, though. There have been a few downright absurd instances of crackpot cryptography in the past few years.</p>



<h2>Modern Examples of Crypto Crackpottery</h2>



<h3 id="craig-wright">Craig Wright’s Sartre Signature Scam</h3>



<p>Satoshi Nakamoto is the alias of the anonymous cryptographer that invented Bitcoin. In the years since Satoshi has gone quiet, a few cranks have come out of the woodwork to claim to be the real Satoshi.</p>



<p>Craig Wright is one of the more famous Satoshi impersonators due to his <a href="https://dankaminsky.com/2016/05/02/validating-satoshi-or-not/">Sartre Signature Scam</a>.</p>



<p>Satoshi’s earliest Bitcoin transactions are public. If you can lift the public key and signature from the transaction and then replay them in a different context as “proof” that you’re Satoshi, you can produce a proof of identity that validates without having to possess Satoshi’s private key. Then you can just wildly claim it’s a signature that validates the text of some philosopher’s prose and a lot of people will believe you.</p>



<p>With a little bit of showmanship added on, you too can convince Gavin Anderson by employing this tactic. (Or maybe not; I imagine he’s learned his lesson by now.)</p>



<h3 id="time-ai">Time AI</h3>



<p>Crown Sterling’s sponsored talk at Black Hat USA 2019 is the most vivid example of crackpot cryptography in most people’s minds.</p>



<p>Even the name “Time AI” just screams buzzword soup, so it should come as no surprise that their talk covered a lot of nonsense: “quasi-prime numbers”, “infinite wave conjugations”, “nano-scale of time”, “speed of AI oscillations”, “unified physics cosmology”, and “multi-dimensional encryption technology”.</p>



<p>Naturally, this pissed a lot of cryptographers off, and the normally even-keeled Dan Guido of Trail of Bits actually called them out on their bullshit during their presentation’s Q&amp;A section.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I yelled at the Time AI guy. It’s ok to get angry at someone trying to harm people.

<p>For most people, the story ended with a bunch of facepalms. But Crown Sterling doubled down and <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/09/crown_sterling_.html">published a press release claiming the ability to break 256-bit RSA keys</a>.</p>

<p>Amusingly, their attack took 50 seconds–which is a lot slower than the standard RSA factoring attacks for small key sizes.</p>



<p>(For those who are missing context: In order to be secure, RSA requires public key sizes in excess of 2048 bits. Breaking 256-bit RSA should take less than a minute on any modern PC.)</p>



<h3 id="terra-quantum">Terra Quantum</h3>



<p>Earlier this week, Bloomberg news ran a story titled, <em><a href="https://archive.md/sZ1Q5">A Swiss Company Says It Found Weakness That Imperils Encryption</a></em>. If you only read the first few paragraphs, it’s really clear that the story basically boils down to, “Swiss Company realizes there’s an entire discipline of computer science dedicated to quantum computers and the risks they pose to cryptography.”</p>



<p>Here’s a quick primer on quantum computers and cryptography:</p>



<p>If a practical quantum computer is ever built, it can immediately break all of the <em>asymmetric</em> cryptography used on the Internet today: RSA, DSA, Diffie-Hellman, Elliptic Curve Cryptography, etc. The attack costs to break these algorithms vary, but are generally in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B32%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{32}" title="2^{32}"> range (for numbers of queries).</p>



<p>The jury is still out on whether or not quantum computers will ever be practical. Just in case, a lot of cryptographers are working on <strong>post-quantum cryptography</strong> (algorithms that are secure even against quantum computers).</p>



<p>Symmetric cryptography fares a lot better: The attack costs are roughly reduced by a factor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt+N&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="\sqrt N" title="\sqrt N">. This makes a 128-bit secure cipher have only a 64-bit security level, which is pretty terrible, but a 256-bit secure cipher remains at the 128-bit security level even with practical quantum computers.</p>



<p>So it’s a little strange that they open with:</p>



<blockquote><p>The company said that its research found vulnerabilities that affect symmetric encryption ciphers, including the Advanced Encryption Standard, or AES, which is widely used to secure data transmitted over the internet and to encrypt files. Using a method known as quantum annealing, the company said its research found that even the strongest versions of AES encryption may be decipherable by quantum computers that could be available in a few years from now.</p><cite>From the Bloomberg article.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Uh, no.</p>



<p>Let’s do some math: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B32%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{32}" title="2^{32}"> calculations can be performed in <em>seconds</em> on modern computers. If we assume that practical quantum computers are also as fast as classical computers, it’s safe to assume this will hold true as well.</p>



<p>You can break 128-bit ciphers in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B64%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{64}" title="2^{64}"> time, using <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/63068/attacking-aes-128-with-grovers-algorithm">Grover’s algorithm</a>. You can’t break 256-bit ciphers <a href="https://pthree.org/2016/06/19/the-physics-of-brute-force/">in any practical time</a>, even with the quantum computer speed-up. Most software prefers 256-bit AES over 128-bit AES for this reason.</p>



<p>What does <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B64%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{64}" title="2^{64}"> time look like?</p>

<p>Published on <span id="pubdate">2021-02-10</span>.</p>
<p>So, you normally do <code>pip install foo</code>, or <code>composer install foo</code>, or <code>npm install foo</code>, or perhaps <code>go get foo</code>, and you never read the source code of the package you just pulled down? Well guess what, that's one (almost) sure way to blow up your project!</p>
<p>Pulling down open source code as a dependency without ever reading the code and verifying that it doesn't contain any backdoors or other malicious content has become <strong>one of the easiest ways to introduce malicious content into a code base</strong>.</p>
<p>All you have to do is this:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Fix some code and create a pull request.</li>
    <li>Fix some more code, perhaps add a new feature, and create more pull requests.</li>
    <li>Upstream "rewards" you with commit access.</li>
    <li>Keep a low profile for a while longer.</li>
    <li>Make a few mistake to check how fast "mistakes" are discovered.</li>
    <li>Create some malicious code disguised as a bug, an honest programming mistake.</li>
    <li>Repeat.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course you cannot validate every single line of code in every open source projects you might use, but I cannot fathom how just about everyone today are completely and blindly trusting every package out there. This is a madness and level of ignorance and naivety in the software industry not previously seen.</p>
<p>In the past many honest mistakes were made, and many systems were not originally programmed with security in mind. But as the industry has progressed and matured, many efforts have been made on many different levels and fronts to improve security, yet for some reason, with the improved access to online cooperation, this has been almost completely set back to a status even worth than in the beginning.</p>
<p>Another different subject, yet just as relevant, is how people keep making popular third party packages "hard" dependencies for their own code base. This is a mistake that very easily can blow up your code base completely, just like this for example: <a href="https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/5771">https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/5771</a></p>
<p>My point with this minor "rant" is that you need to carefully consider what packages you pull down. Don't just trust a project because it is open source. The idea that open source has many eyes watching <strong>is a myth</strong>. Nobody wants to read other peoples code, so very rarely does anyone do that.</p>
<p>Remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed bug</a>?</p>
<p>If your code base is important, make sure (as much as possible) that you can trust the code you pull down as a dependency. Read as much of the third party code as possible, create diffs when changes are made, and investigate and understand how the project handles security. If you don't, you're only asking for trouble.</p>

<p><strong>Gryphon Sql </strong>is a Windows desktop (64 bit) application that takes a CSV or Tab delimited text file and builds a SQL script from its contents. Version 1 has basic functionality that allows you to filter which rows and columns in your data file are used to build the script.</p>



<h2><a href="https://smartedit.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/apps/GryphonSQL.exe">Download here</a></h2>







<p>YOU provide the template SQL that’s used to build the script. YOU choose the columns in your file that form part of the final script. And YOU apply conditions to select the rows to use when building the script.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="619" height="425" src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1.png?w=619" alt="Gryphon SQL Steps" srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1.png 619w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-300x206.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px" data-lazy-srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1.png 619w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-300x206.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1.png?w=619&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>5 Steps to SQL </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The app’s functionality is explained below using a sample CSV file built on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mockaroo.com/" target="_blank">Mockaroo</a> website, containing a list of 1,000 names and email addresses, along with the gender of each person and a status field that contains values between 1 and 6.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1132" height="163" src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1a.png?w=1024" alt="Sample data file" srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1a.png 1132w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1a-300x43.png 300w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1a-1024x147.png 1024w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1a-768x111.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1132px) 100vw, 1132px" data-lazy-srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1a.png 1132w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1a-300x43.png 300w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1a-1024x147.png 1024w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1a-768x111.png 768w" data-lazy-src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1a.png?w=1024&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Sample Data File</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Let’s assume for this example that we want to create a SQL script that populates a new table with only male entries that have a status of 6. The status field may be used to flag whether an account is active, expired, closed, on hold, etc. The purpose of the SQL script we’re generating might then be to update a table in another database with the details of closed or dormant accounts.</p>



<h2>Step 1: Load your Data File</h2>



<p>When you open Gryphon Sql you’ll see the “Load Data File” button along with a few simple file options on the start page. Here you can specify whether the first row in the data file is a header record, and you can specify the delimiter of the data file: comma, tab, or something else.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="269" height="297" src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2.png?w=269" alt="File Options" data-lazy-src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2.png?w=269&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>File Options</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Once you select a file to work with that file is loaded into the UI, and you proceed automatically to Step 2. The app has been tested with a large crime dataset from Chicago containing over 250,000 records.</p>



<h2>Step 2: Choose the Important Columns in your Data file</h2>



<p>The main body of the screen for Step 2 shows you the contents of the data file you’ve selected in a common grid format. If the grid looks incorrect, if the columns are not as expected, then return to Step 1 using the <strong>Previous </strong>button and ensure you’ve selected the correct delimiter. If this doesn’t work, chances are your data file is not in the format you think it is.</p>

<p>To the left of the grid is a section where you define variables. A variable in the Gryphon Sql context is a column in your data file that you want to use to populate your script, or a column that you want to use when applying conditions to a row.</p>



<p>Based on the script we want to generate, we will need to create variables for <em>first_name, last_name</em> and <em>email</em>. We’re also going to be creating conditions based on the gender and status of each record, which means we’ll need to create variables for <em>gender </em>and <em>status </em>as well.</p>



<p>After clicking the Add button, select the data column to use when creating the variable and ensure it has a unique and easily understandable name (Column1, Column2, Column3 are not good names).</p>



<p>Finally, choose a variable type from the drop down. This last step is important, as the variable type dictates what kind of conditional you can build around it.</p>



<p>The screenshot below shows our five variables correctly defined. At this point we can move on to Step 3. If you haven’t defined any variables, you can’t proceed to Step 3 as you have nothing to work with.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Define Conditionals to Apply to These Columns</h2>



<p>On this page, we begin by creating any conditionals we want to apply when selecting the rows to use in building our SQL script. The section to the left is initially populated with a read only list of the variables you defined on the previous page. This is for easy reference only, so you know which values are available to work with.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="760" height="304" src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6.png?w=760" alt="Step 3: Conditionals" srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6.png 760w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6-300x120.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" data-lazy-srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6.png 760w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6-300x120.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6.png?w=760&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Step 3: Conditionals</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>A conditional is a piece of logic that is applied to each row in your data file. If the condition passes, that row and its data are used to populate the SQL script. If it doesn’t pass, the row is excluded from the script.</p>



<p>You may or may not choose to use conditionals. In our example we want to create conditions based around the Gender and Status variables, but you may have decided to build a script based on all rows in the data file, irrespective of gender and status, in which case you should leave the conditional section blank.</p>



<p>Click the Add button to add a new conditional. A panel will appear allowing you to choose a variable to apply an IF statement to. You then select the operand to use and where necessary enter a value next to it.</p>



<p>In our example, we select <em>Status=6</em>, which will give us each record with a status of 6, and exclude all records where the status is between 1 and 5.</p>



<p>Next, add a new conditional. The first conditional is an IF statement, subsequent conditionals add to that in the form of an AND. This second conditional ensures that <em>Gender=Male</em>, giving us only Male records with a status of 6.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="316" height="491" src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.png?w=316" alt="Add Conditionals" srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.png 316w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-193x300.png 193w" sizes="(max-width: 316px) 100vw, 316px" data-lazy-srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.png 316w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-193x300.png 193w" data-lazy-src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.png?w=316&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Add Conditionals</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>Step 4: Write SQL to Apply to Each Row</h2>



<p>Once you’ve defined your conditionals, it’s time to write your SQL template. This is the SQL that you want to build for each row that meets the conditions you’ve already defined. It may be a simple INSERT or UPDATE statement, or it may be a more complex 10 line script, duplicated for each record in the data file.</p>



<p>The template you write uses replacement strings to extract data from columns in your data file. The format of the replacement string is <em>{VariableName}</em>, with no spaces between the curly braces and the name.</p>



<p>A right click menu exists inside the editor to allow you to insert a specific variable replacement string at any point in the template script. You can use the same replacement string as many times as you wish in your script.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="678" height="208" src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8.png?w=678" alt="Insert variables into your template script" srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8.png 678w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8-300x92.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" data-lazy-srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8.png 678w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8-300x92.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8.png?w=678&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Insert Variables Into Your Template Script</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>You are responsible for building the correctly structured SQL around these replacement strings. For example, you need to add the single quotes around a string field and exclude them from integer fields.</p>



<p>The screenshot below shows the INSERT statement we’re building for our example. I’ve added a comment line so that we can check that the conditionals are being correctly applied in our final generated SQL, and a blank comment to break up each record’s SQL for readability.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1117" height="507" src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7.png?w=1024" alt="SQL Template Example" srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7.png 1117w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-300x136.png 300w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-1024x465.png 1024w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-768x349.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1117px) 100vw, 1117px" data-lazy-srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7.png 1117w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-300x136.png 300w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-1024x465.png 1024w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-768x349.png 768w" data-lazy-src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7.png?w=1024&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>SQL Template Example</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Once your template script is ready click “Generate SQL” to create your complete script.</p>



<h2>Step 5: Generate SQL Script</h2>



<p><br>The final page shows your complete script in an edit window. There’s no syntax highlighting on this page, but you have an option to <em>“Save SQL”</em> to a file and then open that file in your favourite SQL editor or client.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="752" height="715" src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10.png?w=752" alt="Generated SQL script in Notepad++" srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10.png 752w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10-300x285.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px" data-lazy-srcset="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10.png 752w, https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10-300x285.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://darrendevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10.png?w=752&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Generated SQL Script in Notepad++</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At this point you should check the contents of the generated SQL to ensure it’s correct. If you had typos in your SQL template or in your replacement variables, this is where you should spot them. Any errors can be fixed by using the Previous button and going back to make changes on previous pages.</p>





<p>A final word of caution: The generated SQL is not validated in any way. You are responsible for checking that it is syntactically correct, and that the data included in the script is the data you wish to use when updating your database. For this reason, I recommend always wrapping your script in a transaction that can be rolled back, and that you first run any script against a test database and verify the results before running it on a Production or QA database.</p>



<p>Version 1 of <strong>Gryphon Sql</strong> is light on features. I do have plans to add much more functionality over time, so check back on a regular basis. Proposed additions include:</p>



<ul><li>Building a project file to save settings per project</li><li>Multiple conditional/SQL template combinations per project</li><li>Generate scripts based on multiple input files in the same format</li><li>Allow for custom pre- and post- SQL to wrap around the generated SQL script</li><li>Full Excel file support (.xlsx)</li><li>Cross platform solution</li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Criminals stole over USD 100 million in cryptocurrencies by hijacking phone numbers</p><div><p>A total of 8 criminals have been arrested on 9 February as a result of an international investigation into a series of sim swapping attacks targeting high-profile victims in the United States. These arrests follow earlier ones in Malta (1) and Belgium (1) of other members belonging to the same criminal network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The attacks orchestrated by this criminal gang targeted thousands of victims throughout 2020, including famous internet influencers, sport stars, musicians and their families. The criminals are believed to have stolen from them over USD 100 million in cryptocurrencies after illegally gaining access to their phones.</p>
<p>This international sweep follows a year-long investigation jointly conducted by law enforcement authorities from the United Kingdom, United States, Belgium, Malta and Canada, with international activity coordinated by Europol.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A NETWORK OF SIM HIJACKERS&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Initiated in the spring of 2020, the investigation uncovered how a network composed of a dozen criminals worked together to access the victims’ phone numbers and take control of their apps or accounts by changing the passwords.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This enabled them to steal money, cryptocurrencies and personal information, including contacts synced with online accounts. They also hijacked social media accounts to post content and send messages masquerading as the victim. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This type of fraud is known as ‘sim swapping’ and it was identified as a key trend on the rise in the latest <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/main-reports/internet-organised-crime-threat-assessment-iocta-2020">Europol Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment</a>. It involves cybercriminals taking over use of a victim’s phone number by essentially deactivating their SIM and porting the allocated number over to a SIM belonging to a member of the criminal network.</p>
<p>This is typically achieved by the criminals exploiting phone service providers to do the swap on their behalf, either via a corrupt insider or using social engineering techniques.</p>
<h2>EUROPOL’S INVOLVEMENT</h2>
<p>Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) supported the case from the onset by providing the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul><li>Organised operational meetings to coordinate the international activity;</li>
<li>Facilitated the information exchange between all partners and cross-checked data sent in by the partners against Europol’s databases;</li>
<li>Supporting the action day by setting up a Virtual Command Post to provide to the investigators in the field real time and secure exchange of information and analytical support.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><h2>DON’T BE THE NEXT VICTIM</h2>
<p>It’s not just celebrities who are under attack. Anyone and everyone with a mobile phone can fall victim to sim swapping. Here are a few tips to help you stay one step ahead from the criminals after your personal information: &nbsp;</p>
<ul><li>Keep your devices’ software up to date</li>
<li>Do not reply to suspicious emails or engage over the phone with callers that request your personal information&nbsp;</li>
<li>Limit the amount of personal data you share online&nbsp;</li>
<li>Try to use two-factor authentication for your online services, rather than having an authentication code sent over SMS</li>
<li>When possible, do not associate your phone number with sensitive online accounts</li>
</ul><p>

        <p><span><span></span></span> Allen Pike • February 8, 2021</p>

        

        <article>
            <p>Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/27/21402744/apple-idfa-facebook-fight-ads-advertising">announced last summer</a> that they will soon require users to opt in before apps can get the infamous “IDFA” tracking identifier for that user. While this was controversial in the ad tech sphere, most mobile apps can get by without this identifier.</p>

<p>However, most mobile app teams do collect analytics to help make product decisions. What features inspire free users to convert to paid users? Why do we think our trial is converting poorly? Do we still need to support iOS 12? A lot of apps use free SDKs to collect and analyze this kind of data.</p>

<p>The most popular analytics SDKs are free because they’re owned by companies that sell ads, or share data with those companies: Google Analytics, Flurry, and Google’s Firebase. Paid competitors like Mixpanel and Amplitude can be really powerful, but often cost thousands of dollars a year or more.</p>

<p>Now, I can’t find this said explicitly anywhere. But it <em>seems</em> like, along with the incoming restrictions on IDFA and ad attribution, Apple is also enacting a de-facto ban on these free analytics SDKs. The setup looks like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Since December, App Store Connect’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/#user-tracking">App Privacy submission process</a> has required developers to indicate if they have “3rd Party Tracking”. Developers are told to do this if they’re including an SDK from a company that hosts ads or shares data with advertisers across apps.</li>
  <li>In the coming weeks, iOS 14.5 will <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">require apps that engage in “3rd Party Tracking” to ask explicit permission</a>, which most users will opt out of.</li>
  <li>App Review will soon start rejecting apps that are not following the opt in provisions. They’ll likely do this by comparing the app’s App Privacy metadata to the use of the new opt-in APIs, as well as scanning apps for the presence of certain SDKs.</li>
  <li>Therefore, it seems, <strong>iOS apps currently using the Google Analytics, Flurry, and Firebase SDKs may need to migrate off of them promptly</strong> and instead use an analytics tool not owned by a company that displays ads. Popular choices include Mixpanel, Amplitude, or a self-managed analytics tool.</li>
</ol>

<p>These new rules could be a big hurdle for some developers, especially if they currently rely on other SDKs that do 3rd party tracking or attribution, such as Facebook’s.</p>

<h2 id="do-we-really-have-to">Do we really have to?</h2>

<p>The challenging thing for developers evaluating all this is that many of the points above have not been said so explicitly by Apple. Apple has instead outlined a series of rules, each rule being worded somewhat differently between the App Privacy documentation and the App Tracking Transparency documentation. A generous reading makes it seem like you maybe <em>could</em> comply with the rules and still use some of these SDKs. Maybe.</p>

<p>Apple did not – and from a legal perspective likely can’t – explicitly ban the Google Analytics, Flurry, Facebook, and Firebase SDKs. Their wording leaves some wiggle room. It seems like it <em>could</em> be possible to use them. It seems even more possible that Facebook and Google could make them usable. However, this puts developers in the situation of evaluating the changing documentation, complex privacy policies, and large settings panels that these tools offer, trying to judge whether a given setup of a given SDK would now pass muster from Apple’s perspective.</p>

<p>For example, in App Store Connect – where developers indicate if they have Third Party Tracking – Apple asks if your app is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sharing data with entities who display third-party ads.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems maybe impossible for a Google-owned analytics SDK to not trigger this provision. In contrast, the AppTrackingTransparency documentation asks whether you are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Placing a third-party SDK in your app that combines user data from your app with user data from other developers’ apps to target advertising or measure advertising efficiency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does it matter if the SDK combines user data <em>in general</em>, or is it sufficient if you’ve been assured that your app’s user data <em>in particular</em> won’t be combined by the SDK? The logical complexities and differences in wording raise questions that, unfortunately, developers need to make assumptions about until we hear something from Apple, or we hear through the grapevine how App Review actually enforces these rules. In particular we need to make three guesses:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Will you be allowed to indicate your app has 3rd Party Tracking, not implement the opt-in dialog, but still get App Review to approve you as long as you believe you’re not required to do opt-in based on your evaluation of the SDK, its settings, and the exact wording in the AppTrackingTransparency documentation? <strong>Our guess is no. It seems likely that Apple will expect that all 3rd Party Tracking requires the opt-in dialog.</strong></li>
  <li>Will you be allowed to include an SDK that App Review considers a “3rd Party Tracking SDK”, but not indicate 3rd Party Tracking in your App Privacy data as long as you believe you’re not required to based on your evaluation of the SDK, its settings, and the exact wording of the App Privacy documentation? <strong>Our guess is no. It seems like Apple will probably consider any use of the Facebook and Google SDKs to be 3rd Party Tracking.</strong></li>
  <li>Is it safe to continue using – or migrate to – 3rd party product analytics tools like MixPanel and Amplitude that are not owned by advertising companies? <strong>Our guess is yes. These rules seem squarely aimed at companies involved in advertising.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>If one of the above assumptions is wrong – for example, maybe these SDKs <em>can</em> be configured to behave sufficiently privately, and App Review can be convinced that this has been done for your app – then that would be really  useful to know. If anybody has more information on what Apple will or won’t be allowing, or even conflicting hunches, <a href="https://twitter.com/apike">let me know</a>.</p>

<h2 id="does-our-sdk-require-app-tracking-transparency-uh-well">Does our SDK require App Tracking Transparency? Uh… well…</h2>

<p><a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/app-store-data-collection#firebase_user_agent">Firebase</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10285841">Google Analytics</a>, and <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2021/01/19/facebook-login-updates-new-limited-data-mode/">Facebook</a> have been releasing updates and documentation to help developers navigate Apple’s questions, but conspiciously they don’t directly answer them. Instead they answer different, related questions that are maybe helpful but are certainly not decisive.</p>

<p>Contrast that to paid analytics tools that don’t share data with ad companies. MixPanel, for example, <a href="https://community.mixpanel.com/announcements-6/idfa-changes-on-ios-14-4442">posted clearly 6 months ago</a> that they believe they’re compliant with Apple’s rules:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You need to specify what data is used to track someone across external apps and websites, which in our case is none. We only allow customers to track data they own; data sent to Mixpanel is not used by any other external companies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, Flurry – whose business model apparently <em>is</em> to share data with advertisers – <a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/flurry/docs/analytics/gettingstarted/ios14/att/">has also claimed its SDK doesn’t trigger the App Tracking Transparency rules</a>. This seems dubious, but is interesting if so.</p>

<p>However, if the above rules and assumptions are correct, any apps that don’t both purge these SDKs and set their App Privacy to say they no longer have 3rd Party Tracking – or only use the SDKs for the small percentage of users who opt in – will soon face rejection. Meanwhile, even besides these restrictions, there are some substantial benefits to using premium analytics services like Mixpanel.</p>

<p>Our advice for now, then, is that <strong>all iOS apps should be prepared to migrate off of the Google Analytics, Firebase, Facebook, and Flurry SDKs, potentially on very short notice</strong>. If you were already on the fence, now is probably a good time to make the move. A <em>lot</em> of apps might be making changes in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Hold on to your butts.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Updates, February 11:</em></p>

<p>A number of developers have gotten in touch to share their guesses about how App Review will handle this in the coming weeks – thanks folks! Some common themes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Many developers assume Apple will only be using App Review to enforce opt-in for the IDFA identifier, and will not start rejecting apps for using SDKs that go against their <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">new rules prohibiting things like combining data and using fingerprinting</a>, as long as developers assert their SDKs are following the rules. This is plausible. If Apple goes this route though, developers are left with the ongoing risk of a surprise rejection, when App Review later cracks down on a specific SDK that’s played loose with the rules.</li>
  <li>Flurry <a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/preparing-for-ios-14/">posted back in July 2020 that it intends to comply with Apple’s requirements</a> so as not to require opt-in. In particular, they’ve explicitly said “Flurry will respect Apple’s policy requirement to not combine data across apps and websites owned by other companies.” It’s not clear how Apple would verify this is true, and this is surprising given Flurry’s business model, but it seems like a clear statement that Flurry intends to comply.</li>
  <li>A couple folks has asked if embedding code from YouTube – which certainly does ad targeting with its data – would violate Apple’s privacy rules. By the letter of the policy, this seems possible.</li>
</ol>

        <p><span>M</span>any marine biologists identify a gateway drug into their obsession, and for Heather Koldewey, it was the seahorse. Who can blame her? Seahorses seem to have evolved not entirely in the ocean, but also by way of a whimsical storybook, in which animal body parts are all mixed up. A fish with the head of a horse? A male that gets pregnant, gives birth, and is monogamous?</p>

<p>Seahorses led her not only to her career as the head of marine and freshwater conservation at the London Zoological Society, but to her efforts as an activist as well. Shortly after getting her Ph.D., Koldewey co-founded <a href="https://www.projectseahorse.org/" target="_blank">Project Seahorse</a> to protect her study subject and the ocean habitats they live in.</p>
<p>Today, Koldewey amplifies both her science and her on-the-ground protection efforts in visionary and critical ways. She was instrumental in getting the Indian Oceanâ€™s Chagos Archipelago designated as a Marine Protected Area, which has helped degraded ecosystems revive and led to cross-disciplinary scientific breakthroughs. She helped forge the pioneering partnership <a href="https://net-works.com/" target="_blank">Net-works</a>, which supports local communities in the Philippines by helping them transform abandoned fishing nets into carpeting. Koldewey is helping make biodiversity protection a profitable business—and saving species as she goes.</p>

<p><strong>How did seahorses get you into conservation?</strong></p>
<p>I did my Ph.D. research in genetics. The whole field of molecular genetics was just starting to reveal you could identify different populations of species and where they came from by genetic markers. Amanda Vincent and I realized we could use genetics to combat the global market in seahorse trade. [More than 37 million seahorses a year are marketed for traditional medicinal use, aquariums, and souvenirs, and as a result they are threatened with extinction.] We could trace where the seahorses came from and target protection efforts to those areas. Amanda and I started Project Seahorse together, using this charismatic species to tackle big ocean issues. Sheâ€™s become the director as Iâ€™ve concentrated on other things. I stay involved and care deeply about that work.</p>
<p><strong>What did molecular genetics tell you about seahorses?</strong></p>
<p>Seahorses are rubbish at swimming, and they have home ranges. They are very immobile. You would expect that they would be highly structured, meaning that in a particular place you would find a particular species. It turns out thatâ€™s not usually the case. Even when seahorses are morphologically distinct (and donâ€™t look alike), they turn out to be closely related. Yet they are found in so many places around the globe. How can that be? They hitch a ride on whateverâ€™s passing by and move vast distances.</p>
<blockquote>When biologists and physicists&nbsp;get to put their heads together, we learn new things.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Seahorses are equally ubiquitous and threatened.</strong></p>
<p>I have a quest for solutions in the science. How do you solve problems seahorses are facing? One approach is captive breeding programs in zoos to address the aquarium trade, and there has been major progress. But of course seahorses and all the species with which they coexist have to be protected where they live. Over-harvesting of fish and incredibly destructive bottom-trawling are decimating the oceans. Industrial fishing is a huge problem. Another is the relentless pressure on coastal communities that depend on fishing for survival.</p>
<p><strong>You were instrumental in helping secure the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean as one of the largest Marine Protected Areas (MPA) in the world. How can limiting human impacts on such a remote place benefit ocean health?</strong></p>
<p>Getting protection in the Indian Ocean is hard won and challenging. Some areas are so over-harvested they are ocean deserts. In 2009, a group of organizations, including mine, compiled the scientific evidence to help support protection around this archipelago, which is part of the British Indian Ocean Territory. In 2010, the Bertarelli Foundation, which has helped protect more than 2 million kilometers of marine areas over the past 20 years, helped the British government to establish what was then the worldâ€™s largest no-take MPA.</p>
<p>The Chagos Archipelago is made up of 58 tiny islands and contains the largest coral atoll on Earth. Here marine life is abundant and diverse, representing a glimpse of what our oceans should look like. Although still affected, protected areas show resilience to climate change. We have research dating back 50 years that gives us valuable insights from this unique location.</p>
<p><strong>This work is about protection, but it has also yielded new insights into how the ocean functions. How?</strong></p>
<p>Weâ€™ve known for a relatively long time that MPAs benefit reef-dwelling species, but havenâ€™t had as much information about how they influence the world of the ocean around them—migratory species, for example, and pelagic (open ocean) species. We have more than 70 scientists from disciplines including physics, genetics, and biology all working in this one place, which has yielded fantastic new insights. For example, a manta scientist watching mantas feeding noticed that they suddenly seemed to disappear. He couldnâ€™t figure it out. What made them suddenly move? The physicist who was monitoring the underwater currents at the time was able to say, â€œoh, itâ€™s the internal waves switching; takes their food right away.â€�</p>
<p>The amazing thing is that biologists and physicists donâ€™t often get to put their heads together, but when they do, we learn new things.</p>
<blockquote>Ocean health is key to supporting human life.</blockquote>
<p><strong>What about the islands themselves, the terrestrial ecosystems?</strong></p>
<p>Weâ€™ve also learned quite a lot in the Chagos Archipelago about how the terrestrial health of the islands impacts the water. Some islands are invaded with rats, which decimate native species and decrease overall biomass. Rats eat eggs and chicks. The islands that donâ€™t have rats support more seabirds. There is a more robust nutrient flow between the water and the land, thanks to the seabirds, increasing the fish biomass off these healthy islands. These islands also seem to be more resilient to coral bleaching events.</p>
<p><strong>Everything is connected. Including people and wildlife.</strong></p>
<p>That idea is at the foundation of Net-Works. As you know, plastic pollution in the oceans is a huge and growing crisis. In addition to plastic bottles everywhere, discarded fishing nets are a terrible issue. In local communities that depend on fishing for survival, the more depleted the fish in their waters, the more nets they use—and eventually abandon when they are beyond repair. Net-Works has set up a supply-chain in the Philippines in which local people are paid to collect discarded nets, bale them, and ship them out to be recycled into nylon threads that are subsequently woven into carpeting. Weâ€™ve collected enough nets thus far to wrap more than five times around the circumference of the globe. This project is not only helping to clean up the ocean, it is providing a revenue alternative to people who are unfairly exploited in the global fishing industry.</p>
<p>Net-Works has been so successful a project within the Zoological Society of London (where Heather works) that it has spun out into an independent social enterprise called <a href="https://coast4c.com/" target="_blank">Coast 4C</a>. 4C stands for â€œcommunity, commerce, conservation, climate,â€� because they are all interconnected. This model has diversified from nets to include seaweed farming in the Philippines. Carrageenan extracted from seaweed is used in products all over the world, but like so many other supply chains, this one has been unfair to local communities. Coast 4C is putting together a model in which the people who live on the water and farm the seaweed will benefit from the supply chain and increase marine protection.</p>
<p><strong>Sorry for this inevitable pun, but there seems to be a sea-change in conservation underway.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Conservation has largely depended on foundation money, grants, and funds from the government. But these are not always sustainable over time. How can we finance conservation for the long term? We are starting to see more and more initiatives that facilitate social and impact investment into conservation. We are seeing new players in the world of conservation—corporate finance people, insurance executives. Itâ€™s not just biologists and shouldnâ€™t be—everyone can be a conservationist.</p>
<p><strong>In 2018 the United Nations reported 4.6 million fishing vessels in operation, harvesting two-thirds of fishing stocks to capacity and one-third at biologically unsustainable levels. Are you worried about ocean degradation?</strong></p>
<p>To say nothing of climate change, pollution, and acidification. Ocean health is key to supporting human life. For one thing, the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide and produces the air we breathe. More than 3 billion people rely directly on marine and coastal biodiversity to live.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You look at the statistics, where we are headed, and itâ€™s scary, daunting. I focus on what I can do and form collaborations with very good people. Lots of people have part of the answer but not the whole thing. Together, we can build that jigsaw puzzle and make a difference.</p>

            <p>People often use short timezone abbreviations like EST and PST to refer to timezones. If you're doing this in a computer program, you are almost certainly making a huge mistake. Let's take take a look, using the disastrously bad <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/TZ-Variable.html">unix libc timezone tools</a>, which you're almost certainly using under the hood if you're writing software on Linux or OSX.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=UTC date
Wed 10 Feb 2021 12:00:00 AM UTC
</code></pre></div>
<p>Alright, this looks good. Let's try to see what time it is in New York:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=America/New_York date
Tue 09 Feb 2021 07:00:00 PM EST
</code></pre></div>
<p>Makes sense, New York is 5 hours behind UTC. It outputs the time as <code>EST</code>, so presumably we can use that as a <code>TZ</code> variable:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=EST date
Tue 09 Feb 2021 07:00:00 PM EST
</code></pre></div>
<p>Which looks like it works! But that's actually an illusion — say we tried doing this in July, instead of February:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=America/New_York date
Fri 09 Jul 2021 08:00:00 PM EDT
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we're in EDT, since it's daylight saving time. Makes sense, let's just plug that into <code>TZ</code> and see what happens:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=EDT date
Sat 10 Jul 2021 12:00:00 AM EDT
</code></pre></div>
<p>And hang on, <code>America/New_York</code> means <code>EDT</code>, but <code>EDT</code> gives us the time in <code>UTC</code>! What's going on here?</p>

<p>Well, it turns out that <code>EDT</code> isn't a valid timezone, and <code>date</code> silently ignores the incorrect timezone variable:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=LOL_THIS_DOESNT_EXIST date
Sat 10 Jul 2021 12:00:00 AM LOL
</code></pre></div>
<p><code>date</code> "helpfully" ignores that the timezone is invalid, and outputs the date in UTC, but <em>using the text of the invalid timezone</em>.  Which is horrifying, but wait, why isn't EDT a valid timezone? I'm not sure what the actual reason is, but one reason that it's not correct in the general case to use the short timezone codes is that they aren't actually unique:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=America/Chicago date
Tue 09 Feb 2021 06:00:00 PM CST
$ TZ=Asia/Taipei date
Wed 10 Feb 2021 08:00:00 AM CST
</code></pre></div>
<p>There are actually two timezones that are canonically named "CST", and they're 14 hours apart! The format that <code>date</code> outputs things in causes there to be two distinct moments in time that correspond to any date outputted in the <code>Asia/Taipei</code> or <code>America/Chicago</code> timezones, and there's no way to tell which is which by looking at it — what fun!</p>

<p>There is no good reason to use short timezone codes like EST, CST, PST — doing so will only bring you pain. Either use the tzdb name like <code>America/New_York</code>, or use an offset from UTC, depending on what you want.</p>

<p>I promised I’ll post stuff about low level hardware issues, and here is my second post on the subject, the first part in a series about the Intel graphics stack.</p>

<p>This post series will be a summary of about a decade of unpublished research I am trying to organize and share.
Not all of it is current, as newer hardware is harder to inspect and reverse, but I think much of the research is relevant.</p>

<p>The first post below is a quick introduction to the different components on the hardware and software side we’ll need to dive into security issues in the next post.</p>


<ul>
  <li>Processor graphics - The graphics unit that is part of the processor itself. Has had many codenames over the years, HD Graphics, UHD Graphics, Iris, Gen9, Gen11, Intel Xe and so on. Even the ‘Gen’ name has double meaning - both generation and ‘Graphics ENgine’. In UEFI code it is sometimes referet to at the IGD - Integrated Graphics Device.</li>
  <li>
    <p>The GuC - an embedded i486 core that supports graphics sechduling, power managment and firmware attestation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>UEFI and OS Drivers</li>
</ul>


<p>As discussed in the introduction to the SecureBoot post, the Intel CPU has four major component groups - the CPU cores, the L3 (or LLC) cache slices, the ‘Uncore’ or ‘System Agent’ parts, all connected through a ring bus inside the die.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/gen9.png" alt="Gen9 Architecture"></p>

<p>The graphics process is made up from several <em>slices</em> and an <em>unslice</em> (like <em>uncore</em>) area that includes common components.
Each slice is divided into subblices and a slice common area. The subslices are made up of several Execution Units (EUs), and Texture unit and a L1 Cache/Memory. The common area includes the L3 cache and the dataport.
The limit to the number of slices is the interconnect between them and the unslice. 
There is always only a single <em>unslice</em>. In the unslice we can find the connection to the ring bus, aptly named the GT interface (GTI), the <em>Command Streamer</em> is reads commands from the system memory and into the graphics processor, the <em>fixed function pipline</em> (FF pipeline), and the thread dispatcher \&amp; spawner that lunch shader programs and GPGPU (General Purpose Comuting) programs onto the EUs. The FF pipeline deals with fixed functions such as vertice operations (called the Geometry Pipe), and other dedicated hardware such as video transcoding.</p>

<p>Different SKUs have different combinations of these. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Skylake GT2: 1 slice of 3 subslices of 8 EUs (1x3x8)</li>
  <li>Skylake GT3: 2x3x8</li>
  <li>Skylake GT4: 3x3x8</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/gen9slice.png" alt="Gen9 Architecture"></p>

<p>The graphics engine is also connect streight to the the IOSF (Intel On Chip Fabric internal bus, see the <a href="https://igor-blue.github.io/2021/02/04/secure-boot.html">secureboot post</a> bus, through a controller called Gunit.  Gunit is connect to both the primary and secondary IOSF and exports functions for communicating with the graphics engine and implementing IOMMU support for graphics memory and unified memory.</p>

<p>All of this is connected to the the display IO interconnect and output to DisplayPort and HDMI outputs.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/gunit.png" alt="Gen9 Architecture"></p>

<h2 id="2d-graphics-pipeline">2D Graphics Pipeline</h2>
<p>The 2D graphics gengine is a standonle IP block in the <em>unslice</em> area, and has its own command streamer, registers and cache. It has 256 different operation codes, for example:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/2dops.png" alt="2D BitBlt Operations"></p>

<h2 id="3d-graphics-pipeline">3D Graphics Pipeline</h2>
<p>The fixed function pipeline in the <em>unslice</em> implements the DirectX 11 redndering pipeline stages: 
Vertex Fetch -&gt; Vertex Shader -&gt; Hull Shader -&gt; Tessellator -&gt; Domain Shader -&gt; Geometry Shader -&gt; Clipper -&gt; Windower -&gt; Z Ordering, -&gt; Pixel Shader - &gt;Pixel Output. Some of these functions are self contained, but many are implemented using by running shader programs on the EUs in the slices. EUs can send certain operations back into dedicated hardware units.</p>

<h2 id="the-execution-units-eus">The Execution Units (EUs)</h2>
<p>The EUs are in-order mulithreaded SIMD processing core. Each execution thread is dispatched has its own 128 register space and executed programs called “kernels”. All instructions are 8 channels wide, e.g. operate on 8 registers at a time (or 16 half registers). Its supports arithmetic, logical and control flow instructions on floats and ints. Registers are addressed by address.
The EU thread dispatcher implements priorities based on age, i.e. oldest is hight priority, and whether the trhead is blocked waiting on instruction fetches, register dependencies etc’. C</p>


<p>The GuC is a small embedded core that supports graphics sechduling, power managment and firmware attestation.
It is implemented in an i486DX4 CPU (also called P24C and Minute IA), altough it seems that since broadwell it has been extended to the Pentium (i586) ISA. It runs a small microkernel call μOS. 
The GuC μOS runs only kernel level tasks (even though μOS supports μApps). The firmware is written in C with not stdlib.
In the GuC we can find supporting blocks: ROM memory, 8KB L1 on core cache, 64KB/128KB/256KB (Broadwell/Skylake/CannonLake) of SRAM  memory which is used for code+data+cache and a 8KB stack. It also has power managment, DMA engine, etc’. 
Communication to the GuC is done through memory-mapped IO and bidirectional interrupts.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/guc.png" alt="GuC architecture"></p>

<p>The GuC offers a light-weight mechanism for dispatch work the host submits to the GPU. This means the GPU driver does not need to handle dispatch and job queuing, making it much faster. The <em>user mode driver (UMD)</em> can communicate with the GuC directly when required and bypass the need to context switch the main CPU into kernel mode. The <em>kernel mode driver (KMD)</em> uses the GuC as a gateway for job submission as well. This simplifies the Kernel and provides a single point where all jobs are submitted.
Communication between the UMD and the GuC is done through shared memory queues.</p>

<p><em>Why is the GuC interesting? Because I think it can communicate with the CSME, CPU and GPU and everything over the IOSF, and if it has bugs it can be used to gain very privileged access to the system and memory</em>.</p>

<h2 id="boot-rom-and-guc-firmware">Boot ROM and GuC firmware</h2>
<p>At system startup GuC is held at reset state until the UEFI firmware initializes the shared memory regtion for the GPU. Inside the shared region a special subregion call WOPCM is set aside fur GuC (and HuC) firmware. It then releases the GuC from reset and it in turn starts executing a small non-modifiable Boot ROM (16/32KB in size) that initializes the basic GuC hardware, and waits for an interupt signalling the firmware has been copied to the WOPCM region.
The GuC firmware is an opaque blob supplied by Intel as part of the GPU KMD, which copies it to the shared memory region (GGTT) and signals the Boot ROM with an interrupt. The bootrom verifies the firmware with a digital signature using a SHA256 hash + PKCSv2.1 RSA signature, and if the test passes copies it to SRAM and starts executing.</p>

<p>The GUC firmware can be extracted from the graphics driver and reversed. Screenshot of IDA open on the kabylake GuC:
<img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/gucfirmware.png" alt="GUC firmware"></p>

<p>The GuC also attest the firmware for the video decoder unit, called <em>HuC</em>. The HuC is an HEVC/H.265 decoded implement in hardware.</p>

<h2 id="the-μos-kernel">The μOS kernel</h2>
<p>The μOS kernel runs in 32-bit protected mode, with no paging and old-style segments model (CS, DS, etc’). All code run in ring0. The OS handles HW/SW exceptions and crashes, and supplies debugging and logging services.</p>

<p>Interrupts are handled through the local APIC - I found interrupts coming from the IOMMU, power managment, display interfaces, the GPU and the CPU.</p>

<p>It runs a single process - which initializes the system and then waits for interrupts/events in a loop.</p>

<h2 id="communication-with-the-os">Communication with the OS</h2>
<p>Commands are dispatched through a ring buffer work queue. Each work item has a header followed by a command. Once a command is posted the CPU notifies the GuC using a “doorbell” interrupt.</p>

<p>The Windows kernel mode driver supports GuC debugging by setting a registry key:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>\\REGISTRY\MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Intel\KMD\GuC\\
	GuCEnableUkLogging=1
    
\\REGISTRY\MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Intel\KMD\GuC\\
    GuCLoggingVerbositySelect=0/1/2/3 (low, medium, high, max)
</code></pre></div></div>


<p>So far we only discussed hardware. The software part of the graphics stack is divided into three levels: UEFI DXE, kernel mode and user mode.</p>

<h2 id="uefi">UEFI</h2>
<p>Traditionally VGA support was implemented with a legacy Video VBIOS as an PCI option ROM. In UEFI VBIOS was modified into a DXE driver call the <em>Graphics Output Protocol</em> (<em>GOP</em>), which support basic display for the UEFI setup menu and for the OS bootloader. The GOP is supplied by Intel to the UEFI vendor. 
The GOP supplies two basic functions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Changing the graphics mode - resultion, pixel depth, etc’</li>
  <li>Getting the physical address of the framebuffer</li>
</ul>

<p>The Windows boot-loader uses the GOP to setup a memory mapped video framebuffer before entering VBS, and after the hypervisor and SK are loaded the access by winload is only through the framebuffer without invoking the GOP. Windows also uses the GOP for disablig blue screens.</p>

<h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>

<p>On Windows, Intel supplies a fairly large graphics driver that implements both the user mode driver (UMD) and kernel mode driver (UMD). Applications using Direct3D communicate through the D3D runtime to the DXGI abstraction interface (in dxgkrnl.sys), which in turn communicated with the KMD. The KMD treats 2D Blt and 3D operations through different pipelines and dispatches the operations to the GPU.</p>

<p>The GPU driver is riddled with telemetry, but I haven’t figured out yet how much of it is sent automatically to Intel, altough crashes are sent through OCA - Online Crash Analysis.</p>

<h2 id="basic-memory-managment">Basic Memory Managment</h2>
<p>A very important job of the graphics drivers (both KMD and UMD) is memory managment (GMM). The Graphics Memory space is the virtual memory allocated to the GPU, and is translated using the system pages tables to the physical RAM. The memory contains stuff lime geometry data, textures, etc’. The GPU hardware used Graphics Page Tables (GTTs) to decode virtual addresses supplied by the software graphics memory space into …</p></section></div>

    <h2>Fractal Image Compression</h2>
    <p>14 May 2018 by <a href="https://pvigier.github.io/">pierre</a></p>
    <p>One year ago, I coded a very simple implementation of fractal image compression for a course and I made the code available on github <a href="https://github.com/pvigier/fractal-image-compression">there</a>.</p>

<p>To my surprise, the repo is quite popular. So I decided to update the code and to write an article to explain the theory and the code.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>This part is quite technical, you can skip it if you are only interested by a documentation of the code.</p>

<h2 id="contractions">Contractions</h2>

<p>Let \((E, d)\) be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_metric_space">complete metric space</a> and \(f : E \rightarrow E\) a mapping from \(E\) to \(E\).</p>

<p>We will say that \(f\) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_mapping">contraction</a> if there exists \(0 &lt; s &lt; 1\) such that:</p><p>

\[\forall x, y \in E, d(f(x), f(y)) \leq sd(x, y)\]

</p><p>From here, \(f\) will denote a contraction with contractivity factor \(s\).</p>

<p>There are two important theorems on contractions: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_fixed-point_theorem">Contraction Mapping Theorem</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collage_theorem">Collage Theorem</a>.</p>

<p><em>Theorem (Contraction Mapping Theorem)</em>: \(f\) has an unique fixed point \(x_0\).</p>

<p><a href="#proof1" data-toggle="collapse">Show the proof</a></p>
<div id="proof1">
<p>First, let us proof that the sequence \((u_n)\) defined by \(\left\{\begin{alignat*}{2}u_0 &amp; = x\\ u_{n+1} &amp; = f(u_n)\end{alignat*}\right.\) is convergent for all \(x \in E\).</p>

<p>For all \(m &lt; n \in \mathbb{N}\): </p><p>

$$
\begin{alignat*}{2}
d(u_m, u_n) &amp; = d(f^m(x), f^n(x)) \\
            &amp; \leq s^md(x, f^{n-m}(x)) \text{ because } f \text{ is a contraction} \\
            &amp; \leq s^m\left(\sum_{i=0}^{n-m-1}{d(f^i(x), f^{i+1}(x))}\right) \text{ by the triangular inequality}  \\
            &amp; \leq s^m\left(\sum_{i=0}^{n-m-1}{s^id(x, f(x))}\right) \text{ because } f \text{ is a contraction}  \\
            &amp; = s^m\left(\frac{1 - s^{n-m}}{1 - s}d(x, f(x))\right) \\
            &amp; \leq \frac{s^m}{1 - s}d(x, f(x)) \underset{m \rightarrow \infty}{\rightarrow} 0
\end{alignat*}
$$

</p><p>So \((u_n)\) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_sequence">Cauchy sequence</a> and as \(E\) is complete, \((u_n)\) is convergent. Let \(x_0\) bet its limit.</p>

<p>Moreover, as a contraction is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipschitz_continuity">Lipschitz-continuous</a>, it is also continuous so \(f(u_n) \rightarrow f(x_0)\). Thus, if we let \(n\) tend to infinity in \(u_{n+1} = f(u_n)\), we have that \(x_0 = f(x_0)\). So \(x_0\) is a fixed point of \(f\).</p>

<p>We have shown that  \(f\) has a fixed point. Let us show by contradiction that it is unique. Let \(y_0\) be another fixed point, then:</p><p>

$$
d(x_0, y_0) = d(f(x_0), f(y_0)) \leq sd(x_0, y_0) &lt; d(x_0, y_0)
$$

</p><p>Contradiction.</p>

<hr>
</div>

<p>From here, \(x_0\) will denote the fixed point of \(f\).</p>

<p><em>Theorem (Collage Theorem)</em>: If \(d(x, f(x)) &lt; \epsilon\) then \(d(x, x_0) &lt; \frac{\epsilon}{1 - s}\).</p>

<p><a href="#proof2" data-toggle="collapse">Show the proof</a></p>

<p>We showed in the previous proof that \(d(u_m, u_n) \leq \frac{s^m}{1 - s}d(x, f(x)) = \frac{s^m}{1 - s}\epsilon\).</p>

<p>If we fix \(m\) to \(0\) then we have that \(d(x, u_n) \leq \frac{\epsilon}{1 - s}\).</p>

<p>Finally we let \(n\) tend to infinity to obtain the desired result.</p>

<hr>
</div>

<p>The second theorem tells us that if we find a contraction \(f\) such that \(f(x)\) is near to \(x\) then we are sure that the fixed point of \(f\) is also near to \(x\).</p>

<p>This result will be fundamental in the following. Indeed instead of saving an image, we will only save a contraction whose fixed point is near to the image.</p>

<h2 id="contractions-for-images">Contractions for images</h2>

<p>In this part, we will show how to build a contraction such that its fixed point is near to a given image.</p>

<p>Firstly, let us define the image set and a distance. We choose \(E = [0, 1]^{h \times w}\). \(E\) is the set of matrices with \(h\) rows, \(w\) columns and with coefficients in \([0, 1]\). Then we take \(d(x, y) = \left(\sum_{i=1}^{h}{\sum_{j=1}^{w}{(x_{ij}-y_{ij})^2}}\right)^{0.5}\). \(d\) is the distance obtained from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_norm#Frobenius_norm">Frobenius norm</a>.</p>

<p>Now, let \(x \in E\) the image we want to compress.</p>

<p>We will segment twice the image in blocks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Firstly, we partition the image in <em>destination</em> or <em>range</em> blocks \(R_1, ..., R_L\). These blocks are disjoint and they cover the whole image.</li>
  <li>Then, we segment the image in <em>source</em> or <em>domain</em> blocks \(D_1, ..., D_K\). These blocks are not necessarily disjoint and neither they necessarily cover the image.</li>
</ul>

<p>For instance, we can segment the image like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://pvigier.github.io/media/img/fractal/segmentation.png" alt="Example of segmentation"></p>

<p>Then, for each range block \(R_l\), we will choose a domain block \(D_{k_l}\) and a mapping \(f_l : [0, 1]^{D_{k_l}} \rightarrow [0, 1]^{R_{l}}\).</p>

<p>Finally, we can define our function \(f\) as:</p><p>

\[f(x)_{ij} = f_l(x_{D_{k_l}})_{ij} \text{ if } (i, j) \in R_l\]

</p><p><em>Claim</em>: If all \(f_l\) are contractions then \(f\) is a contraction.</p>

<p><a href="#proof3" data-toggle="collapse">Show the proof</a></p>
<div id="proof3">
<p>Let \(x, y \in E\) and suppose that all \(f_l\) are contractions with contractivity factor \(s_l\). Then we have that:</p><p>

$$
\begin{alignat*}{2}
d(f(x), f(y))^2 &amp; = \sum_{i=1}^{h}{\sum_{j=1}^{w}{(f(x)_{ij}-f(y)_{ij})^2}} \text{ by definition of } d \\
&amp; = \sum_{l=1}^L{\sum_{(i,j) \in R_l}{(f(x)_{ij}-f(y)_{ij})^2}} \text{ because } (R_l) \text{ is a partition} \\
&amp; = \sum_{l=1}^L{\sum_{(i,j) \in R_l}{(f_l(x_{D_{k_l}})_{ij}-f_l(y_{D_{k_l}})_{ij})^2}} \text{ by definition of } f \\
&amp; = \sum_{l=1}^L{d(f_l(x_{D_{k_l}}), f_l(y_{D_{k_l}}))^2} \text{ by definition of } d \\
&amp; \leq \sum_{l=1}^L{s_l^2d(x_{D_{k_l}}, y_{D_{k_l}})^2} \text{ because the } (f_l) \text{ are contractions} \\
&amp; \leq \underset{l}{\max}{s_l^2}\sum_{l=1}^L{d(x_{D_{k_l}}, y_{D_{k_l}})^2} \\
&amp; = \underset{l}{\max}{s_l^2}\sum_{l=1}^L{\sum_{(i,j) \in R_l}{(x_{ij}-y_{ij})^2}} \text{ by definition of } d \\
&amp; = \underset{l}{\max}{s_l^2}\sum_{i=1}^{h}{\sum_{j=1}^{w}{(x_{ij}-y_{ij})^2}} \text{ because } (R_l) \text{ is a partition} \\
&amp; = \underset{l}{\max}{s_l^2}d(x, y)^2 \text{ by definition of } d \\
\end{alignat*}
$$

</p><hr>
</div>

<p>It remains one question to answer to: How to choose \(D_{k_l}\) and \(f_l\)?</p>

<p>The Collage Theorem suggests us a way to choose them: if \(x_{R_l}\) is near to \(f(x_{D_{k_l}})\) for all \(l\) then \(x\) is near to \(f(x)\) and according to the Collage Theorem \(x\) and \(x_0\) will be near too.</p>

<p>Thus, we will, independently for each \(l\), construct lots of contractions from each \(D_{k}\) to \(R_l\) and select the best one. We will show all the nitty-gritty details in the next section.</p>



<p>In each section, I will copy the interesting snippets of code but you can find the whole script <a href="https://github.com/pvigier/fractal-image-compression/blob/master/compression.py">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="segmentations">Segmentations</h2>

<p>I keep things really simple. The source blocks and the destination blocks segment the image as a grid, as on the image above.</p>

<p>The size of the blocks are powers of two as it makes things easier. The source blocks are 8 by 8 while the destination blocks are 4 by 4.</p>

<p>There exist more advanced schemes for segmentation. For instance, we can use a quadtree to segment more the areas with lots of details.</p>

<h2 id="transformations">Transformations</h2>

<p>In this section, we will show how to construct the contractions from \(D_{k}\) to \(R_l\).</p>

<p>Remember that we want to generate a mapping \(f_l\) such that \(f(x_{D_k})\) is near to \(x_{R_l}\). So, the more mappings we generate, the more likely we are to find a good one.</p>

<p>However, the quality of the compression depends on the number of bits necessary to save \(f_l\). So if we have a set of functions that is too large, the compression will be bad. There is a tradeoff to find.</p>

<p>I chose that \(f_l\) will have the following form:
\(f_l(x_{D_k}) = s \times rotate_{\theta}(flip_d(reduce(x_{D_k}))) + b\)</p>

<p>where \(reduce\) is a function to go from 8 by 8 blocks to 4 by 4 blocks, \(flip\) and \(rotate\) are affine transformations, \(s\) changes the contrast and \(b\) the brightness.</p>

<p>The function <code>reduce</code> reduces the size of an image by averaging neighborhoods:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>reduce</span><span>(</span><span>img</span><span>,</span> <span>factor</span><span>):</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>zeros</span><span>((</span><span>img</span><span>.</span><span>shape</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>//</span> <span>factor</span><span>,</span> <span>img</span><span>.</span><span>shape</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>//</span> <span>factor</span><span>))</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>result</span><span>.</span><span>shape</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]):</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>j</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>result</span><span>.</span><span>shape</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]):</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>result</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The function <code>rotate</code> simply rotates by the given angle the image:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>img</span><span>,</span> <span>angle</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>ndimage</span><span>.</span><span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>img</span><span>,</span> <span>angle</span><span>,</span> <span>reshape</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In order to preserve the shape of the image, the angle \(\theta\) will be in \(\{0^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}, 180^{\circ}, 270^{\circ}\}\).</p>

<p>The function <code>flip</code> flips the image if <code>direction</code> is equal to -1 and does not if it is equal to 1:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>flip</span><span>(</span><span>img</span><span>,</span> <span>direction</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>img</span><span>[::</span><span>direction</span><span>,:]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The whole transformation is done by the function <code>apply_transformation</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>apply_transformation</span><span>(</span><span>img</span><span>,</span> <span>direction</span><span>,</span> <span>angle</span><span>,</span> <span>contrast</span><span>=</span><span>1.0</span><span>,</span> <span>brightness</span><span>=</span><span>0.0</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>contrast</span><span>*</span><span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>flip</span><span>(</span><span>img</span><span>,</span> <span>direction</span><span>),</span> <span>angle</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>brightness</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We need 1 bit to remember if we flip or not and 2 bits for the angle of rotation. Moreover, if we save \(s\) and \(b\) using 8 bits each then we need only 19 bits in total to save the transformation.</p>

<p>Moreover, we should check that these functions are contractions. The proof is a bit tedious and we do not care much. Maybe I will add it in appendix later.</p>

<h2 id="compression">Compression</h2>

<p>The algorithm for compression is simple. First we generate all possible affine transformations of all source blocks using the function <code>generate_all_transformed_blocks</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>generate_all_transformed_blocks</span><span>(</span><span>img</span><span>,</span> <span>source_size</span><span>,</span> <span>destination_size</span><span>,</span> <span>step</span><span>):</span>
    <span>factor</span> <span>=</span> <span>source_size</span> <span>//</span> <span>destination_size</span>
    <span>transformed_blocks</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>k</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>((</span><span>img</span><span>.</span><span>shape</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>-</span> <span>source_size</span><span>)</span> <span>//</span> <span>step</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>):</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>l</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>((</span><span>img</span><span>.</span><span>shape</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>-</span> <span>source_size</span><span>)</span> <span>//</span> <span>step</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>):</span>
            <span># Extract the source block and reduce it to the shape of a destination block
</span>            <span>S</span> <span>=</span> <span>reduce</span><span>(</span><span>img</span><span>[</span><span>k</span><span>*</span><span>step</span><span>:</span><span>k</span><span>*</span><span>step</span><span>+</span><span>source_size</span><span>,</span><span>l</span><span>*</span><span>step</span><span>:</span><span>l</span><span>*</span><span>step</span><span>+</span><span>source_size</span><span>],</span> <span>factor</span><span>)</span>
            <span># Generate all possible transformed blocks
</span>            <span>for</span> <span>direction</span><span>,</span> <span>angle</span> <span>in</span> <span>candidates</span><span>:</span>
                <span>transformed_blocks</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>((</span><span>k</span><span>,</span> <span>l</span><span>,</span> <span>direction</span><span>,</span> <span>angle</span><span>,</span> <span>apply_transform</span><span>(</span><span>S</span><span>,</span> <span>direction</span><span>,</span> <span>angle</span><span>)))</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>transformed_blocks</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then for each destination block, we try all the previously generated transformed source blocks. For each we optimize the contrast and the brightness using the method <code>find_contrast_and_brightness2</code> and if the tested transformation is the best we have seen so far, we saved it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>compress</span><span>(</span><span>img</span><span>,</span> <span>source_size</span><span>,</span> <span>destination_size</span><span>,</span> <span>step</span><span>):</span>

<p>Today I created a command-line tool for sending bulk SMS using Twilio.</p>

<p>The utility lets you define a mustache template and provide a CSV file with matching columns for bulk SMS sends.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>The utility requires <code>python3.7</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code>python -m pip install twilio_sendsms
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>The first time you run, you will be prompted to provide your Twilio account details.</p>

<p>All configuration settings get stored in <code>~/.twilio-sendsms.config</code>. To reconfigure you can delete this file.</p>

<h2 id="running">Running</h2>

<p>First, you need to define a mustache template and save to a file, e.g. example.mustache:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Hi {{first_name}}, this is a test SMS.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, you need to create a bulk send CSV file. The file must have a <code>mobile_number</code> column. The mobile number must be in the international format, e.g. +614XXXXXXXX. The other column names need to match the variable names used in the mustache template.</p>

<p>buld_send.csv</p>
<div><div><pre><code>"mobile_number","first_name"
"+614XXXXXXXX","Joe"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To process the batch file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sendsms --template example.mustache test.csv
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

<p>Before processing a bulk CVS file, it’s a good idea to sample some entries and send them to yourself first. Testing is useful to confirm the formatting and the number of segments are as expected.</p>

<p>To sample and override the mobile_number in the CSV file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sendsms --template example.mustache --sample 1 --sendto +614XXXXXXXX test.csv
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The command outputs destination mobile number, the Twilio message identifier and the SMS message sent.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>+614XXXXXXXX,SM8c6335fdcffe4bb88313a16fabc9234d,Hi Joe, this is a test SMS.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(Hey, if you want to come work with me at Roundforest, and try out ESM on Node.js, feel free to
find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/giltayar/">LinkedIn</a> or on Twitter (@giltayar))</p>
<p>ES Modules are the future of modules in JavaScript. They already are the rule in the frontend,
but till now they couldn’t have been used in Node.js. Well, it seems that now they can.
Moreover, the Node.js community is fast at work at adding support for Node.js ESM. This includes
tools like Mocha, Ava, and even Jest (although in Jest the support is incremental). Moreover,
ESlint and TypeScript work nicely with ESM, albeit with a few gotchas.</p>
<p>This guide shows you how to use ESM in Node.js, detailing the basics, and also the gotchas
that you need to be careful with. You can find all the code in the
<a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide">companion code repository</a>. It’s a monorepo
where each package displays a certain facet of Node.js ESM support. This post goes through
each of the packages, explaining what was done there, and what are the gotchas.</p>
<p>This guide turned out to be pretty long, so I broke it into three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>The basics (this document)</li>
<li><a href="https://gils-blog.tayar.org/posts/using-jsm-esm-in-nodejs-a-practical-guide-part-2/">“exports” and its uses (including dual-mode libraries)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gils-blog.tayar.org/posts/using-jsm-esm-in-nodejs-a-practical-guide-part-3/">Tooling and Typescript</a></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: this guide covers <strong>Node.js ESM</strong> and does <em>not</em> cover Browser ESM.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-do-i-mean-by-esm-in-node.js%3F-don%E2%80%99t-we-have-that-already%3F">What do I mean by ESM in Node.js? Don’t we have that already? <a href="#what-do-i-mean-by-esm-in-node.js%3F-don%E2%80%99t-we-have-that-already%3F">#</a></h2>
<p>ESM is the standard JavaScript module system (ESM is a shorcut for
JavaScript Modules, and is also called ESM, or EcmaScript modules,
whereby “EcmaScript” is the official name for the JavaScript language).
ESM is the “newer” module system, and is supposed to be a replacement for the
regular Node.js module system, which is CommonJS (CJS for short), altought CommonJS will probaby
stil be with us for a very very long time. The module syntax is this:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>a<span>,</span> b</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>return</span> a <span>+</span> b<br><span>}</span><p><br><span>import</span> <span>{</span> add <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./add.js"</span></p></code></pre>
<p>(An intro to ESM is out of scope of this guide, but you can find it <em>everywhere</em> today on the
internet)</p>
<p>ESM was standardized in 2015, but it took awhile for browsers to support this,
and it took even longer for Node.js to support it
(the final stable version in Node.js was finalized only in 2020!).
If you want more information, you can see my
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK_3OP0uJ0Y">talk at Node.TLV</a>. In the talk, at the end,
I discuss whether ESM is ready for work, and I say that it’s not quite there yet,
and people should start migrating to it in a year or two. Well, that year is NOW, and it’s READY,
and this guide will prepare you for that.</p>
<p>Some of you may be nodding your head and asking themselves: aren’t we already using that? Well,
if you are, then you’re transpiling your code using Babel or TypeScript, which support ESM
out of the box and transpile it to CJS. The ESM this post is talking about is <em>native</em> ESM
that is supported by Node.js without transpiling. While syntactically it is the same, there
are small differences between it and Babel/TypeScript ESM, differences which are discussed
in my Node.TLV talk above. Most importantly, native ESM in Node.js does not need transpiling,
and so doesn’t come with the baggage of problems transpiling comes with.</p>
<h2 id="give-it-to-me-straight.-can-i-start-using-esm-in-node.js%3F">Give it to me straight. Can I start using ESM in Node.js? <a href="#give-it-to-me-straight.-can-i-start-using-esm-in-node.js%3F">#</a></h2>
<p>Yes. Mostly yes. All the tooling I use supports it, but there are two BIG gotchas that are probably
hard to swallow for some people, gotchas that are hard to workaround:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jest support for ESM in Node.js is <a href="https://jestjs.io/docs/en/ecmascript-modules">experimental</a></li>
<li>Jest experimental support does not support yet mocking modules
(regular function/object mocking is supported)</li>
<li><code>proxyquire</code> and other popular module mockers do not yet support ESM (although <code>testdouble</code>
fully support it)</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest problem is the lack of support for module mockers. There <em>is</em> one mocking
library that does support ESM (<code>testdouble</code>[<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/testdouble">https://www.npmjs.com/package/testdouble</a>]),
and we use that in this guide.</p>
<p>So can you live with this? If you can, then going all in with ESM in Node.js is now totally
possible. I’ve been using it for four months now, with zero problems. Actually, it feels
like VSCode support for ESM is much better than for CJS, so I suddenly get auto imports of modules,
and other goodies, which I didn’t get before in the CJS world.</p>

<p>This guide comes with a monorepo that has 7 directories, each directory being a package
that demonstrates the above sections of the Node.js support for ESM. You can find the monorepo
<a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-simplest-node.js-esm-project"><a id="section-01"></a>The simplest Node.js ESM project <a href="#the-simplest-node.js-esm-project">#</a></h2>
<p>Companion code: <a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/tree/main/01-simplest-mjs">https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/tree/main/01-simplest-mjs</a></p>
<p>This is the simplest package, and demonstrates the basics of the basics.
Let’s start by exploring <code>package.json</code>, and the new <code>exports</code> field.</p>
<h3 id="main-and-.mjs"><code>main</code> and <code>.mjs</code> <a href="#main-and-.mjs">#</a></h3>
<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/package.json">https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/package.json</a></p>
<pre><code><span>{</span><br>  <span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"01-simplest-mjs"</span><span>,</span><br>  <span>"version"</span><span>:</span> <span>"1.0.0"</span><span>,</span><br>  <span>"description"</span><span>:</span> <span>""</span><span>,</span><br>  <span>"main"</span><span>:</span> <span>"src/main.mjs"</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>The main entry point is <code>src/main.mjs</code>. Why does the file use the <code>.mjs</code> extension? Because in
Node.js ESM, the <code>.js</code> extension is reserved for CJS and <code>.mjs</code> means that this is a JS module
(in the next section, we’ll see how to change that). We’ll talk a bit more about that in the next
part.</p>
<p>Let’s continue exploring <code>main.mjs</code>.</p>
<h3 id="importing-using-extensions">Importing using extensions <a href="#importing-using-extensions">#</a></h3>
<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/main.mjs">https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/main.mjs</a></p>
<pre><code><br><span>import</span> <span>{</span>bannerInColor<span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./banner-in-color.mjs"</span><p><span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>banner</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>return</span> <span>bannerInColor</span><span>(</span><span>"white"</span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p></code></pre>
<p>Look at the import statement that imports <code>banner-in-color</code>:
Node.js ESM <em>forces</em> you to specify the full relative path to the file, <em>including the extension</em>.
The reason they did this is to be compatible with Browser ESM (when using ESM in browsers,
you always specify the full name of the file, including the extension). So
don’t forget that extension! (You can understand more about this in my
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK_3OP0uJ0Y">talk at Node.TLV</a>)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, VSCode doesn’t like the <code>.mjs</code> extension and so Ctrl/Cmd+Clicking it won’t work,
and its built in intellisense doesn’t work on it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Gotcha</strong>: VSCode doesn’t like the <code>.mjs</code> extension and ignores files with that extension. In
the next section we’ll see how to deal with that, so it’s not a <em>real</em> gotcha.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This <code>main.mjs</code> exports the <code>banner</code> function, which will be tested in <code>test/tryout.mjs</code>. But
first, let’s explore <code>banner-in-color.mjs</code>, which contains most of the implementation of
the <code>banner()</code> function.</p>
<h3 id="importing-esm-and-cjs-paclages">Importing ESM and CJS paclages <a href="#importing-esm-and-cjs-paclages">#</a></h3>
<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/banner-in-color.mjs">https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/banner-in-color.mjs</a></p>
<p>We’ve seen how we can import ESM modules. Let’s see how to import other packages:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>import</span> <span>{</span>join<span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"path"</span><br><span>import</span> chalk <span>from</span> <span>"chalk"</span><br><span>const</span> <span>{</span>underline<span>}</span> <span>=</span> chalk</code></pre>
<p>We can import Node.js internal packages like <code>path</code> easily, because Node.js
exposes them as ES modules.</p>
<p>And if we had a ESM package in NPM, the same could have been used to import the ESM package.
But most of the pacakges NPM has are still CJS packages. As you can see in the second line, where
we import <code>chalk</code>, CJS packages can also be imported using <code>import</code>. But for the most part,
when importing CJS modules, you can only use “default” importing, and not “named” imports. So
while you can import named imports in a CJS file:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>const</span> <span>{</span>underline<span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"chalk"</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
<p>You <em>cannot</em> do this in a ESM file:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>import</span> <span>{</span>underline<span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'chalk'</span></code></pre>
<p>You can only import the default (non-named) import, and use destructuring later:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> chalk <span>from</span> <span>"chalk"</span><br><span>const</span> <span>{</span>underline<span>}</span> <span>=</span> chalk</code></pre>
<p>Why is this? It’s complicated, but the gist of it is that when loading modules,
ESM does not allow <em>executing</em> a module to determine what the exports are,
and so the exports need to be determined statically.
Unfortunately, in CJS, executing a module is the only reliable way of determining
what the exports are. Node.js actually tries very hard to figure out what the named exports are
(by parsing the module using a very fast parser),
but my experience is this method doesn’t work for most packages that I’ve tried this with,
and I need to fall back to default importing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Gotcha</strong>: importing a CJS module is easy, but you mostly can’t use named imports and need
to add a second line to destructure out the named imports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that in 2021, more and more packages will have ESM entry points that export
themselves as ESM with the proper named exports. But for now, you may need the additional
destructuring to use named imports from CJS pacakges.</p>
<h3 id="top-level-await">Top-level await <a href="#top-level-await">#</a></h3>
<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/banner-in-color.mjs">https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/banner-in-color.mjs</a></p>
<p>Continuning our exploration of <code>banner-in-color.mjs</code> we find this extraordinary line
that reads a file from the disk:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>const</span> text <span>=</span> <span>await</span> fs<span>.</span><span>readFile</span><span>(</span><span>join</span><span>(</span>__dirname<span>,</span> <span>"text.txt"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>"utf8"</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
<p>Why so extraordinary? Because of that <code>await</code>. This is an <code>await</code> that is outside an <code>async</code>
function, and is at the top level of the code. This kind of <code>await</code> is called “top-level await”
and is supported since Node.js v14. It is extraordinary because it is the only feature in Node.js
that is available <em>only</em> in ESM modules (i.e. not available in CJS). Why is that? Because
ESM is an async module system, and so supports async operations when loading the module,
while CJS is loaded synchronously and so cannot support <code>await</code>.</p>
<p>Great feature, and only in ESM! 🎉🎉🎉🎉</p>
<p>But notice the use of <code>__dirname</code> in the line above. Let’s discuss that.</p>
<h3 id="__dirname"><code>__dirname</code> <a href="#__dirname">#</a></h3>
<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/banner-in-color.mjs">https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/banner-in-color.mjs</a></p>
<p>If you try to use <code>__dirname</code> in ESM, you will find that it is not available
(just like <code>__filename</code>). But if you need it, you can quickly determine it using these lines:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>import</span> url <span>from</span> <span>"url"</span><p><span>const</span> __dirname <span>=</span> url<span>.</span><span>fileURLToPath</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>URL</span><span>(</span><span>"."</span><span>,</span> <span>import</span><span>.</span>meta<span>.</span>url<span>)</span><span>)</span></p></code></pre>
<p>Complex? Yes. So let’s deconstruct this code to understand it.</p>
<p>First off, the expression <code>import.meta.url</code> is part of the ESM spec, and its purpose
is the same as the CJS <code>__filename</code>, except …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We started IPRally with Clojure because of my personal love story with the language. Before IPRally, I was working as a developer in Adtile, working with a globally distributed analytics pipeline. We had the code organized in Clojure microservices, and the crazy thing was that the code was easy to understand. Not only that, it was easy to modify. We had tests for the microservice functionalities, but not for the finer details. Then without changing the tests, you could fearlessly modify the solution, refactoring the code into something comprehensible. Because the language is so powerful, such high level tests can be enough.</p><figure id="w-node-_396c9ff0-a22c-cab0-f5e4-4c7f1ef2a6fd-bb2520dd"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5bec13eafb29cc0f35b87530/601403e1e7a5aaf2ddd5fc95_Screenshot%202021-01-29%20at%2014.46.39.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Data is kept in simple format. When you can understand the data, the code makes more sense too.</figcaption></figure><h2>What is this language</h2><p>Clojure is a modern reincarnation of Lisp, an ancient language already specified in 1958. In fact, the original Lisp is the second oldest high level programming language after Fortran. It was favored especially among the artificial intelligence researchers. Clojure, the Lisp of today, is often used with web development, with integrations to both Java and JavaScript ecosystems. Lately there has been some movement towards the AI&nbsp;roots too with support for <a href="https://github.com/clj-python/libpython-clj">Python interop</a> and Clojure data science libraries like <a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>.</p><p>You don’t usually learn Clojure as your first language, nor do you accidentally end up writing Clojure in the industry. That’s why studying it tends to be a conscious choice, and that’s why the Clojurians tend to come with some seniority, and <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#top-paying-technologies">are among the highest paid programmers</a>.<br></p><figure id="w-node-fa6d359a-091a-5690-3e52-7478f9de0661-bb2520dd"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5bec13eafb29cc0f35b87530/6013f8643c677af37b7e6ef6_fOxEYxyc3buKsGDE3RxXH5Ew787Gww5NzAGTWAci93BWp_1mr-ihMap5A51V0NcBHna0ENFgimFVDNj_ctH5Y4__GaGr964SfZhgZ9E99HDopawD3Xwa1IIxRg-4OAerpqIfK0Pd.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>We use !&nbsp;in the end of function name if running it may have side effects. In this case, you are the machine.</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Simple &gt; easy or safe</strong>‍</h2><div><p>At the end of the day, programming is mostly about building. There certainly are difficult challenges, e.g. natural language understanding, but mostly we developers focus on building systems in a maintainable way. And it’s not just about technical debt. Systems can be built in endlessly different ways, which of most eventually slow you down and cause suffering. When you compromise your solution slightly with every decision, you cannot fix it with just some refactoring. Building in a maintainable way is crucial for a product company - it eventually leads to a faster development speed and allows scaling up the organization.</p><p>Clojure opts for simplicity. As a comparison, Ruby is a language that tries to make things easy. But the Clojure way is to care less about how fast you can code, and more about minimising magic. <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/">Rich Hickey's classic presentation</a> on the subject comes recommended. Other languages like Java or Haskell choose safety, with type systems for data. With Clojure, the responsibility for creating safety nets is left for the developer. Advantage? In good hands, this can avoid complexity. <a href="https://labs.ig.com/lines-of-code-matter">Here</a> is an example how 441 lines of idiomatic Java become 58 lines of Clojure.</p></div><h2><strong>The right thing to do, even if it’s hard</strong></h2><p><strong>‍</strong>Aiming for simplicity makes one respect craftsmanship. No technology guarantees a simple solution. There are always more ways to create a mess than to find something elegant. Simple is hard, and we still choose simple. In the long run, a simple solution is more maintainable and safer than something more complex.&nbsp;</p><div><p>You surely can create a good solution with any moderately sensible technology. In the end of the day, developers matter more than technology or the processes, and the main advantage of Clojure comes from this. The developers who love programming and go the extra mile for learning a rare language are often pretty good ones. We met with two of the earliest IPRally team members, Juho Sepänmaa and Sebastian Björkqvist, in the Helsinki Clojure meetups. Even though Sebastian ended up working with deep learning and Python, Clojure helped once again to spot a top talent.</p></div><figure id="w-node-_2e926122-ad3f-0bf6-b715-65faa7fc86aa-bb2520dd"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5bec13eafb29cc0f35b87530/6013f86447b2bdec5422e7cd_Qz284vk1xnW6rGT320sWN40Pe80uRZw1l6u31MOAVi9jfAt3iJkoW017WmSEk9BRZ4_L0VuhSRWlN3CMCMDbTa5l1AngS-dVGJK4W-QGOTW4m6es7kbOTohGsQ8WPZYQ4-EDT3PD.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>The syntax for figuring out the good startups has never been simpler.</figcaption></figure><p>We are building a tech organization with foundations in Clojure philosophy.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>When it comes to sharing files, there are many SaaS options out there, but what if you need a quick and simple solution?</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>When I released the first version of inlets, my mind was set on solving just one problem. My team at an enterprise company needed to receive webhooks from a GitHub App in order to build a CI/CD platform we were working on. We looked to solutions like Ngrok and SSH tunnels, but both were blocked or had limits that meant they were not suitable.</p>

<p>The project did well, and then I got <a href="https://twitter.com/ntdvps/status/1143071544203186176?s=20">a message</a> from Roman Dodin who had just used inlets to transfer a large file.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I just transferred a 70Gb disk image from a NATed NAS to a remote NATed server with @alexellisuk’ inlets tunnels and a one-liner python web server. Check it out, works like a breeze.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice that Roman did not have to upload 70GB to One-Drive or Dropbox, only to download it again. He was simply able to set up an inlets exit-server and get access to the file directly, without having to wait for an initial upload and download.</p>

<p>Maybe you need to share a 5GB video recording with someone for editing, or as part of a virtual conference? Perhaps you have a number of smaller files to share with a colleague, and don’t want to clog up your Google Drive with them.</p>

<p>In this post I’ll explain how it was not as simple as I expected to share a large file over my inlets tunnel, and what I did to make it simpler. I hope you’ll also find the tool useful whether you run it directly on a cloud instance, or expose it securely over an inlets tunnel.</p>

<h2 id="not-so-simple">Not so simple</h2>

<p>So when I was having issues with my Apple Mac and Big Sur, and was asked to provide a dump of my Mac’s diagnostic information, we decided to try to use inlets to share the zip file.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I thought: “I’ll simply use <code>inletsctl</code> to create a quick self-hosted server tunnel the inlets server, then connect my inlets client running on my laptop, and the engineer can grab the file”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://inlets.dev/images/2020-10-advanced-cloud/internet-webhooks.png" alt="Conceptual diagram"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conceptual diagram showing how inlets uses a client/server architecture to bridge networks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, I tried to use <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code> - the built-in HTTP server, but it didn’t work.</p>

<p>Here’s what went wrong:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it couldn’t support the large file-size (~500MB)</li>
  <li>directory listing is turned on by default, so anyone could see the file who found the IP address</li>
  <li>there was no password protection, so anyone could download the file</li>
</ul>

<p>In the end, I ran an <code>nginx</code> container with Docker Desktop, and mounted my file into the container. That also didn’t work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nginx didn’t want me to serve such a large file</li>
  <li>I had to build a custom config file and rebuild the container</li>
  <li>I still didn’t have basic auth, which is trivial to set up, but lots of manual steps</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixing-the-pain">Fixing the pain</h2>

<p>Having written HTTP servers using the Golang standard library for the past 4 years, I thought I’d try making my own which could solve this pain and be built into inlets going forward.</p>

<p>So I went ahead and built the <code>inlets-pro http fileserver</code> command, and to test it, used it to share a new pre-release version of the feature with the community.</p>

<p>The main flags that solve the pain pain points above are:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  <span>-a</span>, <span>--allow-browsing</span>      Allow directories to be browsed by clients
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means I can quickly turn on or off browsing, so I could keep a private URL, and have no need for a password.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  -p, --port int            port for server and for tunnel (default 8000)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This one means we don’t have to have port clashes, even the SimpleHTTPServer supports changing the port. I also get to run two servers or more.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  -t, --token string        token or password for Basic Authentication
  -f, --token-from string   read the authentication token from a file
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The token when set is the basic auth password. Basic auth over TLS is a reasonable combination for providing ad-hoc downloads.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  -w, --webroot string      select the webroot, or leave empty for the current directory
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally I wanted to give the option to easily set a webroot. It’s quite common for users to accidentally share their home directory, which includes .ssh keys and a whole host of other confidential data. This flag exists to help you be more intentional about what you share.</p>

<p>Just like with Python’s built-in HTTP server, you run <code>inlets-pro http fileserver</code> on your local computer.</p>

<p>Here’s how to turn on file-browsing and enable a password (read from a file)</p>

<div><div><pre><code>inlets-pro http fileserver <span>\</span>
  <span>--token-file</span> <span>$HOME</span>/password.txt <span>\</span>
  <span>--webroot</span> /tmp/share <span>\</span>
  <span>--allow-browsing</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s how to make it a little easier for who is accessing your tunnel by disabling the password but making sure they access a direct URL for a given file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>inlets-pro http fileserver <span>\</span>
  <span>--webroot</span> /tmp/share <span>\</span>
  <span>--allow-browsing</span><span>=</span><span>false</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, if you want to generally share files with anyone who may find them, you can do it like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>inlets-pro http fileserver <span>\</span>
  <span>--webroot</span> /tmp/share <span>\</span>
  <span>--allow-browsing</span><span>=</span><span>true</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To put this all together you’d do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Run <code>inlets-pro http fileserver</code> on your local machine</li>
  <li>Create a server on the cloud to host the <code>inlets-pro http server</code></li>
  <li>Run <code>inlets-pro http client</code> on your local machine</li>
</ul>

<p>And then share the URL with your colleagues or friends.</p>

<p>For a walk-through of everything using a custom domain and Let’s Encrypt, try this quick quest:</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/alexellis/cb2653a56d666871955e4ac180355168">Your quest - establish a secure tunnel with a custom domain</a></p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>So next time you need to share a file from your local computer, or need to run a simple, but powerful HTTP server, why not try inlets-pro’s new <code>http fileserver</code> mode?</p>

<p>There is no enforced requirement to have a license to use the fileserver, but if you want to support the project and benefit from self-hosted HTTP and TCP tunnels, why not check out a personal license that you can use at home and work? <a href="https://inlets.dev/pricing/">inlets pricing</a></p>

<div><p><strong>Fetch AWS data<br></strong>Feeding AWS data into securiCAD Vanguard can be done in two ways.<br>– You can enter API keys of a read-only IAM user so that Vanguard can fetch it for you. If you want more information, see <em>Creating an IAM user</em>, <em>Setting IAM User permissions</em> and <em>Generating AWS Access Key</em> below.<br>– You can download a script, enter your keys, and let it fetch your configuration for you. It will then store the configuration as a json file which you then upload into vanguard. If you want more information see below.</p><p><strong>Amazon Inspector<br></strong>By including data from Amazon Inspector, securiCAD Vanguard can help you prioritize existing vulnerabilities. Amazon Inspector data can be included in the simulation by either checking the box for Amazon Inspector when simulating from an IAM User or by running the CLI Script locally. securiCAD Vanguard will automatically fetch scans from the last 30 days and pick the lastest scan and gather CVE and Network Reachability data.</p><p><strong>Configure Simulations<br></strong></p><p>Once you have a model of your environment you may supply some additional information.<br>– Threat profile. Are you worried about criminals, nation state hackers or bored teenagers? Which threat profile you choose will affect the simulation results.<br>– High value assets. Which components in your environment contain the sensitive data or must not be compromised?<br>If you want to know more about these configuration options, please see <em>Assets &amp; Threat Profile</em> under <em>How it works</em> further down.</p><p><strong>Simulate<br></strong>Clicking ”Simulate” will start the attack simulation of the model generated from the AWS data and the selected scenario configuration.<br>Simulations are computationally heavy and may take anywhere from seconds to minutes depending on size of the generated model.<br>Once the simulation is done, the model and results can be inspected by selecting “Critical Path”, “Report” or “Model viewer”.

A desired outcome can for example be to gain administrative access to a given EC2 instance which e.g. is represented by the HighPrivilegeAccess attack step and that will be highlighted in blue in the Critical Path viewer.</p><p>The term “path” may be a bit misleading as attack steps may require multiple preconditions to be satisfied. This is for example access via known credentials to a networked service which will require both the ability to connect to the service over the network as well as access to the login credentials.

Ryan is based in LA. I’m based in London. We work on the internet. </p><p>There has been a lot of “micro fund” chat on the internet: <a href="https://blogofjake.com/2020/08/24/how-rolling-funds-could-rock-vc/">The rise of rolling funds</a>, <a href="https://thecuriousinvestor.substack.com/p/rolling-funds-and-the-rise-of-the">the rise of Micro LPs</a>, <a href="https://nbt.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-the-solo-capitalists">The Rise of the Solo Capitalists</a>…</p><p>But little has been shared about how funds like ours operate, and how we aim to: </p><ul role="list"><li>Be the highest helpfulness to check-size ratio investor to our portfolio founders. One of our portfolio founders Harry Hurst tweeted about the concept <a href="https://twitter.com/harryhurst/status/1280165358255538179">here</a>. </li><li>Invest in the best early-stage deals partnering with founders early and driving returns </li><li>Be the best possible fund manager to our LPs: trusted, communicative and high-performing</li></ul><p>‍</p><p>Jeff Lawson, the founder and CEO of Twilio, said this about strategy on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2VHi9azzFenfH4R9SlBHqT?si=nsqv1LKhRa64c5vr1Lqs4Q">Bessemer Venture Partners Cloud Giants Podcast</a>:</p><blockquote>I often say that strategy is a dirty word in business; it should be struck. Any time you find yourself talking about strategy, you’re probably off-course, actually. There’s only one business strategy: serve your customers.</blockquote><p>I agree with that. In venture, I think there’s only one core strategy: serving founders in a differentiated way. We’ve implemented workflows made up of tools, automations and habits to optimize our limited time to create leverage to serve founders.</p><p>Let’s break this down.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Spark</h3><p>Investors spend a lot of time in their inbox. 😅 </p><p>Here’s what makes Spark the best email tool for us:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Shared drafts:</strong> We use each other as a second pair of eyes to review email drafts including offers to invest in companies, deal-flow sharing with other investors and diligence follow-ups. Spark has a collaborative real-time editor that speeds up making edits before sending a draft. </li><li><strong>Spark templates:</strong> We use Spark templates to quickly share details about portfolio companies with other investors when helping founders with their fundraise.</li><li><strong>In-email private chat:</strong> We use this to make quick decisions about the email we receive. This includes cold email, deal-flow from other investors and admin/scheduling.</li></ul><figure id="w-node-_7ba6e6a7-3dcf-2fca-e88d-37c75a60536c-cdb40311"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f95adbd8f997f228751ac9f/600dfe86a1d3df2e88f92e31_spark-chat.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Airtable</h3><p>Airtable is the central storage for all information on deal flow, investments, and people in our network.</p><p>Here’s what makes Airtable the best tool for us:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Flexible:</strong> It’s flexible enough for us to store anything. We store a lot. </li><li><strong>Relational:</strong> You’ve probably heard that investors are in the relationship business. Relational databases like Airtable aren’t just about storing data, they store relationships between data. This helps us see links between the companies, deals, founders, investors, funds, and more in the WF universe. </li><li><strong>Integration friendly:</strong> It integrates with other tools to make all types of workflows that power the fund.</li></ul><p>Our Airtable “base” includes three primary tables:</p><p><strong>Companies</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>We manage our Pipeline through an “Active Pipeline” view which filters companies we are meeting, diligencing or going to pass on. We also have a Missed view, a Tracking view, a Markups view and more to help us sort through companies. </li><li>We automatically capture pipeline entry and exit dates to track how fast we’re responding to founders. We try to get back to founders with a 7 day “SLA”. </li><li>We also record who introduced us to every deal sourced through an introduction. This links to our People table enriching our CRM. &nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>People</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>This includes founders, investors and others who have introduced us to companies. The table is designed to surface the context of our relationship: i.e for investors, it would surface which deals we’ve co-invested in, which deals they introduced us to, etc. </li><li>We have a “Warm Angel and Small Fund” view we use to share deals with angels + small funds we’re collaborating most with. </li><li>We also have a “Top Introducers” view that filters top introducers based on the # of deals + portfolio companies they’ve introduced us to.</li></ul><p><strong>VC Firms</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>We use this table to capture who is investing at VC firms (linked of course to the People table), and what stages, categories, check sizes they invest in, and if they lead rounds. </li><li>Like our People table, we have a “Warm VC Firms” table we use to share deals with the firms that are most collaborative. It’s also helpful for identifying firms that might be best suited for a particular company based on their stage and market focus. </li><li>What makes this table especially useful for deal-sharing is the subjective context we capture in notes and often share with founders before making introductions. Here’s what a note would look like “Coatue is one of the most data-driven firms and Mazzeo’s one of the most energetic, product-minded investors I know.” Yes, that is a real example.</li></ul><p>🎁 Here’s a digital goodie: <a href="https://airtable.com/shr5i9tJSUl7ob7CY/tblbr0WwfLMZ1a9Mc/viwZ1sYZ9ripf5Ft4?blocks=hide">Template from our Airtable</a></p><figure id="w-node-_8d35af31-6898-a193-fc30-0a3d187f3df2-cdb40311"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f95adbd8f997f228751ac9f/600ee65b3b6b23278218888b_Screenshot%202021-01-25%20at%2015.40.25.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Zapier</h3><p>We automate as much as possible not just to save time, but also to not miss any steps in our processes. We want to be working on the right things, the right way. &nbsp;</p><p>Zaps we have running right now:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Deal channel creation zap: </strong>We have a Zap that automatically creates a deal channel in Slack for every deal we’re meeting from Airtable. More on that below. 🎁 <a href="https://zapier.com/shared/f9ccfed550a2def74cd37da38aab2d00f0780118">Template here</a></li><li><strong>7-day SLA zap:</strong> We have a Zap that sets up a reminder to follow up 7 days after the deal entered our pipeline. This helps us ensure that we get back to every founder in a reasonable time. 🎁 <a href="https://zapier.com/shared/f9ccfed550a2def74cd37da38aab2d00f0780118">Template here</a> (last 2 steps in template)</li><li><strong>Tracking zap:</strong> We have another Zap to follow up on companies we’re tracking. 🎁 <a href="https://zapier.com/shared/71703611e82231e90d81e13e60cd722dc5aad259">Template here</a></li></ul><p>‍</p><h3>Slack</h3><p>Slack works well for our working style at Weekend Fund. Here’s how we use it for deals:</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>Our deal creation Zap (as mentioned above) automatically creates a Slack channel for every company we’re meeting</li><li>We consolidate materials/context in the channel before every pitch call </li><li>We share questions for the founder in the channel before every pitch to ensure we’re well prepared </li><li>Debrief + decide next steps immediately after call </li><li>The 7 day SLA Zap goes off in the channel 7 days after the deal entered our pipeline </li><li>We close the channel only after we close the investment or send the pass email + “close the loop” email updating the person who introduced us to the deal</li></ol><p>In addition to deal channels, we have a few more to organize our communications:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>#deal-outbound:</strong> Vedika is using this channel to build a habit of outbound deal sourcing starting with 1x deal a day </li><li><strong>#experiments:</strong> As early stage becomes even more competitive, it feels even more important for us to run experiments. We’ve run experiments like Weekend Build, Fundraise From Home, and are working on our next one. This is the channel we use for experiments related chat. <strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>#shower-thoughts:</strong> This is a creative safe space where we discuss “What if we tried this?” ideas.</li></ul><p>At the time of this post, we have 25 Slack channels open. This might sound silly for a two-person team, but we’ve found this organization helpful in our communications. Our slack history is a searchable artifact for the years to come.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Vimcal</h3><p>The newest tool in our stack is Vimcal, the calendar app we use for scheduling. Here’s why we use it:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Timezone juggling: </strong>As a distributed team jumping on calls with founders around the world, we do a lot of scheduling across timezones. Vimcal is the best tool we’ve found for this.</li><li><strong>Efficient, but still personal:</strong> Gets us the efficiency of booking links without the risk of it coming off as transactional</li></ul><figure id="w-node-cfea6145-512c-34a8-e7b2-501f9f458622-cdb40311"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f95adbd8f997f228751ac9f/600e0104afcfe91478eedf7c_vimcal-gif.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><h3>AngelList Venture Funds</h3><p>AngelList makes it possible for a small team (or single person) to run a venture fund. They provide:</p><ul role="list"><li>Operational support to execute deals - reviewing + signing legal docs and wiring funds</li><li>Tax reporting and accounting overhead </li><li>Capital calls and other LP management </li><li>A dashboard with investment and fund performance data (use <a href="https://angel.co/v/venture/calculator">this calculator</a> to see how your fund performs in comparison to others)</li></ul><p>‍</p><h3>Share Your Stack</h3><p>This is our stack at a high level. There’s a lot more we do behind the scenes, and we’re always thinking about ways to improve our workflows, automations and habits. </p><p>While we don’t expect other fund managers to copy our way of working 100%, we’re hoping that sharing our stack and workflows will be useful for other emerging fund managers. </p><p>If you’re a fund manger, we’d love to see the stack powering your fund on Twitter. Tweet me at <a href="https://twitter.com/vedikaja_in">@vedikaja_in</a>.</p><p>‍</p><p><em>Thanks to Ryan Hoover, Varadh Jain and Liam Moore for reading drafts of this.</em></p></div></div>]]>

Besides being cost-effective, outsource programming brings your project extra flexibility and efficiency: you are paying your team for their time and work and don’t have employers’ obligations to them.<br>But where to outsource? In this article, we will provide you with a guide on outsourcing destinations with the best developers.</p>



<h2> What Makes A Country Good Outsourcing Destination?</h2>



<p>Here is what top outsourcing countries are known for:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Lower costs;</li><li>Highly-developed IT market;</li><li>Great educational infrastructure;</li><li>Good English level.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>Those are general rules among the best countries for web developers. These are the basics and we recommend choosing from the countries that fit the above criteria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other questions to ask yourself are:</p>



<ol><li>Can you comfortably align your work with this country’s time zone?</li><li>Is it easy to find a competency you are looking for in this market?&nbsp;</li><li>Do this country’s mentality and cultural values correspond with yours?&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>And that’s pretty much it. Now, let’s see what are the outsourcing destinations that offer the best software developers in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://blog.onbench.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-4-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.onbench.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-4-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://blog.onbench.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-4-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blog.onbench.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-4-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blog.onbench.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-4-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://blog.onbench.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-4-1-355x199.jpg 355w, https://blog.onbench.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-4-1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h3>Top Outsourcing Countries In The World</h3>



<ol><li>Ukraine</li></ol>



<p>Time zone GMT+3</p>



<p>Prices $25–50/hr</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://skillvalue.com/en/companies/it-ranking-best-developers-2019-skillvalue/" rel="nofollow">SkillValue 2019</a> best countries for software engineers ranking, Ukraine takes 4th place among other European countries. And according to HackerRank, Ukraine gained a score of 88.7% and takes 11th place in the overall ranking.</p>



<p>The software development teams in Ukraine focus on web and mobile development, Big Data and AI, blockchain, and cryptocurrency-related projects. You can find all kinds of tech stack and expertise in this country.</p>



<p>Even though English is not an official language, workers from the IT sector are known for their great English level. So if you are looking for low-cost and high-quality best developers based outside of the EU, we highly recommend considering Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="2"><li>The Philippines</li></ol>



<p>Time zone GMT+8</p>



<p>Prices $18–40/hr</p>



<p>The main advantage of outsourcing your software development to the Philippines is the developers’ English level. English is an official language in the Philippines and you’ll be getting a fluent English-speaking engineer for at least 10th of the price you’d pay in the US.<br>This outsourcing destination gained 63.8$ score in the <a href="https://blog.hackerrank.com/which-country-would-win-in-the-programming-olympics/" rel="nofollow">HackerRank</a> coding challenges. Even though the Philippines is not known for the best developers, we advise you to consider this country for small low-budget projects.</p>



<ol start="3"><li>India</li></ol>

<p>India gained 76% in the <a href="https://blog.hackerrank.com/which-country-would-win-in-the-programming-olympics/" rel="nofollow">HackerRank</a> list. India is probably the most well-known outsourcing destination and is considered the best country to hire developers by big players such as Microsoft. And the scale is impressive – 2.6 million STEM or Science, Technology, Engineering, Math specialists in India graduate from universities every year.</p>



<p>Also, India is the second largest English-speaking country in the world and if you prefer to work with native English speakers – it’s a great choice.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="4"><li>Argentina</li></ol>



<p>Time Zone GMT-3</p>



<p>Prices $30–50/hour</p>



<p>If you are based on the West Coast and are looking to work with someone in a relatively close timezone, you should consider Argentina. Rated 72.1% by <a href="https://blog.hackerrank.com/which-country-would-win-in-the-programming-olympics/" rel="nofollow">Hackerank</a>, Argentina became one of the best countries for web developers due to its thought-through, math-oriented government schooling programs.</p>



<p>While English can be a bit of a struggle in a country in general, you can find outsource programming specialists that have great command in English.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Outsourcing companies in Argentina specialize in software development, cloud computing, and DevOps.</p>



<ol start="5"><li>China</li></ol>



<p>Time Zone GMT+8</p>



<p>Prices $18-40/hr</p>



<p>China has ranked unbelievable 100% in the <a href="https://blog.hackerrank.com/which-country-would-win-in-the-programming-olympics/" rel="nofollow">HackerRank</a> list. It means that it seamlessly passed all of the HackerRank challenges and well, the quality is just perfect.</p>



<p>But before jumping to type “how to hire developers in China” in the search bar, we have to reveal two serious flaws of Chinese outsourcing market. First, is, of course, English – the general population of the country doesn’t speak it. Though, over the last few years, China has proudly received a label ‘moderate’ in the <a href="https://www.ef.com.co/epi/regions/asia/china/" rel="nofollow">EF English proficiency</a> rating. Second concern is the history of data leaks and copyrights violations.</p>



<p>Though if you are determined to hire China-based best developers (and they truly are the best!) we recommend you to thoroughly source for the right reliable partner and properly arrange all the paperwork. Safety first!</p>



<p>We tried to outline a country in each region and, honestly, these are the best countries for software engineers. And the list doesn’t end there as we listed only 5 of these amazing outsourcing destinations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if we were to take an overview and define which region in the world is better for outsourcing. Is it the Americas, Europe, Asia, or maybe Africa?</p>



<h3>Which Area Is The Best For Outsourcing?</h3>



<p>We briefly mentioned the downsides of each outsourcing destination. Argentina is a bit more pricey than other countries, China has copyright issues and the Philippines is behind its competitors due to a lower level of coding expertise. And to be honest, many of these issues exist due to countries’ specifics and politics as well as their locations.&nbsp;While Europe could be expensive due to high pay rates and employment rules and India can have too much of a variance in expertise, how to finally understand what is the best country to hire developers?</p>



<p>We’ll surprise you, but it’s all up to you to decide that. There isn’t a universal mechanism on how to find that perfect team, it really depends on one’s taste.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though our team is located in Ukraine and we truly believe that is the ultimate outsourcing location. Why?</p>



<ol><li>It has a lot of great talent. In 2018, Ukraine was <a href="https://2018.stateofeuropeantech.com/" rel="nofollow">reported</a> to have 200.000+ IT specialists.</li><li>Most of the developers speak English. Ukrainian IT companies offer free classes to their employees.</li><li>Easy-going and professional work ethics. Ukrainians share European values and are extremely easy to work with.&nbsp;</li><li>Reasonable pricing. Ukraine is a very affordable country with a low tax rate. So as a result, the software development prices end up being lower than other European countries.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>The ratings are often subjective. Though we tried to be neutral, yet share our thoughts and experience about the best countries to outsource programming too. We hope you enjoyed reading about the top outsourcing countries.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a> is ubiquitous and I often run into it whilst developing or debugging.</p>
<p>When it’s in raw form like this …</p>
<p><img src="https://bengtan.com/blog/reading-long-json-snippets/plaintext.jpg" alt="json as raw text"></p>
<p>it’s hard for a human to interpret.</p>
<p>For small snippets, I could copy-and-paste it into a text file and hand-prettify it. For long snippets, that’s obviously not scalable.</p>
<p>I stumbled upon a very useful tool for interpreting and analysing (extremely) long JSON snippets. The surprising thing is that it’s been around for a long time and I just never noticed. However, once I knew about it, I kept using it, and it’s now my go-to tool for analysing long JSON snippets.</p>
<p>The tool?</p>
<p><strong>Mozilla Firefox.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the web browser. (It also helps that Firefox is my main browser.)</p>
<p>Here is a link to a random JSON file from the internet:</p>
<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bengtan/bengtan.github.io/main/content/css-named-colours-picker/dist/main.js.map">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bengtan/bengtan.github.io/main/content/css-named-colours-picker/dist/main.js.map</a></p>
<p>If you click on the link with Firefox you get something human-unfriendly:</p>
<p><img src="https://bengtan.com/blog/reading-long-json-snippets/plaintext.jpg" alt="json as raw text"></p>
<p>However, if you open a file with a <code>.json</code> extension on your local computer , you get …</p>
<p><img src="https://bengtan.com/blog/reading-long-json-snippets/json.png" alt="json in firefox json browser"></p>
<p>… which is a nice and useful and human-friendly json browser with collapsible sections, pretty printing and <strong>filtering</strong>.</p>
<p>(I think Firefox shows the json browser when the mimetype is set to json, and opening a local file with a <code>.json</code> extension is an easy way to set the mimetype.)</p>
<p>I stumbled upon this by chance. But since then, everytime I have a long JSON snippet to debug, I save it to a text file, give it a <code>.json</code> extension and open it with Firefox.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Okay, so installing Firefox just to browse JSON is probably overkill, but this is great for me since I already use it.</p>
<p>I’m glad Firefox is my main browser.</p>

<p>In 2015 I predicted the boom of <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> with my post <a href="https://kurozael.com/ethereum-org-future-of-the-web/">Ethereum.org - Future of the Web</a>, and I'm ready to do it again.</p><h2 id="what-is-nano">What is Nano?</h2><p><a href="https://nano.org/">Nano Currency</a> is <em>digital money for the modern world </em>and it offers a variety of revolutionary features that rival Bitcoin. It has <strong>no fees</strong> for transactions, and it is <strong>eco-friendly</strong> because it does not rely on mining. In addition, Nano transactions are near-instant and the technology is scalable.</p><h2 id="why-not-bitcoin">Why not Bitcoin?</h2><p>Over recent years Bitcoin has seen huge success, and this success has largely been driven by the following things:</p><ul><li>The fear of missing out as the price increases</li><li>Influencers artificially driving up the price</li><li>The potential profitability of mining</li></ul><p>Bitcoin is valuable, because it has value. People are willing to buy Bitcoin. However, we have seen that Bitcoin does not scale very well, and in addition to that, it incurs a huge cost in real-world resources to mine it. Massive GPU farms are mining Bitcoin and using up valuable energy that is better served elsewhere.</p><p>In a modern world, a world where people are conscious of their carbon footprint and the damage that we as human beings are doing to the world, we must be cautious of wasting energy.</p><h2 id="no-mining">No Mining?</h2><p>Because of Nano's very interesting <a href="https://docs.nano.org/glossary/#open-representative-voting-orv">Open Representative Voting</a> mechanism, Nano describes the way it provides value over other cryptocurrencies as such:</p><blockquote>Minimal block size allows for lightweight communication resulting in ultrafast transaction confirmation times</blockquote><blockquote>Without traditional Proof-of-Work and mining, nodes use significantly less energy per transaction than other popular networks</blockquote><blockquote>Emergent centralization forces for node operators are reduced due to the near zero marginal cost of producing consensus in Nano</blockquote><h2 id="why-not-ethereum">Why not Ethereum?</h2><p>I want to be clear here that by supporting Nano I do not detract from my previous views on Ethereum. I maintain that Ethereum is extremely important for the future of the web and this can be seen from the applications developed for it, and the surge in interest over the last 5 years.</p><p><strong>Ethereum is not a currency.</strong> Ethereum provides a very unique and important way to build decentralized applications for the web. We must not mistake Ethereum as your everyday fiat replacement.</p><p><strong>Nano is a Bitcoin alternative. </strong>The difference is that Nano is scalable, fast, fee-less, and contributes far less energy wastage than Bitcoin does. This makes it a great eco-friendly alternative and what has the potential to be the best currency of the future.</p><h2 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h2><ul><li><a href="https://nano.org/">https://nano.org/</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.nano.org/whitepaper/english/">https://docs.nano.org/whitepaper/english/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/">https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/</a></li></ul><p>For a great read on Nano check out <a href="https://senatusspqr.medium.com/fight-the-climate-crisis-usenano-6e7c22d45b0e">Fight the Climate Crisis, #UseNano</a>, by <a href="https://reddit.com/u/SenatusSPQR">/u/SenatusSPQR</a>, their article delves deeper into to the true value of Nano in preventing the disastrous effects that Bitcoin could have on our planet.</p><h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2><p>This is not financial advice.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="full_content">
    <p><em>Speculative</em>: the word is often used to describe the crypto market. Still, after what happened with <strong><b>Gamestop </b></strong><a href="https://www.fool.ca/company/nyse-gme-gamestop/272716/" data-is-tickerizer-link="true">(NYSE:GME)</a> rally, it might be safe to say the speculations — especially once they gain traction in the social networking circles and build up a legit “hype” — can be just as potent at driving the price of stocks up and down as they are at controlling the price of crypto.</p>
<p>Whether or not you participated in the rally, made a profit, or lost a lot of money, there are a few lessons to learn from the rally and the perils of jumping on a perilous, short-lived bandwagon.</p>
<h2><strong><b>The cons of following a hype</b></strong></h2>
<p>It’s effortless to see the <a href="https://www.fool.ca/2021/02/03/blackberry-stock-soars-over-250-then-plummets-50/"><u>Gamestop hype</u></a> as some sort of justice that retail investors are serving to the institutional investors who have been shorting Gamestop for quite a while by creating a short squeeze. This rally began from a Reddit group, and it has taken social media, and now even mainstream media, by storm, and it’s understandable why.</p>
<p>From the beginning of this year to the recent peak on Jan. 27, Gamestop stock grew by over 1,900%. That’s more than how much Bitcoin grew from its lowest point after the 2017 crash to its 2020 peak.</p>
<p>And while it was glorious for people who bought and sold at just the right moment, it caused many average investors to lose their shirts to this bet. According to an analyst, that’s what usually happens when a short squeeze meets its inevitable end. For an average investor, betting against the machine (or, more precisely, betting “late” against the machine and not pulling out on time) didn’t go very well.</p>
<p>A small minority won the short squeeze, and even though it was a different minority compared to the elites, the situation only got worse for the average investors.</p>
<h2><strong><b>The good, old long-term holdings</b></strong></h2>
<p>For average investors, playing “trader” every once in a while doesn’t bode very well. Sticking to a good long-term-holding strategy would be safer (even if it’s <a href="https://www.fool.ca/2021/02/02/shopify-inc-tsxshop-the-original-gamestop/"><u>not as explosive</u></a>). One reasonably priced stock you might consider, especially for its mouthwatering yield of 8%, is <strong><b>Timbercreek Financials </b></strong><a href="https://www.fool.ca/company/tsx-tf-timbercreek-financial-corp/273410/" data-is-tickerizer-link="true">(TSX:TF)</a>. The payout ratio is a bit shaky at 119%, but it’s sustainable so far. And considering the payout ratio history, the company might be able to pull through without slashing its dividends.</p>
<p>The company saw its revenue growing a bit in the last quarter, and if we look back further, the company has been growing its revenues every year since 2012. The company issues a loan to commercial real estate businesses. Most of its loans are short duration, so the company doesn’t have to wait long to realize its gain. Companies like Timbercreek fill the gap left by the traditional lenders — i.e., banks — and real estate businesses seek such companies to fund many of their projects.</p>
<h2><strong><b>Foolish takeaway</b></strong></h2>
<p>One major takeaway from the Gamestop rally is that if you want to play trader or try to capture the upside of a hype that’s building, try doing it with money you can risk losing. So, if you win, you win big. But if you lose, your overall financial standing won’t suffer a severe blow.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><strong>How I learnt to stop worrying and made the inbox-as-to-do-list approach work for&nbsp;me.</strong></p>

<p>I know. I know. I know! Using my inbox as my to-do-list is considered <a href="https://www.curaytor.com/blog/Your-Inbox-is-Not-a-To-Do-List">bad practice</a>, and I should feel bad for even trying.</p>

<p>Several well known time management books explicitly advise against this approach. Based on this advice, I have tried different tools and techniques to create a to-do-list <em>separate</em> from my inbox. Yet the honest truth is that all of these attempts didn’t work nearly as well for me as my current Gmail setup.</p>

<p>I learnt to stop worrying and made the inbox-as-to-do-list approach work for me. I will try to explain why and how. Perhaps it can work for you too.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="realisation-1-most-of-my-tasks-are-emailsalready">Realisation #1: Most of my tasks are emails&nbsp;already.</h2>

<p>My job revolves around communicating with people. Emails inevitably form a large part of that communication. Most of the things I get “done” get done through email. Most of the things I need to get done next will also get done through email.</p>

<p>When I try to keep a to-do-list separate from my inbox, most of the tasks that end up on that to-do-list started life as an email, or will at least result in an email eventually. Moving all of those emails to a separate to-do-list is a chore; moving them back to an email doubly so. Using my inbox as my to-do-list saves me a lot of work simply moving tasks back and forth.</p>

<p>Obviously, not all tasks start with an email. However, effective to-do-list management becomes a lot easier when all tasks are collected in <em>one place</em> (as opposed to being distributed across notebooks, sticky notes on my desk, apps on my phone, and my email).  So, since I have decided to use my inbox as my to-do-list, I need to ensure that somehow  all my tasks arrive as emails there, even those tasks that were not sent to me by other people.</p>

<p>The solution to that problem is rather straightforward.</p>

<h3 id="trick-1-i-email-tasks-tomyself">Trick #1: I email tasks to&nbsp;myself.</h3>

<p>Emailing myself about the odd task that does <em>not</em> already involve an email in my inbox feels like less work than moving everything else back and forth between two lists.</p>

<p>The great thing about this approach is that it is <em>extremely flexible</em>. Sometimes I email myself just a subject. Sometimes I write whole paragraphs of text in the body to remind myself of the details of the task.  Sometimes I add links to other things. Sometimes I reply to myself and post updates to keep track of my progress. Sometimes I carbon copy people who depend on the completion of the task, letting them know that I have documented this task and will get back to them later.</p>

<p>Inbox-as-to-do-list supports rich notes and collaborative tasks out of the box. Everyone I know already has an account and knows how to use this open platform.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.lukasvermeer.nl/publications/assets/2020-07-07-gmail-email-task.png" alt="A screenshot of composing an email addressed to &quot;Bob&quot; telling him it is a reminder for myself to do &quot;that thing&quot;."></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="realisation-2-time-management-is-attention-management">Realisation #2: Time management is attention management.</h2>

<p>Visual clutter clutters my mind. Anything I can see can distract me. The less there is to see on the screen, the less I will be distracted. To help me focus on the most important tasks, I try to hide everything else.</p>

<h3 id="trick-2-simplifygmail">Trick #2: Simplify&nbsp;Gmail.</h3>

<p>Simplify is an awesome <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simplify-gmail/pbmlfaiicoikhdbjagjbglnbfcbcojpj">Chrome extension</a> that simplifies the Gmail interface to the bare minimum. Most of the interface elements are useless anyway, because I use the keyboard to navigate (more on that later).</p>

<p>(I used to maintain a personal fork of Simplify that would hide <em>even more</em> of the interface - such as the giant”plus” in the bottom right of the screen - but then I realised I could just use my ad-blocker to block those specific components. Much easier, and just as effective.)</p>

<h3 id="trick-3-separate-gmail-from-thebrowser">Trick #3: Separate Gmail from the&nbsp;browser.</h3>

<p>I use Gmail through the web interface. Often I have several other tabs open at the same time. When I’m browsing, the Gmail tab distracts me. When I’m emailing, the other tabs distract me. Browsing and email are separate tasks that should live in separate apps.</p>

<p>Chrome can <a href="https://www.webnots.com/how-to-create-desktop-shortcut-of-a-site-from-google-chrome/">create a shortcut</a> to Gmail that opens as a new window. That way, Gmail behaves like a separate app, rather than just another tab.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.lukasvermeer.nl/publications/assets/2020-07-07-chrome-create-shortcut.png" alt="A screenshot of Chrome showing the menu entry to create a shortcut."></p>

<h3 id="trick-4snooze">Trick #4:&nbsp;Snooze.</h3>

<p>Tasks I do not need to focus on right now need to be out of <em>sight</em> and out of <em>mind</em>. If they are not, these currently unimportant tasks continue to take up valuable brain space, even when I am not actively working on them.</p>

<p>In my experience, there are two main ways in which a postponed task can impinge on my attention:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>If I see the task, I will think about the task.</em> Simply looking at a list of tasks is a great way to destroy my concentration. So many things to do! So little time!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>If I postpone a task, I need to know for sure that I will get back to it later.</em> This one is a bit more subtle, but nevertheless important. A postponed task tends to linger in my mind if I am not absolutely confident that I will be reminded about it later. Fear of forgetting is the mind-killer.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I need a way to completely hide a task, but I also need to know that it will be back. Luckily, Gmail has a <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7622010?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en">“snooze” feature</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Postpone emails and <strong>temporarily remove them from your inbox</strong> until you need them. Your email <strong>will come back to the top of your inbox</strong> when you want it to, whether that’s tomorrow, next week, or this evening.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I snooze frequently. I snooze ruthlessly. I snooze without regret.</p>

<p>Snoozing helps me avoid both of the attention traps above: the email disappears from view, and yet I can be absolutely confident that I will be reminded of it in the future, because it will come back directly to my inbox.</p>

<p>Deliberately deciding to postpone a task by actively snoozing it feels much better than pretending to ignore it for a while. Managing my own attention makes it more likely I will actually get to the task eventually. It’s not “goodbye”, it’s “see you later”.</p>

<p>Can it wait? Great!</p>

<h3 id="trick-5-disable-notifications">Trick #5: Disable notifications.</h3>

<p>Email is an asynchronous communication channel. It can usually wait a few hours. I will be checking my to-do-list several times a day in between tasks anyway. Notifications are a distraction and a waste of time.</p>

<h3 id="trick-6-close-gmail-while-working-on-atask">Trick #6: Close Gmail while working on a&nbsp;task.</h3>

<p>The purpose of a to-do-list is to help me decide what task I should be working on next. I do not need my to-do-list if I already know what I should be working on, or while I am working on a task. To avoid being distracted by other tasks on the list, or by new emails arriving in my inbox, I close Gmail while working on a task.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="realisation-3-time-spent-managing-the-tasks-is-not-spent-doing-thetasks">Realisation #3: Time spent managing the tasks is not spent doing the&nbsp;tasks.</h2>

<p>The best to-do-list is obviously an empty list with no tasks on it remaining to be done. Empty is what we should be striving for.</p>

<p>I get more things done when I spend more time doing the things to be done. I want to spend as little time as possible navigating, organising, and managing my tasks.</p>

<h3 id="trick-7-use-the-keyboard-for-navigation">Trick #7: Use the keyboard for navigation.</h3>

<p>Using a mouse requires squinting at the screen, searching for the pointer, and directing it with precision. After clicking on the compose or reply button, writing an email then requires switching context and placing both hands on the keyboard for textual input. Over the course of a day, quite a bit of time is spent just navigating around and switching context.</p>

<p>Conversely, using the keyboard for navigation relies more on muscle memory and hammering out well worn patterns (open email, delete email, archive email, snooze email, reply-all, send email, etc). In addition, there is no switching cost between the navigation and the writing of an email.</p>

<p>I avoid using the mouse as much as possible. I use <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6594?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en">keyboard shortcuts</a> instead. After a few days of practice (and hitting&nbsp;<code>?</code> for the cheatsheet a lot), I never looked back. I now spend far less time navigating, and thus more time doing.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.lukasvermeer.nl/publications/assets/2020-07-07-gmail-shortcuts.png" alt="A screenshot of Gmail Keyboard shortcuts cheatsheet."></p>

<h3 id="trick-8-dont-use-filters-orfolders">Trick #8: Don’t use filters or&nbsp;folders.</h3>

<p>I used to have filters and folders. Lots and lots of filters and folders. They were only hiding the real problem: I was getting too many emails. More emails than I could ever hope to read. Worse still, I wasn’t even sure why I was even trying just to <em>read</em> them.</p>

<p>If an email requires an action from me, it should go to my inbox so I can prioritise it. If an email does not require an action from me, I should not be getting it.</p>

<p>Do or do not, there is no FYI.</p>

<p>(I realise this trick is probably the most controversial of all the tricks listed in this post. If you very strongly disagree - and you want to explain to my why I am wrong - feel free to <a href="http://lukasvermeer.nl/#contact">send me an email</a>. You can be assured it will go straight to my inbox.)</p>

<h3 id="trick-9-use-labels-as-visualcues">Trick #9: Use labels as visual&nbsp;cues.</h3>

<p>Some tasks are more important than others. I use coloured labels to draw attention to more urgent and important tasks in my inbox.</p>

<p>My labelling scheme is intentionally simplistic. I use labels as temporary indicators, not for permanent organisation or structure. Organisation and structure are only distractions from the ultimate goal of ending up with an empty list anyway. An empty list does not need either.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.lukasvermeer.nl/publications/assets/2020-07-07-gmail-labels-urgent.png" alt="A screenshot of Gmail inbox showing two emails one of which is marked as urgent."></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="realisation-4-i-cannot-do-everything-today">Realisation #4: I cannot do everything today.</h2>

<p>Every morning there are more tasks in my inbox than I can reasonably hope to complete in one day. After denial, anger, bargaining, and depression comes acceptance of the simple fact that effective time management involves deliberately  deciding what <em>not</em> to spend time on.</p>

<h3 id="trick-10-start-the-day-snoozing">Trick #10: Start the day snoozing.</h3>

<p>Every morning I start my day by snoozing everything that I don’t expect to get done that day. This usually takes a few minutes scanning through my inbox. If something new and important comes up later, I immediately reevaluate if another task should now be pushed out to tomorrow. If so, I snooze without delay.</p>

<p>The reality is that I cannot do everything, so I must eventually always choose. Choosing as early as possible ensures that I will have as much time available as possible for the most important tasks. Snoozing as early as possible ensures that less important tasks take up as little of my attention as possible during the day.</p>

<p>When in doubt, I snooze rather than wait or deliberate. Snoozing is a two-way door decision: it is easily reversed. If I happen to finish all my …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>I keep getting more and more powerful laptops, and then offloading more and more processing to the cloud. SOMETHING’S GOTTA GIVE! My local machine doesn’t just run web browsers and chat apps. No, my laptop is still loaded up with dev tools, while all my virtual machines and container clusters now live in the cloud. That helps. But we’re seeing  more and more of the dev tools sneak into the cloud, too.</p>



<p>One of those dev tools is the shell experience. If you’re like me—actually, you’re probably much more advanced than me—you invest in a loaded terminal on your machine. On my Mac, I directly install a few tools (e.g. git, gcloud CLI) but use Homebrew to keep most of my favorite tools close by. </p>

<p>It’s no small effort to maintain a local terminal environment that’s up to date, and authenticated to various endpoints. To make all this easier, each of three hyperscalers now has a “cloud shell” experience that offers developers a hosted, pre-loaded terminal for working with that cloud.</p>



<p><strong>In this blog post, I’m going to look at the cloud shells from AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, and see what they really have to offer.</strong> Specifically, I’m going to assess:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Shell access.</strong> How exactly do you reach and use the shell?</li><li><strong>Shells offered</strong>. Bash? Powershell?</li><li><strong>Amount of storage provided</strong>. How much can you stash in your environment?</li><li><strong>Durability period</strong>. How long does each cloud hold onto your compute environment? Storage?</li><li><strong>Platform integrations</strong>. What ways does the shell integrate with the cloud experience?</li><li><strong>Embedded tools</strong>. What comes pre-loaded in the shell?</li><li><strong>Code editing options</strong>. Is there a way to edit files or build apps?</li><li><strong>Compute environment configuration/extensibility</strong>. Can you change the shell environment temporarily or permanently?</li><li><strong>UX and usability controls</strong>. What can you do to tweak the appearance or behavior?</li></ul>



<p>Let’s take a look.</p>



<p><em>Disclaimer: I work for Google Cloud, so obviously I’ll have some biases. That said, I’ve used AWS for over a decade, was an Azure MVP for years, and can be mostly fair when comparing products and services. Please call out any mistakes I make!</em></p>







<p>GCP offers a Cloud Shell that <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works">runs within a Docker container on a dedicated Google Compute Engine virtual machine</a>. Not that you see any of that. You just see a blinking cursor.</p>



<p>How do you reach that cursor? From within the GCP Console, there’s an ever-present button in the top navigation. Of note, you can also access it via a dedicated link at <a href="https://shell.cloud.google.com/">shell.cloud.google.com</a>.</p>

<p>Once you launch the Cloud Shell—and if it’s the first time, you’ll see a brief message about provisioning your infrastructure—you see a new frame on your screen. Note that this is a globally distributed service, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works#zone_selection">you’re automatically assigned to the closest geographic region</a>. </p>

<p>Each user gets <strong>5GB of persistent storage</strong> that’s mounted into this underlying virtual machine. This <strong>VM terminates after 20 minutes</strong> of inactivity. If you don’t use Cloud Shell at all for 120 days, the home disk goes away too. </p>



<p>You have <strong>two default shell interpreters</strong> (Bash and sh) at your disposal here. Google Cloud Shell lets you create unique sessions via tabs, and see below that I’m using one tab to list all the shells. I was able to switch between shells, including PowerShell too!</p>

<p>Cloud Shell comes with lots of <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works#tools"><strong>pre-loaded tools</strong></a> including gcloud, vim, emacs, gradle, helm, maven, npm, pip, git, docker, MySQL client, TensorFlow, and Terraform. It also has built-in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works#language_support">language support</a> for Java, Go, Python, Node.js, Ruby, PHP, and .NET Core.</p>



<p>If you want tools that aren’t pre-loaded by Google Cloud, you’ve got a few options. You can manually install tools during your session, or, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/configuring-cloud-shell#environment_customization">create a customer_environment script</a> that runs whenever your instance boots up.</p>



<p>What about <strong>platform integrations</strong>? If you call a Google Cloud API that requires credentials, there’s a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/auth">prompt for authorization</a>. There’s also an “<a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/open-in-cloud-shell">Open in Cloud Shell</a>” feature that makes it simple to create links that trigger opinionated Cloud Shell instances. If you’re writing tutorials or want people to try the code in your git repo, you can generate a link. There’s also a baked-in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/using-cloudshell-command">cloudshell CLI</a> to launch tutorials, download files, and more. You can also use the gcloud CLI on your local workstation to tunnel into the Cloud Shell, thanks to the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/cloud-shell">gcloud beta cloud-shell</a> operation.</p>



<p>The Google Cloud Shell also has a full-fledged <strong>code editor built in</strong>. This editor—also available directly via <a href="https://ide.cloud.google.com/">ide.cloud.google.com</a>—gets launched right from the Cloud Shell, either through the button on the Cloud Shell navigation or by invoking the <code>cloudshell edit .</code> command.</p>

<p>This editor is based on Eclipse Theia and has the Cloud Code extensions built in. This means I can create apps, use source control, link to GCP services, run tests, and more. Because Cloud Shell <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/using-web-preview">supports Web Preview</a>, you can also start up web applications and hit a local endpoint.</p>



<p>Let’s look at the overall <strong>user experience</strong>. In the Cloud Shell navigation menu, I have options to send key combinations (e.g. Ctrl+V), change the look and feel (e.g. color, font), upload or download files, run in safe mode, restart the Cloud Shell instance, minimize the frame itself, break it out into its own window, or close the terminal entirely.</p>

<p>With this mix of free storage, a wide set of tools, a fully functional code editor, and easily extendible environments, the Google Cloud Shell feels like a very complete experience.</p>







<p>Azure provides a <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/cloud-shell/">Cloud Shell</a> that runs on a temporary virtual machine. Like with GCP, all the infrastructure details are invisible, and users just get a virtual terminal.</p>



<p>You have a few ways to reach Azure’s Cloud Shell. There’s an always-there button in the Portal and a direct link available at <a href="https://shell.azure.com/">shell.azure.com</a>.</p>

<p>Once you trigger the Cloud Shell, you quickly get a new resizable frame holding your terminal instance.</p>

<p>The compute instance is available at no charge. These instances use a <strong>5GB persistent storage</strong> image in your file share, and it appears that you pay for that. Like the Google Cloud Shell, the Azure one uses non-durable compute nodes that time out after <strong>20 minutes of inactivity</strong>.</p>



<p>You have <strong>two shell experiences</strong>: bash or PowerShell. Storage is shared between each.</p>

<p>The Azure Cloud Shell comes <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/features#tools">absolutely loaded with <strong>tools</strong></a>. You have all the standard Azure tools (Azure CLI, azcopy, etc) along with things like vim, emacs, git, maven, npm, Docker, kubectl, Helm, MySQL client, PostgreSQL client, Cloud Foundry CLI, Terraform, Ansible, Packer, and more. There’s also built-in language support for Go, Ruby. .NET Core, Java, Node.js, PowerShell, and Python. I didn’t see any obvious way to customize the experience that lasts beyond a given session.</p>



<p>As far as <strong>integrations</strong>, it appears there is SSO with Azure Active Directory. There’s also a special PowerShell commandlet for managing Exchange Online. Try to control yourselves. Similar to GCP, the Azure Cloud Shell supports a URL format that lets tutorial creators launch the Cloud Shell from anywhere. Visual Studio Code users can also <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip49.html">integrate the Azure Cloud Shell into their local dev experience</a>.</p>



<p>Azure also provides a handy <strong>code editor</strong> within their Cloud Shell experience. Based on the open source Monaco editor, has a basic file explorer, command palette, and language highlighting.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the <strong>user experience</strong>. In the Cloud Shell navigation bar, you have buttons to restart the shell, configure font style and size, download files, upload files, open the code editor, trigger a local web server, minimize the frame, or shut it down. </p>



<p>All in all, it’s a solid experience. Not as rich as what GCP has, but entirely functional with nice touches like the code editor, and easy switching between bash and PowerShell.</p>







<p>AWS is the newest entrant to the cloud-based terminal with their <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/">AWS CloudShell</a>. AWS seems careful to call the host a “<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/vm-specs.html#vm-configuration">computing environment</a>” versus ever saying “virtual machine.” It’s possible that you get a container in a shared environment.</p>



<p>It looks like you have one way to reach the CloudShell. There’s a button in the AWS Console navigation bar. </p>

<p>There’s no cost for AWS CloudShell and you get <strong>1GB of persistent storage</strong> (also for free). The service is available in a handful of AWS regions (3 in the US, 1 in Ireland, 1 in Tokyo). Sessions expire after 20-30 minutes, and <strong>data is held for 120 days</strong>.</p>



<p>AWS CloudShell has <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/working-with-cloudshell.html#using-shells"><strong>three shell experiences</strong></a> including bash, PowerShell, and z shell. </p>

<p>The AWS CloudShell comes with a handful of useful <strong>pre-loaded tools</strong>. You get the AWS tools (e.g. AWS CLI, AWS SAM), as well as git, make, ssh, and vim. You can modify the default environment by creating a .bashrc script that runs whenever the bash shell fires up. There’s native language support for Node.js and Python. </p>



<p>There’s one <strong>platform integration</strong> I noticed, which helps you <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/tutorial-code-commit.html">push and pull code</a> from AWS CodeCommit. </p>



<p>There are some nice touches in the AWS CloudShell <strong>user experience</strong>. I like that you can stack tabs (session) or put them side by side. You can also download and upload files. AWS also offers settings to change the font size or switch from dark mode to light mode.</p>

<p>AWS offers a functional experience that’s basic, but useful for those living in an AWS world.</p>



<p>It’s great to see all the major clouds offering this functionality. GCP objectively has the most feature-rich experience, but each one is useful. Try them out, and see if they can make your dev environment simpler.</p>

                    <p><em>Car companies are halting production because their vendors can't supply electronic components. Laptops are struggling to meet demand because they don’t have computer chips. Mobile phone companies are having to pay through the roof to source critical parts. And it’s all happening because the world is witnessing an unprecedented semiconductor shortage. So in today’s Finshots, we talk about this and more.</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="the-story">The Story</h3><p>Companies dabbling with semiconductors are in a highly specialized business. They are few and far between and they spend billions of dollars planning for the future.</p><p>As we wrote in one of our articles <a href="https://finshots.in/archive/nvidia-arm-40-billion-deal/">earlier </a>—</p><blockquote>Intel spent close to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-09/how-intel-makes-a-chip" rel="noopener">$8.5 billion</a> in building a fabricator that could produce its flagship E5 chips. These were sophisticated enterprise-level chips and they weren’t easy to produce. The research and development cost $11.5 billion. Mistakes cost extra. And this doesn’t include time commitments. Companies have to plan years in advance to build this kind of capacity and scaling production can be quite a challenging task.</blockquote><p>So you can’t wake up one day and suddenly ramp up supply. It’s almost next to impossible to achieve this kind of scale. And the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) — the largest semiconductor company in the world haven’t been investing aggressively over the past few years. As one article <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/mega-wave-capex-cycle-logic-semiconductor-industry/">notes</a> — <em>“From 2015 to 2019, the capital investment cycle remained conservative across the industry.”</em> It further goes on to add —<em> “Taking a closer look at the semiconductor capital investment trends during the past few years, it becomes clear that under-investment is the root cause of demand-supply imbalance, particularly in logic (non-memory) semiconductor industry.”</em></p><p>And that’s the crux of the problem. We didn’t think we’d need this many semiconductors. Especially the kind we use for computing stuff. The kind that goes on cars, gaming consoles, mobile phones and laptops. And it’s now pushing us to the brink. However, semiconductor companies should have jumped into action last year when it became evident that the supply lines were being stretched thin. They knew it was inevitable. And truth be told, they would have done it if it weren’t for Covid.</p><p>Expanding capacity in the middle of a pandemic isn’t exactly easy. So they were forced to defer plans. And if reports are to be believed, companies are gearing for a massive capacity building exercise this year after having struggled to expand last year. TSMC, for instance, said it would raise nearly $9 billion in a bid to expand in 2021. You’ll likely see other companies follow suit as well. So if all goes well, the problem should be alleviated by the end of 2021.</p><p>However, the current predicament isn’t a result of the supply crunch alone. Companies like Huawei, for instance, have been building semiconductor reserves over the past few years. And the pandemic forced people to spend on sophisticated consumer appliances that further dented supply lines. As an article in Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/chip-shortage-spirals-beyond-cars-to-phones-and-game-consoles">notes </a>—<em> “Industry executives also blame excessive stockpiling, which began over the summer when <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/40978Z:CH" rel="noopener">Huawei Technologies Co.</a> — a major smartphone and networking gear maker — began hoarding components to ensure its survival from crippling U.S. sanctions. Led by Huawei, Chinese imports of chips of all kinds climbed to almost $380 billion in 2020…Rivals including Apple, worried about their own caches, responded in kind. At the same time, the stay-at-home era spurred sales of home appliances from the costliest TVs to the lowliest air purifiers, all of which now come with smart, customized chips.”</em></p><p>Also, the impact of this shortage isn’t uniform across the board. The likes of Apple can negotiate better than small time vendors. Meaning, if you are in an industry that sources a lot of semiconductors then you have better bargaining power, plain and simple. Auto manufacturers unfortunately rely on third party vendors who don't source a lot of semiconductors. At least not on a relative scale. So they've been affected real bad. </p><p>Bottom Line — The semiconductor shortage is pulling multiple industries to its knees and now you know why.</p><p>Until then...</p><p>Share this Finshots on <a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=An%20explainer%20on%20semiconductor%20shortage.%20https://bit.ly/3jFyoi7">WhatsApp</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://bit.ly/3p2dCKB&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=An%20explainer%20on%20semiconductor%20shortage.">Twitter</a>, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https://finshots.in/archive/the-great-semiconductor-shortage">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>The design and implementation of programming languages fascinates me. A programming language enables a text file to both accurately communicate to another person a problem’s solution and control a computer’s execution. The influence a language’s feature set has on the way a programmer thinks about problems and their solutions is an endlessly captivating idea. The world of programming languages is amazing.</p>

<p>I’m particularly interested in implementing higher-level languages in lower-level languages. I think I was attracted to Math in school because the construction of new ideas based on a small set of axioms seems like good, clear thinking. Building up to a high-level programming language from below has the same appeal for me.</p>

<p>This article <em>may</em> be the first of many recording the scratching of an itch that apparently needs scratching. I cannot seem to ignore it even if I try. A book on Scheme or implementing interpreters or compilers always seems to find its way into my hands. I want to implement Scheme from Scratch: an interpreter, a compiler, a JIT, etc. I want to see how it all happens. If you do too then you may enjoy following along.</p>


<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>This exploration is not for novice programmers. It is a tutorial introduction for novice language implementor and enthusiasts from the perspective of a novice language implementor and enthusiast.</p>

<p>You have experience programming on a UNIX or UNIX-like system. Any of Linux, BSD, or Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X is fine. You have used common developer tools like <code>gcc</code> and <code>make</code>. Your copy of <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/cbook/">K&amp;R&nbsp;2e</a> is a little dog eared but cherished. You might even have a copy of <a href="http://www.apuebook.com/">APUE&nbsp;2e</a>.</p>

<p>You have some prior exposure to Intel&nbsp;386 Assembly language. You don’t need to be an Assembly master. Just some general knowledge about registers, the stack and heap, and some basic instructions. Jeff&nbsp;Duntemann’s <a href="http://www.duntemann.com/assembly.htm">Assembly&nbsp;Language Step&nbsp;By&nbsp;Step</a><a>, now in its third edition, is a light and enjoyable introduction providing a sufficient level of Assembly knowledge.</a></p><p><a>If someone even mentions </a><a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a>, your head fills with thoughts of master magicians casting alluring spells. SICP&nbsp;2e has spent a lot of time on your bedside table and you’ve done many of the exercises when you really should have been doing other things (like I should be doing now.) SICP showed you the implementation of Scheme <em>in</em> Scheme. This chicken and egg paradox bothers you and you wonder <strong>“How do I implement Scheme from Scratch?”</strong></p>


<h2>“Scheme”</h2>

<p>There are many versions of “Scheme”. <a href="http://library.readscheme.org/page1.html">The Original Lambda Papers</a> show various ancestors. I’ve seen threads mentioned in those papers. SICP implements several versions of Scheme. The main language used in SICP doesn’t have macros. SICP shows the implementation of a lazy Scheme. There is the official <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/std_public/description/busarch/1178-1990_desc.html">IEEE Scheme standard</a> and the <i>de facto</i> RnRS standards: <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.39.1890">R4RS</a>, <a href="http://schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/">R5RS</a>, <a href="http://www.r6rs.org/">R6RS</a>.</p>

<p>It isn’t totally clear what makes a Scheme “Scheme”. I’m not going to worry too much about exactly what a language must have to be enough of a Scheme to earn the name. I know it needs at least s-expressions; garbage collection; symbols; first-class, lexically scoped procedures; and proper tail calls.</p>


<h2>“from Scratch”</h2>

<p>What does it mean to implement “from Scratch”? Upon what foundation will we build Scheme? Do we have a working physical computer, an operating system, an assembler, a linker, a C compiler, a Scheme interpreter or compiler, another high-level language?</p>

<p>At least to me, “from Scratch” implies building up towards Scheme from some lower-level. If a system already has another high-level language then, philosophically, why not just write programs in that language? We could, after all. So implementing Scheme with the assistance of another high-level language is out.</p>

<p>Does the system already have Scheme? No. If it did, we’d use it and you wouldn’t need to implement Scheme. (Or if the system does have Scheme, at least we’d pretend it didn’t so we could enjoy implementing it ourselves.)</p>

<p>I will assume we have working computer with a 32&nbsp;bit Intel&nbsp;386-style processor, UNIX-like operating system with an assembler and linker. These are all very interesting low-level details but building up towards a Scheme system from a level where one of these is missing is out of scope for this discussion.</p>

<p>Perhaps the grey area is whether or not the system has a C compiler or not and if we want to use that to build up to Scheme. All UNIX-like systems have a C compiler. The operating system and tools are probably written mostly in C. Many high-level languages, like Scheme, are implemented in C. Working in C is definitely working at a lower-level then working in Scheme. A testament to the low-level of C is that C is often referred to as “portable Assembly”. Given these things we can take a C compiler, <code>gcc</code>, as one of our available tools.</p>


<h2>Scheme from Scratch Implementations</h2>

<p>There are many possible ways to implement Scheme from Scratch:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Bootstrap Scheme</dt>
	<dd>A quick and <em>dirty</em> Scheme interpreter implemented in C. This should be less than 1000 lines to implement. Not many features and slow execution but enough of an interpreter to bootstrap us into the world of Scheme.</dd>

	<dt>Compiling Scheme</dt>
	<dd>A Scheme to i386 Assembly compiler written in Scheme. First executed with Bootstrap Scheme but later self compiling. See <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~aghuloum/">An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction</a>.</dd>

	<dt>Compile-to-C Scheme</dt>
	<dd>A Scheme to C compiler written in Scheme. Provides great portability because C is the intermediate language on the way to machine code.</dd>
  
	<dt>Byte Code VM Scheme</dt>
	<dd>An embeddable Scheme virtual machine based on a byte-code compiler and interpreter. Written in ANSI C and very portable. See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chibi-scheme/">Chibi Scheme</a>, for example.</dd>

	<dt>JIT Engine Scheme</dt>
	<dd>An embeddable Scheme engine based on a just-in-time compiler for i386 and with   sophisticated garbage collection. I’m not sure if this will be written in C or Compiling Scheme.</dd>

	<dt>Platform Scheme</dt>
	<dd>Compile Scheme to target a platform like <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/hotspot/index.jsp">JVM</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ddk909ch.aspx">.NET’s&nbsp;CLR</a>, <a href="http://www.parrot.org/">Parrot</a>, or <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a>. By targeting an existing platform, a lot of education and fun would be missed. It certainly wouldn’t count as “from Scratch”. It is necessary to write the target platform also.</dd>

</dl>

<p>You can see that it is a big itch. I don’t know how long it will take to scratch or what will come of it all but will surely be fun implementing Scheme from Scratch.</p>

 <li>It only takes four days to produce and can carry payloads of upto 100 kilos into lower earth orbit (LEO).</li>
 <li>While the first company to be successful in such an endeavour, there are others who are fast catching up and realise the value of 3D printed engines versus conventional assembly.</li>
</ul><p>Rocket engines are tough to build, and they’re even tougher to 3D print because all the details have to be ‘just right’ for the rocket to work successfully. But, an Indian space startup based out of Chennai has pulled off this mammothian task. 
</p><p>
Agnikul Cosmos has successfully fired its higher stage semi-cryogenic rocket engine called Agnilet. “This entire engine, Agnilet, is just one piece of hardware from start to finish and has zero assembled parts,” said co-founder and CEO Srinath Ravichandran.
</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S1GVGbn4-U4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
 

<p>Normally, rocket engines have 100s of different parts that have to be built individually. This includes things like injectors which inject fuel into the engine, cooling channels that ensure the engine doesn’t overheat and the igniter which actually kindles propellants to push the rocket off the ground.
</p>
<p>Agnilet, on the other hand, is a three-in-one solution. It takes all three of these modules and puts them into a single piece of hardware. There is no complex assembly and the turnaround time for the entire setup is less than four days. 
</p><p>    
The rocket engine is capable of carrying upto 100 kilos to low earth orbit (LEO), which is around 700 kilometers above the Earth’s surface. That’s only a fraction of what the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) is capable of and possibly only enough to carry a single satellite at most.
</p><p>

<strong>Agnikul may be the first to be successful, but it’s not alone<br></strong>Agnikul was the first Indian space startup to enter into a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with the Department of Space (DoS) under the newly established Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe).

<p>Another space startup that’s hot its heels is Hyderabad-based Skyroot Aerospace founded by former Indian Space Research Organisation (</p><keyword keytype="UnKnown" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="ISRO" keynameseo="isro" actualkeyword="isro">ISRO</keyword><p>) scientists Pawan Kumar Chandana and Naga Bharath Daka. In September last year, they too revealed their fully 3D printer cryogenic rocket engine dubbed Dhawan-I. 
</p><p>
    Dhawan-I will be used to power the Vikram-II rocket, which Skyroot is also building from scratch. 
</p><p>The startup entered an NDA with the DoS earlier this month on February 2. They will be able to use ISRO’s test and launch facilities to test their Vikram-I rocket and eventually Dhawan-I as well. 
</p><p>
    The global space industry is expected to generate $1.1 trillion or more by 2040, according to 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/investing-in-space" rel="nofollow">Morgan Stanley</a> — more than triple its current value of $350 billion. And, new space engine technology like 3D printed rocket engines are expected to play a big role in this explosion of value.
</p><p>
But even international players like Elon Musk’s SpaceX, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), 
<a target="_blank" href="https://3dprint.com/278184/startup-accelerator-ursa-major-is-3d-printing-rocket-engines-to-grow-space-economy/" rel="nofollow">Ursa Major</a> and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin are only 3D printing components for rocket engines. This means that putting together these engines and making sure they work is still a fairly complicated task. 
</p><p>The only US-based startup close to producing a fully 3D printed rocket engine is 
<a target="_blank" href="https://manufactur3dmag.com/firehawk-aerospace-raises-2-million-for-3d-printed-rocket-engines/" rel="nofollow">Firehawk Aerospace</a>, and they only just raised the $2 million needed to start on their project.

        <article>
            <p>Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/27/21402744/apple-idfa-facebook-fight-ads-advertising">announced last summer</a> that they will soon require users to opt in before apps can get the infamous “IDFA” tracking identifier for that user. While this was controversial in the ad tech sphere, most mobile apps can get by without this identifier.</p>

<p>However, most mobile app teams do collect analytics to help make product decisions. What features inspire free users to convert to paid users? Why do we think our trial is converting poorly? Do we still need to support iOS 12? A lot of apps use free SDKs to collect and analyze this kind of data.</p>

<p>The most popular analytics SDKs are free because they’re owned by companies that sell ads, or share data with those companies: Google Analytics, Flurry, and Google’s Firebase. Paid competitors like Mixpanel and Amplitude can be really powerful, but often cost thousands of dollars a year or more.</p>

<p>Now, I can’t find this said explicitly anywhere. But it <em>seems</em> like, along with the incoming restrictions on IDFA and ad attribution, Apple is also enacting a de-facto ban on these free analytics SDKs. The setup looks like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Since December, App Store Connect’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/#user-tracking">App Privacy submission process</a> has required developers to indicate if they have “3rd Party Tracking”. Developers are told to do this if they’re including an SDK from a company that hosts ads or shares data with advertisers across apps.</li>
  <li>In the coming weeks, iOS 14.5 will <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">require apps that engage in “3rd Party Tracking” to ask explicit permission</a>, which most users will opt out of.</li>
  <li>App Review will soon start rejecting apps that are not following the opt in provisions. They’ll likely do this by comparing the app’s App Privacy metadata to the use of the new opt-in APIs, as well as scanning apps for the presence of certain SDKs.</li>
  <li>Therefore, it seems, <strong>iOS apps currently using the Google Analytics, Flurry, and Firebase SDKs may need to migrate off of them promptly</strong> and instead use an analytics tool not owned by a company that displays ads. Popular choices include Mixpanel, Amplitude, or a self-managed analytics tool.</li>
</ol>

<p>These new rules could be a big hurdle for some developers, especially if they currently rely on other SDKs that do 3rd party tracking or attribution, such as Facebook’s.</p>

<h2 id="do-we-really-have-to">Do we really have to?</h2>

<p>The challenging thing for developers evaluating all this is that many of the points above have not been said so explicitly by Apple. Apple has instead outlined a series of rules, each rule being worded somewhat differently between the App Privacy documentation and the App Tracking Transparency documentation. A generous reading makes it seem like you maybe <em>could</em> comply with the rules and still use some of these SDKs. Maybe.</p>

<p>Apple did not – and from a legal perspective likely can’t – explicitly ban the Google Analytics, Flurry, Facebook, and Firebase SDKs. Their wording leaves some wiggle room. It seems like it <em>could</em> be possible to use them. It seems even more possible that Facebook and Google could make them usable. However, this puts developers in the situation of evaluating the changing documentation, complex privacy policies, and large settings panels that these tools offer, trying to judge whether a given setup of a given SDK would now pass muster from Apple’s perspective.</p>

<p>For example, in App Store Connect – where developers indicate if they have Third Party Tracking – Apple asks if your app is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sharing data with entities who display third-party ads.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems maybe impossible for a Google-owned analytics SDK to not trigger this provision. In contrast, the AppTrackingTransparency documentation asks whether you are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Placing a third-party SDK in your app that combines user data from your app with user data from other developers’ apps to target advertising or measure advertising efficiency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does it matter if the SDK combines user data <em>in general</em>, or is it sufficient if you’ve been assured that your app’s user data <em>in particular</em> won’t be combined by the SDK? The logical complexities and differences in wording raise questions that, unfortunately, developers need to make assumptions about until we hear something from Apple, or we hear through the grapevine how App Review actually enforces these rules. In particular we need to make three guesses:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Will you be allowed to indicate your app has 3rd Party Tracking, not implement the opt-in dialog, but still get App Review to approve you as long as you believe you’re not required to do opt-in based on your evaluation of the SDK, its settings, and the exact wording in the AppTrackingTransparency documentation? <strong>Our guess is no. It seems likely that Apple will expect that all 3rd Party Tracking requires the opt-in dialog.</strong></li>
  <li>Will you be allowed to include an SDK that App Review considers a “3rd Party Tracking SDK”, but not indicate 3rd Party Tracking in your App Privacy data as long as you believe you’re not required to based on your evaluation of the SDK, its settings, and the exact wording of the App Privacy documentation? <strong>Our guess is no. It seems like Apple will probably consider any use of the Facebook and Google SDKs to be 3rd Party Tracking.</strong></li>
  <li>Is it safe to continue using – or migrate to – 3rd party product analytics tools like MixPanel and Amplitude that are not owned by advertising companies? <strong>Our guess is yes. These rules seem squarely aimed at companies involved in advertising.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>If one of the above assumptions is wrong – for example, maybe these SDKs <em>can</em> be configured to behave sufficiently privately, and App Review can be convinced that this has been done for your app – then that would be really  useful to know. If anybody has more information on what Apple will or won’t be allowing, or even conflicting hunches, <a href="https://twitter.com/apike">let me know</a>.</p>

<h2 id="does-our-sdk-require-app-tracking-transparency-uh-well">Does our SDK require App Tracking Transparency? Uh… well…</h2>

<p><a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/app-store-data-collection#firebase_user_agent">Firebase</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10285841">Google Analytics</a>, and <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2021/01/19/facebook-login-updates-new-limited-data-mode/">Facebook</a> have been releasing updates and documentation to help developers navigate Apple’s questions, but conspiciously they don’t directly answer them. Instead they answer different, related questions that are maybe helpful but are certainly not decisive.</p>

<p>Contrast that to paid analytics tools that don’t share data with ad companies. MixPanel, for example, <a href="https://community.mixpanel.com/announcements-6/idfa-changes-on-ios-14-4442">posted clearly 6 months ago</a> that they believe they’re compliant with Apple’s rules:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You need to specify what data is used to track someone across external apps and websites, which in our case is none. We only allow customers to track data they own; data sent to Mixpanel is not used by any other external companies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, Flurry – whose business model apparently <em>is</em> to share data with advertisers – <a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/flurry/docs/analytics/gettingstarted/ios14/att/">has also claimed its SDK doesn’t trigger the App Tracking Transparency rules</a>. This seems dubious, but is interesting if so.</p>

<p>However, if the above rules and assumptions are correct, any apps that don’t both purge these SDKs and set their App Privacy to say they no longer have 3rd Party Tracking – or only use the SDKs for the small percentage of users who opt in – will soon face rejection. Meanwhile, even besides these restrictions, there are some substantial benefits to using premium analytics services like Mixpanel.</p>

<p>Our advice for now, then, is that <strong>all iOS apps should be prepared to migrate off of the Google Analytics, Firebase, Facebook, and Flurry SDKs, potentially on very short notice</strong>. If you were already on the fence, now is probably a good time to make the move. A <em>lot</em> of apps might be making changes in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Hold on to your butts.</p>

<p><em>Updates, February 11:</em></p>

<p>A number of developers have gotten in touch to share their guesses about how App Review will handle this in the coming weeks – thanks folks! Some common themes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Many developers assume Apple will only be using App Review to enforce opt-in for the IDFA identifier, and will not start rejecting apps for using SDKs that go against their <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">new rules prohibiting things like combining data and using fingerprinting</a>, as long as developers assert their SDKs are following the rules. This is plausible. If Apple goes this route though, developers are left with the ongoing risk of a surprise rejection, when App Review later cracks down on a specific SDK that’s played loose with the rules.</li>
  <li>Flurry <a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/preparing-for-ios-14/">posted back in July 2020 that it intends to comply with Apple’s requirements</a> so as not to require opt-in. In particular, they’ve explicitly said “Flurry will respect Apple’s policy requirement to not combine data across apps and websites owned by other companies.” It’s not clear how Apple would verify this is true, and this is surprising given Flurry’s business model, but it seems like a clear statement that Flurry intends to comply.</li>
  <li>A couple folks has asked if embedding code from YouTube – which certainly does ad targeting with its data – would violate Apple’s privacy rules. By the letter of the policy, this seems possible.</li>
</ol>

<p>None of the doctors ever told me my Dad was dying. Not the surgeon at Maine Med who first went in to do the biopsy of the lung. Not the surgeon at Mass General who did the biopsy of a lymph node. Not the oncologist at Maine Cancer Care the first few chemo treatments, which were also the only ones I could attend thanks to COVID. None of them.</p>



<p>But they didn’t have to. Mesothelioma is hard to Google, because the search results are heavily polluted by law firms in search of riches from ignorant or irresponsible manufacturers, but you can get the gist. And the gist is that it’s not good.</p>



<p>Mesothelioma is a malignant tumor that is caused by inhaling asbestos fibers. How my father, who spent his career on Wall Street theoretically well removed from the material that used to be common in building materials, firefighting gear and the like ended up with these fibers in his lung is an open question. We’ll never know for sure, but the evidence strongly suggests that it’s a consequence of my father going back to work downtown shortly after the 9/11 attacks. Per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos#11_September_2001_attacks">WikiPedia</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>As New York City’s World Trade Center collapsed following the September 11 attacks, Lower Manhattan was blanketed in a mixture of building debris and combustible materials. This complex mixture gave rise to the concern that thousands of residents and workers in the area would be exposed to known hazards in the air and in the dust, such as asbestos, lead, glass fibers, and pulverized concrete. More than 1,000 tons of asbestos are thought to have been released into the air following the buildings’ destruction.</p></blockquote>



<p>As an aside, before someone mentions the 9/11 victims fund, he was aware of it. Given the limited pool of funds, however, this was a non-starter for him because he would never have been willing to take money away from the first responders or their families. </p>



<p>Anyway, my father’s commute for four decades had him walk off the Path trains into the Trade Center en route to the Exchange every day. I know this because I did it with him one summer. He was fortunate enough to be on vacation up here in Maine not just for the attempted bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 but for 9/11 as well. It would be as tragic as it would be ironic if he survived the attack in 2001 by not being there but the air he breathed when he returned to work ended up killing him twenty years later.</p>



<p>Pragmatist that he was, however, he’d have taken that trade.</p>



<p>It’s a similar trade, in fact, to the one he took when he was first diagnosed with cancer while at Harvard Business School in the early seventies. Cancer treatments were a little less sophisticated all those years ago, and to attack the cancer that he had the doctors irradiated large swaths of his body. Today, they can apparently target areas smaller than a dime. He was told that he had an 8% chance of dying within six weeks, and a 92% chance of living out most of the rest of a normal lifespan – albeit with some side effects.</p>



<p>Side effects that he accepted without complaint. His immune system went haywire, for one, and he developed allergies, the worst of which was poison ivy. If that so much as touched him, it was in his blood stream and off to the races. My childhood memories are always a little hazy, but I remember that. The side effects changed his hair color and density, and it left him permanently immuno-compromised. It’s weird when you’re a kid and your Dad’s mustache randomly grows in bright red.</p>



<p>Not that any of that mattered much: I don’t remember him missing a single day of work, ever.</p>



<p>For fifty years, the deal that he’d accepted was a good deal. Despite a few scares along the way, the cancer never came back until he noticed being short of breath and developed a chronic cough two years ago. Never one to visit a doctor unnecessarily, and probably for good reason given his history, he nevertheless went and ended up on the track that led to the diagnosis and the year that was 2020.</p>

<p>Christmas 2019 was a sad affair. My Dad had been diagnosed merely days before, and his weight loss left him gaunt and weary. When shown pictures of the dinner later, he replied with typical bleak humor, “shit, I look dead.” Still, we tried to take an optimistic tack with 2020. If there’s one thing I’ve learned about cancer today, it’s that your primary goal if they can’t cure you immediately is to buy time, because they might be able to in future.</p>



<p>So that is what my Dad set out to do. Always goal oriented, his assessment was that based on trajectory at the time, he was unlikely to make it until the Fourth of July. Thus his goal was to make it beyond that date. To that end, he promised his oncologist one thing: that as long as they would agree to treat him, he would show up. At times, this meant employing some gamesmanship, no stranger to the lifelong athlete. As he continued to bleed weight he couldn’t afford to lose, he slyly wore heavier and heavier shoes to his weigh-in’s so they wouldn’t remove him from treatment.</p>



<p>So intent was he on continuing treatment, in fact, that he literally broke himself out of the hospital to get the toxic substance injected into his body. He’d fallen and shattered his femur – in retrospect, likely due to the fact that his heart had begun to stop unpredictably due either to a bad valve, arrhythmia’s or both. </p>



<p>All in all in 2020, he dealt with the cancer, a bad valve in his heart, a congenital heart murmur gone rogue, five surgeries, and the broken leg. To add insult to injury, his access to the thing that made him most happy – his grandchildren, and to a lesser extent his children – was drawn down to a trickle thanks to the pandemic.</p>



<p>Insult, injury or otherwise, he fought to the last. Every time he seemed to take a hard won step forward, some new fresh hell would drop him back ten steps, or even twenty. But he was a fighter, and every time he got knocked down, he picked himself up off the mat and waded back in.</p>



<p>He died as a fighter, Monday morning. And despite the terminal prognosis, the cancer never won. His body may have ultimately failed him, but his spirit never did. It was his heart, or maybe his brain, it’s not clear which, that killed him. Not the cancer. </p>

<p>That terrible endurance was something I never wanted to learn from my Dad, but I did. He taught me many other things, some of which I wrote down in an admittedly <a href="http://thisistheway.us/">lengthy letter</a> to my then unborn daughter. Here are ten that I’ve thought about this week.</p>



<h2>Have Priorities</h2>



<p>My Dad grew up with very little. What wealth his family on one side had had at one point had largely petered out, and while his father always worked, you don’t become a minister for the money. Still, the family prioritized education, and so he went to Williams like his father and brother before him, and from there it was on to Harvard Business School. That provided him with access to jobs that featured, let’s just call it, high income potential. For the first time in his life, he had money. And but for his kids, that could have been his life.</p>



<p>Instead, he eventually came to a fork in the road. Down one path lay wealth and comfort; the other was precarious, stressful self-employment as an independent floor broker – the upside of which was predictable hours that allowed him to get home in time to coach my brother and I, first in soccer, later adding lacrosse in the spring.</p>



<p>Every family has different choices to make, and I can’t imagine the financial stress both of my parents bore. But I think I can speak for my brother when I say that I’m glad he chose us.</p>



<h2>You Do What You Have To</h2>



<p>When my Dad enlisted in the army, he and my mother were dirt poor and living in a trailer in Georgia. Every dollar, therefore, was precious. As a semi-related aside, if you get the chance, ask my Mom what it was like to work at a K-Mart in the deep south with a wicked Boston accent.</p>



<p>Anyway, after finding out that paratroopers got an extra pittance per month, my Dad signed up for jump school. The only problem with this transaction was that my Dad was terrified of heights. Every morning he had to jump, then, he’d get up and vomit because he was scared. But dollars were precious, so he got his wings.</p>



<p>Later, in business school, he had to go in regularly to get blasted with high doses of radiation. This had the intended effect of killing off the cancer and the unintended effect of giving him nearly full time nausea. He didn’t intend to miss class, however, so he merely requested a seat on the aisle so he could get to the bathroom quickly. All professors but one complied; the hold out required an appeal to the dean. He had no such impediments while competing in tennis tournaments during treatment, however; he’d merely vomit in between sets.</p>



<p>My Dad never really sat us down to talk about working through fear, sickness or injury. We just watched him.</p>



<h2>Be Yourself</h2>



<p>All the years my Dad worked on the various exchanges, he dressed – in general – as comfortably as the dress code permitted. He had nice suits and ties when they were needed, but his normal uniform was LL Bean chinos, a plain white shirt, his trading jacket and one of a couple of ties kept in his desk. That was who he was. My Dad paid no more attention to NYC fashion then he did to bars after work or coke in the bathrooms. His worst vice was coke, the soda.</p>



<p>It never occurred to me that this was in some way different or unique until I moved to New York City after college. Some friends had Armani suits and Gucci loafers. I was much more likely to be the one who kept us from getting into a bar because I was dressed like a 1930’s rail-riding hobo.</p>



<p>Like my Dad, for better or for worse, I knew who I was, and I never worried too much about what everyone else was up to.</p>



<h2>Let Your Kids Be Who They Are</h2>



<p>My Dad was an athlete all his life, and a very good one. Great, even. My brother and I grew up on stories of his freak athleticism, how he started on his college …</p></div></div>

February 9, 2021 | https://www.wilburlabs.com/blueprints/how-to-get-startup-ideas | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.wilburlabs.com/blueprints/how-to-get-startup-ideas">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Startups and technology canâ€™t solve <em>all</em> the worldâ€™s problems, but they can solve a good amount of them. Now more than ever, we need people to build the next generation of companies that will tackle some of the worldâ€™s biggest problems. There are a lot of unknowns right now, but at Wilbur Labs, we believe this is the best time to start a company â€“ ever. </p><p>Wilbur Labs is a startup studio turning bold ideas into market-leading companies. Since 2016 we have built and invested in 15 technology companies, including <a href="https://www.vacationrenter.com/">VacationRenter</a>, <a href="https://www.vitabox.com/">Vitabox</a>, <a href="https://www.joblist.com/">Joblist</a>, <a href="https://www.barkbus.com/">Barkbus</a>, and more.</p><p>We plan to launch several companies every year, which requires building a solid pipeline of ambitious ideas. Over the years, we have used three primary approaches to get startup ideas: build for the future, solve existing problems better, or solve personal problems.</p></div><h2>1. Build for the Future</h2><div><div><p>The future is not static. It is built by people who have a vision for what the future should look like, and those who have the willingness to work hard and take the risks necessary to get there. A great way to get startup ideas is to sit down and think about what the future should look like. Ask yourself the following questions: </p><p><em>How are behaviors changing? Which changes will stick? </em><br><em>What long-term problems have been created as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic? </em><br><em>What priorities and values have changed?</em><br><em>What are the biggest problems today?</em><br><em>What will be the biggest problems tomorrow?</em><br><em>What new problems can technology solve today?</em><br><em>How can new technology change the way existing problems are solved?</em></p></div><p>2020 is a year that consumer behaviors are changing and evolving at a faster rate than ever before. Emerging trends that would have taken 5 to 10 years to mature are instead maturing overnight. There is a large opportunity to think about changing trends and build companies ahead of the curve. eCommerce, Employment, Insurance, and Mobile On-Demand are just a few industries where we are boosting investments as a result of new long-term trends.</p><p>When thinking about the future, itâ€™s important to think and plan for the long-term. The best ideas can be built into big, sustainable businesses that can solve problems and create value over the long-term. Avoid short-termism, also known as ideas which may seem solid in the short-term but have a short expiration date.</p><p>Barkbus is a great example of a business that is building for the future. Back in 2017, the world was rapidly transitioning to direct-to-your-door services. Despite that, the way most people got their dogs groomed hadnâ€™t changed. Pet parents still went to the salon, which was a time consuming and stressful experience for both dogs and their parents. Barkbus launched to <a href="https://www.wilburlabs.com/announcements/why-we-acquired-barkbus">make mobile grooming the new norm</a> for pet parents and their dogs. </p></div><h2>2. Solve Existing Problems Better</h2><div><p>We believe the best companies solve real problems. These problems may be completely new problems, or they may be existing problems that have not been solved well by existing companies to date.</p><p>Do not discount existing problems when generating startup ideas. Some of the largest, most impactful companies throughout history were built by solving existing problems better than others. Google did not invent the search engine, search ads, web based email, or maps. Apple did not invent the smartphone, the tablet, or the smart watch. Facebook did not invent social networking. The list goes on and on. What these companies did is provide a better experience than the existing companies. At Wilbur Labs, we refer to this as â€œcreating a 10x experience.â€� </p><p>Next time you have an idea and someone says, â€œdoesnâ€™t X do that?â€� â€” instead of throwing away your idea, first decide if thereâ€™s an opportunity to 10x the experience. Competitors are a good sign as it means there is a real problem people care about. Challenging the status quo is a great way to solve big problems and build a large business. </p><p>When we built Joblist, we did so because despite multiple large job boards, the job search process hasnâ€™t changed in 20 years â€” when job listings first moved online. We saw an opportunity to 10x the job search experience by introducing more personalization and collaboration tools to a traditionally generic and lonely process. Job seekers have embraced this new approach, which allowed Joblist to help millions of job seekers by powering over 500,000 new applications <a href="https://www.joblist.com/news/why-we-launched-joblist">before their public launch</a>.</p></div><h2>3. Solve Personal Problems</h2><div><div><p>Many of the best startup ideas are personal problems that you have faced. What are the biggest problems that you wish were solved? How many others face the same problem? If you experience a problem, then you are uniquely positioned to solve it.</p><p>More often than not, entrepreneurship is not a way to get rich quickly. You will likely need to work harder and longer, with higher stress and more at stake than working a regular job. The journey is absolutely worth it for the right person, but itâ€™s important that you care enough about what you are working on enough to dedicate 5 to 10 years of your life. This will be easier if you care deeply about the problem you are solving.</p></div>
<p>A great example of this is why we launched VacationRenter. At Wilbur Labs, we had quarterly company offsites where we book a vacation rental to work for a few days in a different city. Every time we searched for a rental, it took hours of planning and work. We found ourselves scrolling through pages of search results and jumping from site to site, trying to find the ideal place for the best price. This was a frustrating experience and we knew we could make the search for a vacation rental better for others like us â€” which is why <a href="https://www.vacationrenter.com/news/why-we-launched-vacationrenter">we launched VacationRenter</a>. If you experience a problem, it is likely that others are experiencing it too. </p>
<p>VacationRenter became the fastest growing travel startup ever, generating over $1 billion gross bookings in 2020. This milestone confirms that we werenâ€™t the only travelers who had a frustrating experience finding the perfect rental.</p></div><h2>Next Steps</h2><div><p>At Wilbur Labs, the best startup ideas check a few key boxes:</p><ul><li><strong>Solves a problem.</strong> Could your idea solve a big problem, and have a large positive impact on a significant number of people?</li><li><strong>Builds a sustainable business. </strong>Can the idea be turned into a sustainable business that creates value over the long-term?</li><li><strong>Uniquely positioned.</strong> Are you uniquely positioned to solve the problem and you want to dedicate 5 to 10 years of your life?</li></ul></div><figure><img alt="best-startup-ideas-venn-diagram" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/wl-blog/images/ideas-venn-diagram.png"></figure><div><p>No matter how good an idea is, we believe that ideas alone are worthless unless you take initiative to execute. Execution is everything. Everyone has big ideas â€” no startup ideas are truly unique. Being able to execute on those ideas is what will turn that idea into a business.</p><p>For any idea, the most important next step is thorough research where you pair your initial idea with independent and external information.

          <p><small>Posted by Matthew Wild on February 9 2021</small></p><p><em>There is a significant difference between developing and promoting a
protocol (such as XMPP) and a product (such as Signal). Both approaches
have their advantages and disadvantages. This post details how and why
Snikket aims to strike a balance between the two.</em></p>
<h2 id="products-vs-protocols">Products vs Protocols</h2>
<p>This past weekend I gave a talk at the (virtual) FOSDEM conference about
a topic I’ve been thinking about a lot the past few years - the differences
between developing a product and developing a protocol.</p>
<p>You can watch the talk <a href="https://peertube.thepacket.exchange/videos/watch/96e35d83-e70c-4a87-868b-f9cbeb48e1d0">here</a>, but there were many things I
wanted to touch upon that wouldn’t fit into the 20 minute slot. This post
will cover the same topics, but expands on some of the points I
discussed.</p>
<h2 id="previously-in-open-protocols">Previously, in open protocols…</h2>
<p>I’ve been involved with <a href="https://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a> (once known as Jabber) for over 15
years. It is now over 20 years since XMPP’s inception, and over this
time XMPP, along with the rest of the tech industry, has seen significant
change.</p>
<p>XMPP began life in the late 1990s, as an attempt to break into the
messaging silos of that era. The names and logos may have been different,
but it was a very similar landscape to today - oversized tech companies
fighting each other for control over people who simply want to use the
internet for what it was designed, communicating with one another.</p>
<p>Email got lucky. A standard protocol managed to break down the walls of
even the final fortress of resistance, AOL. This was achieved largely
because the adoption of standard protocols by smaller providers allowed
them to form a network together that began to threaten even America’s
largest ISP.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we never quite reached that point with instant messaging.
However that hasn’t stopped many of us from continuing to strive for a
similar outcome even as our symbol of hope, the open email network, is
under threat today more than ever before.</p>
<p>Despite numerous projects, communities and organizations campaigning for
decades in favour of open messaging systems, the space is still
dominated by large silos. The largest the world has ever known. WhatsApp
alone has over <em>2 billion</em> users. That means a significant portion of
the world’s communications are flowing through a single company. A
company that has a simple business model - amassing data about people
and leveraging that data to help their actual customers (other
businesses) influence the beliefs, biases and behaviour of the users of
their platforms.</p>
<h2 id="the-slippery-slope">The slippery slope</h2>
<p>Despite the dizzying numbers associated with WhatsApp today, it had more
humble beginnings. Founded by two ex-Yahoo employees, Brian Acton and
Jan Koum, it began as a simple messaging app for iPhones. The server was
originally based on an <a href="https://www.process-one.net/blog/whatsapp-facebook-erlang-and-realtime-messaging-it-all-started-with-ejabberd/">open-source XMPP server</a>, and
used the XMPP protocol. However the goal of WhatsApp was not openness
and federation, and they soon diverged far from standard XMPP.</p>
<p>As WhatsApp grew, early users may recall that they also began charging a
small fee for accounts ($1/year). Their reasoning was simple:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>â€œRemember, when advertising is involved <strong>you the user</strong>
    are the product.</p>
    <p>Your data isn't even in the picture. We are simply not interested in any of it.</p>
    <p>When people ask us why we charge for WhatsApp,
    we say â€˜Have you considered the alternative?â€™â€œ</p>
    <p><a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/why-we-don-t-sell-ads">
         <strong>WhatsApp blog post â€œWhy we don't sell adsâ€œ, June 2012</strong>
       </a>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, just two years later it was announced that WhatsApp had
been acquired by the internet’s fastest-growing advertising platform,
Facebook.</p>
<p>Despite declaring to the EU competition commission that linking an
individual’s data between WhatsApp and Facebook was not technically
feasible this is exactly what they went on to do, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/18/facebook-fined-eu-whatsapp-european-commission">leading to a â‚¬94
million fine</a>. Little by little, Facebook has been
loosening their privacy policies to allow them to absorb WhatsApp data
into their daily operations.</p>
<p>So when, in early 2021, the latest update to the privacy policy gave users
of the platform a clear ultimatum to allow this sharing or close their
account, many users wisely began to seek alternatives. Finally, the
moment we had been waiting for had arrived.</p>
<p>Many of us advocates of open communications seized the opportunity, and
recommendations were soon flying around for the wide range of alternative
messaging systems we’ve been building these past years. “Use XMPP!”,
“Use Matrix!”, “Use Signal!”, to name a few.</p>
<p>Despite a marked increase of signups on XMPP and Matrix servers, of
these three it was Signal that won by far the largest share of new users.
Millions of people flocked from WhatsApp and overloaded Signal’s servers,
resulting in disrupted message delivery across Signal’s service for days.</p>
<p>This service disruption was possible because, unlike XMPP and Matrix,
Signal is centralized, and all messages flow through a single set of
servers, the same model as WhatsApp.</p>
<p>XMPP and Matrix are both federated networks. Rather than a single entity
controlling the network, there are many servers to choose from, run by
many different independent providers. Even with a server down,
overloaded or closed to new users, the rest of the network continues
functioning.</p>
<p>So why did Signal receive millions of users, and XMPP/Matrix did not?</p>
<h2 id="signal">Signal</h2>
<p>At this point it’s impossible not to reference <a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/">The Ecosystem is Moving</a>,
a 2016 blog post by Signal’s founder and CEO, Moxie Marlinspike. In this
post Moxie details all the problems he sees with protocols becoming
open internet standards. In particular, that they lose their ability to
evolve, and that evolution is vital to compete in our industry’s “moving
ecosystem”.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>We got to HTTP version 1.1 in 1997, and have been stuck there
       until now. Likewise, SMTP, IRC, DNS, XMPP, are all similarly
       frozen in time circa the late 1990s.</p>

<p>Well. Far from being frozen in time, XMPP has changed significantly in the past
20 years.</p>

    <img src="https://snikket.org/blog/products-vs-protocols/xmpp_2004_2021.png">

<p>Just some of the things we have now that we didn’t have in the beginning:</p>
<ul>
<li>End-to-end encryption using OMEMO (based on Signalâ€™s protocol and
audited), with multi-device and offline capabilities</li>
<li>Audio/video calling (now 2nd generation, encrypted, WebRTC-compatible)</li>
<li>Mobile optimizations (bandwidth, connectivity, push notifications)</li>
<li>Full cross-device message synchronization</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these things didn’t even exist as concepts back when XMPP began.
Adding them was only possible due to XMPP’s smart design: a core
protocol, with a <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/">suite of extensions</a> (known as XEPs). New
extensions are added as needed, and irrelevant ones get deprecated.</p>
<p>To help keep everyone on the same page as the protocol evolves, the XMPP
Standards Foundation (XSF) annually publishes the recommended XEPs that
different classes of software (e.g. instant messaging,
<a href="https://xmpp.org/uses/social.html">social networking</a>, or <a href="https://xmpp.org/uses/internet-of-things.html">smart devices</a>) should be
implementing. These round-ups are known as <a href="https://xmpp.org/about/compliance-suites.html">compliance suites</a>.</p>
<p>The documentation site <a href="https://docs.modernxmpp.org/">Modern XMPP</a> also serves as a useful reference
guide for modern XMPP implementations (including UI/UX considerations,
which are not covered by the protocol-level documentation).</p>
<h2 id="the-unfortunate-truth">The unfortunate truth</h2>
<p>The effort required in advancing the protocol <em>is</em> significant. And that’s
not even counting the implementation work. XMPP has a diverse and open
ecosystem. There is no single “XMPP client”, instead the ecosystem is
composed of… just about anyone who decides to write XMPP software. The
vast majority of this software is free/open-source, and developed by
volunteers and communities.</p>
<p>Publishing protocol updates does not magically mean the changes are
implemented in all XMPP software overnight. Some projects are more active
than others, and each contributor is an individual with their own life
and work schedule. Unfortunately this means that it’s very difficult to
evolve the protocol and keep everyone 100% in sync. Luckily XMPP’s
modular design makes it easy for some software to advance ahead of others
without having to lose backwards compatibility with the rest of the
network. If we didn’t have this feature, we would always be in a state where
half of the network is unable to communicate with the other half of the
network, or more likely we would be stuck with the initial set of
features because nobody would want to be the first ones to become
incompatible with everyone else.</p>
<p>But Moxie is right. We could move <strong>much</strong> faster if we didn’t care about
interoperability, software diversity, and decentralization.</p>
<p>And that is the approach Signal is taking.</p>
<h2 id="product-or-protocol">Product or protocol?</h2>
<p>It’s clear that there are trade-offs to be made here. Signal’s
product-led development excludes others from participating in the Signal
network. But it allows them to remain agile, and implement new features
as fast as they can write and ship code.</p>
<p>I put together some of the trade-offs into the following table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Building an ecosystem</th>
<th>Building a product</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Focus on protocol</td>
<td>Focus on implementation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mostly documentation</td>
<td>Mostly code</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cross-project collaboration</td>
<td>Single project/team</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Building for developers</td>
<td>Building for end-users</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Slow evolution</td>
<td>Evolves as fast as you want</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Achieve diversity</td>
<td>Achieve a monoculture</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Robust</td>
<td>Single point of failure</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I think that Signal’s approach is laudable for the number of people that
they have helped divert from data-mining platforms, and helping to remind
people that surveillance capitalism isn’t the only way to do things.</p>
<p>They’ve built a good user-friendly product, and they have done it with
security and privacy at its heart.</p>
<p>But we have to aspire to more than this. Signal is a centralized, closed
system. That means to communicate with your contacts who use Signal, you
must also consent to their terms, their software, their US jurisdiction.
You have to be okay with their servers being hosted with large cloud
providers such as Amazon and Google.</p>
<p>But one thing the past has shown us is that things change. Technologies
evolve, business leaders come and go, motives adjust. Signal today may
be as benign as WhatsApp before its acquisition by Facebook. But …</p></div></div>

                                    <p>Most of the visual cortex studies I’ve read have been about mammalian vision. But mammals are not the only organisms with cortex, or at least tissue resembling cortex. This paper explores <em>turtle</em> visual cortex, in an area known as dCx. This dorsal region plays the role of the turtle primary vision center — as close as you can find to the homolog of human V1.</p>

<p>But unlike V1, Fournier &amp; Müller et al confirm the existing knowledge that while dCx receives direct inputs from LGN, its layout is <em>not</em> retinotopic. They expand upon this understanding by recording from both individual cells (with electrophysiological recording) and populations of cells. They show that, aside from some slight preferences of caudal dCx for rostral LGN inputs (and vice versa), dCx doesn’t have any clear layout pattern.</p>

<p>This is interesting because the simple, three-layer cortex of a reptile is a much simpler substrate for understanding vision than the complex, deep cortex of mammals. What, if not “pixel-level” information, is dCx responding to?</p>

<p>While the turtles watched movies, the researchers watched the turtles. In particular, they noticed that certain cells of dCx responded to <em>scene-level</em> stimuli: When there was a cut, or the film started or stopped, there was a burst of activity. When the same stimulus was played repeatedly, these responses died away.</p>

<p>This style of scene-level parsing in mammals is reserved for “later”, down-stream brain areas. Does this mean that turtles are using dCx as both early signal processing as well as higher-level object recognition and interpretation? If so, does this mean that mammalian brains, with discrete areas for low-level and high-level vision, evolved from an earlier system where all of these tasks were colocated?</p>

<p>Debian is a rock solid GNU/Linux distribution with more than 30,000 packages available in its official repositories. Debian is suitable for servers, workstations, mobile devices and embedded systems.</p>
<p>Debian has a simple and clean installation system which allows installing Debian with little effort as long as the number of installations to be executed is minimal, but as this number grows the installation procedure becomes cumbersome and tedious (Please note that during the installation process it is necessary to answer configuration questions and package selection), for example if we want to install Debian in a lab that has 15 workstations, we need to repeat this process 15 times, which is possible , but if we want to deploy Debian in mass, for example 100, 200, 500 or 1000 installations, it is no longer feasible, this is the reason why the Debian developers have created a system that allows automatic or unattended installations starting from a configuration file (preseed).</p>
<p>There are three methods that can be used to execute an unattended installation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adding the preseed file to the installer’s <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initrd">initrd.gz</a>, <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed#Adding_the_preseed_file_to_the_installer.27s_initrd.gz">link</a></li>
<li>Add the file boot parameter to the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ManipulatingISOs#remaster">ISO image</a></li>
<li>Load the preseed.cfg file from the network

</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this post we’re going to use method 1 for unattended installation starting from <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed/EditIso">DebianInstaller/Preseed/EditIso</a></p>
<h2 id="dowload-debian-image">1. Dowload Debian image</h2>
<p>We will download the “net-install” image that allows a minimal installation, an internet connection is needed since the files are downloaded from Debian repositories.</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -LO# https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/debian-10.8.0-amd64-netinst.iso
</code></pre>
<p>Recommended reading: <a href="https://www.librebyte.net/en/internet-browsers/as-download-files-using-curl/">How to download files using curl</a></p>
<h2 id="install-xorriso">2. Install xorriso</h2>
<p><strong>xorriso</strong> allows  to extract files from an ISO image and dump into the file system</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt -y install xorriso
</code></pre>

<p>With the following command we put the files contained in the “net-install” image into the file system under the isofiles DIR if the isofiles DIR does not exist, xorriso creates it automatically.</p>
<pre><code>$ xorriso -osirrox on -indev debian-10.1.0-amd64-netinst.iso  -extract / isofiles/
</code></pre>
<h2 id="dowload-a-base-preseed">4. Dowload a base preseed</h2>
<p>A basic template is available from Debian site which serves as a starting point for our unattended installation system.</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -#L https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/example-preseed.txt -o preseed.cfg
</code></pre>

<h2 id="modify-preseed-template-according-our-needs">5. Modify preseed template according our needs</h2>
<h3 id="setting-the-locale">5.1. Setting the locale</h3>
<p>Set operating system language to English, UTF-8 encoding and locale settings (date, currencies) to English U.S.</p>
<pre><code>d-i debian-installer/language string en
d-i debian-installer/country string US
d-i debian-installer/locale string en_US.UTF-8
</code></pre>
<h3 id="setting-the-timezone">5.2. Setting the timezone</h3>
<p>Set the hardware clock to UTC and set the timezone to America/New_York (we can use any value found on <code>/usr/share/zoneinfo/</code>) and use <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol">NTP</a> for time synchronization.</p>
<pre><code>d-i clock-setup/utc boolean true
d-i time/zone string America/New_York
d-i clock-setup/ntp boolean true

<h3 id="configure-the-keyboard">5.3.  Configure the keyboard</h3>
<p>Set the keyboard to US.</p>
<pre><code>d-i keyboard-configuration/xkb-keymap select us
</code></pre>
<h3 id="configure-the-network">5.4. Configure the network</h3>
<p>With the following configuration the installation system will try to configure the network automatically, set the hostname to debian10, set localdomain as domain name and use the <code>http.us.debian.org</code> as  mirror it is also possible to specify a proxy which in this case is empty.</p>
<pre><code>d-i netcfg/choose_interface select auto
d-i netcfg/get_hostname string debian10
d-i netcfg/get_domain string localdomain
# Avoid to show WEP dialog
d-i netcfg/wireless_wep string
d-i mirror/country string manual
d-i mirror/http/hostname string http.us.debian.org
d-i mirror/http/directory string /debian
d-i mirror/http/proxy string
</code></pre>
<h3 id="configure-users">5.5. Configure users</h3>
<p>We disable the the root user authentication user, instead we will use <code>sudo</code> with a standard user with encrypted password.</p>
<pre><code>d-i passwd/root-login boolean false
d-i passwd/user-fullname string Ponga Aqui el nombre completo del usuario a crear
d-i passwd/username string nombre_de_usuario
d-i passwd/user-password-crypted password Ponga aqui la contraseña encryptada
</code></pre>
<p>To encrypt the password you can execute the following command:</p>
<pre><code>$ python3 <span>-</span>c <span>'import crypt; print(crypt.crypt("mipass", crypt.METHOD_SHA512))'</span>
</code></pre>
<h3 id="partitioning">5.6. Partitioning</h3>
<p>We’re going to use <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager">LVM</a> as partition method, <strong>any old partition will be removed</strong>, the selected partition scheme is <code>atomic</code> that means use the the entire hard disk for a single partition, another options are: home (living in its own partition) and multi (separate partitions for /home, /var, /tmp).</p>
<pre><code>d-i partman-auto/method string lvm
d-i partman-lvm/device_remove_lvm boolean true
d-i partman-lvm/confirm boolean true
d-i partman-lvm/confirm_nooverwrite boolean true
d-i partman-auto/choose_recipe select atomic
d-i partman-auto-lvm/guided_size string max
</code></pre>
<p>Avoid that partman asks for  confirmation to continue with the partition process.</p>
<pre><code>d-i partman-partitioning/confirm_write_new_label boolean true
d-i partman/choose_partition select finish
d-i partman/confirm boolean true
d-i partman/confirm_nooverwrite boolean true
</code></pre>
<h3 id="packages-selection">5.7. Packages selection</h3>
<p>In addition to the base system, install an <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">SSH</a> server.</p>

A few years ago we worked with Leif Segerstam, a composer/conductor
from Finland. He had a remarkably creative way of using the English
language, and as usual, I started writing my favourite quotes in our music.
After a few days, I learned that several other members of the
orchestra were doing the same thing.  This is a compilation of our
efforts. 
<p>
Unlike the collected quotations of another famous conductor, these
aren't just the fractured phrases of someone who speaks English as
a second language - we have before us a record of the creative mind
of a kaleidescopic flexator electrifically fluxating new meaning into
a tired old language.

<!-- make the list of quotations double spaced -->


</p><ul>
<li>Could we have a relativity normal beginning?
</li><li>Take ``La Forza Del Destino'' and half it.
</li><li>I want the music more traumatised.
</li><li>Like an old time Western locomotive we can get the organity of the puffing.

</li><li>The old quarter note becomes very freshly enough the new quarter note.
</li><li>You could take a speed of 33 metronome, or 22.
</li><li>A dividing 50 percent reaction tempo-wise.
</li><li>The quintuplet should be freshly and rudely the same as the triplet.
</li><li>I am in 76 of this here.
</li><li>Still together, conductified.
</li><li>Could I have something which is close to that which is underneath the pencil?
</li><li>The atmospheric things must have a millimetre to do with the speed.
</li><li>The winds can rehearse the length of the teedle-eedle-boom.
</li><li>Something is satelliting out of the control of the beated music.

<p>Matrix is an open standard and communication protocol for real-time communication. It aims to make real-time communication work seamlessly between different service providers, just like standard Simple Mail Transfer Protocol email does now for store-and-forward email service, by allowing users with accounts at one communications service provider to communicate with users of a different service provider via online chat, voice over IP, and videotelephony. Such protocols have been around before such as XMPP but Matrix is not based on that or another communication protocol. From a technical perspective, it is an application layer communication protocol for federated real-time communication. It provides HTTP APIs and open source reference implementations for securely distributing and persisting messages in JSON format over an open federation of servers. It can integrate with standard web services via WebRTC, facilitating browser-to-browser applications. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(protocol)">Wikipedia</a></p>

February 9, 2021 | https://markjames.dev/2021-02-09-iracing-telemetry-fsharp/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://markjames.dev/2021-02-09-iracing-telemetry-fsharp/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>During the pandemic, I’ve been spending quite a bit of time playing <a href="https://iracing.com/">iRacing</a> in VR. I love the realism of iRacing (and how well it supports VR!), and managed to score a win in the Mazda MX-5 this season at the (sadly) now defunct Oran Park Raceway near Sydney.</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/race-result-mazda.png" width="600" height="150" alt="First place at Oran Park Raceway"></p>

<p>In a <a href="https://markjames.dev/2021-01-08-writing-an-iracing-sdk-implementation-fsharp/">previous post</a>, I discussed how I was looking to create an F# library for the iRacing SDK. This proved to be a bigger challenge than I thought as the iRacing API uses a memory mapped file and I’m not yet familiar enough with F# to be tackling the problem yet.</p>

<p>As an alternative (and thanks to F#’s interoperability with C# and the .NET platform), I decided to familiarize myself with this <a href="https://github.com/NickThissen/iRacingSdkWrapper">C# iRacing SDK</a> and build a small app that gathers some basic telemetry data and writes it to a CSV file which I could then plot in a .NET Interactive Notebook using Plotly.NET. The end result of my first few tests looked like this:</p>


    
        <!-- Plotly.js -->
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=11">
        
        
    
    
      
     
    


<p>The entire process was refreshingly simple, but there were a few things that had stumped me as I had still been thinking in C# (which I’m more familiar with). For example, here’s the code which listens to an event from the iRacing SDK and then calls a function which parses and then writes telemetry data to a CSV:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Get the current speed in m/s and convert to a rounded km/h.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>getSpeed</span> <span>(</span><span>evArgs</span><span>:</span> <span>SdkWrapper</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryUpdatedEventArgs</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>speed</span> <span>=</span> <span>float</span> <span>evArgs</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryInfo</span><span>.</span><span>Speed</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>speedInKMh</span> <span>=</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>3</span><span>.</span><span>6</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>speedRounded</span> <span>=</span> <span>System</span><span>.</span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>Round</span> <span>(</span><span>speedInKMh</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> 
    <span>speedRounded</span>

<span>// Get the throttle input and round it.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>throttleValue</span> <span>(</span><span>evArgs</span><span>:</span> <span>SdkWrapper</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryUpdatedEventArgs</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>throttle</span> <span>=</span> <span>float</span> <span>evArgs</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryInfo</span><span>.</span><span>Throttle</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>roundedThrottle</span> <span>=</span> <span>System</span><span>.</span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>Round</span> <span>(</span><span>throttle</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>
    <span>roundedThrottle</span>

<span>// Get the lapdistance and round it.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>getLapDistance</span> <span>(</span><span>evArgs</span><span>:</span> <span>SdkWrapper</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryUpdatedEventArgs</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>distance</span> <span>=</span> <span>float</span> <span>evArgs</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryInfo</span><span>.</span><span>LapDistPct</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>roundedDistance</span> <span>=</span> <span>System</span><span>.</span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>Round</span> <span>(</span><span>distance</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>
    <span>roundedDistance</span>

<span>// Append the output of the current tick to a CSV file.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>writeToCsv</span> <span>(</span><span>evArgs</span><span>:</span> <span>SdkWrapper</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryUpdatedEventArgs</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>dataToWrite</span> <span>=</span> <span>$</span><span>"{getSpeed evArgs},{evArgs.TelemetryInfo.Gear.Value},{throttleValue evArgs},{evArgs.TelemetryInfo.Lap.Value},{getLapDistance evArgs}</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
    <span>File</span><span>.</span><span>AppendAllText</span> <span>(</span><span>"""C:</span><span>\</span><span>LapTimes.csv"""</span><span>,</span> <span>dataToWrite</span><span>)</span>
    <span>printfn</span> <span>"Wrote to CSV"</span>

<span>let</span> <span>start</span> <span>()</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>// Bind an instance of iRacing SdkWrapper to iRacing</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>iracing</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>SdkWrapper</span><span>(</span><span>TelemetryUpdateFrequency</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
    <span>iracing</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryUpdated</span>
    <span>// Listen to the iRacing telemetry updates</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Observable</span><span>.</span><span>subscribe</span> <span>writeToCsv</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>ignore</span>
    <span>iracing</span><span>.</span><span>Start</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The first thing to note is the structure of the code. F# code is structured from the bottom up (the same applies for files in a project), and I find that this helps with readability and reasoning about the code.</p>

<p>Another thing to consider is how to set the update frequency (in updates per second). In C#, we would update a variable to set the telemetry update frequency like so:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>iracing</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryUpdateFrequency</span> <span>=</span> <span>2.0</span><span>;</span> <span>// Updates per second</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>However, In F#, we bind names to expressions as opposed to assigning variables. Then how can we set an update frequency for the C# library without using a mutable? The answer is simple, pass it in as a parameter to the SdkWrapper constructor:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>iracing</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>SdkWrapper</span><span>(</span><span>TelemetryUpdateFrequency</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>// Receive events at a rate of two updates/sec.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, note the use of Observable.subscribe to listen to an event. In C#, we would likely do something like this to subscribe to the event using an event handler:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Program</span> 
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>Sdkwrapper</span> <span>iracing</span><span>;</span>

    <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>Main</span><span>(</span><span>string</span><span>[]</span> <span>args</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>    
        <span>iracing</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>SdkWrapper</span><span>;</span>
        <span>iracing</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryUpdated</span> <span>+=</span> <span>OnTelemetryUpdated</span><span>;</span>
        <span>iracing</span><span>.</span><span>Start</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>private</span> <span>void</span> <span>OnTelemetryUpdated</span><span>(</span><span>object</span> <span>sender</span><span>,</span> <span>SdkWrapper</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryUpdatedEventArgs</span> <span>e</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>// Use live telemetry</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In F#, we subscribe to the event using Observable.subscribe and call our writeToCsv function each time the event is fired:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>    <span>iracing</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryUpdated</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Observable</span><span>.</span><span>subscribe</span> <span>writeToCsv</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>ignore</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The interop between C# and F# events is nice, and I find this solution to be quite elegant. In addition, you also have Observable.scan which accumulates state each time an event has fired. I haven’t had to do that in this example, but you can see <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/concurrency-reactive/">more details here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="plotting-the-telemetry-data">Plotting the Telemetry Data</h2>

<p>Now that we have a backend system logging some telemetry data from the sim, the next step is to plot the graph we saw above. In order to do so, I created a new .NET Interactive notebook in VS Code Insiders. I then imported the libraries I needed and wrote the following initial code:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>[&lt;</span><span>Literal</span><span>&gt;]</span>
<span>let</span> <span>FilePath</span> <span>=</span> <span>"""C:</span><span>\</span><span>LapTimes.csv"""</span>

<span>type</span> <span>rawCsv</span> <span>=</span> <span>CsvProvider</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FilePath</span><span>,</span> <span>HasHeaders</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>&gt;</span>

<span>// CSV File</span>
<span>let</span> <span>lapPerformance</span> <span>=</span> <span>rawCsv</span><span>.</span><span>GetSample</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The use of [&lt;Literal&gt;] here is because FilePath must be a constant so that the CsvProvider can read the data while we’re developing. As I mentioned in a previous article on <a href="https://markjames.dev/2021-01-23-plotting-csv-files-fsharp/">CSV files in F#</a>, “Type providers are a blessing and curse in F#. On one hand, they’re amazing, because you get compile-time types for your data! But, that also means the data must be available at compile time. You can usually work around this by either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Including representative data inside your project’s git repo, so you can build the provider based on sample data and then parse any conforming input data</li>
  <li>Using a string literal in source code to define sample data and use that for the provider (which is what I’ve done here).”</li>
</ul>

<p>I also added some column headers into my CSV file (in the future, I plan to write these automatically in the backend code). We also create a new CsvProvider, and then get the data by calling GetSample() on the raw CSV file.</p>

<p>Next, let’s write the createChart function and then pass it out formatted CSV file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>createChart</span><span>(</span><span>lapPerformance</span><span>:</span> <span>rawCsv</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> 

    <span>let</span> <span>speed</span> <span>=</span> <span>lapPerformance</span><span>.</span><span>Rows</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Seq</span><span>.</span><span>filter</span> <span>(</span><span>fun</span> <span>row</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>row</span><span>.</span><span>Lap</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span> <span>)</span>
    <span>speed</span>

    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>withSize</span> <span>(</span><span>900</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>600</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>Show</span>
    
<span>createChart</span><span>(</span><span>lapPerformance</span><span>:</span> <span>rawCsv</span><span>)</span> 
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The first thing I do is make use of a higher order function, Seq.filter in order to only include lap two for plotting. Thanks to type providers, we can reference columns (e.g. row.Lap) directly while developing! I find this super handy as I no longer need to reference the file itself to figure out which columns are which.</p>

<p>Next, we construct a pipeline using the forward piping operator (|&gt;) to map the lap distance and speed variables as X and Y values on a line chart, and then define how the chart should be styled. I really like the forward piping operator, and I find that it produces some really clean and concise code.</p>

<h2 id="exploratory-data-with-deedle">Exploratory Data with Deedle</h2>

<p>For a project at work, I’ve been exploring the use of <a href="https://bluemountaincapital.github.io/Deedle/">Deedle</a> as an alternative to Python’s Pandas, and it could be a good library to make use of here to explore telemetry data in greater detail.</p>

<p>The first thing I tried using Deedle, was seeing what my average lap speed was across laps 1-4 at the Laguna Seca Racetrack:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>lapCsv</span> <span>=</span> <span>Frame</span><span>.</span><span>ReadCsv</span><span>(</span><span>"""C:</span><span>\</span><span>LapTimes.csv"""</span><span>,</span> <span>hasHeaders</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>)</span>

<span>let</span> <span>speed</span> <span>=</span> <span>lapCsv</span><span>.</span><span>GetColumn</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;(</span><span>"Speed"</span><span>)</span>
<span>speed</span> 
<span>|&gt;</span> <span>Stats</span><span>.</span><span>mean</span>
<span>|&gt;</span> <span>printf</span> <span>"Average speed: %A Km/h"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The results were:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Average speed:
121.036 Km/h
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>In this example, we’re loading our CSV file into a Deedle Dataframe, and then binding the Speed column to speed. Next, we make use of pipeline operator to get the mean of the column and print that to the console.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>Although there are much better telemetry systems out there, working on my own simple version has allowed me to better see the differences between C# and F#, while at the same time seeing how I can use C# libraries in F# in order to accomplish different tasks. In addition, It would be a good idea to buffer the output as opposed to writing to the file each tick, but since its only two updates per second and doesn’t need to scale, I’m okay with leaving it as is for now.</p>

<p>Moving forward, the next step is to parse the CSV file and then plot several laps together to analyze breaking points and speed on the straights to see if I can improve on any specific areas of the track.</p>

<p>Lastly, thanks to F# great interop with C#, I’m not so sure that there’s a need to port the library to F#, and I might instead look towards some other areas of F# where there’s more of a need for a library.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div property="content:encoded"><p>A lack of competition and transparency in the digital advertising technology supply chain is impacting publishers, advertisers and consumers and needs to be addressed, according to the <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/inquiries-ongoing/digital-advertising-services-inquiry/interim-report">interim report</a> for the ACCC’s Digital advertising services inquiry, released today.</p>

<p>The report examines the digital display advertising supply chain in Australia, which enables the near instantaneous delivery of $3.4 billion of digital display advertising opportunities on news, entertainment and other websites and apps each year. Digital advertising is, in essence, how consumers’ attention and data are monetised. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“Advertising technology, or ad tech, has significantly transformed the way that advertising is delivered to consumers online. As consumers live more of their lives online, ad tech plays an increasingly critical role in the advertising market and the wider digital economy,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.</p>

<p>“But there is a real lack of competition, choice and transparency in this industry. These issues add to the cost of advertising for businesses, which will ultimately impact the prices paid by consumers.”</p>

<p>While there are many ad tech providers in Australia, Google is by far the largest provider of all of the key ad tech services examined by the report, and is the only provider across the full ad tech supply chain that also sells ad inventory. The ACCC estimates that Google’s share of the revenue or ads traded in each of the required services in Australia ranges from 50-60 per cent to between 90-100 per cent, depending on the service.</p>

<p>Over time, Google has made a series of acquisitions that have cemented its strong position in the ad tech supply chain, which is further reinforced by its unrivalled access to data from its wide range of consumer-facing services, including Google Search, Chrome and Android, and from its wide network of trackers on third-party websites and apps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Google’s significant presence across the whole ad tech supply chain, combined with its significant data advantage, means Google is likely to have the ability and the incentive to preference its own ad tech businesses in ways that affect competition,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p>“During this inquiry we have heard concerns from parties about potential conflicts of interest from Google’s various roles in this industry. This includes Google very often acting on behalf of both publishers and advertisers for the same ad sale across the ad tech supply chain, while also selling its own ad inventory.”</p>

<p>Google-owned YouTube’s ad inventory is sold exclusively through Google’s own platforms. Advertisers who consider YouTube ads essential to their advertising strategy must use Google’s ad tech services to buy these ads.</p>

<p>Google also does not participate in header bidding auctions run by publishers, in which they offer ad inventory for sale to advertisers in a real-time bidding process. Instead, Google’s publisher ad server developed its own proprietary Open Bidding auctions, which means publishers who wish to receive real-time bids from advertisers using Google’s ad tech services must use Google’s publisher ad server.</p>

<p>The ACCC has also heard concerns about the competitive effect of Google’s restrictions on rivals’ access to different types of data, for example its move to block access to the DoubleClick ID and its proposal to block third-party cookies on Chrome.</p>

<p>The ACCC’s preliminary report sets out a series of possible options for addressing the issues in the ad tech industry, based on suggestions received during this inquiry and other industry developments.</p>

<p>Feedback is sought on these options, which include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Rules to manage conflicts of interest and prevent self-preferencing in the supply of ad tech services. The ACCC notes that the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK and the European Commission have both recently released proposals that relate to these issues, and seeks feedback on which aspects of those proposals could be appropriate in Australia.</li>
	<li>Proposals to enhance the ability of ad tech providers to assess the price and quality of services, including requiring demand-side platforms to allow independent verification and that the industry implement common transaction and user IDs.</li>
	<li>Promoting competition in the industry through boosting data portability (allowing a consumer’s data to be moved or shared at their request) and interoperability (allowing data to be shared between firms without a request from a consumer). One option is to require firms with a significant data advantage to provide consumers with an easy way to port their data between rival.</li>
	<li>Mandating the breaking up of datasets held by large incumbents, to make it easier for rival ad tech providers to enter and compete in the supply of ad tech services.</li>
</ul>

<p>The ACCC recognises that any proposals must be carefully designed with an eye to regulatory burden, efficiency and protecting consumers’ privacy while enhancing competition and transparency.</p>

<p>The report also supports the ACCC’s previous recommendations from the <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/inquiries-finalised/digital-platforms-inquiry-0">Digital platforms inquiry</a> to introduce an unfair practices provision and the establishment of an ombudsman scheme to resolve complaints and disputes with digital platform.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The report is available at <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/inquiries-ongoing/digital-advertising-services-inquiry">Digital advertising services inquiry</a>. Submissions to the preliminary report are due by 26 February 2021.</p>

<p><strong>Notes to editors</strong></p>

<p>Digital display advertisements are the images or videos that appear before or alongside content viewed online. This inquiry considers the advertising technology or “ad tech” services that deliver personalised digital display advertising and associated advertising agency services.</p>

<p>Examples of situations where individuals may view targeted display advertising include</p>

<ul>
	<li>Image or video ads shown while viewing a website in a browser on a desktop or mobile device</li>
	<li>Image or video advertising integrated into the content of a mobile app</li>
	<li>Videos shown during the ‘ad breaks’ in the ‘catch-up’ video streaming services of major commercial television networks</li>
</ul>

<p>The inquiry has examined four key ad tech services: advertiser ad servers, demand side platforms, supply-side platforms and publisher ad servers.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>On 10 February 2020, the Treasurer signed a Ministerial Direction requiring the ACCC to hold a public inquiry into markets for the supply of ad tech services and ad agency services.</p>

<p>This inquiry is being conducted by the ACCC’s Digital Platforms Branch, and will build on the findings of the ACCC’s Digital Platforms Inquiry, which delivered its final report in July 2019.</p>

<p>The ACCC provided a preliminary report to the Treasurer on 31 December 2020 and will provide a final report by 31 August 2021.</p>

<p>The ACCC’s Digital Platforms Branch is also conducting a separate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/inquiries-ongoing/digital-platform-services-inquiry-2020-2025">Inquiry</a>&nbsp;into markets for the supply of digital platform services. The first interim report for that inquiry was publicly released in October 2020.</p>

<p>The ACCC is closely following recent overseas enforcement actions in relation to Google’s supply of ad tech services, including the complaint filed by the Texas Attorney-General on behalf of nine US states on 16 December 2020 alleging that Google has monopoly power and forecloses competition in the markets for publisher ad server for display inventory, display ad exchanges, display ad networks and separate markets for display ad buying tools for large and small advertisers.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			<!-- Article Start -->
			
<p>Among the millions of images available on Wikimedia Commons is a <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:AsterNovi-belgii-flower-1mb.jpg">stunning photo</a> of a purple daisy with a yellow pistil. Taken in The Hague in 2004, it appears to be a variety of aster, a genus of flowering plants that mostly grow in Eurasia. It’s a nice picture, but its beauty doesn’t explain why the photo has received around 78 million hits each day — mostly from India — since roughly June 29 of last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chris Albon, the director of machine learning at the Wikimedia Foundation (the nonprofit that runs Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons), <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisalbon/status/1358890731981611009">said</a> in a tweet Monday that the flower was accounting for 20% of data requests for media to one of the organization’s servers. Albon called the spike in traffic “an ongoing mystery,” and linked to a <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T273741">ticket</a> on the Wikimedia forum where people were discussing what might be causing it. The flower photo soon began attracting attention on other parts of the internet, including <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26072025">Hacker News</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The original ticket on the Wikimedia forum indicated that the traffic was likely coming from a mobile app, a clue that helped guide early theories. One person identified a health conglomerate in India that has “Aster” in its name and speculated that its app or website might be using the photo and unintentionally sending traffic back to Wikimedia. Others remembered the generic image of the flower referenced as an example in their coding or design classes, leading them to wonder whether a particularly popular online course could be the culprit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Photos uploaded to Wikimedia Commons can be used by anyone for free and are often included as part of Wikipedia articles. Photographers from around the world have contributed to the project, including a Dutch man named Teun Spaans, who appears to be responsible for the picture of the purple flower. Spaans could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>



<p>Many online commenters noted that the purple flower had been used in sample code on sites like Stack Overflow, a question-and-answer forum for programmers. They theorized that an app developer may have accidentally copied and pasted one of the samples and forgot to remove a link to the photograph. Using code snippets from Stack Overflow is a common strategy among developers around the world.</p>



<p>“It appears to be a classic case of hot linking,” said Michael Donohoe, head of product at <em>Rest of World</em>. Hot linking is when a website displays an image by linking to the original site where it’s hosted, instead of uploading it separately. The practice allows the site borrowing the picture to avoid using their own server space — that’s why Wikimedia is forced to handle the requests to the flower photo. “As I’m sure you’ve gathered, people often do it by mistake [copy/paste code without knowing what it does]. When done by a developer, it’s usually sloppy coding and doesn’t look good,” Donohoe explained.</p>



<p>As speculators began trying to identify which app might be behind the traffic, another clue emerged: June 29, the day the flower photo first began attracting a significant amount of traffic, is the same day the Indian government blocked a group of apps made by Chinese developers, <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/do-you-even-tiktok-tiktok/">including the social media platform TikTok</a>. Millions of Indians began flocking to the app’s <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/the-clock-is-tik-tok-tik-tok/">domestic competitors</a>, including MX TakaTak, Moj, and Josh. The evidence suggested that one of the TikTok replacements had inadvertently hot-linked to the flower image in their code. Then, after TikTok was banned and the copycat app suddenly became popular, traffic to the picture began spiking.</p>



<p>Public <a href="https://pageviews.toolforge.org/mediaviews/?project=commons.wikimedia.org&amp;platform=&amp;agent=spider&amp;referer=all-referers&amp;start=2020-06-29&amp;end=2021-02-08&amp;files=AsterNovi-belgii-flower-1mb.jpg">data</a> collected by the Wikimedia Foundation indicates that the image has been receiving roughly the same amount of traffic since June 29, about 78 million hits per day. That suggests an app with tens of millions of daily active users is likely responsible. Traffic for the purple flower first began spiking around June 15, when it received roughly 5 million hits. That number quickly jumped after TikTok was banned in India and peaked at almost 120 million hits on New Year’s Eve. (Before June, the picture was getting only a few hundred hits a day.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, the culprit remains a mystery — at least to the public. Sukhbir Singh, an engineer at the Wikimedia Foundation, said on the nonprofit’s forum that, after extensive testing, it had identified the app in question and confirmed it was from India. He said the organization planned to release the name of it soon. “We have initiated contact with the app developers and are waiting to hear back from them. In the meantime, given the volume of requests, we have decided to ban those specific requests until the issue is resolved,” Singh wrote. The Wikimedia Foundation did not immediately return a request for comment.</p>



<p>Singh added that Wikimedia couldn’t find the image anywhere in the app itself, “confirming our theory that it fetches the image but does not display it.” In other words, every day, millions of phones are sending traffic to a beautiful photograph of a flower, but no one is able to actually witness its beauty. It’s like a weird version of the butterfly effect — except for throwaway code.</p>

<p><strong>Subtitle:</strong> Want to reread The Lord of the Rings? Or are you more a fan of Harry Potter? Use MeiliSearch to find your favorite books quickly!</p><p>This tutorial uses a sample dataset from GoodReads uploaded by <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks" rel="nofollow">Jealous Leopard on Kaggle</a>.</p><p>The goal of this tutorial is to learn more about advanced MeiliSearch concepts, such as:</p><ul><li>How MeiliSearch handles nested objects</li><li>How to use facets to calculate the distribution of documents</li><li>How to use distinct attributes</li><li>How to define searchable attributes using the settings object</li></ul><p>So, what are the requirements to follow this tutorial?</p><h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2><p>To follow this standalone tutorial, we expect you to have a basic understanding of MeiliSearch. If you’re unsure, feel free to check out the previous tutorial about <a href="https://blog.meilisearch.com/how-to-search-nobel-prize-winners-faster-with-meilisearch-api-for-javascript/" rel="nofollow">searching for Nobel prize winners</a>—however, it isn’t required.</p><p>Other requirements include.</p><ul><li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" rel="nofollow">A Node.js installation</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch#getting-started">A MeiliSearch instance</a>: this can be running locally, via Docker, or on a <a href="https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/meilisearch?action=deploy">DigitalOcean droplet</a>. Don’t want to set up your own MeiliSearch instance? Try out our <a href="https://sandbox.meilisearch.com/" rel="nofollow">MeiliSearch sandbox</a> to create a free, remote-hosted instance available for 72h.</li><li><a href="https://curl.haxx.se/download.html" rel="nofollow">cURL</a> or Postman for sending requests from the terminal</li><li>The MeiliSearch-js wrapper and dependencies (see the <a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-js#-installation">installation guide</a>).</li></ul><p>All set? Let's dive right into it!</p><h2 id="project-setup-and-meilisearch-js-installation">Project setup and MeiliSearch-js installation</h2><p>To follow along, we need to set up our JavaScript project and install MeiliSearch-js. Create a new folder and run the following command in your terminal.</p><p><code>npm init -y</code></p><p>This will prepare your project setup. Next, we can add the MeiliSearch-js dependency.</p><p><code>npm install meilisearch</code></p><p>Lastly, let’s create a file called <code>index.js</code> inside your project. We’ll use this file to add our JavaScript code.</p><p><code>touch index.js</code></p><p>Done? Let's move on!</p><h2 id="step-1-creating-an-index">Step 1: Creating an index</h2><p>This step will prepare the <code>index.js</code> file so we can experiment with the <code>meilisearch</code> package.</p><p>First, we need to connect with our MeiliSearch instance. If you've used the MeiliSearch sandbox, you've received a <strong>master key that protects all API endpoints for your MeiliSearch instance</strong>. If you've used another installation method, we highly recommend <a href="https://docs.meilisearch.com/guides/advanced_guides/authentication.html#authentication" rel="nofollow">setting a master key</a> for security reasons. For instance, an unsecured DigitalOcean droplet allows anyone to access your instance via the publicly available IP address.</p><p>Below, you’ll find a boilerplate code snippet that you can reuse in all of your MeiliSearch projects. We wrap our code in an asynchronous <code>main</code> function in order to access the <code>async/await</code> syntax. We also use the <code>client</code> object to connect with our MeiliSearch instance.</p><p>Add the code snippet below to your <code>index.js</code> file.</p><pre><code>const { MeiliSearch } = require('meilisearch')

const main = async () =&gt; {
    const client = new MeiliSearch({
        host: 'http://127.0.0.1:7700',
        headers: {
            'X-Meili-API-Key': 'your-master-key'
        }
    })
    const indexes = await client.listIndexes()
    console.log(indexes)
}

main()</code></pre><p>Note that we call the <code>listIndexes()</code> method on the newly created <code>client</code> object. If you are using a new instance, your terminal should print an empty array. For users who've opted for the MeiliSearch sandbox, it comes with a <code>movies</code> index by default.</p><p>Now, execute the file from your terminal with the <code>node</code> command.</p><p><code>node index.js</code></p><p>If you've received a response from your client, the connection object works. If you haven’t, double check your host address and API key.</p><p>For the next step, let's create the <code>books</code> index to add our GoodReads data.</p><pre><code>const { MeiliSearch } = require('meilisearch')
 
const main = async () =&gt; {
    const client = new MeiliSearch({
        host: 'http://127.0.0.1:7700',
        headers: {
            'X-Meili-API-Key': 'your-master-key'
        }
    })
 
    const indexes = await client.listIndexes()
    console.log(indexes)
 
    await client.createIndex('books')
 
    const updatedIndexes = await client.listIndexes()
    console.log(updatedIndexes)
}
 
main()</code></pre><p>Execute the file with the <code>node</code> command like before. You should see the following response containing your <code>books</code> index. Note that your values for <code>createdAt</code> and <code>updatedAt</code> will be different from ours.</p><pre><code>[ 
  { 
    name: 'books',
    uid: 'books',
    createdAt: '2020-12-15T11:34:23.052004747Z',
    updatedAt: '2020-12-15T11:34:23.052024846Z',
    primaryKey: null 
  }
]
</code></pre><p>Our index is created, but we haven’t given it a primary key yet. When we add data in the next step, MeiliSearch will <a href="https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/core_concepts/documents.html#primary-field">infer our primary key</a> because our data set contains an <code>id</code> field.</p><p>Index created? Good! Let’s explore the GoodReads books data set.</p><h2 id="step-2-adding-the-goodreads-books-dataset">Step 2: Adding the GoodReads books dataset</h2><p>This step explores the GoodReads books dataset. For clarity, we’ve used a modified, smaller version of this dataset, but you can find the original dataset on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks" rel="nofollow">Kaggle</a>, if you’re interested. First, let's download our dataset using the cURL command.</p><pre><code>curl -L https://gist.githubusercontent.com/michielmulders/671ba6e225fbb815bd3f610f5b006802/raw/33c410c003239d2fbda0ebd535e9f94176544f8c/books.json -o books.json</code></pre><p>So, what does a <code>book</code> object look like?</p><pre><code>{
    id: "1",
    title: "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince",
    author: "J.K. Rowling/Mary GrandPré",
    cover: "hard cover with dust jacket",
    language: "eng",
    publisher: "Scholastic Inc.",
    details: {
        isbn: "0439785960",
        rating: "4.57",
        pages: "652"
    }
}</code></pre><p>Each book contains a unique <code>id</code>. The <code>cover</code> property has three possible values: <code>hard cover</code>, <code>hard cover with dust jacket</code>, and <code>soft cover</code>. This property will be useful later on when we take a look at distinct attributes.</p><p>To display how MeiliSearch handles nested objects, we've created a <code>details</code> property that contains the book's <code>isbn</code> code, <code>rating</code>, and number of <code>pages</code>.</p><p>Note that the dataset contains a <a href="https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/under_the_hood/datatypes.html#object">nested JSON object</a>. JSON objects are broken into separate string tokens during indexing, which means separate words. This means that each value gets tokenized and indexed so the value is searchable.</p><p>Ok, let's add the data to our <code>books</code> index. For this, we'll be using the <code>curl</code> command again. Make sure you execute the command in the folder that contains the <code>books.json</code> file.</p><pre><code>curl -i -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:7700/indexes/books/documents' \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --header 'X-Meili-API-Key: your-master-key' \
  --data @books.json</code></pre><p>If the query returns a status 201, the documents have been created successfully!</p><p>Alternatively, you can use JavaScript code to upload documents to your index. Here's an example.</p><pre><code>const { MeiliSearch } = require('meilisearch')
const books = require('./books.json')
 
const main = async () =&gt; {
    const client = new MeiliSearch({
        host: 'http://127.0.0.1:7700',
        headers: {
            'X-Meili-API-Key': 'your-master-key'
        }
    })
 
    const index = client.index('books')
    index.addDocuments(books).then((res) =&gt; console.log(res))

    console.info('Documents added!')
}
 
main()</code></pre><p>Now, if you open a browser and navigate to the host address of your MeiliSearch instance (by default: <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7700/">http://127.0.0.1:7700</a>), you can use our <a href="https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/features/web_interface.html#web-interface">web interface</a> to start searching with the index you just created. </p><p>That's it for adding documents! </p><h2 id="step-3-using-facets-to-calculate-the-distribution-of-documents">Step 3: Using facets to calculate the distribution of documents</h2><p>To improve our search, we can use facet filters. They index data for a particular property so the MeiliSearch instance can retrieve data faster. Furthermore, faceting allows users to browse data by category and narrow their search selection, which leads to faster searching.</p><p>To retrieve the facet distribution, we have to define a <a href="https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/features/settings.html#attributes-for-faceting">facet filter</a>. For this example, we want to figure out the language distribution of all books written by <code>Douglas Adams</code>. Therefore, let's define a facet filter for the <code>language</code> property. Our dataset contains five different languages. That's perfect for faceting.</p><pre><code>const { MeiliSearch } = require('meilisearch')
 
const main = async () =&gt; {
    const client = new MeiliSearch({
        host: 'http://127.0.0.1:7700',
        headers: {
            'X-Meili-API-Key': 'your-master-key'
        }
    })
 
    const index = client.index('books')
    
    await index.updateSettings({
        attributesForFaceting:
        [
            "language"
        ]
    })
}

main()</code></pre><p>Let's say we want to figure out the language distribution of all books written by author <code>Douglas Adams</code>. In other words, we want to know how many books are written in <code>eng</code> (English), <code>esp</code> (Spanish), or <code>fre</code> (French).</p><p>You can try for yourself how to solve this problem. Information and examples about the facets distribution can be found in the <a href="https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/features/faceted_search.html#using-facets">documentation</a> (scroll down to "The facets distribution"). You can also find <a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-js#-api-resources">a list of MeiliSearch-js functions</a> on the repository README.</p><p>We expect the following outcome for <code>Douglas Adams</code>.</p><pre><code>{ 
    hits:[ ... ],
    offset: 0,
    limit: 20,
    nbHits: 10,
    query: 'Douglas Adams',
    facetsDistribution: { 
        language: 
        { 
            mul: 0, 
            esp: 1, 
            eng: 9, 
            spa: 0, 
            fre: 0 
        }
    },
   exhaustiveFacetsCount: true 
}
</code></pre><p><br><strong>Code solution for facets distribution</strong></p><p>Solution: To obtain the facet distribution, we can pass the `facetsDistribution` property with our search query.</p><pre><code>const { MeiliSearch } = require('meilisearch')
 
const main = async () =&gt; {
    const client = new MeiliSearch({
        host: 'http://127.0.0.1:7700',
        headers: {
            'X-Meili-API-Key': 'your-master-key'
        }
    })
 
    const index = client.index('books')
    
    const distribution = await index
        .search('Douglas Adams', {
            facetsDistribution: ['language']
        })
    console.log(distribution)
}

main()</code></pre><p>Cool, right? Let's move on!</p><h2 id="step-4-using-distinct-attributes-to-avoid-duplicates">Step 4: Using distinct attributes to avoid duplicates</h2><p>Perform a search for <code>The Lord of the Rings 2</code>. Notice anything strange?</p><pre><code>{

February 9, 2021 | https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr"><div><p>A <b>brainwallet</b> refers to the concept of storing Bitcoins in one's own mind by memorizing a <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase" title="Seed phrase">seed phrase</a>. If the seed is not recorded anywhere, the Bitcoins can be thought of as being held only in the mind of the owner. If a brainwallet is forgotten or the person dies or is permanently incapacitated, the Bitcoins are lost forever. Using memory techniques allow them to be memorized and recalled easily.
</p><p>To create a brainwallet, use Bitcoin wallet software to generate a seed phrase and then memorize it. Such seeds are generated by wallets like <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Electrum" title="Electrum">Electrum</a>, <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Armory" title="Armory">Armory</a> and <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mycelium" title="Mycelium">Mycelium</a>.
</p><p>Brainwallets are not recommended to be used in general because of fallible human memory. But in special situations they could be very useful, for example when fleeing a country as a refugee with only the clothes on your back.
</p>

<h2><span id="Worked_Example">Worked Example</span></h2>
<ol><li> Run <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Electrum" title="Electrum">Electrum</a> and use it to generate a <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase" title="Seed phrase">seed phrase</a>.</li>
<li> Memorize the phrase using <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_peg_system">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_peg_system</a></li>
<li> When spending or saving, restore the wallet from memory using the phrase.</li></ol>
<h3><span id="Example_Mnemonic_Peg">Example Mnemonic Peg</span></h3>
<p>To memorize a seed with this method you must invent a story which hits the words as "keynotes". Try to make it like a fairy tale story, use imagery. Make it somehow striking and emotionally resonant. When remembering you just remember the key words, not all the other words - the other can be remembered more as images and thoughts (which are hard to write down)
</p><p>Let's say we have this seed:
</p>
<pre>   witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least
</pre>
<p>You'd imagine walking through a building familiar to you, maybe your own home or workplace or school.
</p>
<ul><li> You imagine looking in the first room and seeing your mother dressed as a <b>witch</b>, playing the jenga boardgame until the tower <b>collapses</b>.</li>
<li> You walk to the next room and see your father <b>practising</b> with a longbow, he shoots a chicken to <b>feeds</b> himself.</li>
<li> In the next room you see your brother naked in <b>shame</b> attempting to cover himself, he's looking through a window that's <b>open</b> and flapping in the wind.</li>
<li> Now you reach the kitchen, girlfriend is looking at Picasso's <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guernica_%28Picasso%29">Guernica</a> on the wall. She is in <b>despair</b> from it. Next to it is a television playing the show Dawson's <b>Creek</b>.</li>
<li> Next you're in the garage, your childhood friend is working on his car. He plans to go on a <b>road</b> trip for the 5th time this month, he's going <b>again</b>.</li>
<li> Finally to go outside to the garden. It's early spring and the ground is covered in melting <b>ice</b>. Two of your other friends are there, one friend has a huge basket of apples, the other has a smaller basket but you're holding only some apples. You've got the <b>least</b> apples.</li></ul>
<p>Repeat this story in your head several times over a short period - the first few days. It will sink in, deep, after that. You'll only have to revisit it very occasionally. After a while you can ignore it for months and it'll still come back, not that I'd recommend relying on that.
</p>
<h3><span id="Video_Example_of_Mnemonic_Peg_Method">Video Example of Mnemonic Peg Method</span></h3>
<p>From the BBC documentary The Human Mind (2003) by Professor Robert Winston. Approximately 31 minutes in. Memorizing a list of 30 random words.
</p><p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhfQCW1f68&amp;t=1867">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhfQCW1f68&amp;t=1867</a>
</p>
<h3><span id="Fallible_Memory_Warning">Fallible Memory Warning</span></h3>
<p>Despite the memory aids, human memory can be very fallible. So if your only storage is memory you may find that it just vanished one day.
</p><p>Data should always be backed up. Storing a seed phrase in one place is bad, even if that one place is your brain.
</p>
<h2><span id="Obsolete_Brainwallet_Style">Obsolete Brainwallet Style</span></h2>
<p>An early old-style brainwallet was created by by memorization of a passphrase and converting it a <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Private_key" title="Private key">private key</a> with a hashing or key derivation algorithm (example: SHA256). That private key is then used to compute a Bitcoin address. This method was found to be very insecure and <b>should not be used</b>. Humans are not a good source of entropy. Using a single address also has problems associated with <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address_reuse" title="Address reuse">address reuse</a>.
</p>
<h3><span id="Low_Entropy_from_Human-Generated_Passphrases">Low Entropy from Human-Generated Passphrases</span></h3>
<p>Practically everyone who knows about or cares loudly yells at people DO NOT USE BRAINWALLETS [GENERATED BY HUMANS]. We've seen pretty concrete evidence that users are resistant to good advice in this space, and they are shocked when their favorite quotation is cracked and they lose their coins (But it was 60 characters long! I even added a special character! how is this possible?!), the existing sites promoting this stuff won't use a KDF stronger than SHA256*1 because "users are stupid if they use weak passwords". <sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3><span id="Ryan_Castellucci_DEFCON_Talk">Ryan Castellucci DEFCON Talk</span></h3>
<p>Ryan Castellucci gave a talk at DEFCON23 about cracking brainwallet passphrases. Although brainwallet passphrases were being exploited for years by this point, the talk helped bring the issues to more popular consciousness.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3><span id="Legacy_Code">Legacy Code</span></h3>
<p>If you have coins in an old-style brainwallet, the website <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bitaddress.org/">http://www.bitaddress.org/</a> contains a GUI for generating the private key using the sha256(passphrase) algorithm. It's highly recommended you move the coins out as soon as you can.

      <p>If you didn't see it, please check out <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/10/haskell-bad-parts-1">part 1 of this series</a> to understand the purpose of this. You can also check out <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/11/haskell-bad-parts-2">part 2</a>. Now, for more bad parts!</p>
<p>Note that this is the last blog post in this series where I had specific ideas queued up. So it's likely that this will be the last post for a while until I get annoyed by something again. So if you really want to see a continuation, find some bit of Haskell code that will annoy me and share it with me!</p>
<h2 id="pattern-matching">Pattern matching</h2>
<p>OK, this section title is a complete troll. I don't think pattern matching is a bad part of Haskell. I think pattern matching is one of the most powerful features in all of Haskell, especially when combined with sum types/ADTs. If someone asked me for a singular reason to consider using Haskell, this is what I'd point to.</p>
<p>Which is why the bad parts of pattern matching in Haskell are so bad. My "Haskell elevator pitch" is almost immediately undermined by terrible defaults.</p>
<p>My elevator pitch goes something like this: with sum types, you get to define your data types far more explicitly than in languages with only product types. And then you can rely on the compiler to tell you when you've made a change to a data constructor, or added a new data constructor. I usually try to understand first what someone's field of experience is and then build a real-ish example of sum types from that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that's all a lie, at least by default. Some specific parts of pattern matching <em>do</em> in fact let the compiler tell you when you've screwed up. (And if it's not clear: my favorite part of GHC is when it tells me I've screwed up.) If I delete a data constructor, or if I add a new field to a data constructor and I was pattern matching on positionally, the compiler will error.</p>
<p>But this code compiles just fine, and I wish it didn't!</p>
<pre><code><span>data </span><span>MySum </span><span>= </span><span>Foo </span><span>| </span><span>Bar </span><span>| </span><span>Baz

</span><span>main </span><span>:: </span><span>IO</span><span>()
</span><span>main </span><span>=
    case </span><span>Baz </span><span>of
        </span><span>Foo </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> putStrLn </span><span>"</span><span>Foo</span><span>"
        </span><span>Bar </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> putStrLn </span><span>"</span><span>Bar</span><span>"

</span></code></pre>
<p>Not only does it compile just fine, but <em>there are no warnings</em>! "OK Michael," you say. "Who cares? <em>Everyone</em> knows that you should compile with <code>-Wall</code> turned on." To that, I say three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>No, not everyone knows it</li>
<li>Because of spurious warnings in <code>-Wall</code>, like unused import warnings, important warnings like this often get drowned out. (Yes, it's better to be warning-free for this reason...)</li>
<li>Yeah, but it gets worse</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's elaborate on (3). I'm a good programmer. So I turn on <code>-Wall</code>. Now I'm guaranteed a warning on incomplete pattern matches... right? Right?!? Right!!!!!!1111oneoneone</p>
<pre><code><span>{-# </span><span>OPTIONS_GHC</span><span> -Wall #-}
</span><span>data </span><span>MySum </span><span>= </span><span>Foo </span><span>| </span><span>Bar </span><span>| </span><span>Baz

</span><span>main </span><span>:: </span><span>IO</span><span>()
</span><span>main </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>\</span><span>Foo </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> putStrLn </span><span>"</span><span>Foo</span><span>"</span><span>) </span><span>Bar
</span></code></pre>
<p>Nope, denied! I get no warning here. Even though I have a <em>refutable pattern match</em> in my lambda, the compiler provides no warnings. "Didn't you know you needed to turn on <code>incomplete-uni-patterns</code> for that?" Actually, no, for a long time I didn't know that.</p>
<pre><code><span>{-# </span><span>OPTIONS_GHC</span><span> -Wall -Wincomplete-uni-patterns #-}
</span><span>data </span><span>MySum </span><span>= </span><span>Foo </span><span>| </span><span>Bar </span><span>| </span><span>Baz

</span><span>main </span><span>:: </span><span>IO</span><span>()
</span><span>main </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>\</span><span>Foo </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> putStrLn </span><span>"</span><span>Foo</span><span>"</span><span>) </span><span>Bar
</span></code></pre>
<p>Fortunately, there's some <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/15656">hope on the horizon</a> for this one.</p>
<p>One more annoyance, only tangentially related. GHC: please stop generating partial functions on my behalf!</p>
<pre><code><span>data </span><span>Staff
    </span><span>= </span><span>Principal
    </span><span>| </span><span>Teacher</span><span> { subject </span><span>:: </span><span>String</span><span> }

</span><span>main </span><span>:: </span><span>IO</span><span>()
</span><span>main </span><span>=</span><span> putStrLn </span><span>$ </span><span>"</span><span>Your subject is </span><span>" </span><span>++</span><span> subject </span><span>Principal
</span></code></pre>
<p>I just discovered that this can be detected with <code>-Wpartial-fields</code>, which is nice, but not part of <code>-Wall</code>. I've been giving advice for a long time to not include any field labels in sum types, and I'll continue to give that advice.</p>
<p>Note that some Haskellers won't like: this topic came up for me recently while writing a blog post comparing pattern matching in Haskell and Rust (probably going live next week). And, yet again, Rust does this better than Haskell. Yes, Rust is strict and Haskell is lazy. But as far as I'm concerned, in this case, Rust is simply more type safe than Haskell.</p>
<h2 id="slow-compilation">Slow compilation</h2>
<p>Let's get an elephant in the room out in the open. Compiling is slow. Some of this is because of GHC. Some of this is because our libraries are trying to do overly complicated things (like stream fusion in <code>vector</code> and <code>text</code>). This is a bane for Haskell, constantly.</p>
<p>As a recent example, I needed to add a flag to <code>http-conduit</code> to disable the <code>aeson</code> dependency:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/snoyberg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@snoyberg</a> kindly provided "-aeson" flag to http-conduit which saves my time very much. Thanks.<br>BTW, why does building aeson take so much time?</p>— 山本和彦 (@kazu_yamamoto) <a href="https://twitter.com/kazu_yamamoto/status/1334988010434150401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>I'm not going to beat up on this too much, since GHC is a complicated project and people are trying hard to both improve the existing support <em>and</em> add new features. And library authors (myself included) are caught between providing features and speeding up compilation.</p>
<p>There is a part of me that wonders if part of the problem is that our standard library (<code>base</code>) doesn't provide enough functionality out of the box, and leaves a lot of external libraries to implement and reimplement similar functionality. As more time goes on, I think Vincent Hanquez was <a href="https://github.com/haskell-foundation">completely correct about how to improve Haskell</a> and I wish I'd embraced it.</p>
<h2 id="text">Text</h2>
<p>There's so much wrong here. And I can't even blame it all on the <code>text</code> package. But I can blame a lot of it on the <code>text</code> package. Consider this section incoherent rambling instead of well reasoned arguments. (Typically a fair assumption with anything I say to be honest.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Why oh why is it UTF-16 instead of UTF-8? This is terrible! Except...</li>
<li>It's completely irrelevant what encoding <code>text</code> uses under the surface, because <em>you can't directly interact with its underlying representation</em>. And <em>that's</em> because...</li>
<li><code>text</code> uses unpinned memory to avoid heap fragmentation, which is a Good Thing, but then <code>text</code> can't be directly used in FFI calls. Which is probably a good thing, since it uses the wrong character encoding under the surface.</li>
<li><code>text</code> defines its own <code>Builder</code> type. It shouldn't. We should be using the <code>ByteString</code> <code>Builder</code> everywhere, and have a <code>newtype</code> wrapper around it to encode the invariant "must be UTF-8 encoded." <code>Builder</code> is a <em>wonderful</em> thing in Haskell, and it gets used far less than it should because it's such a PITA to deal with all of this. (I tried to address that in <code>rio</code>.) This is exactly the same as how we don't use <code>Vector</code> enough because of all the flaws with using it.</li>
<li>And, of course, <code>text</code> has stream fusion, which is shouldn't. I'll touch on this even more in the next section.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, Vincent got this all right. We need a singular packed data type. It should underly a <code>ByteString</code> and a <code>Text</code>. A <code>Text</code> should be a simple newtype around a <code>ByteString</code>. Users should never have to make a decision around pinned vs unpinned memory, that should be an implementation detail. (And sure, why not, give users a knob somewhere to control this when they know better than the defaults.) Have a single <code>Builder</code> type that builds up <code>Vector</code>s, and have it work for <code>ByteString</code> and <code>Text</code> too.</p>
<p>Oh, and just a side note...</p>
<p><strong>MAKE TEXT UBIQUITOUS</strong></p>
<p>We are now more than 10 years since the first release of <code>text</code> to Hackage. And people are still regularly using <code>String</code>. <strong>I</strong> regularly use <code>String</code> in examples. We really should be able to move our ecosystem over to better types.</p>
<p>We've broken everyone's code for far less important things many times in the past. Just to rile you all up: Foldable/Traversable Proposal wasn't important or interesting, this should have taken precedence.</p>
<h2 id="lazy-data-structures">Lazy data structures</h2>
<p>There should be no lazy <code>ByteString</code>. There should be no lazy <code>Text</code>. There isn't a lazy <code>Vector</code>, and that's a Good Thing.</p>
<p>"But what if I want to read a 10GB file into memory lazily?" You're using the wrong abstraction.</p>
<p>"But what if I want to lazily generate a massive file?" You're using the wrong abstraction.</p>
<p>Here's the problem: we don't have the right abstraction in <code>base</code>. We ended up at a local minimum.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lazy lists get used for "generators" and for data storage, when they're only half good for the former</li>
<li>We don't get a real generator type in <code>base</code>, because we have lazy lists</li>
<li>We don't get a real data storage type in <code>base</code>, because <code>vector</code> exists and sucks</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's what we need to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get rid of lazy lists from the language entirely</li>
<li>Add a streaming data interface to <code>base</code> that properly handles side-effects without hacks like lazy I/O</li>
<li>Provide great tooling around that streaming data interface, like stream fusion</li>
<li>Add a <code>Vector</code>-like type to <code>base</code> that only handles storage, no fusion or generation, and have it work with the streaming data interface</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, I'll say: Vincent got it right.</p>
<h2 id="qualified-imports">Qualified imports</h2>
<p>Since everyone loves to fixate on trivial syntactic issues, let me include one of those here at the end so everyone can ignore my other points. Qualified imports suck. Actually, modules suck. Actually, modules and packages suck. Actually, it all sucks.</p>
<p>The first problem? Our names are too verbose. <code>import qualified Control.Monad.Trans.Class as Trans</code>. I've actually typed that, many times. That's too much typing. Why is it <code>Control.Monad</code>? How does it help me?</p>
<p>What package does that module live in? You can't tell from the name. It's <code>transformers</code>. I think. Oh wait, no, now it's in <code>base</code>. My bad. Anyway, packages are able to just trample all over each others' namespaces like this. It's annoying.</p>
<p>And because Haskell doesn't have object syntax, importing identifiers directly, or qualified importing modules, is an absolute must for accessing most functionality on types. OOP kinda beat us here.</p>
<p>Yay, more incoherent rambling!</p>
<h2 id="should-we-fix-this">Should we fix this?</h2>
<p>OK, serious talk here. I think the warnings issue I mentioned above should absolutely be fixed. For the last section: I don't see a reality where a holistic change to Haskell syntax, module hierarchy, etc, could ever be possible. We're stuck with what we've got, possibly with minor ergonomic …</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>

<p>Wanna know how you can prioritise technical debt and reduce it? There are no <em>three easy steps</em> solutions to do so. It’s more complicated and messier than that. You need to translate technical debt into business impact. By framing technical debt as cost we have an easily understandable metric we can use to rally for support. After all, if technical debt does not hurt the business in any way, why should anyone care?</p>



<h2>Technical debt hurts the bottom line</h2>



<p>Don’t fall into the trap of measuring technical debt only in technical terms. Calculating your maintainability index certainly has its merit. But it won’t put your technical debt on anyone’s roadmap. If you tell a product manager how insanely high your cyclomatic complexity is the only reasonable answer is: <em>So what?</em></p>



<figure><img src="https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/prioritise-technical-debt-1024x684.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/prioritise-technical-debt-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/prioritise-technical-debt-300x200.jpg 300w, https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/prioritise-technical-debt-768x513.jpg 768w, https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/prioritise-technical-debt.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>What you really want to show is how bad your technical debt is for your business. That means you want to frame your technical debt as a monetary value. Start measuring the impact on developer productivity, cost of interrupted service or estimating impact of black swan events like security breaches. Here is a more extensive article about <a href="https://andreschweighofer.com/tech/how-to-measure-technical-debt/">how you can measure technical debt</a>.</p>



<h3>Technical debt is not technical</h3>



<p>Stop looking at technical debt in isolation. A fundamental problem of not erasing technical debt is that it has to compete against feature requests. Such feature requests often have a clear business case and are much more predictable. They pay into your shiny new company strategy directly and look good on your CV. Yes, the cards are stacked against you.</p>



<p>Add to this the uncertainty and high risk for any individual or team tackling the technical debt and to understand why it is so hard to prioritise technical debt. Especially global technical debt comes with another layer of difficulty. Such debt is not owned by a single team and it does not affect a single feature. How technical debt comes to be and grow is a good example of the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tragedy-of-the-commons.asp">tragedy of the commons</a>. So let’s find a way to counteract all those problems.</p>



<h2>A continuous budget for technical debt</h2>



<p>Let’s just be adults about it. We’ve seen that technical debt slows your team down. Instead of fighting a constant prioritisation battle we can simply set aside a certain amount of time for working on our technical debt, we’ll call this the 80/20 approach. 20% of your team’s effort is consistently spent on technical debt.</p>



<p>This approach brings with it a few advantages:</p>



<ul><li>You can continuously work on technical debt</li><li>The prioritisation process stays simple. You can prioritise technical debt and product features separately.</li></ul>



<p>But unfortunately it falls short in some aspects as well:</p>



<ul><li>If you only have a day in a week to work on technical debt, you will focus on small tasks leaving the bigger, more severe issues aside.</li><li>You’re multi-tasking which means both the feature work and technical debt take longer to get done. Besides that you’re wasting time switching context.</li><li>We focus on how much time we spend on technical debt, not on the impact and outcomes of our efforts</li><li>When the pressure is on to meet deadlines the 20% of your technical debt time is hard to defend and justify. What starts as a one-off exception can quickly turn into a 90/10 and eventually a 100/0 split.</li></ul>



<h2>RICE is not just for cooking</h2>



<p>Let’s see if we can do better than assigning a continuous budget for technical debt. With the RICE prioritisation technique we can try to frame our technical debt as business opportunity.</p>



<p>You assess the <strong>Reach</strong> and <strong>Impact</strong> of your opportunities, add your level of <strong>confidence</strong> and the expected <strong>effort</strong>. With those four variables you can then calculate a number for each opportunity, your RICE score. The higher the more valuable the opportunity.</p>



<h3>Prioritising features and technical debt with RICE</h3>



<p>Let’s try to compare a feature against technical debt with RICE. The feature we want to build is a new API endpoint. The technical debt we want to repay is replacing our API gateway. </p>



<p>The new API endpoint can reach about 50.000 of our customers and the endpoint has a medium impact (you can use any scale, for example 1 – 5) on their business, it’s a “nice to have”, so we’ll score it with a 2. We’re relatively confident (80%) that our numbers are accurate because we did the customer research and analysed feature requests. It’d take one team roughly 3 weeks from concept to production. </p>



<p>Now we calculate <em>Reach * Impact * Confidence / Effort</em> which comes out at the random number of 32.000. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Over_9000!">It’s over 9.000</a> which is good I guess. Let’s do the same for our technical debt.</p>



<p>The API gateway on the other hand is a central piece of our architecture, affecting every single customer. Let’s say that number is 350.000. The impact on each one of them is arguably smaller, because there would only be the performance improvement here and there and one of the other fixed edge case. So we’ll score it with a 1. It’s technical debt so we can’t be sure that the new gateway will deliver on all its promises. So we’ll only give it a 60% confidence score. Unfortunately it’s also not the simplest so you need two teams for roughly 4 weeks, 8 weeks in total. Let’s do the math: 350.000 * 1 * 0.6 / 6 equals 26.250. That proves how our technical debt is not as valuable as our shiny new endpoint. But does it really?</p>



<h3>Leave the RICE for the kitchen, not the codebase</h3>



<p>RICE is great for giving you a framework to look at certain data points and making rational decisions. However, in this case it has a few shortcomings:</p>



<ul><li>It’s customer centric. We’ve assumed that technical debt will provide customer value and that this is the only important dimension. But maybe the biggest value in fixing technical debt lies in gained efficiency and reduced cost through developer productivity. Unfortunately there’s no easy way to measure those different forms of value against each other. Back to square one.</li><li>While you can define the reach and impact with reasonable effort your confidence and efforts are really just opinionated estimations. And <a href="https://andreschweighofer.com/agile/make-better-predictions-stop-estimating/">your estimates tend to be pretty bad</a>.</li></ul>



<p>Okay, so far we have discovered to ways of how we can <strong>not</strong> prioritise technical debt. Let’s give it one more try.</p>



<h2>Show me the money</h2>



<p>Let’s try expressing our technical debt in terms which really matter to the business: money. Let’s try to answer how much technical debt costs us.</p>



<p>Technical debt is often not directly tied to a single feature. The most painful technical debt is systemic, affecting development across the organisation. It makes every feature touching it slower and more expensive. This costs us in three different ways: Developer productivity, delayed feature releases and infrastructure cost.</p>



<h3>Measuring developer productivity</h3>



<p>The simplest way to measure the impact on developer productivity is marking every interaction with the technical debt. Over a longer timeframe you can then do a simple statistical analysis. How long does a feature or pull request take on average? How much slower from first commit to production is your feature when it has to interact with the technical debt? </p>



<p>While this is only showing correlation and not causation, it still gives us some comprehensible data. Let’s say that the average developer works 20 hours for an average pull request. Features touching the technical debt take 30% longer, so about 6 hours. In a month your whole organisation creates 15 of such pull requests. Your average engineer costs you $70 per hour. <em>6 hours * 15 pull requests * $70 * 12 months</em> makes over $75.000. That’s almost a full engineering year just spent on this. But consider that this is only one single piece of technical debt. Also, it’s only one piece of the puzzle.</p>



<h3>Fixing technical debt boosts efficiency</h3>



<p>The even bigger implication is that every feature takes 30% longer to build. That doesn’t just cost you in terms of engineering salary. It costs you time that your feature could already earn you money. In product management this is called <em>cost of delay</em>. A product doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It has a lifecycle. While you’re still building your competitors are snatching up your customers. Here you can <a href="https://www.playbookhq.co/blog/cost-of-delay-calculate">read more about the cost of delay</a> but for now we just focus on the numbers. Because of the technical debt and the product-lifecycle we can not generate as much revenue from the new features we ship.</p>



<p>Let’s say on average a feature helps our sales team to onboard 20 new customers, netting us $500 each per month, $10.000 in total per feature. If your feature is one month late you lose $10.000 in profits. Let’s say we ship 3 features each month, one of them a month delayed because of technical debt. That’s $10.000 revenue lost each month, or $120.000 a year.</p>



<p>If you add up the lost developer productivity and the cost of delay we can estimate our technical debt costs us almost $200.000 per year. Now that gives us a fighting chance against all those features. In fact it changes the narrative from working on feature <em>or</em> working on technical debt to: </p>



<blockquote><p>If you want to ship features faster, tackle technical debt.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Prioritising technical debt is cost reduction</h2>



<p>Developer productivity and cost of delay are just two examples how you can put technical debt into a financial context. In your organisation it might be infrastructure cost or developer churn or customer churn and dissatisfaction. </p>



<p>Translate technical debt into the language of business to put technical debt on your roadmap. Try to find an angle where you can reasonably estimate its impact and cost. If you can highlight how much revenue your organisation is leaving on the street it makes it much easier to prioritise technical debt.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>A Unified API aggregates many APIs in the same software category, making integration easier with a standard endpoint, authentication, and normalized data. This results in a consistent developer experience with less integration hassle.</p><p><img alt="What-is-a-Unified-API" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/d6o5ai4eeewt/4bmcK2owWmTkyz8dQrLgk3/bccc1d0493747688f26ea154745fa8ae/What-is-a-Unified-API.png"></p><h2>The Problem With API Integration</h2><p>There are many problems with your typical one-off API integration. To start, onboarding takes time and effort. You must research documentation, learn the HTTP methods, and handle custom objects and fields. You must figure out security schemes, ensure the API meets all requirements, test the API, and resolve errors (REST APIs are notorious for handling errors in different ways).</p><p>Once integrated, the work is just getting started â€” maintaining connections introduces several more hurdles. APIs are continually evolving, and developers must routinely adapt their integrations to new versions to avoid breaking changes. Documentation may be out of date, and the API may not offer SDKs in your preferred programming language.</p><p>All these headaches are amplified when aggregating multiple APIs from different providers. The APIs could utilize entirely different API styles (REST, RPC, SOAP, GraphQL, etc.). They may send payloads in various data formats (JSON, XML, etc.) and use different data models. Also, opaque rate limits could shut lights out for unsuspecting applications. As the number of integrations increases, ensuring regulatory compliance becomes exponentially more difficult.</p><p>The API economy is exploding with an increasing number of APIs across all sectors. While  standards like <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a> and <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/">AsyncAPI</a> exist, the API industry is still largely fragmented, and each API has its own quirks. This makes it difficult for middleware, like finance, ERP, or CRM applications, to make reliable connections with multiple providers to meet their customers' integration requirements. Instead, they must repeat a cumbersome process for each unique  integration.</p><p><img alt="problem with API integration" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/d6o5ai4eeewt/6tqwHrTnYgYMiDgA49i7vk/d18b48416868abf5eb9d37820839f0eb/problem_with_API_integration.png"></p><h2>Introducing Unified APIs</h2><p>A Unified API is an abstraction layer that easily handles communication with many different APIs and backend data models. You can think of a Unified API as an airport hub that maintains relationships with airlines and helps route passengers to their destination of choice. The beauty  of a Unified API is its ability to offer a consistent API design and developer experience on par with Stripe and Twilio. </p><p>Unified APIs <strong>aggregate</strong> cloud providers in specific software categories, offering a single endpoint to areas like banking, accounting, CRM, leads, calendar, or email. By standardizing resources and data models across a single vertical, Unified APIs combine many services into a single integration â€” significantly decreasing redundancy. </p><p>A Unified API can also <strong>augment</strong> the data in transit and introduce PII (personal identifiable information) masking, field-level encryption, and an additional security gateway. This could provide a standard OAuth and scope management mechanism while allowing the flexibility to use unique Client IDs and secrets. Such an abstraction layer could also generate valuable support materials, such as libraries and SDKs, to streamline consumption. It could even convert a REST API to GraphQL without you doing any of the heavy lifting. Imagine, being able to query all your Salesforce and Stripe data through a GraphQL API!</p><p>Within the finance world, Unified APIs are typically called <em>API aggregators</em>. If you think about it, many of today's financial SaaS are essentially Unified APIs under the hood. Stripe, for example, connects with many payment providers to offer a single, seamless payment integration. Similarly, Plaid and Truelayer provide integrations with thousands of bank accounts. </p><h3>Examples of Unified APIs</h3><p>Unified APIs are becoming a popular way to integrate specific software categories. Some Unified API examples include: </p><ul><li><strong>Cloud Storage</strong>: Kloudless provides a unified Cloud Storage endpoint to access providers like Box, Google Drive, and OneDrive.</li><li><strong>Calendar</strong>: Nylas offers a unified Calendar API to synchronize gCal, iCloud, Outlook, and other popular calendars. </li><li><strong>CRM</strong>: Apideck Unify provides a <a href="https://www.apideck.com/crm-api">normalized CRM API</a> to instantly expose CRM connectors like Salesforce, Zoho, Airtable, Hubspot, and many others.</li><li><strong>Open Banking</strong>: <a href="https://www.openbankingtracker.com/">API Aggregators</a> like Plaid, Tink, Ibanity, Truelayer, and many more, provide API aggregation to access to consumer banking, transactions, and other financial data from banks and non-bank financial institutions.,</li><li><strong>Travel</strong>: Duffel provides an <a href="https://duffel.com/">airlines API</a> to search, book, and sell flights across a variety of airlines.</li><li><strong>Accounting</strong>: Codat's API integrates many accounting, banking, and commerce APIs from ClearBooks, QuickBooks, Zero, and others.</li><li><em>More Unified APIs</em>: Unified APIs are emerging for virtually all software categories, from team messaging, chat, email, shipping, and others. For a full list, check out our <a href="https://unifiedapis.io/">Unified APIs directory</a>.</li></ul><h2>Benefits of Unified APIs</h2><p>There are many benefits to utilizing a Unified API:</p><ul><li><strong>No integration pains</strong>: Unified APIs lower integration hurdles and makes the painful process of debugging APIs a thing of the past.</li><li><strong>Consolidated docs</strong>: No more reading a gazillion developer docs to make integrations. We all know the feeling. ðŸ•µðŸ�»â€�â™€ï¸�</li><li><strong>Solve compliance issues</strong>: A Unified API layer could help transform or mask potentially sensitive data (Personally Identifiable Information) to meet regulatory standards like HIPAA, PSD2, GDPR. </li><li><strong>Centralized logging</strong>: Unified APIs can centralize logging, increasing visibility and getting full observability out-of-the-box. </li><li><strong>Resource aliasing</strong>: Traditional integration development faces a fragmented taxonomy. A Unified API layer can create aliases to standardize terminologies across organizations, enabling you to use a common name per resource type.</li><li><strong>Normalized data</strong>: Unified APIs normalize data into a consumable format for easier ingestion.</li><li><strong>Domain model discovery</strong>: By mapping domain models across API vendors, it's much easier for developers to grasp specific APIs' scope and potential.</li><li><strong>Proxying requests</strong>: The ability to have a gateway that allows you to perform validation upfront and capture traffic going through all APIs.</li><li><strong>Simplifying webhooks</strong>: By standardizing events, a Unified API can make event-driven architecture more seamless.</li><li><strong>Standardized pagination and filtering</strong>: You know what you're going to get. Unified APIs make pagination, filtering, and sorting more consistent. They could also help avoid under-fetching and over-fetching.</li><li><strong>Lower maintenance cost</strong>: A unified API takes care of versioning downstream APIs to facilitate ongoing maintenance.</li><li><strong>Future-proofing</strong>: A Unified API could help future-proof connections, especially for AI use cases. Through machine-readable standards like <a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a>, an aggregator could extract helpful metadata and even pinpoint real-life objects.</li><li><strong>API Augmentation</strong>: With common libraries and SDKs, Unified APIs can support more developer preferences and programming languages. </li></ul><h2>Potential Downsides of Unified APIs</h2><p>Unified APIs could significantly improve the overall integration experience. However, if implemented incorrectly, unified APIs present some potential negatives. Thankfully, most can be mitigated with the right setup:</p><ul><li><strong>Latency</strong>: Adding an extra hop into the mix will introduce extra milliseconds.</li><li><strong>Vendor lock-in</strong>: You're adding another dependency to your stack. <em>Conversely, a single API integration could decrease future migration concerns.</em></li><li><strong>Data privacy</strong>: Adding another data processor increases liability, especially if sharing confidential data with a third party. <em>Unified APIs must be GDPR-compliant and encrypt data in transit to meet PSD2, CCPA, and other regulations.</em></li><li><strong>Lowest common denominator effect</strong>: If you're choosing commonalities across many APIs, you lose intricacies of downstream payloads. <em>A robust unified API should enable access to the full payload for power users and support <a href="https://medium.com/@grace_62874/how-unified-apis-work-with-custom-fields-ac655dbc2463">custom fields</a>.</em></li><li><strong>Data standardization qualms</strong>: To support the Unified API concept, you need a smart abstraction layer. <em>Common data models for specific software categories must be impeccably designed.</em></li><li><strong>Reliability</strong>: According to <a href="https://www.postman.com/state-of-api/api-strategies/#api-strategies">Postman's 2020 report</a>, 71.6% of developers say reliability is the most important factor of API integration. <em>Abstraction layers upon APIs must not introduce outages.</em></li><li><strong>Cost</strong>: An abstraction layer could cost money. However, <em>you gain velocity and time to market, equatable to revenue.</em></li></ul><p>Unified APIs do admittedly present some drawbacks, namely increased latency, added costs, and data compliance concerns. Thus, to offset any potential disadvantages, Unified APIs must expose an open, robust, encrypted platform where the time saved on integration dramatically outweighs the cost.</p><h2>A Unified API Movement is Underway</h2><p>Let's face it; integration is a skill in its own right. That's why Unified APIs are so intriguing â€” by unifying many tailored integrations in one endpoint, developers can offset the integration pains and free up time to work on their core business.</p><p>By augmenting the consumption experience, Unified APIs can normalize data models, bake in compliance and security models, and increase developer experience with standard documentation and support libraries. Even though the concept is relatively new, <a href="https://unifiedapis.io/">many unified APIs already exist</a>, underscoring their market validity.</p></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>How Infinitus helped VaccinateCA improve their coverage of Covid-19 vaccination sites by automating calls to 2500 pharmacies every day.</p></div><div><div><p>It all started when our CEO Ankit was tagged on a tweet:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edab43874bee849d9301d27/601a428d57edde4b089996f4_I_MtQLyy7YWzCtfAiaxFhcmMkrcwEnW-98Us4QJYixOqGaFqeq3uTcxZo6pkaw78gO4bKrJR8Fffvwonapk3gpmSk-XzoQWgOP7hZUbqzZvZC2DsT2rrEqNVB17lLpnKQxCCLMz3.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>At Infinitus, we automate repetitive, routine phone calls so our customers can focus on the more creative and empathetic parts of their businesses. Over the past two years, we have built a platform that collects data on behalf of tens of thousands of healthcare providers to help their patients access and afford therapies as efficiently as possible. When we learned that VaccinateCA volunteers were calling hundreds of local pharmacies daily to check for vaccine availability, we asked ourselves: how can our platform help this volunteer effort?</p><figure id="w-node-_5486cc49-4b64-1119-94c9-d7485b84ba76-f67b3b60"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edab43874bee849d9301d27/601a4a9679f268411d14b00f_Screen%20Shot%202021-02-02%20at%2010.59.30%20PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Timeline from first contact to production and a transcript of one of our first successful test calls</figcaption></figure><p>The VaccinateCA phone calls can be broken into two parts - first, identifying whether the vaccine is available, and second, how to get the vaccine. The majority of phone calls never make it past the first question. In fact, volunteers were only getting a 10% hit rate over the 200 calls they were able to make in a day. What if we could help the volunteers focus on the more exploratory work of figuring out who can get vaccines and how, and let us figure out where the vaccine is available?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s how we built it:</p><h2>Phase 1. Adapt Infrastructure for New Use Case</h2><p>The Infinitus VoiceRPA platform is designed to automate phone calls. While our system is currently tuned for a few use cases, one of our goals for 2021 is to make a platform where we can quickly configure and automate any new call type. We planned to leverage our existing system as much as possible so we could get this project out the door fast. We created a new Covid Vaccination call type and a workspace for storing the data.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edab43874bee849d9301d27/601a428dfb556cc89a26ef76_MH7Dyc-9NLpmZIatKQLSvAZsfA_ADFdYaIG7GImrhv2dWWbM-FfMT5Dl0S0rNx3Ua-sinCe-MpmQsHOEmkalMMcoYhIkMkEvABXU8D2CVnOu-XC98Mkg6csDcGPw-4vb3S-mhbKt.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>The Infinitus Technology Stack</figcaption></figure><p>The volunteers at VaccinateCA provided our team with a list of thousands of hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies that they were calling. We limited our scope to big pharmacy chains which have a large number of locations with standardized IVR (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_voice_response">Interactive Voice Response</a>) systems. They were also the most likely places to have vaccine availability across the state.&nbsp;</p><p>Within a day, the Covid Vaccination workspace was filled with pharmacies and phone numbers, all displayed in the same internal tools currently used by our data labeling team.</p><h2>Phase 2. Refine the Conversation Model</h2><p>The volunteers at VaccinateCA follow this script for their phone calls:</p><ul role="list"><li>Is the vaccine available for those 65 years and older?</li><li>Where can appointments be made?</li><li>Are walk-ins accepted?&nbsp;</li><li>What documentation is needed?</li></ul><p>We dedicated two members of our data labeling team to prepare the data to call pharmacies. They guided our digital assistant, Eva, through calls to (a) generate training data for our NLP team to automate future calls and (b) validate if pharmacists would be willing to talk to a digital assistant. Here’s what an early call sounded like:</p><p>The results were promising - pharmacists were providing the information we were looking for, but, as expected, we encountered a few challenges:</p><h4>1. Some pharmacists were not sure what to do when a digital assistant called them.</h4><figure id="w-node-b7e45f80-7c74-e54e-32f5-8797a3059363-f67b3b60"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edab43874bee849d9301d27/601a428d108eb65d7911a316_XPM4l0fV9unhDxCqe-uyBPL5ZRVMBDY2a-_00VDUM1uquJjZNHCVFBhJf9Ra9SclJM7upP4EuUcJ2Rpcmid80O_s2wmZ9XbBMQrBq90ChQCzZ1d1HjTiuxhjVBv9B5CcgjvO96Iu.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Between 25-30% of pharmacists who heard Eva’s automated voice, hung up without interacting with her.&nbsp;</p><p>To combat these outright hangups, we followed up with those pharmacies to explain who we are calling on behalf of and why, and asking if in the future they would be willing to talk to our digital assistant.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h4>2. Difficulty detecting when to start asking questions.<br></h4><p>A person can easily differentiate between a pharmacist, an IVR system, or when they’re on hold, because humans subconsciously use signals like how ‘real’ a voice sounds and background noise. Humans also use signals such as pauses and changing intonations as cues to know when someone is ready for us to ask a question.<br></p><p>Our current Natural Language Understanding model processes incoming voice through a speech-to-text engine first, thereby eliminating some of the audio-based nuances a human can use to guide a conversation. For some pharmacy calls it is hard to tell from just the text if the pharmacist is ready for questions, or if they still need us to wait on hold.<br></p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-e8df9944-846d-a16f-b8f6-397c33be13c7-f67b3b60"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edab43874bee849d9301d27/601a428d57edde3aa69996f5_2R137_qS0jIN5Stj5eP8EdQXxvr6bHXOQmWrNXDXOHJyIi5PtJ0YuYVmvVjsEk8vvep9tcw3rE2nnWCad2lg90OKuDL7xKPKX_HEDvpcHG57GKLMtPeQw866Hx64zSLrRMzdG5FK.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Consider the following examples of common phrases that can appear in the IVR, but are also commonly used by pharmacists:</p><p><strong>“How can I help you today?”</strong></p><p>In this case, the system expects a button press or a phrase like “speak to a pharmacist” to help direct the call. However, a pharmacist may use the exact same verbiage when picking up the phone, indicating that we should start asking our vaccine related questions.<br></p><p><strong>“Please hold for a moment.”</strong></p><p>If we interpret this as something to respond to, the IVR system can route our call in unexpected ways. However, if a pharmacist asks us to continue to hold and doesn’t hear a response right away, they often hang up.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>“Thank you for calling Rite Aid.”</strong></p><p>If we hear this in the IVR, we want to wait and listen to the menu options and press the appropriate number on a keypad. However, pharmacists also say this when picking up the phone. It is critical to ask questions as soon as we are connected to a pharmacist, otherwise they assume no one is on the line and will hang up.</p><p>‍</p><h4>3. Variation in responses from free-form questions</h4><figure id="w-node-_6c6157e9-3177-b5f2-8e36-9aad4be7a260-f67b3b60"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edab43874bee849d9301d27/601a428d59087960f81bd2d2_q_yj6nvFeOONto65FyIf6brM9LzBd2clk_84qdS71j074E-78rU1ifwmroEQmzGS1IuHoDOPoFOOrMRPaJslDBhMrUzqcTvn1yycIHzXvp0pIC9Be3-Yy5NoKSGtokqrLARF-8HJ.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Responses to yes or no questions can be understood at a much higher confidence with a smaller set of training data than open-ended questions. For example, the answer to “Where can appointments be made?” results in harder to understand responses like “Do the County of Alameda.”, which was a mistranscription of something like “Through the County of Alameda [website]”.</p><p>We also noticed that the chances of a pharmacist hanging up on us increased with the length of the call. Combined with the insight that the majority of volunteers’ phone calls never made it past the first question in the script, we realized we could streamline volunteer efforts by automating the question, “Is the vaccine available for those 65 and older?” Eva could pre-screen a much larger pool of sites, and have the volunteers follow-up only in cases where the answer was “yes”.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h2>Phase 3. Full Automation</h2><p>To automatically navigate IVRs, we collected the scripts that the IVR systems follow. As long as a location belongs to a pharmacy chain (e.g. Rite Aid) whose IVR we have automated, we know what the IVR will say, except for some minor variations like the location’s address. Using fuzzy matching, we built a state machine which responds with the appropriate key press or voice response until we are put on hold to connect to a pharmacist.<br></p><figure id="w-node-_8d2d4741-0562-fd84-5c48-0d60d3f721cb-f67b3b60"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edab43874bee849d9301d27/601a428e4e028a520cbea1bf_-FeYyvb_mX7wjwX-Zk85DYOpRlGnj9JVe12V4GWeqbBfIjLQ3p2ygjhoyr3sirf5yM0RaFTxuCDSJEbIptL1PUw12Kr2WoMee9H02yKPi98ZQurlsjJUtflNq4phrPcLQ7R49Xj2.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Once on hold, we get a continuous speech-to-text transcript and pass it to our trained model. If someone picks up and says something like “Hi, how can I help you today?”, the model classifies it as a greeting and Eva asks the covid vaccine availability question. We got around the confusion of phrases used in the IVR and by humans picking up by enabling the hold model only once the IVR portion of the call is complete.</p><p>Finally, for the conversation itself, we focused on one question: “Does your location have the covid-19 vaccine?” Because the volunteers use this data to determine which sites to call back, we want it to be as accurate as possible. If the system gets a response that it doesn’t understand yet (it’s still improving), it will ask a follow up question “Could you please answer yes or no. Do you have covid-19 vaccines?” If we still don’t get an understandable answer, we call back another time.<br></p><p>Each day, Eva calls pharmacies that haven’t been confirmed to have vaccines yet (since this information changes daily). These calls are now fully automated, from navigating each pharmacy’s automated IVR, detecting when a pharmacist is on the line, and finally extracting the response from the pharmacist and saying bye before hanging up.<br></p><p>We have been supplying the results of our calls to the volunteers at VaccinateCA, who then prioritize positive cases to confirm additional details (such as who’s eligible, how to make appointments, etc.).&nbsp;</p><h2>Beyond California</h2><p>Last week, we expanded our support to volunteer groups mirroring the efforts of VaccinateCA. We are now supporting groups in Colorado, Florida, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia.&nbsp;</p><h2>Our Impact</h2><figure id="w-node-_9943b8a9-7511-961f-4f76-5d17724f8253-f67b3b60"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edab43874bee849d9301d27/601a428e10a41b21690f668e_PbhUak00017R-LVSLvuO1md5n7GtubjnigyLepLSVf5Gbi4pIAJ7IdAqOxu2aNEGb0I0i7Hdg61Ejam2BPyhT2F4Az_EFGKC-zLOzmbSCALoQ5M93swtpog5DAJV5n_zolRoZduO.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Comment about Eva in the VaccinateCA Discord channel</figcaption></figure><p>Over the past two weeks, we have made over 10,000 calls to pharmacies across 8 states. After the initial implementation phase, we’ve mostly been able to sit back and let the machine do its job. The data we’ve provided back to the group has proved immensely valuable, increasing the efficacy of their volunteer callers by an order of magnitude.</p><blockquote>Working with Infinitus has been game-changing for our effort at VaccinateCA!

                                                        <p><strong>Researchers develop robust approach for detecting market manipulation</strong></p>

<p>Social media is increasingly used to spread fake news. The same problem can be found on the capital market – criminals spread fake news about companies in order to manipulate share prices. Researchers at the Universities of Göttingen and Frankfurt and the Jožef Stefan Institute in Ljubljana have developed an approach that can recognise such fake news, even when the news contents are repeatedly adapted. The results of the study were published in the Journal of the Association for Information Systems.</p>

<p>In order to detect false information – often fictitious data that presents a company in a positive light – the scientists used machine learning methods and created classification models that can be applied to identify suspicious messages based on their content and certain linguistic characteristics. "Here we look at other aspects of the text that makes up the message, such as the comprehensibility of the language and the mood that the text conveys," says Professor Jan Muntermann from the University of Göttingen.</p>

<p>The approach is already known in principle from its use by spam filters, for example. However, the key problem with the current methods is that to avoid being recognised, fraudsters continuously adapt the content and avoid certain words that are used to identify the fake news. This is where the researchers' new approach comes in: to identify fake news despite such strategies to evade detection, they combine models recently developed by the researchers in such a way that high detection rates and robustness come together. So even if "suspicious" words disappear from the text, the fake news is still recognised by its linguistic features. "This puts scammers into a dilemma. They can only avoid detection if they change the mood of the text so that it is negative, for instance," explains Dr Michael Siering. "But then they would miss their target of inducing investors to buy certain stocks."</p>

<p>The new approach can be used, for example, in market surveillance to temporarily suspend the trading of affected stocks. In addition, it offers investors valuable information to avoid falling for such fraud schemes. It is also possible that it could be used for criminal prosecutions in the future.</p>

        <p><em>Hey! Today I have something different for you. Itâ€™s a piece about the weird world of LinkedIn â€” from celebrity </em>workfluencers<em> to the strange social features that feel out of place. This is a guest essay from <a href="https://twitter.com/fadeke_adegbuyi">Fadeke Adegbuyi</a>, senior marketing manager at Doist and a fan of all things internet culture. I think youâ€™re going to like it! ðŸ˜†</em></p><p><em>- Nathan</em></p><p><em> </em>LinkedIn is the fucking worst.</p><p>Despite our collective confusion about the platform, its enthusiastic embrace by HR departments and recruiters has ensured its success. Even though it was <a href="https://news.linkedin.com/2020/july/a-message">forced to lay off 1,000 employees</a> because of the pandemic, they still increased their&nbsp;Q<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2020-Q4/press-release-webcast">4 revenue by 10%.</a> As of Q3 of 2020, the company has over 722 million users and is truly internationalâ€“â€“just 26% of their members are based in North America. With revenue largely powered by recruiting solutions, paid job listings, and advertising, LinkedIn knows how to appeal to businesses at scale. LinkedIn doesnâ€™t need <em>you</em> to like it.</p><p>But, the companyâ€™s consumer-side remains in the midst of a long-standing identity crisis. Feature bloat and odd idiosyncrasies make the site a superbly strange social network. Many of us have profiles but donâ€™t log in for months at a time. Our â€œAboutâ€� sections point to better ways to be reached. Others, seemingly alive and well, have claimed on their pages to have died.</p><p>LinkedIn bills itself as an online destination, like a conference held at a 5-star hotel where big thinkers give big speeches, deals get made in private corners, and you can â€œbuild and engage with your professional network.â€� But many of us see it as a not-so-funhouse, with wacky mirrors, jumpout surprises, and peculiar attractions. Can I interest you in a tour?</p><h2>Copy-Cat Cemetery&nbsp;</h2><p>LinkedIn recently released Stories, a vertical video feature copied from Instagram, who better stole it from Snapchat. LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/119760/linkedin-stories-overview?lang=en#:~:text=LinkedIn%20Stories%20enable%20members%20and,of%20their%20everyday%20professional%20moments.&amp;text=LinkedIn%20shares%20Stories%20that%20you,recent%20version%20of%20the%20app.">suggests</a> users â€œshare images and short videos of their everyday professional moments.â€� Released in the midst of a global pandemic during a mass migration to remote work, itâ€™s unclear whether we should showcase cramped work setups on kitchen tables or restless kindergarteners interrupting the 143rd minute of a Zoom.&nbsp;</p><p>Available only on LinkedIn's iOS and Android apps, this begs the question...<em><strong>Who is using LinkedIn on their phone?</strong></em> The platform would like you to believe that celebrities are. A permanent Story from LinkedIn shows a reel of workfluencers â€“â€“Mark Cuban, Arianna Huffington, Deepak Chopra â€“â€“ posting professionally shot high-definition videos of their work days.</p><p><a href="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_40ac9496-fcd6-4638-9b55-64f17ba91976_1600x1067.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_40ac9496-fcd6-4638-9b55-64f17ba91976_1600x1067.png"></a></p><p>A tagline ends the montage: â€œShare your story.â€� At last glance, only a single one of my 1000+ connections is using the feature.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast, Twitter is seeing early success with Fleets, their own copy-cat story feature that users have been receptive to, posting baby photos and dog pictures in between subtweets and shitposts. Feature imitation isnâ€™t a bad strategy. But LinkedIn Stories was dead on arrival. No one in the boardroom asked the critical question: <em>Who cares?</em></p><h2>The Audio Trolls</h2><p>Audio apps, like Clubhouse, Chalk, and Rodeo point to the power of sound-based social. Twitter released voice tweets earlier this spring and is currently working on an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">audio spaces feature</a>. LinkedIn has taken their own steps into voice with a handful of audio features. Like most things on the platform, they feel out of place.&nbsp;</p><p>The sentiment behind their name pronunciation feature on personal profiles is a positive one, but hasnâ€™t seen wide adoption for its intended purpose. Since the feature was launched, Iâ€™ve heard people with the most pronounceable of names use the feature for anything from inserting a 10-second clip from The Office to playing a song snippet at 2x speed. A now common but unintended use case is delightful trolling:</p><ul><li>At one point, Jeff Hui used the feature to ironically <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffistyping/status/1304947619651817477?s=21">shout an elevator pitch at recruiters</a></li><li>On Riva-Melissa Tezâ€™s profile, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/riva-melissa-tez-661a0aab/">she declares herself â€œQueen Beeâ€�</a></li><li>Ben Taylor, who includes â€œclick 4 soundâ€� in his name, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bentaylordata/">rickrolls his profile visitors</a></li></ul><p>On a site where people declare Ivy League associations, summa cum laude status, and internships at investment banks, cheeky irreverence for work culture warps the throughline of respectability that LinkedIn intends. Trolling LinkedIn, while on LinkedIn, is a break from the BusinessTM of polished headshots and corporately crafted â€œExperienceâ€� sections. Itâ€™s ironic participation on a platform where youâ€™re <em>meant</em> to be performing professionalism.&nbsp;</p><p>At times, it feels like LinkedIn is actively building features for the intended purpose of trolling. Within LinkedIn messages, users can hold down a microphone icon to record their voice. An audio snippet is an oddly intimate option for starting a professional conversation with a stranger. Perhaps thatâ€™s the point. But attempting to speed up relationships with overly familiar features is a â€œpersonal touchâ€� unwelcome in the world of networking, already so fraught with faux pas.</p><p>An innocent but outlandish 39-second audio message, sent by â€œ<a href="https://twitter.com/okcandice_/status/1285956830045380608?s=21">Jimmy from LinkedIn</a>â€� went viral as a case of networking-gone-not-quite-right:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>â€œHello Candice, how are you doing and good morning. How have you been? Hey Candice, this is me, Jimmy from LinkedIn. And the reason I was giving you this quick voice message call was to say thank you so kindly. I really appreciate that you have accepted me here on the LinkedIn platform. What we will do is learn from each-other. I appreciate your kindness. Jimmy from LinkedIn.â€�</blockquote><p>Though it doesnâ€™t feel malicious, itâ€™s just <em>off</em> to encounter this kind of weirdness in the same space you seek new job opportunities and professional updates from former colleagues and classmates. Itâ€™s the stuff that makes you pause and say, <em>Where am I?</em></p><h2>InMail Infinity</h2><p>The premise of the platform, bringing professionals together, is a challenging one from the start. People hate networking. Also, theyâ€™re bad at it.&nbsp;</p><p>For users, LinkedIn â€œnetworkingâ€� often means receiving a barrage of InMail and connection requests. You might recognize some or all of these:</p><ol><li><strong>The bad sales pitch</strong>: Sales people and business development people will slide into DMs to peddle their companyâ€™s products, whether youâ€™re the right person to buy or not. Usually not.</li><li><strong>The professional neg</strong>: Recruiters ask senior level employees if theyâ€™re interested in entry level roles or, better yet, internships.</li><li><strong>The just-in-case connection</strong>: Industry peers will suggest itâ€™s â€œmutually beneficialâ€� to connect, but donâ€™t specify these benefits up front.</li><li><strong>The endangered business school</strong>: Admissions teams are now online shilling once-coveted seats in their dwindling MBA programs. Based on your profile and experience, they think youâ€™re a â€œgreat fitâ€� and want you to apply.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The eager seeker</strong>: Some people see LinkedIn messages as an alternative resume and cover letter submission portal. This is why that endless string of people in your messages inquire about roles outside your departmentâ€¦ or outside your company.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The LinkedIn team</strong>: If their emails notifying you about connection requests wasnâ€™t enough, LinkedIn also maintains a direct line to your InMail. Expect prompts to try Premium, credits to advertise your company, and messages about whatever else theyâ€™re feeling.</li><li><strong>The proposition</strong>: Linkedin stands in the long-tradition of <em>every</em> site becoming a dating site. Or, er, a place to sexually harass people. If you havenâ€™t gotten one of these messages in your InMail, you know someone who has.</li></ol><p><a href="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_de8db43f-b1b6-454a-83a2-fe92f9bed869_1600x480.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_de8db43f-b1b6-454a-83a2-fe92f9bed869_1600x480.png"></a></p><p>Overfull InMail and random connection requests feels like a never-ending chore. You get enough work emails and donâ€™t need any more. LinkedInâ€™s constant drip of communication is just more work on top of the real work you have to do.&nbsp;</p><p>Linkedinâ€™s inbox infinity isnâ€™t just annoyingâ€”it detracts from the usability of the platform. Unless youâ€™re embracing a new position of processing and answering everything that comes through, if a real connection came along, how would you know?</p><h2>The Cursed Timeline</h2><p>At any given point on your LinkedIn timeline, youâ€™ll see a corporate blog post shared by someone you know, a marketing sales pitch from someone you donâ€™t, and a news story about COVID-19. Their timeline is similar in this way to other social networks, where you see posts made or liked by your connections, people and brands you follow, and promoted posts that people pay to get in front of you. This cacophony of content is bizarre, but not atypical â€“â€“ social feeds optimize for engagement, here as everywhere.&nbsp;</p><p>Whatâ€™s uniquely odd about LinkedIn is that it is not unique. â€œThe professional networkâ€� is still just a social network. Though the topics of the posts in your timeline may be on the world of work, diving into the comments, you can see polarization in action. Inspirational posts on giving parents grace while working from home during the pandemic have angry rants suggesting that kids are a personal choice and their burden shouldnâ€™t be foisted upon colleagues. Beneath articles on workplace harassment, sympathetic discussions ensue on why someone might naturally retaliate after being romantically rebuffed. A political article about the 2020 US presidential election draws comments on whether former President Barack Obama was really Black.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_96580804-aafd-41cc-896c-028a895490d6_1600x272.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_96580804-aafd-41cc-896c-028a895490d6_1600x272.png"></a></p><p>In a time when the collective conversation is consumed by the topic of human cancellation, people readily post things on LinkedIn that make them fireable or unhireable.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_758c1270-4c2a-4e06-8dbc-7dc0e356a568_1600x540.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_758c1270-4c2a-4e06-8dbc-7dc0e356a568_1600x540.png"></a></p><p>While these comments are nothing new in terms of online culture, they feel out of bounds on a professional website where people use their full names and disclose precisely where they work and the city they live in. In the alternate universe of LinkedIn, cancel culture either doesnâ€™t exist, its inhabitants are blissfully unaware, or they simply donâ€™t care.</p><p><a href="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_befe2496-abfd-4e7a-a29f-8dc8a3889521_1600x259.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_befe2496-abfd-4e7a-a29f-8dc8a3889521_1600x259.png"></a></p><h2>The Rockstar Recruiters</h2><p>The strangest of Linkedinâ€™s features isnâ€™t a feature at all; itâ€™s a specific set of power users.&nbsp;</p><p>Every platform has its royalty.

is that we’re tool builders. I read a study that measured the efficiency of
locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least
energy to move a kilometer. Humans came in with a rather unimpressive
showing about a third of the way down the list. It was not too proud a
showing for the crown of creation. So, that didn’t look so good.</p><p>But then, somebody at Scientific American had the insight to test the
efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle. And, a man on a bicycle, a
human on a bicycle, blew the condor away, completely off the top of the
charts.</p><p>And that’s what a computer is to me. What a computer is to me is it’s the
most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with.</p><p>It’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lvMgMrNDlg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=322">Steve Jobs (1980)</a></p></blockquote><p>* * *</p><p><a href="https://www.it-hiroshima.ac.jp/institution/library/pdf/research52%5F007-013.pdf">No one knows</a> when or how we, the human species, started talking to each
other. It is likely a natural progression from gesturing, but we can only
speculate about it.</p><p>Language allowed us to break out of our brains and reveal the inner
workings of our consciousness to others.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/language_speech.jpg" alt="Figure 2: Scott H.

Young</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Language is the vessel that carried us from the stone age through the
agricultural revolution, the development of written language, the
scientific and industrial revolutions, and now, the digital age.</p><p>Writing allowed us to <em>offload</em> memories to the physical world—outside of
our brains. Through our collective and external memories, each generation
has a head start on the previous one. Little by little, standing on the
shoulders of taller and taller giants, we accumulate knowledge about
ourselves and everything around us.</p><p>We’ve been for long using tools to help us think: notebooks help us
calculate formulas, reason geometrically and preserve our ideas. With
computers, our <em>thinking</em> is now occurring outside of our brains.</p><p>Computers are extensions of our minds in that they allow us to store,
process, and retrieve information from them. With the advent of the
internet we now have immediate access to not only almost all of the
information ever produced by humankind but also to reproducible <em>thinking</em>
encoded into these machines: algorithms.</p><p>Our brain is still a much more impressive device than any of today's
computers. Computers learn
<a href="https://www.davidsilver.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/nfsp-1.pdf">mostly</a>
by finding patterns in massive
quantities of examples given by us. Teaching a young kid about cars—how
to recognize one, what they are, what their purpose is, and how they're
related to other things—requires little supervision. Noam Chomsky talks
about it in
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdUbIlwHRkY&amp;t=1462">this interview</a>.</p><p>Each of these processes—storing, processing and retrieving
information—have concrete effects on the physical world: if I’m in
Munich, saying “show route to Hamburg” to my phone will immediately show me
the distance, ETAs and paths for different types of transport to reach my
destination. Not only do I now suddenly know how to navigate across the
country to reach another city, I’m also able to follow through the exact
path via GPS—a sixth sense giving me perfect geolocation!</p><p>These <em>things</em> that we created—computers, and the internet—are literally
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6502424/">rewiring our brains</a>, right now, shaping how we think, and engage in social
relationships, changing not only our individual selves but the societies we
live in.</p><p>They started as mechanical machines that filled entire laboratories, turned
into beige boxes in our homes and places of work, and are now sleek slabs
of plastic, metal and glass in everyone’s pockets. Step by step they get
closer to our bodies, their interfaces more intuitive and natural.</p><p>The way we communicate with them is changing: before, we could only
interact with them by speaking their language. We have now taught them
ours. The torch of progress blazes on: it’s a matter of <em>time</em> until they’re
connected directly with our brains—which is equally terrifying and
awe-inspiring.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/neuralink.jpg" alt="Figure 3: Neuralink"><figcaption><p>Figure 3: <a href="https://neuralink.com/">Neuralink</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Brain-computer interfaces present a monumental scientific and engineering
challenge, and brain-to-brain, a whole other category of difficulty.</p><p>First, we have no idea how information is encoded in the brain. That needs
to be understood. Second, even assuming we’re able to take a perfect
snapshot of a piece of information in someone’s brain—for example, how a
particular movie scene makes them feel—we still need to be able to encode
it in a way that includes the full context of their subjective experiences.
Maybe the scene evokes unique memories of their childhood or is somehow
entangled with the smell of a particular cinema’s leather seats. Third, we
need to figure out how to safely write this perfect snapshot into someone
else’s brain in a way that can be perceived identically.</p><p>Which is to say, it’s a difficult problem. But a worthwhile one: imagine
having the capability to suddenly become aware of answers for questions you
just thought about. To expertly control <a href="https://youtu.be/PLk8Pm%5FXBJE?t=13">truly integrated</a> prosthetics giving
you superhuman abilities. To give movement to the paralized, sound to the
deaf, and sight to the blind.</p><p>What would be the impacts on society if we were able to communicate an
order of magnitude more effectively? What if <em>everyone</em> was equipped with
the same undisputed basic knowledge of history and science?</p><p>There are internal thoughts that we can attempt to describe with a thousand
words, but ultimately fail to capture in a way that’s precise, much less
comprehensible by someone else. Words and sentences are an incomplete
representation of our internal thoughts. In the same way that 3D objects
cast 2D shadows (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0WjV6MmCyM">and 4D, 3D</a>) communicating through language doesn’t carry
all of our cultural and developmental context—transmitting all of that
along with every phrase would be impractical. Language is in this sense,
lossily compressed thought.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/tesseract_shadow.jpg"></figure><p>Inert strings of words of ink and paper take a life of their own inside our
heads. It’s why the exact same information can be interpreted completely
differently by different people.</p><p>Before language, fire and cooking technology allowed us to reallocate
energy usage from the digestive system to the brain by outsourcing
digestion to outside of our bodies, making macronutrients more efficiently
absorbable. Almost all of a cooked meal is metabolized by the body, whereas
raw foods yield less than half of their nutrients.</p><p>Cooking is an extension of our digestive system, and enabled us to develop
large, calorie-hungry brains. It also gave us time to think: our primate
cousins spend half of their days chewing raw food to consume enough
calories to stay alive.</p><p>Brains can be seen as <em>survival machines</em>, locked inside dark skulls,
constantly building a model of the outside world by predicting and learning
through senses and memory. The biological human brain evolved to have the
necessary sophistication to not only expertly navigate and understand the
brute physical reality but also to construct <em>social</em> reality. Democracy,
religion, money: all made up by us, for us.</p><p>We remember the past so that we can predict the future, and by doing so, we
thrive.</p><p>We create technology, which functions as a non-biological extra layer to
our brains and bodies, augmenting, complementing, and sometimes replacing
our natural capabilities.</p><blockquote><p>The wheel… is an extension of the foot.</p><p>The book… is an extension of the eye…</p><p>Clothing, an extension of the skin…</p><p>Electric circuitry, an extension of the central nervous system.</p><p>—
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_Media">Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man (1964)</a></p></blockquote><p>Relatively speaking, we are done evolving <em>biologically</em>. Further adaptations
and enhancements to our bodies and minds will come through technology.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/brain_layers.jpg" alt="Figure 5: Check out &amp;ldquo;Neuralink and the Brain&amp;rsquo;s Magical Future&amp;rdquo; for a very entertaining primer on the brain."><figcaption><p>Figure 5: Check out “<a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html">Neuralink and the Brain’s Magical Future</a>” for a very entertaining primer on the brain.</p></figcaption></figure><p>To be human is to have the ability to change the world around us. The shift
from hunting and gathering to farming allowed us to spend less energy to
acquire food while giving us a predictable calorie supply.</p><p>The resulting food surplus made it possible for populations to settle down
and grow quickly while supporting people not being directly involved in the
production of food—before agriculture that was everyone’s job. For one,
it allowed some to specialize and focus on developing better farming tools
and more resistant crops, starting a vicious cycle of improvement and
consumption that continues until today.</p><p>The transition from active foraging to a more sedentary lifestyle resulted
in worse health for the general population. The average farmer worked
harder than the average forager and got a worse diet in return. Our teeth,
bones and joints became more fragile, and we became afflicted by novel
diseases coming from newly domesticated animals, carriers of pathogens that
incubated in our new densely populated cities.</p><p>Owning land suddenly became really important. Agriculture and the concept
of private property reinforced each other and grew together, allowing us to
create value and secure the fruits of our labor. It also created the
circumstances for slavery to arise, and wars to be waged.</p><p>The groups of people growing the first crops could not have anticipated all
of the collateral effects of their breakthrough. They just wanted more
food.</p><p>If the past has taught us anything is that we have to be mindful of the
consequences of our progress. In an increasingly connected world, change is
often <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/05/linear-thinking-in-a-nonlinear-world">nonlinear</a> and unpredictable. Cars didn’t just replace horses—they
forever changed the entire outlook of every city. Did Tim Berners-Lee
anticipate his invention adding to forces pulling whole countries apart?</p><p>Our progress will continue to bring us previously unimaginable challenges.
Against an unknowable future, it doesn’t hurt to keep improving our
capabilities to adapt and, more difficultly, to cooperate—especially at
scale.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/humanity.jpg" alt="Figure 6: &amp;ldquo;Humanity&amp;rdquo; by Pawel Kuczynski"><figcaption><p>Figure 6: “<a href="https://www.pictorem.com/24592/humanity.html">Humanity</a>” by Pawel Kuczynski</p></figcaption></figure><p>Computers are getting pretty good at driving cars—even in the most

<p>curl is an internet transfer engine. A rather modular one too. Parts of curl’s functionality is provided by selectable alternative implementations that we call <em>backends</em>. You select what backends to enable at build-time and in many cases the backends are enabled and powered by different 3rd party libraries.</p>



<h2>Many backends</h2>



<p>curl has a range of such alternative backends for various features: </p>



<ol><li>International Domain Names</li><li>Name resolving</li><li>TLS</li><li>SSH</li><li>HTTP/3</li><li>HTTP content encoding</li><li>HTTP</li></ol>



<h2>Stable API and ABI</h2>



<p>Maintaining a stable API and ABI is key to libcurl. As long as those promises are kept, changing internals such as switching between backends is perfectly fine.</p>



<p>The API is the armored front door that we don’t change. The backends is the garden on the back of the house that we can dig up and replant every year if we want, without us having to change the front door.</p>



<h2>TLS backends</h2>



<p>Already back in 2005 we added support for using an alternative TLS library in curl when we added support for GnuTLS in addition to OpenSSL, and since then we’ve added many more.  We do this by having an internal API through which we do all the TLS related things and for each third party library we support we have code that does the necessary logic to connect the internal API with the corresponding TLS library.</p>



<h2>rustls</h2>



<p>Today, we merged support for yet another TLS library: <strong><a href="https://github.com/ctz/rustls">rustls</a></strong>. This is a TLS library written in rust and it has a C API provided in a separate project called <a href="https://github.com/abetterinternet/crustls/">crustls</a>. Strictly speaking, curl is built to use crustls.</p>



<p>This is still early days for the rustls backend and it is not yet feature complete. There’s more work to do and polish to apply before we can think of it as a proper competitor to the already established and well-used TLS backends, but with this merge it makes it much easier for more people to help out and test it out. Feel free and encouraged to join in!</p>



<p>We count this addition as the <strong>14th</strong> concurrently supported TLS library in curl. I’m not aware of any other project, anywhere, that supports more or even this many TLS libraries.</p>

<h2>rustls again!</h2>



<p>The TLS library named <a href="https://mesalink.io/">mesalink</a> is actually already using rustls, but under an OpenSSL API disguise and we support that since a few years back…</p>



<h2>Credits</h2>



<p>The TLS backend code for rustls was written and contributed by Jacob Hoffman-Andrews.</p>

<p>Until now, most cybersecurity efforts have focused on controlling network access by outsiders or end users. The greatest harm, however, is likely to come from insiders—system administrators, network architects, system analysts, developers, and site reliability engineers—who often have authorized access to data, networks, and applications. They may misuse or abuse their access to steal or damage sensitive data. Breaches may also occur unintentionally due to lax security protocols. It’s estimated that <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/insider-threats-reponsible-for-43/" rel=" noopener">43% of all breaches are committed by insiders</a>—both accidental and intentional.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Probably one of the most infamous examples of intentional insider breaches is the case of Edward Snowden, a Booz Allen contractor working with the NSA. In 2013, Snowden, stole nearly 2 million intelligence files in what is considered one of the biggest thefts of US secrets in history. As a system administrator and architect, Snowden had unlimited access to NSA systems, and he was also <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-09/pentagon-finds-snowden-took-1-7-million-files-rogers-says" rel=" noopener">able to access files from other sites, including those of other countries</a>.<sup>2</sup> The incursions continue to occur. In 2019, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/former-twitter-employees-charged-with-spying-for-saudi-arabia-by-digging-into-the-accounts-of-kingdom-critics/2019/11/06/2e9593da-00a0-11ea-8bab-0fc209e065a8_story.html" rel=" noopener">two Twitter employees were charged with spying</a> for Saudi Arabia by accessing information on Saudi Arabian dissidents who used the Twitter platform.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Even when organizations secure their own systems internally, the threat of intrusion through third parties remains. The more third parties that may access your IT data and networks, the higher the risk of a breach. One of the more publicized early breaches involved the hack of Target’s point of sale systems using the login of an approved HVAC supplier, resulting in stolen data of 40 million debit and credit cards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bad actors present credentials that make them appear to be insiders. Marriott revealed unauthorized hacking had exposed the personal information of 383 million guests—and that the hacking had occurred undetected for nearly five years. The company blamed Chinese hackers for the breach. In high-risk geographies, government agencies may cross the line as well. Hostile state actors may be using hardware attacks that can’t be detected until the stolen information is used months or years later.</p>
<p>The move to cloud-based computing only compounds the problem, since there is limited accountability and control over the personnel at IT cloud platform providers who are able to access your files. A data breach at Capital One in early 2019 exposed the personal data of over 100 million bank customers and applicants—including social security numbers, credit scores, dates of birth, and linked bank account numbers. The perpetrator was a former cloud employee, who boasted online about what she’d done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The costs of these threats are enormous. In addition to direct financial losses in the millions of dollars and a negative impact on the stock price, disclosure of trade secrets may have long-term implications. Business reputation take a hit as customers lose confidence in the company’s ability to safeguard personal information. There may be fines for noncompliance with privacy regulations, such as GDPR in Europe or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), or significant regulatory implications in some industries. Marriott was hit with a $123 million GDPR fine. The fine against British Airways for exposing payment and personal information of 500,000 customers was even worse: $230 million.</p></span></p>

Starting her career as a programmer and switching to law, Heather has been focused on software licensing for the last 25 years. She's worked with some of the most famous open source software companies and projects in the world and has an amazingly balanced view of the space and the role that licensing can/should and does play within the ecosystem. We were able to cover the history of open source, interpretations of different licenses and examples of projects/companies that are getting it right.</p><p>As we got deeper into the discussion, I asked Heather if there was a point where the licensing changed to enable the successful open source projects we see today. She had this to say which was an amazing point of view coming from someone with so much experience in the space:</p><p><em>The reason it was successful is that it was a great product. I don’t mean to be flippant but without that, the license wouldn’t have worked. It’s the license that serves the business and not vice versa.</em></p><p>If you are thinking about which license to use for your open source project or what makes the most sense for your business, you should definitely listen to this talk. </p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>-Ben</p></div><h2>Episode Transcript</h2><div><p><strong>Heather, thank you for your time. It's great to have you on. For the readers, do you want to give us a brief overview of who you are and why I'm talking to you?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Thank you for having me on. I'm a lawyer and a venture capitalist, and in both of those roles I focus heavily on open source software. A bit of color about that: I've been a lawyer in Silicon Valley for about 25 years. Before that, I was once a computer programmer, and it was long ago that we called ourselves “computer programmers.” Everything I did professionally in computing is outdated now, but I've had fun learning from my clients over the years. As a lawyer, I am essentially a technology transactions lawyer, meaning that I do licensing and commercial deals. My specialty has always been software licensing, because software is interesting to me. A few years, I got involved in a venture capital fund, Open Source Software Capital, which focuses entirely on early-stage commercial open source companies. One of the reasons I did that was that my law practice had become more and more about advising people on business strategy around open source. That is inextricably bound up with licensing strategy. It was a more natural move than you might expect for a lawyer-type like me. Now those things are dovetailing nicely. I spent a lot of time talking to small companies about how to set their business and licensing strategy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I remember the first time I heard the phrase or came into contact with open source software was a CD on the front of a magazine in 1995. It was a copy of Slack for Linux. I remember me and my friends were spending days and days trying to get it up and running. It meant that we could stop programming because we had Sonos terminal at the time at the university. It meant that we could start coding at home instead of having to go and see the university. When did you first hear the phrase?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It probably was around that time, 1995, 1996. At that time, I had been a lawyer for a brief amount of time and my clients were asking me about the software. They asked, “Can we use this software under this license?” They were referring to various licenses, a lot of them permissive, like MIT licenses and so forth, but also licenses like GPL and LGPL, which nobody in the legal community understood at the time. At that time, I was boots on the ground in terms of clients saying, “Can we do this? Can we use this?” It was free and they wanted to use it. The general attitude of lawyers at that time was like when your mother says, “Don't put that in your mouth, you don't know where it's been.”&nbsp;</p><p>They considered open source dangerous, but the reason they considered it dangerous was it didn't come from a commercial vendor. It could have infringement issues and so forth. Most of the lawyers at that time were saying, “No, you can't use that.” I realized quickly, because I was the one that they were asking every day, that was the wrong answer. It had to be, “Yes, but,” instead of “No.” I thought, I need to figure out what is that condition, “Yes, but if you do this, you can use it.” There was nobody in the law trying to figure that out from that perspective at that time. I looked around and there wasn't any information about it. There's a lot of philosophy about open source. There wasn't much that was for somebody who was making this decision on a practical level day to day on behalf of a private enterprise.&nbsp;</p><p>I started developing those things myself and trying to learn more and more about it. The rule of being in an organization is that if you know 10% more than the person in the next room, you're the expert. People kept asking me about this stuff and I kept trying to answer the best I could, with little to go on. More people asked me questions and I learned more, and gave more answers, and it kept snowballing. I thought, “This will go away. It will be the flavor of the month.” It never went away. After the internet bust in around 2000, 2001, it took off. That's when I decided that this was going to be my area. This is what I'm going to do with my legal career.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You didn't have that light bulb moment when you came into contact with it in ‘95 or ‘96 that like, “This is going to change the world.” I didn’t. I thought it was great that someone was giving this operating system away for free, but I remember I discovered the web around the same time. It's within a minute of using Mosaic that you knew the world was never going to be the same.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I don't think many people realized it. The reason was that at that time, open source was considered a hobbyist thing. People could not have foreseen how widely accepted it would become, much less becoming the entire backbone of the internet, which everybody perceived immediately was going to change the world. It was the internet bust that caused it to skyrocket, because people were casting around desperately to save money. All of these big companies that otherwise never would have considered Linux seriously, all of a sudden they started saying, “We're going to throw our hats in the ring here.” That in itself was the amazing thing to me. It got people to collaborate in a way that they had never collaborated before. That was the sea change. Businesses started saying, “We can collaborate with our worst competitors on this infrastructure stuff.” That was what changed things for me.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I was working around that time. I was an engineer. I remember hearing how much people or my clients were paying 6, 7 digits for software that you wouldn't dream of paying anything for nowadays. What were the risks for someone who's not legally minded? What was the thing that was frightening people at that time? What's the worst case?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>First, beyond any real risk, people just didn't understand the licenses. People don't like things they don't understand. Not understanding things is risk. Let's lay that aside, because that's irrational. The real risk that they were worried about from a legal point of view was that the software would be infringing, and that can happen one of two ways. One way is that somebody took something they didn't have the right to use and put it in the software. In legal terms, that would be either copyright infringement or trade secret misappropriation, depending on how they did it and how much they copied and so forth. The other risk is quite different, and that's patent infringement. That can happen even if you don't improperly take something else.&nbsp;</p><p>For years and years, people had been buying software from commercial vendors who gave them some comfort in the form of an indemnity. If the software was infringing, that vendor would take care of that problem for them. With open source, you usually don't have that. There are some vendors now who offer indemnities, but at the time there was no such thing at all. People were concerned that if they used software and it was infringing, then they would be flapping out in the wind and there would be no vendor to help them.&nbsp;</p></div><div><blockquote>“<!-- -->They asked, “Can we use this software under this license?” They were referring to various licenses, a lot of them permissive like MIT licenses and so forth, but also licenses GPL and LGPL which nobody in the legal community understood at the time. <!-- -->”</blockquote></div><div><p><strong>It's where the buck stops if there's a problem. Talk a bit about the history of that. Which side was driving that? Was it the commercial side of the internet driving the changing in feelings and the licensing around that, or was it the other way around?</strong></p><p>What changed it was that people decided they needed something inexpensive enough that they were willing to bear the risk. At the same time, commercial vendors, like famously Microsoft, although they had changed their tune by now, they were creating what people call FUD -- Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt -- about these issues because they were competing with Linux. If I can make an aside, it’s interesting that at the time, Windows was so dominant that the only thing that could have competed with it was not a commercial product. All of a sudden, they had this competition and they were trying to throw shade on it. They caused people to change the way they've thought about it. Interestingly, a lot of lawyers still have these ideas in their mind that come from that time and the FUD that Microsoft created. We even see provisions in documents that came from that time. They were effective in causing people to be concerned about it because they were competing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>That was several years ago. I remember that time well.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Lawyers are slow to change. What they do is they go, “I know about this risk. I have to identify it. That's my job.” It's difficult to get them to stop when the risk is no longer significant anymore.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>One of the things I've noticed when I've …</strong></p></div></div></div>

<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>In the previous parts of this series we studied the core of the CPython interpreter and saw how the most fundamental aspects of Python are implemented. We made an overview of <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">the CPython VM</a>, took a look at <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">the CPython compiler</a>, stepped through <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/">the CPython source code</a>, studied <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-4-how-python-bytecode-is-executed/">how the VM executes the bytecode</a> and learned <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-5-how-variables-are-implemented-in-cpython/">how variables work</a>. In the two most recent posts we focused on <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-6-how-python-object-system-works/">the Python object system</a>. We learned what Python objects and Python types are, how they are defined and what determines their behavior. This discussion gave us a good understanding of how Python objects work in general. What we haven't discussed is how particular objects, such as strings, integers and lists, are implemented. In this and several upcoming posts we'll cover the implementations of the most important and most interesting built-in types. The subject of today's post is <code>int</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h2>Why Python integers are interesting</h2>
<p>Integers require no introduction. They are so ubiquitous and seem so basic that you may doubt whether it's worth discussing how they are implemented at all. Yet, Python integers are interesting because they are not just 32-bit or 64-bit integers that CPUs work with natively. Python integers are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic">arbitrary-precision integers</a>, also known as bignums. This means that they can be as large as we want, and their sizes are only limited by the amount of available memory.</p>
<p>Bignums are handy to work with because we don't need to worry about such things as integer overflows and underflows. They are extensively used in fields like cryptography and computer algebra where large numbers arise all the time and must be represented precisely. So, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_arbitrary-precision_arithmetic_software">many</a> programming languages have bignums built-in. These include Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Haskell, Erlang, Julia, Racket. Others provide bignums as a part of the standard library. These include Go, Java, C#, D, PHP. Numerous third-party libraries implement bignums. The most popular one is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Multiple_Precision_Arithmetic_Library">the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library</a> (GMP). It provides a C API but has bindings for all major languages.</p>
<p>There are a lot of bignum implementations. They're different in detail, but the general approach to implement bignums is the same. Today we'll see what this approach looks like and use CPython's implementation as a reference example. The two main questions we'll have to answer are:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to represent bignums; and</li>
<li>how to performs arithmetic operations, such as addition and multiplication, on bignums.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll also discuss how CPython's implementation compares to others and what CPython does to make integers more efficient. </p>
<h2>Bignum representation</h2>
<p>Think for a moment how you would represent large integers in your program if you were to implement them yourself. Probably the most obvious way to do that is to store an integer as a sequence of digits, just like we usually write down numbers. For example, the integer <code>51090942171709440000</code> could be represented as <code>[5, 1, 0, 9, 0, 9, 4, 2, 1, 7, 1, 7, 0, 9, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]</code>. This is essentially how bignums are represented in practice. The only important difference is that instead of base 10, much larger bases are used. For example, CPython uses base 2^15 or base 2^30 depending on the platform. What's wrong with base 10? If we represent each digit in a sequence with a single byte but use only 10 out of 256 possible values, it would be very memory-inefficient. We could solve this memory-efficiency problem if we use base 256, so that each digit takes a value between 0 and 255. But still much larger bases are used in practice. The reason for that is because larger base means that numbers have less digits, and the less digits numbers have, the faster arithmetic operations are performed. The base cannot be arbitrary large. It's typically limited by the size of the integers that the CPU can work with. We'll see why this is the case when we discuss bignum arithmetic in the next section. Now let's take a look at how CPython represents bignums.</p>
<p>Everything related to the representation of Python integers can be found in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/Include/longintrepr.h"><code>Include/longintrepr.h</code></a>. Technically, Python integers are instances of <code>PyLongObject</code>, which is defined in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/Include/longobject.h"><code>Include/longobject.h</code></a>, but <code>PyLongObject</code> is actually a typedef for <code>struct _longobject</code> that is defined in <code>Include/longintrepr.h</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>struct</span> <span>_longobject</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyVarObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span> <span>// expansion of PyObject_VAR_HEAD macro</span>
    <span>digit</span> <span>ob_digit</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>];</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This struct extends <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyVarObject"><code>PyVarObject</code></a>, which in turn extends <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject"><code>PyObject</code></a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_size</span><span>;</span> <span>/* Number of items in variable part */</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyVarObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So, besides a reference count and a type that all Python objects have, an integer object has two other members: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>ob_size</code> that comes from <code>PyVarObject</code>; and </li>
<li><code>ob_digit</code> that is defined in <code>struct _longobject</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>ob_digit</code> member is a pointer to an array of digits. On 64-bit platforms, each digit is a 30-bit integer that takes values between 0 and 2^30-1 and is stored as an unsigned 32-bit int (<code>digit</code> is a typedef for <code>uint32_t</code>). On 32-bit platforms, each digit is a 15-bit integer that takes values between 0 and 2^15-1 and is stored as an unsigned 16-bit int (<code>digit</code> is a typedef for <code>unsigned short</code>). To make things concrete, in this post we'll assume that digits are 30 bits long.</p>
<p>The <code>ob_size</code> member is a signed int, whose absolute value tells us the number of digits in the <code>ob_digit</code> array. The sign of <code>ob_size</code> indicates the sign of the integer. Negative <code>ob_size</code> means that the integer is negative. If <code>ob_size</code> is 0, then the integer is 0.</p>
<p>Digits are stored in a little-endian order. The first digit (<code>ob_digit[0]</code>) is the least significant, and the last digit (<code>ob_digit[abs(ob_size)-1]</code>) is the most significant.</p>
<p>Finally, the absolute value of an integer is calculated as follows: </p>
<p>$$val = ob\_digit[0] \times (2 ^{30})^0 + ob\_digit[1] \times (2 ^{30})^1 + \cdots + ob\_digit[|ob\_size| - 1] \times (2 ^{30})^{|ob\_size| - 1}$$</p>
<p>Let's see what all of this means with an example. Suppose we have an integer object that has <code>ob_digit = [3, 5, 1]</code> and <code>ob_size = -3</code>. To compute its value, we can do the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$ python -q</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>base</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>**</span><span>30</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>-</span><span>(</span><span>3</span> <span>*</span> <span>base</span><span>**</span><span>0</span> <span>+</span> <span>5</span> <span>*</span> <span>base</span><span>**</span><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>*</span> <span>base</span><span>**</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>
<span>-1152921509975556099</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now let's do the reverse. Suppose we want to get the bignum representation of the number <code>51090942171709440000</code>. Here's how we can do that:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>51090942171709440000</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>x</span> <span>%</span> <span>base</span>
<span>952369152</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span><span>)</span> <span>%</span> <span>base</span>
<span>337507546</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span><span>)</span> <span>%</span> <span>base</span>
<span>44</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span><span>)</span> <span>%</span> <span>base</span>
<span>0</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So, <code>ob_digit = [952369152, 337507546, 44]</code> and <code>ob_size = 3</code>. Actually, we don't even have to compute the digits, we can get them by inspecting the integer object using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#module-ctypes"><code>ctypes</code></a> standard library:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>ctypes</span>

<p>As you might guess, the representation of bignums is an easy part. The main challenge is to implement arithmetic operations and to implement them efficiently.</p>
<h2>Bignum arithmetic</h2>
<p>We learned in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-6-how-python-object-system-works/">part 6</a> that the behavior of a Python object is determined by the object's type. Each member of a type, called slot, is responsible for a particular aspect of the object's behavior. So, to understand how CPython performs arithmetic operations on integers, we need to study the slots of the <code>int</code> type that implement those operations.</p>
<p>In the C code, the <code>int</code> type is called <code>PyLong_Type</code>. It's defined in <code>Objects/longobject.c</code> as follows:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PyTypeObject</span> <span>PyLong_Type</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyVarObject_HEAD_INIT</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>PyType_Type</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>

<h3 id="introduction"><a name="Introduction"></a> Introduction</h3>
<p>The question of whether or not the worldview and practice—for <i>practice</i> it intentionally is—going variously by the names “<a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-social-justice/">Social Justice</a>,” “<a href="https://newdiscourses.com/2020/02/naming-enemy-critical-social-justice/">Critical Social Justice</a>,” or, more colloquially, “<a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-woke-wokeness/">Woke</a>” constitutes a religion is one of some general interest that seems to be growing. Until quite recently, we maintained the luxury of not having to treat the matter more deeply than as something of a curio of sociocultural philosophy, however important the issue may be. I have contended, for example, that Critical Social Justice constitutes a religion of sorts (a <i>postmodern one</i>, as I <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/2020/06/postmodern-religion-faith-social-justice/">laid it out</a> at considerable length; a nominally “<a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-antiracism/"><i>anti-racist</i></a>” one, as Columbia University professor John McWhorter is <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/antiracism-our-flawed-new-religion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tackling</a> it currently, at book length) and must be thought of as such, at least by everyday citizens—though not by the law. Those were simpler times.</p>
<p>Now things are quite different and much more serious, so a much more serious inquiry is demanded of us. This escalation arrives not so much due to the externally obvious reasons like how profoundly parallel to religion Critical Social Justice and its practice have become—literally washing black people’s feet in the streets through tearful apologies against whiteness—but more because of its rapid and seemingly unstoppable penetration into our public institutions, including government at every level and, more importantly, our public schools.</p>
<p>It is nearly always a question of considerable importance and some urgency when an ideology, especially when it comprises a totalizing worldview, decides that it is to be the fundamental basis for how we organize society and educate our children, to say nothing of other legal concerns. This, to be certain, is happening now with astonishing rapidity. The overwhelming majority of our schools systems’ teacher training over the summer of 2020, to prepare teachers for the new mostly-online educational demands for the coming fall term, have been heavily, if not exclusively, about issues pertinent to Critical Social Justice. Our government agencies at all levels are taking on the basic principles and tenets of this belief system as matters of both policy and recommendation.</p>
<p>With astonishing speed, a shocking number of our nation’s school systems have taken up explicitly <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-critical/">critical</a>—as in <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-critical-theory/">Critical Theory</a>—<a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-critical-pedagogy/">educational approaches</a> that focus on teaching <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-identity-politics/">identity politics</a>, “<a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-antiracism/">anti-racism</a>,” and about the <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-power-systemic/">systems of power</a> that the Critical Social Justice worldview <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/2020/01/influence-anti-racist-scholarship-activism-evergreen-college/">assumes</a> exists in everything. States like <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/education-lab/free-feminine-hygiene-products-in-schools-early-ethnic-studies-on-washington-state-legislative-wish-list-for-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington</a>, <a href="https://edsource.org/2020/new-draft-ethnic-studies-curriculum-for-california-students-issued-after-a-year-of-study/637506" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">California</a>, and <a href="http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/culturally-responsive-sustaining-education-framework" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York</a> are openly adopting “Ethnic Studies” programs that revamp their entire educational systems in line with Critical Social Justice so extreme that they seek to replace math with “<a href="https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2019/10/11/seattle-schools-lead-controversial-push-to-rehumanize.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ethnomathematics</a>” and history with critical “hxstory.” These changes come alongside other equally questionable practices with even more jargon-heavy descriptions, all dedicated to awakening a “<a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-critical-consciousness/">critical consciousness</a>” of “<a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-antiracism/">anti-racism</a>” through “cultural awareness” in our nation’s children. Our curricula, we’re told, have to be “<a href="https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s12129-020-09899-2?sharing_token=QkTk_96aBmLzTIpYfqE8ofe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY5ccP1G-tw-JzDXMsIXpR0f0Y4rNLFgSAa0KYeeP1aaFVQ8HMjWnRTD0mHYY1gOKUcbE09-xzMpT4tlJ5mtTAbjIkhtAiPpw166JZGnapIh1paO0lxQItuZwe2Pq9L2OSk%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decolonized</a>.” New curricula are explicitly based not only in <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-critical-theory/">Critical Theories</a> of <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-identity-politics/">identity</a>, but upon the critical historiography of the infamously <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/2020/07/history-killers-academic-fraudulence-1619-project/">revisionist</a> (and Pulitzer Prize-winning) <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-1619-project/">1619 Project</a> and the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/mobile/folders/1LGslwJwhXvpVnDgw0uC-n794l6EGzpuH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explicit dictates</a> of the radical Black-power activism organization <a href="https://blacklivesmatter.com/what-we-believe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Lives Matter</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a veritable war is going on regarding whether or not assessment (like standardized testing) is “<a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-racism-systemic/">racist</a>,” and excellence programs are being scrapped for being “<a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-equity/">inequitable</a>.” As parents react to this (often very negatively) by seeking to pull their kids out of our public schools in favor of homeschooling them, calls to abolish homeschooling are coming to the fore of the discussion from the priestly of this new faith, insisting that it is “racist” to teach one’s own children at home because the state has a duty to teach them subjects like “Social Justice.” These changes should facilitate the elimination of objective standards that will enable an increase in the ability to execute and hide rampant problems of applying discriminatory admissions policies at elite schools and universities, all in the name of “equity,” which people are led to believe is a hallmark of<i> group </i>fairness.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, many of our government agencies and departments are taking on the tenets of Critical Social Justice, especially Critical Race Theory and its derivative, “anti-racism,” as a matter of mandate. These entities include state and federal “departments of” as well as myriad government contractors and state funded entities, like National Public Radio (NPR). Even NASA, which is widely regarded as synonymous with scientific rigor, hosted “anti-racist” historian Ibram X. Kendi to <a href="https://disrn.com/news/nasa-asks-far-left-antiracism-professor-ibram-x-kendi-to-speak-to-employees" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lecture</a> its employees on tenets of this Theoretical view of the world. This invitation is remarkable given that Kendi’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/how-to-fix-politics-in-america/inequality/pass-an-anti-racist-constitutional-amendment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explicit ambition</a> is to pass an “anti-racist” Constitutional amendment that would permanently create and empower a <i>de facto</i> fourth branch of the American government dedicated to <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-critical/">critically</a> examining and unmaking any “racist” policy, defined as anything that ends up having certain (but not other) disparate outcomes by race. This invitation is even less alarming than the fact that Kendi’s argument is being used in support of a California initiative to remove the anti-discrimination language from its state constitution in accordance with achieving equity and “anti-racism.” Equally, if not more alarming, are that the Center for Disease Control has <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/race-ethnicity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">institutionalized</a> tremendous <span>quantities</span> of this Theory (during a pandemic, no less), even while states officially declare “systemic racism” a kind of “public health crisis” that obviates any reasonable measures for pandemic mitigation if done in the name of “racial justice.” Even large government contractors, like Sandia Laboratories, which handles extremely high-tech weaponry (including nuclear weaponry), have taken on this ideology deeply enough to have fallen into an internal “<a href="https://twitter.com/realchrisrufo/status/1299008750729097216" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">civil war</a>” after a brave employee blew the whistle.</p>
<p>The matter of understanding Critical Social Justice, as the ideology is formally called, is, in some sense, no longer a mere philosophical issue (if it ever truly was). It’s now an emergency, and as more and more people are noticing (or, it seems, hoping, as it would provide them with recourse that currently seems not to exist), it’s likely to be a <i>legal</i> emergency. Unfortunately, very little legal architecture currently exists to do anything about the problem of this imposition of one particular belief system upon society via its most susceptible demographic—children. Further, perhaps due to failures of people like myself in the past few years, there has been very little push to generate this legal architecture in what is likely to be one of its strongest and most fruitful directions: identifying the Critical Social Justice worldview as a <i>functionally religious</i> worldview. This is required to open it up to the full machinery of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and its famous Establishment Clause, and would, at least, get it out of our school systems very quickly.</p>
<p>The argument, I think, needs to be opened up in earnest because we now face two incredible perils against the American ideal where it collides with the Critical Social Justice worldview, and these merit taking the issue and the risk that comes with it (legally<i> protecting</i> Critical Social Justice as a system of faith)<i> </i>very seriously. The first of these is the one I’ve already spent some time on pointing out: Critical Social Justice has already encroached deeply into our public education system and halls of government in the United States. In fact, this trend is accelerating to a pitch so extreme that complaints that schools are operating in the service of political indoctrination rather than as houses of a basic and liberal education, as they were initially conceived, are rapidly becoming plausible. The second is that a time may come in the not-distant future in which this totalizing and totalitarian worldview could be installed as the de facto state religion, even while it elides categorization as such. The state endorsement—or worse, enforcement—of any faith falls directly afoul of the protections the U.S. Constitution was written to ensure to individual citizens, and, in fact, to other systems of faith that would disagree with it. The question is, which totalizing worldviews that are not traditionally recognizable as faiths should be treated in the same way for the same reasons? While the answer to this question is not immediately clear, it must have to do with how they function in society and in the lives of those who believe them.</p>
<p>Therefore, to put it directly: It is my belief that the contents of the Critical Social Justice worldview should be protected as matters of private conscience only, and they …</p></section></div></div></div>

<p>"Permanent Record," Edward Snowden's 2019 memoir, was just what I'd hoped for: a record of a personal journey, recounted in service to a thoughtful, nuanced argument for civil disobedience and acts of conscience.</p>
<p><a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2019/09/24/permanent-record-edward-snowden-and-the-making-of-a-whistleblower/">https://memex.craphound.com/2019/09/24/permanent-record-edward-snowden-and-the-making-of-a-whistleblower/</a></p>
<p>Whistleblowers are often complicated figures. Often, a whistleblower acts out of mixed motivations – personal grievance, trauma, anger. Sometimes they're incoherent and struggle to frame their deeds.</p>
<p>Not Snowden.</p>
<p>As Permanent Record makes clear, he acted out of principle, after lengthy soul-searching, because he believed in his country and was both elated at the liberatory power of tech and terrified by its power to oppress.</p>
<p>On top of that, Permanent Record is a beautifully written, gripping technothriller, a procedural that explains the nuts and bolts of encryption, operational security, both fascinating and revelatory, a guide to what you should be worried about, and what you can do about it.</p>
<p>But Permanent Record keeps getting better! Today, Henry Holt released "Permanent Record: Young Readers Edition," which is exactly what it sounds like, a young adult version of Snowden's memoir, laying out his life's story and his principles for teens.</p>
<p><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250767929/">https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250767929/</a></p>
<p>Speaking as someone who grew up on the kind of Heinlein "juvie" that read like a super cool older brother who put his arm around your shoulder and said, "Look, kid, I'm going to tell you how the world works" —</p>
<p>Speaking as a writer who tried to capture that same spirit with my own book Little Brother – a book whose working title was "Wikipedia Brown," and which I pitched as "Howard Zinn meets Have Spacesuit Will Travel" —</p>
<p>Speaking as the father of an adolescent —</p>
<p>This is an amazing book.</p>
<p>Snowden's sprightly prose, his deep technical knowledge, his superb knack for explaining complex matters, his ability to articulate principled action all come together in a book that is, if anything, <em>better</em> than the adult version.</p>
<p>Books for teens cast a long shadow. They can alter the course of a person's life. I was permanently affected by the books I read as an adolescent. Snowden isn't just simplifying his message for kids here.</p>
<p>He's engaging with a generation of people who will never know a life without the internet, but who might someday know a life free from ubiquitous surveillance.</p>
<p>Tonight at 7PM Pacific I'm helping Snowden launch the book in a livestreamed event in collaboration with Copperfield Books:</p>

<p>When you think of online tracking, chances are you think about third-party cookies that follow you from site to site. Third-party cookie handling has been a hot-button issue among the major browser vendors of late, with Google announcing that Chrome would deprecate them.</p>
<p>But third-party cookies are just the most obvious way that your online activity gets tracked. Far more insidious is "browser fingerprinting," in which the unique characteristics of your browser and computer are linked to your identity and tracked.</p>
<p>Browser fingerprinting and other de-anonymizing attacks are a reminder that the technical problems of anonymity are subtle and complex, which is generally true of all privacy questions.</p>
<p>It's also a reminder that privacy problems can't be solved with code alone: to be private, you also need legal recourse against companies that cheat and spy on you.</p>
<p>Finally, it's a reminder that we need independent security researchers, who can warn us about novel ways of attacking our digital privacy.</p>
<p>Researchers like Jonas Strehle, who just published a fascinating proof-of-concept demonstrating how favicons (the tiny icons in your browser tabs) represent a serious privacy vulnerability.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jonasstrehle/supercookie">https://github.com/jonasstrehle/supercookie</a></p>
<p>Strehle calls this tracking-by-favicon "supercookies," and his demo shows that these trackers defeat incognito mode, VPNs, and ad-blockers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7v5y7/browser-favicons-can-be-used-as-undeletable-supercookies-to-track-you-online">https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7v5y7/browser-favicons-can-be-used-as-undeletable-supercookies-to-track-you-online</a></p>
<p>His work builds on an academic U Illinois Chicago paper from Network and Distributed Systems Security, published in 2020: "Tales of FAVICONS and Caches:Persistent Tracking in Modern Browsers"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/~polakis/papers/solomos-ndss21.pdf">https://www.cs.uic.edu/~polakis/papers/solomos-ndss21.pdf</a></p>
<p>Favicons are stored locally in a database called the F-cache; if a user requests a favicon from a site, the site can infer that the user has never visited the site before (or that the gap since their last visit was so long that the cache expired).</p>
<p>"By combining the state of delivered and not delivered favicons for specific URL paths for a browser, a unique pattern (identification number) can be assigned to the client. When the website is reloaded, the web server can reconstruct the identification number with the network requests sent by the client for the missing favicons and thus identify the browser."</p>
<p>This confirms the original paper's theoretical prediction that favicon attacks "allow a website  to reconstruct a 32-bit tracking identifier in 2 seconds."</p>

<p>For people and businesses, money is scarce; for currency-issuing governments, it's not. The story that governments "spend our taxes" is obviously wrong: since governments are the <em>source</em> of money, it can't be right that governments have to get money from us before they spend.</p>
<p>Governments spend first, spending money into existence. Then they tax, which annihilates some of that money. If governments run "balanced budgets" (where they tax as much as they spend), they leave no money left over for us to use.</p>
<p>And if they run a surplus (taxing more than they spend), then they reduce the supply of money that's available for the private sector to spend. The government's deficit is the public's credit, and vice-versa.</p>
<p>Government spending is constrained…but not by money. It's constrained by <em>resources</em>. If the government creates money to buy more things than are for sale – or things that the private sector's also trying to buy – prices go up (AKA inflation).</p>
<p>There's a lot of important stuff for sale in any given government's currency that no one else is trying to buy, though: for example, the labor of unemployed people. Governments can safely create money to buy that labor at a socially inclusive wage with good benefits.</p>
<p>Sometimes, governments need to buy things the private sector also wants. During WWII, states needed raw material, processing facilities, and labor for the war.</p>
<p>To prevent inflation, they did two things: first, they rationed, limiting what the private sector could buy.</p>
<p>Second, they created "war bonds," which were basically sinkholes for money. By urging workers to sequester the money they earned in war production, governments were able to take the money out of circulation during the period when there was nothing to buy with it.</p>
<p>Governments that recognize this undeniable truth – money is spent into existence, taxed out of existence – are able to weather crises, for example, by spending whatever it takes to get through a pandemic, or to recover from a crash.</p>
<p>Governments that allow themselves to be constrained by the fiction of "spending tax money" are hobbled during crises – locked into austerity at the moment when the economy contracts, drawing down the pool of spendable money when spending is desperately needed.</p>
<p>And even if a government is free from the ideological straitjacket of scarce money, it can still be hampered by external factors. For example, if a government owes debts in a currency it doesn't issue, then it can't spend its way out of debt.</p>
<p>Venezuela and Zimbabwe could create VEBs and ZWDs all day and it wouldn't give them the dollars they needed to service their debts – and since they'd oriented their economies towards import rather than self-reliance, there wasn't much they could buy in VEBs and ZWDs either.</p>
<p>It's not just debt: governments can cede their monetary sovereignty by pegging their currency to some other currency (like the USD), or by allowing a third party to issue their currency (like the eurozone nations).</p>
<p>The eurozone is a remarkable phenomenon: a union of 19 affluent countries that have abandoned control of their money and thus their ability to fund things like a job guarantee, putting themselves at the mercy of the European Central Bank during economic crises.</p>
<p>During the 2008 crisis, the ECB put the screws to the eurozone, punishing austerity and a wildly uneven recovery with riches for the financial sector (who were able to charge interest on loans that replaced state spending) and destruction for the real economy and the 99%.</p>
<p>It's grimly ironic. The ECB – which is largely controlled by German politicians – is repeating the mistakes of the German central bank in the runup to WWII. You've probably heard the stories of Weimar hyperinflation, but that's not what triggered the German depression.</p>
<p>Rather, it was Brüning's 1930 policy of <em>deflation</em> – removing money from the economy through austerity – that triggered and then worsened the economic crisis in Germany, creating the conditions for societal collapse, fascism, and imperialist aggression.</p>
<p>Well, there's another economic crisis in the offing – the pandemic – and yet another, far worse one on the horizon – the climate emergency. And even with the constraints the ECB and eurozone nations have imposed on themselves, there is still room to get it …</p></div></article></div>

																										<p><span>Recently published </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10410236.2020.1871169"><span>research</span></a><span> found that when actor Tom Hanks announced his COVID-19 diagnosis on March 11, 2020, it likely had a significant effect on the public’s attitude toward the deadly pandemic.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A day after Hanks </span><a href="https://twitter.com/tomhanks/status/1237909897020207104?s=20"><span>announced</span></a><span> on social media that he and his wife Rita Wilson had contracted the Coronavirus, Dr. Jessica Myrick of Penn State University and Dr. Jessica Willoughby of Washington State University surveyed 682 people about their attitudes and behaviors toward COVID-19.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The pair of researchers say 83% of persons surveyed had heard of Hanks’ diagnosis, and approximately half of that group said the news had changed their attitudes and behaviors towards COVID-19. Results of the study were published in the </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10410236.2020.1871169"><span>journal of Health Communication</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“There is a growing body of research about how celebrity behavior and social media posts can affect public health,” said Dr. Myrick in a </span><a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/646649/2021/02/04/research/tom-hanks-covid-19-diagnosis-likely-shaped-behaviors-thoughts"><span>statement </span></a><span>issued by Penn State. “This suggests that public health officials and advocates may want to use these types of celebrity announcements to help reach people who may be harder to reach.”</span></p>

Live, Los Angeles. (Image Source: Stock image)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>Staring in a slew of blockbuster movies, such as <em>Forrest Gump</em>, <em>Toy Story</em>,<em> Saving Private Ryan</em>, and <em>Captain Phillips</em>, Hanks is one of the world’s most popular and well-known film stars.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>News of Hanks coming down with COVID last spring was further spread when a photo showing Hanks, apparently in a hospital room, holding a volleyball identical to the ball his character befriends and names Wilson in the 2000 film <em>Cast Away</em> went viral online. A caption accompanying the image claimed hospital staff had given Hanks the volleyball to keep him company during his quarantine.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Indeed a heartwarming story, Hanks’ photo holding the volleyball was a </span><a href="https://factcheck.afp.com/doctored-image-contains-2015-photo-tom-hanks-and-ball-movie-cast-away"><span>doctored image</span></a><span>, and the story was false. The account had initially appeared on the satire news site, </span><a href="https://factcheck.afp.com/doctored-image-contains-2015-photo-tom-hanks-and-ball-movie-cast-away"><span>The Betoota Advocate</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>Nevertheless, the fake viral story further spread the news of Hanks’ diagnosis, which researchers say “highlighted the reality of COVID-19” during the early days when much of the public was still learning about the virus and its severity. Because of Hanks’ announcement, many began to consider their own susceptibility to COVID-19.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“This [Hanks disclosure] just makes me a little worried now. Anyone, no matter who you are, can catch the virus and not even know it. Makes me take all the precautions that I possibly can to prevent myself and family from getting the virus,” said one of the respondents to the study.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Researchers say many survey participants reported being inspired to learn more about COVID-19 and/or take stricter precautions thanks to Hanks’ disclosure. “I am more alert and interested in the issue of coronavirus than I was before Tom Hanks disclosed that he had it,” reported a participant. Another said, “My thoughts have changed. Hearing this news about Tom Hanks makes me think that the virus is more serious.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Many expressed a range of emotions to the news of Hanks’ illness, including surprise, fear, anger, sadness, and hope. “I just feel an increase in fear and worry. I think humans are stupid and might give me the disease, this makes me angry,” reported a participant. “I am worried about the coronavirus hitting close to home. Knowing a celebrity has gotten sick with this virus makes me more worried that myself or my family might catch it,” said another.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For the half of respondents not influenced by Hanks’ diagnosis, the majority reported thinking the illness did not pose any severe health concerns to the actor. Researchers also noted that many in the “not influenced” category said they were already aware of COVID-19 and its effects before Hanks’ announcement.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With persons reporting they had not heard about Hanks’ diagnosis, researchers showed half of these participants the Facebook post where Hanks announced he’d tested positive for COVID-19 and the other half a non-COVID post made by Hanks. Researchers say the group who read the COVID-19 post reported feeling less capable of avoiding the virus than those who had read the non-COVID post.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“It could be that learning of Hanks’ diagnosis, despite his wealth and resources, resulted in people thinking that if Hanks could not avoid COVID-19, then they may not be able to, either,” theorized researchers.</span></p>
<p><span>A wealth of </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2666148"><span>empirical research</span></a><span> has demonstrated the significant impact celebrity endorsement can have on consumer buying behavior. A 2017 </span><a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=40853"><span>study </span></a><span>by Harvard Business School professor Dr. Anita Elberse and Barclays Capital analyst Jeroen Verleun found that, on average, a celebrity endorsement increased a company’s sales by 4% relative to its competition and increased stock value by 0.25%. While this may not seem like a lot, 4% can translate into billions of dollars for major corporations.&nbsp;</span></p><div><div id="block-wrap-67451" data-id="67451"><div><div><div>		<article>

<p><span>Researchers say their study showing the impact of Hanks’ COVID-19 diagnosis on public perception demonstrates that celebrities can be equally powerful voices during public health crises.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Statistical analysis performed by researchers showed that celebrity influence could be especially pervasive during a health crisis whenever it involves a famous personality people feel they can identify with. “Tom Hanks is the guy we feel we like and know, so hearing about him is closer to finding out that a friend or a family member has it,” said one participant.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“People who said they typically trust celebrities, friends, family, or Donald Trump for health information were more likely to say that Hanks’ announcement led to positive behavior change,” said Dr. Myrick. “This suggests that public health officials and advocates may want to use these types of celebrity announcements to help reach people who may be harder to reach. They don’t rely as much on news or on scientists for health information.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Researchers note their findings suggest not everyone will respond uniformly to illness announcements made by celebrities, and some may feel disempowered by the news that a beloved public figure cannot protect themselves from illness.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Public health organizations may need to focus on creating messages that boost public efficacy if a beloved celebrity is struggling with an illness. Conversely, once a celebrity like Hanks recovers, additional campaign messages may want to point to that recovery to generate hope and stronger efficacy perceptions,” note researchers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Following his recovery, </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/06/tom-hanks-on-surviving-coronavirus-i-had-crippling-body-aches-fatigue-and-couldnt-concentrate"><span>Hanks has said</span></a><span> he experienced “crippling body aches,” fatigue, and the inability to “concentrate on anything for more than 12 minutes” during his bout with COVID-19. Hanks says his wife, Rita Wilson, lost her sense of taste and smell, had severe nausea, and a high-fever.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Not wanting to see anyone else go through the unpleasant, in some cases fatal, experience, Hanks encourages people to follow prevention guidelines issued by health professionals. “There’s really only three things everyone needs to do: wear a mask, social distance, wash your hands. I know societally it’s been politicized, but I don’t get it, man. I don’t understand how anyone can put their foot down and say: ‘I don’t have to do my part.'”</span></p>

        <p><em>Hey, Nathan here! Remember a few months ago when we published a wonderful essay on&nbsp;</em><a href="https://every.to/divinations/linkedins-alternate-universe-21780381" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>LinkedInâ€™s ridiculousness</em></a><em>? It was one of Divinations most popular posts ever, and it was written by </em><a href="https://twitter.com/fadeke_adegbuyi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Fadeke Adegbuyi</em></a><em>, a brilliant observer of internet culture who also is a senior marketing manager at Doist. Today Iâ€™m thrilled to share with you Fadekeâ€™s latest workâ€”this time examining our obsession with identity through the lens of a Twitter bio tracking app called Spoonbill. Enjoy!</em></p><hr><p>Elon Musk updated his Twitter bio 23 times in 2020. He last changed it on February 4, 2021 at 6:31 AM PST. A few versions include â€œBorn 69 days after 4/20,â€� â€œSoundCloud Rockstar,â€� â€œBudgie Smuggler,â€� and â€œ#bitcoin.â€� I didnâ€™t spend months stalking Muskâ€™s page, developing an encyclopedic knowledge of his time spent in the Twitterverse. I looked it up on <a href="http://spoonbill.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spoonbill</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_1.png"></a></p><p>I could use the app to give you similar information on any celebrity or public figure with a Twitter account. Or I could use it on you. If I wanted to, I could see all the changes youâ€™ve made to your profile since you first signed up: your name, your location, your website, your pinned tweets. </p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_2.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_2.png"></a></p><p>Spoonbillâ€™s creator, <a href="https://twitter.com/justinmduke" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Justin M. Duke</a>, describes the app, which has nearly 93 thousand users, as a â€œtracking tool for online metadata.â€� Over 45K of those users have signed up to receive daily emails that aggregate updates across all the Twitter profiles they follow. The open rate for these daily emails hovers around 55%, <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/knowledge-base/what-are-the-average-click-and-read-rates-for-email-campaigns/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">well above average</a> for email campaigns.</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_3.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_3.png"></a></p><p>I asked <a href="https://twitter.com/hunterwalk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hunter Walk</a>, a Partner at the seed-stage venture capital firm Homebrew and an avid Spoonbiller, why he uses the app :</p><blockquote><em>"It's fun to see people wordsmithing their bios, changing the order of the portfolio companies they list based on startup performance, subtly announcing personal life changes...Instead of letting Twitter decide what's worthy of notification, I get to see </em>every<em> change and decide for myself what's interesting, often with context that the algorithm is unaware of."</em></blockquote><p>The tracked changes that Twitterâ€™s algorithm might register as neutral additions and subtractions can indeed be revealing to onlookers. Spoonbill captures what the people we follow are changing their bios to express; an investment exit, a tongue-in-cheek joke, or the end of an internet cult affiliation.</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_New.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_New.png"></a></p><p>Social apps have made creepers out of all of us. Whether itâ€™s scrolling to the start of someoneâ€™s Instagram feed or <a href="https://sarajbenincasa.medium.com/confessions-of-a-venmo-voyeur-cb0e4c23d04a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">looking through Venmo transactions</a>, weâ€™re constantly peering into othersâ€™ online lives. Spoonbill not only satisfies our tendency for online lurking, but pushes it into voyeur territory; surfacing whatâ€™s meant to be hidden is intimate in a way that scrolling a timeline isnâ€™t. The tool provides a glimpse into the specific ways we represent ourselves to the world, the unseen effort with which we express our identities, and how the uncanny feeling of being watched informs our sense of self.</p><p>Twitter is an interesting observation ground for online identity. Snapshots at Big Sur are meant for Instagramâ€™s photogenic feed, while professional milestones belong on <a href="https://divinations.every.to/p/linkedins-alternate-universe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LinkedInâ€™s alternate universe</a>. But in the Twitterverse, life and work converge. People are just as likely to share career news as they are to live-tweet a Netflix binge; professional gripes commingle with criticism of political leaders; snark and sincerity live side-by-side. </p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_4.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_4.png"></a></p><p>Twitterâ€™s bio section, then, is a tall order: <em>compress your entire identity into a single line item</em>. Many use the space to convey their own complexityâ€“â€“smart yet funny, accomplished but approachable. Society has progressed past the need for the phrase â€œworks hard, plays hard,â€� but thatâ€™s what weâ€™re trying to convey in our own personalized way: we contain multitudes. We are real.</p><p>Spoonbill reveals the way that people play with their latest positioning of self, carving out character space for their newly important aspects of identity.</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_7.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_7.png"></a></p><p>Hustle culture looms large and professional accomplishments convey worth. In turn, notable work, career highlights, and impressive affiliations take center stage in our Twitter bios, the structure and grammar of which are heavily coded. Freelance journalists add and shuffle their bylines, arranged in order of prestige â€“â€“ @nytimes is meant to come first. In my corner of Tech Twitter, where optionality is king, itâ€™s now effectively a meme to be <em>â€œstarting something new,â€�</em> marked increasingly by the addition of â€œSubstack:â€�, â€œScout:â€�, or â€œSide project:â€� to oneâ€™s bio. Users adding â€œ<em>permanent student</em>â€� or â€œ<em>forever learning</em>â€� to their bios arenâ€™t pupils at cruel and unusual institutions, theyâ€™re signalling intellectual curiosity.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_8.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_8.png"></a></p><p>The ability to see Twitter bio updates across hundreds or thousands of profiles over time make Spoonbill updates insightful in aggregate. Certain patterns and conventions emerge.&nbsp;</p><p>Spoonbillâ€™s creator has observed interesting trends in his app:</p><blockquote><em>"On an individual/corporate basis, a particularly fun one is seeing angels and investors tinker with the parts of the portfolio they </em><a href="http://spoonbill.io/twitter/data/Jason/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>choose to highlight</em></a><em>. A very classic example of this was the sheer number of firms and investors who removed things mentioning WeWork during, well, the period of time that you didnâ€™t want your name associated with WeWork."</em></blockquote><p>WeWork reached a $47 billion valuation in 2019, but cancelled their plans to go public <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-ipo-timeline-delayed-ceo-adam-neumann-scandals-explained-2019-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">after their IPO filing drew questions and concerns</a>. In a bio block thatâ€™s meant for selling ourselves to a potential follower, a failed investment takes up valuable real estate. But while WeWork investors might wish we would all forget their involvement as quickly as they hit â€œsaveâ€� on their new bio, Spoonbill always knows.</p><p>In that same 160-character space, weâ€™re also meant to declare our commitment to cause: political, social, or economic. Often, emojis will do:</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_9.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_9.png"></a></p><p>If you watch Spoonbill updates closely enough, they suggest that the labels and descriptors we choose to signal our allegiances can be fleeting, our attention spans short. As COVID-19 spread throughout the world in early 2020, many updated their bios with their own messages about the virus, encouraging their followers to take some form of action:</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_10.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_10.png"></a></p><p>But almost as quickly as these bio changes were made, they were unmade, individuals returning to their regular profiles. Less charitably, people just got bored; short-term vigilance surrounding the virus eventually led to a return to normal life for many. More charitably, the longer the pandemic wore on, identities once swaddled in concern for the virus eventually needed some wiggle room.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year, as racial tensions bubbled to a boil throughout the United States and set off an international cascade, Spoonbill revealed how Twitter bios were used to show support for what was top of mindâ€“â€“or a stance on what was top of the fold:</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_11.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_11.png"></a></p><p>As time went on, it was jarring but predictable to see lines through phrases like â€œBlack lives matterâ€� across swaths of profile updates in my inbox. </p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_12.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_12.png"></a></p><p>Politics similarly finds its way into our descriptions of self. With the 2020 U.S. presidential election, many translated their desired vote on the ballot to their bio: </p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_13.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_13.png"></a></p><p>The story has already been written, and you know what comes next: dashed presidential dreams translated to crossed-out candidates. Adding presidential hopefuls or even political parties to how we identify can be an exercise in disappointment. Disappointment is inevitable (after all, there can only be one). But seeing how long people hold on to their hopefuls was interesting; some still signalling long after their candidate had dropped out.</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_14.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_14.png"></a></p><p>These tracked changes of our online selves provide a glimpse into the specific ways we represent ourselves to the world, how society manages to infect our identities, and, what we valueâ€”or what we want to be seen as valuing.</p><p>Spoonbill uncovers the tacit labor involved in our quest for the perfect personal positioning. In describing the way online influencers take effortless-looking selfies that are actually quite effortful, <a href="https://twitter.com/wishcrys" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dr. Crystal Abidin (aka wishcrys)</a>, a researcher and â€œanthropologist of influencer culturesâ€� (according to her own Twitter bio), <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2056305116641342" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">coined the term â€œtacit laborâ€�</a> as:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><em>â€œA collective practice of work that is understated and under-visibilized from being so thoroughly rehearsed that it appears as effortless and subconscious.â€�</em></blockquote><p>You donâ€™t need to be an influencer to know the labor involved in taking and selecting a selfie. Getting the right light, angle, and expression are just some of the considerations made while snapping and choosing from the photos that fill our camera rolls. After selecting the winning shot, we leave behind a stream of rejected selfies, never to see the light of day; the tacit labor stays hidden. After a photo has been cropped, filtered, and face-tuned, a refined â€œselfâ€�-ie joins the feed, adding to our curated online imageâ€“â€“polished, carefree, or somewhere in between.</p><p>Just like we strain for the perfect selfie, we tinker to find the perfect bio, treating it as a personal sales pitch and making micro edits to what we represent and â€œwho we are.â€� Spoonbill catalogues every time-stamped keystroke and tracked changeâ€“â€“from the removal of a single stuffy period to self-consciously swapping â€œMarketerâ€� for â€œStorytellerâ€� and reverting back again.&nbsp; Like the photos in your camera roll, your current Twitter bio has leftâ€“â€“for Spoonbill users to seeâ€“â€“a wake of rejected selves. </p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_5.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_5.png"></a></p><p>Spoonbill reveals the surprising scale and frenzying frequency with which all kinds of people make these online edits. We add in emojis, expand and shrink our past affiliations, and flirt briefly with humor, adding clever one-liners before eventually reverting to something more serious.

					<p>Having good internet is really important to me, but I also want it as cheap as possible. I know that, especially where I live in New York, I can negotiate my bill. There are always promotions that can vastly bring the cost down, but as with many Americans, I often neglect trying to get a better deal once the initial set up is over. There’s some fear that I will have to switch providers, which will be a pain (I certainly don’t want to be out of internet for any amount of time). But one of the biggest reasons I never negotiate my internet bill is that I hate talking on the phone. I don’t like having to listen to the gravelly voice while holding something up to my ear and having to pay full attention the whole time. With <a href="https://www.voyxt.com/">Voyxt</a>, I was able to call my internet provider <a href="https://www.rcn.com/">RCN </a>from my computer (no literally picking up the phone) and using my keyboard to speak, and also saved ~$40/month on my bill with a simple 7 minute call (see the full call below or on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBDIREk3GJ8&amp;feature=youtu.be">Youtube</a>)</p>

					<p>The big broadband corporations (ex.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verizon.com/">Verizon</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://official.spectrum.com/">Spectrum</a>) that provide you internet and television (and, if you’re a bit old fashioned, maybe a landline) make it pretty&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/business/so-easy-to-sign-up-and-so-hard-to-cancel.html">hard to cancel your subscription</a>. Even though many have some form of online webchat or email support, cancellation or price changes to your subscription are often only allowed through the phone or in person. Because there are only a few providers, they don’t feel the need to provide such services through online channels. They know that calling is harder and many people avoid customer service calls, so they can continue raising your prices even though their costs are much lower. I suspect they might even make the calls more difficult to navigate on purpose – making you waste your time talking to their machine while they are using automated code to put you on hold. However, calls to negotiate price are not uncommon, and it’s likely that many of the customer service representatives that answer your call are just following a script and can easily look up promotions to reduce your price. You simply have to ask.,</p>

					<p>I knew that I should be able to get a better price, but I still wanted to be respectful and prepare some conversation points for my chat with RCN. I spent some time researching my options – I knew that Spectrum and Verizon both had deals in the new year for cheaper internet. It was easy to access their prices from their sites and spam letters they have been sending me (another problem!). I wrote out a few sentences that I might use so that I could communicate faster using Voyxt. I expected I could probably get about $20/month discount with my call so I was ready to cancel if I could not get the price down below $90/month total on my bill. I also prepared some research on purchasing my own modem and router (although this was a huge annoyance because it is almost impossible to determine which modems work for RCN). With these resources, I felt ready to make the call.</p>

					<div><p>First, I had to navigate RCN’s own customer service machine. Luckily, I was using Voyxt, so I could navigate it easily using Voyxt’s transcriptions and text to speech, using machine against machine. There was a long section discussion the COVID 19 pandemic which I could easily put out of my mind while I waited for useful information. Funnily, they suggested that I might have to wait 40 minutes before an agent talked to me (perhaps an unintentional way to get me to hang up?) but immediately connected me to a real agent, Jasmine. After all the transfers, the phone call had gotten jittery and some of the audio was garbled. However, Voyxt’s transcriptions kept working so I was able to easily navigate the conversation. After simply asking for a reduction in price (and being a bit patient), Jasmine was able to offer me internet at a greatly reduced price, saving me just under $40 per month. I didn’t have to use anything I prepared – I just had to ask. I believe that the customer service representatives are working hard to help out respectful customers, and with Voyxt it’s impossible to come off as upset or in the wrong way. After a brief chat, the call was over. There was a slight confusion in the call on the exact change in cost, but I checked my account online afterwards and it showed my next bill was as discussed and $40 per month cheaper than my previous month’s payment.</p><p>There are a lot of people trying to make customer service better, but in the end, the corporations are not incentivized to make it easy. The employees working there even want to help you out (they likely care little for their corporate overseers), but the way the companies have designed their customer service still means you have to call them and get to an agent. That’s why Voyxt was created – to give users the power and make phone calls easier. <a href="https://www.app.voyxt.com/register">Register for Voyxt now</a>.</p><p>See the full call I had with RCN below.&nbsp;<span>Start of chat with the agent at ~3 minutes</span></p></div>

            — 10 min read.
          </p></div></section><section data-v-19ec50a8=""><article data-v-19ec50a8=""><p>The beta for the upcoming 5.21 release of the <a href="https://gitlab.com/kwinft" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">KWinFT projects</a> is now available.
It contains a monumental rewrite of KWinFT's windowing logic.
Read on for an overview of the changes and why this rewrite was necessary.</p>
<h2 id="a-confused-heart">A Confused Heart</h2>
<p>Let's define first what <em>windowing logic</em> is.
In my definition this means all structures and algorithms in code
to decide where a window should be stacked, placed, moved
or in which other ways its geometry can be manipulated
to allow the user to interact with and organize the totality of all windows.</p>
<p>And if you agree to such windowing logic
being of central importance for a windowing manager
and what distinguishes it in the end from others,
we may call it the <em>heart</em> of KWinFT.</p>
<p>The KWinFT compositor is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KWin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">KWin</a>,
KDE's official compositor for the Plasma Workspace.
KWin was founded over two decades ago.
Necessarily some of its code is very old,
does not adhere to any modern development principles
and sometimes,
due to changes in other levels of the graphics stack,
it is just plain wrong.</p>
<p>It is kind of unexpected though,
that this has been in particular the case for the windowing logic,
the heart of KWinFT.
For example at the HEAD of KWin's current master branch
<a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/blame/master/layers.cpp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">do a git-blame</a>
over the ludicrous code in <code>layers.cpp</code>
responsible for all window stacking
and count how many lines are older than a decade.</p>
<p>But old code is not necessarily bad.
The reason why this old code is bad, is two-fold:
for one under the leadership of the former maintainer
the Wayland support was shoehorned into an already complex code base
and secondly he followed a strategy
to keep the old code untouched as much as possible.
Instead of doing necessary incremental refactors to the old code,
he tried to firewall it with an abundance of tests.</p>
<p>For sure one can find reasons and excuses to pick such a strategy,
but ultimately one has to say it failed.
This can not be judged of course from the outside,
but I feel comfortable in making this assessment
as someone who knows the code in detail
and because I am not the only one who abandoned his strategy.</p>
<h2 id="who-does-the-work-is-not-always-right">Who Does the Work Is Not Always Right</h2>
<p>In fact I am not the first one to refactor the old windowing logic.
The current de facto maintainer of KWin, <a href="https://blog.vladzahorodnii.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Vlad Zahorodnii</a>,
has done so in the past.</p>
<p>The result of his work were often massive merge requests
and back then,
when I was still contributing directly to KWin,
I had a feeling this was going into the wrong direction.
But I was also working on other upstream projects
and was in no position to tell someone,
who worked exclusively on KWin,
that his work should not go in as is.</p>
<p>This is actually enforced through an unwritten rule in KDE,
which prescribes that "the one who does the work, decides".
This sounds good when heard first,
but the one who does the work is not always right
and in the case of KWin,
Vlad's refactors made the old code even more complicated,
more fragile and less coherent.</p>
<h2 id="simple-is-difficult">Simple is Difficult</h2>
<p>The problem with Vlad's work on KWin is
that he likes to create solutions through the addition of new things.
He <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/merge_requests/656" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">still does</a>.</p>
<p>I call that the "easy way" to solve a problem in an existing code base:
You add new code, which you write against the problem you want to solve.
You ensure the new code does not break any of the old unit tests.
For compliance add another unit test for your new code.</p>
<p>The big downside of this approach is
that the complexity of the code increases every time you do it.
And KWin's windowing code has become absurdly complex over the years.
As an example
take a look at the different <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/blob/4890db3f16d1b9bd244f1a83c8d198ff93f6543b/toplevel.h#L299-349" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">types of geometries</a>,
which describe the position and size of a window.</p>
<p>In contrast I chose the hard way: I made the code simpler.</p>
<p>This would of course be also kind of easy if I just removed features,
but I was able to keep in all features of KWinFT's windowing logic
while simplifying major internal concepts and algorithms.</p>
<p>There is one exception though: the <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-latest.html#idm45623492381424" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">shading of windows</a> got removed.
Sorry to the few people who used it,
but it is one of these features not meant for a Wayland world
and whoever had implemented it at some point in the ancient history of KWin,
had done that by littering special cases and boolean traps all over the code base
in order to get it done.</p>
<h2 id="battle-plans-and-front-lines">Battle Plans and Front Lines</h2>
<p>After this prelude let me give you an overview of what this revolution actually contains.</p>
<h3 id="flattening-the-hierarchy">Flattening the Hierarchy</h3>
<p>To get the revolution started I drafted in the beginning,
like I always do with bigger projects like this,
a general plan that I published in an <a href="https://gitlab.com/kwinft/kwinft/-/issues/75" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">issue ticket</a>.</p>
<p>You can see that my primary focus was to simplify the sprawling hierarchy of different window types,
which have grown in numbers over the years mostly because of the Wayland changes.</p>

<p>My first idea was to flatten the hierarchy through the use of C++ templates
and replacing <a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/prefer-composition-over-inheritance-1602d5149ea1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">inheritance with composition</a>.
And while not yet fully finished,
the current state absolutely reaffirms my decision to follow through with this idea.</p>

<p>The classes <code>AbstractClient</code> and <code>XwaylandClient</code>,
which represented different kinds of windows,
have been removed completely.
This simplifies the hierarchy to only two levels.</p>
<p>In the future I want to also get rid of the <code>Toplevel</code> class.
My plan for that is to template the <code>Workspace</code> class over its supported window types.
This would mean no more dynamic inheritance at all.</p>
<p>Other dependent properties that were previously stuffed into <code>AbstractClient</code>
I carefully dissected out of it.
For example everything related to Scripting
is now contained in a single independent <a href="https://gitlab.com/kwinft/kwinft/-/blob/5409a4b98a79fdef463076b1c1b847d917cf3eb7/scripting/window_wrapper.h" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">interface</a>.</p>
<h3 id="clean-code-is-comprehensible-code">Clean Code is Comprehensible Code</h3>
<p>While moving forward with my initial goals
I realized that huge parts of the code were so outdated, so ugly, so rotten,
that I could not just refactor the logic,
but also had to improve the code styling.
Often the internal logic was incomprehensible
because of the style.</p>
<p>So this project became also about replacing archaic macros with modern lambdas,
reducing code duplication, adding white space where it made sense and so on.</p>
<p>Overall I improved the readability and reduced clutter.
I ensured there is a single coherent style in all refactored files.
One of the largest single commits in that endeavor
was the <a href="https://gitlab.com/kwinft/kwinft/-/commit/71926f30eb014ed2dfd0de715f16c01b93915d28?expanded=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">overhaul</a> of the <code>X11Client</code> class.</p>
<p>When deciding on how to clean up code,
I follow modern C++ principals in general.
I orientate myself at the Standard Library and the <a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">C++ Core Guidelines</a>
instead of the outdated Qt library style.
This falls in line with my long-term plan to <a href="https://gitlab.com/kwinft/kwinft/-/issues/21" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">factor out libraries</a>
that will be pure C++ and not depend on Qt anymore.</p>
<h3 id="the-big-ones-subsurfaces-and-window-geometries">The Big Ones: Subsurfaces and Window Geometries</h3>
<p>While my focus in the beginning of the windowing refactoring
was to simplify the hierarchy of windows,
that was not the initial motivation for this project.
My motivation was to fix a certain issue with Wayland subsurfaces:
they were not correctly transformed by effects.</p>
<p>There had landed <a href="https://phabricator.kde.org/D29131" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a patch</a> for that in KWin in the middle of last year,
but I had a feeling it was once again a half-baked attempt at a solution,
leading to more complexity instead of less and not solving the problem in a holistic way.
My further analysis of the patch confirmed my initial thoughts
and I decided to look at the problem from a completely different angle.</p>
<p>The solution I came up with I would in fact call <em>revolutionary</em>.
In the <a href="https://gitlab.com/kwinft/kwinft/-/merge_requests/64" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Merge Request</a>
I described it as a "huge mental shift in what we understand under subsurfaces".
I reused existing concepts from X11 and Wayland,
but interpreted them in a new way,
what simplified the code
and unified the logic over all windows.</p>
<p>As there is much to say about this specific solution,
I split out the discussion of it into a follow-up article.
Stay tuned.</p>
<p>I will also write a separate article about the other big change:
a total redesign of how we store and change the geometries of windows.</p>
<p>These geometries were a pain point for me already for a long time.
Any aspiring new contributor for KWin must feel absolutely shell-shocked,
when trying to understand what all the different geometry types of windows are supposed to mean
and how they relate to each other.</p>
<p>As a reminder <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/blob/4890db3f16d1b9bd244f1a83c8d198ff93f6543b/toplevel.h#L299-349" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">these</a> are just the getters
for the different kinds of geometries in the abstract top level interface class.
And <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/blob/4890db3f16d1b9bd244f1a83c8d198ff93f6543b/abstract_client.h#L624" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this</a> is one of many ways to change a single one of them.
Yes, that's a pure virtual function in a subclass,
and yes, the second argument of that setter is a masked boolean trap.</p>
<p>To finally squash any hope that new contributor might have,
show him all the different forms on how to save a geometry
<a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/blob/4890db3f16d1b9bd244f1a83c8d198ff93f6543b/x11client.h#L483" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>, <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/blob/4890db3f16d1b9bd244f1a83c8d198ff93f6543b/xdgshellclient.h#L97" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>,
<a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/blob/4890db3f16d1b9bd244f1a83c8d198ff93f6543b/toplevel.h#L723-724" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/blob/4890db3f16d1b9bd244f1a83c8d198ff93f6543b/abstract_client.h#L1276-1294" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
And until now we have looked only at header files.</p>
<p>To simplify all that,
eradicate this glaringly unnecessary complexity,
make the code actually comprehensible again,
I redesigned everything about it from the ground up.
This was for sure the most comprehensive and most difficult task.
And I had to go through several iterations before a final overarching model emerged
on how to handle <em>all</em> geometries of <em>all</em> windows,
on how to save and manipulate them via clearly defined structures and processes.</p>
<p>Some explanation for that model
can be found in the <a href="https://gitlab.com/kwinft/kwinft/-/merge_requests/68" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">primary Merge Request</a> of the geometries rework.
But as said, like with subsurfaces,
I plan to write about the reworked geometries soon
in a more detailed follow-up article.</p>
<h2 id="a-blossoming-heart">A Blossoming Heart</h2>
<p>Why did I call this project the <em>Windowing Revolution</em>?
Does it deserve this pathos?
The project was massive, that's for sure.
In sheer numbers <a href="https://gitlab.com/kwinft/kwinft/-/merge_requests/71" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the result</a>
is over 50 000 changed lines in over 300 commits.
I sacrificed over months all my time for this project, and my health.</p>
<p>But size or sacrifices alone do not make this a revolution.
Instead it comes through changes in our way of thinking
and how this project will reshape our future:
we radically redesigned the heart of our windowing manager,
we broke with overcome beliefs and traditions,
we simplified and reworked what was left rotten for decades.</p>

            <p>Back in 1994 a not yet know business owner posted a job listing on Usenet. It was for a company called Cadabra which would eventually turn into Amazon.com. As we all know Amazon has become a trillion dollar company and continues to grow. It’s fun to see that Jeff was utilizing Usenet to help grow his business. We can only assume that the C/C++ developer that got the position is happy they did. The exact message that Jeff posted to Usenet is pictured below.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Well-capitalized start-up seeks extremely talented C/C++/Unix developers to help pioneer commerce on the Internet. You must have experience designing and building large and complex (yet maintainable) systems, and you should be able to do so in about one-third the time that most competent people think possible. You should have a BS, MS, or PhD in Computer Science or the equivalent. Top-notch communication skills are essential. Familiarity with web servers and HTML would be helpful but is not necessary.</em></p>
<p><em>Expect talented, motivated, intense, and interesting co-workers. Must be willing to relocate to the Seattle area (we will help cover moving costs).</em></p>
<p><em>Your compensation will include meaningful equity ownership.</em></p>
<p><em>Send resume and cover letter to Jeff Bezos:</em></p>
<p><em>mail: be…@netcom.com</em><br>
<em>fax: 206/828-0951</em><br>
<em>US mail: Cadabra, Inc.</em><br>
<em>10704 N.E. 28th St.</em><br>
<em>Bellevue, WA 98004</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p>When people talk about incentive alignment, what they really mean is correlated returns.</p>
<p>Consider equity as a solution principal-agent problems. Since founders and employees are both paid as a percent of company valuation, their returns are correlated, and incentives are mostly aligned. [1]</p>
<p>But even where returns are perfectly correlated, there’s no guarantee that actors actually have each other’s best interests in mind. A more concrete way to think about this is: would you be willing to delegate your decisions to the other party? This is what I mean by “true alignment”.</p>
<p>This can go wrong in at least three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Returns are correlated, but with different opportunity cost</li>
<li>Returns are correlated, but with different levels of risk</li>
<li>Returns are correlated, but with different second degree utility</li>
</ol>
<p>Real estate agents are typically paid on commission of a home’s sale price. As a result, their returns are really well correlated with the homeowner’s:</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_XV2FycYR05hx0I4oVt7w38kIim-ElkWApsXwaHin-qO4kqy-CarjGsIvQjDzC2Z6UZVDURWUogHubZRisFwnrtKbn0fYAE_L6fKZOG4OOCGa1tDvA3dOfTjn79YzdbbDrMHKOVC" title="Chart"></p>
<p>In theory, this ought to mean that real estate agents and homeowners are truly aligned.</p>
<p>In practice, the real estate agent is the one doing work, which means that they’re the one paying opportunity cost.</p>
<p>Let’s say an agent can expect to earn $200/day, and gets paid 6% of home sale price. It’s not worth it for them to spend another 5 days of work pushing up your home price from $500k to $510k when this only nets them $600 against an opportunity cost of $1000.</p>
<p>In contrast, a homeowner would happily wait a week to get another $10k, or $9.4k after commission. Even factoring into account the time value of money, an additional 2% week-over-week is great.</p>
<p>If both sides were explicit about incentives and willing to broker a side deal, the homeowner would happily pay the full $1000 opportunity cost to get an extra $9000. But in the absence of transparency, the real estate agent will do their best to convince the owner to sell, even at net loss to their collective interests.</p>
<p>The result is correlated returns without true alignment. Neither side ought to trust the other.</p>
<p>Another classic example is Venture Capitalists versus Founders. For any given startup, a founder might own 30%, and the VC 10%, so their returns are really well correlated:</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3JuiQ-W08HBI4QNLW73fwywCMFe7ekiGAsWnsHg1bhzB2xyh4hdJW5DDwE-RJx4SF9HwTOxiKo_5IZNuy89kh_qefoMz7JAOrR_VfOXjhGza5JL_KRpNcfIJEBH_LOO5Z5UW0eKE" title="Chart"></p>
<p>In theory, this ought to mean that VCs and Founders are truly aligned.</p>
<p>In practice, VCs are massively diversified across startups, providing insulation against any one failure. As a result, they’re eager to push for riskier bets, even when it’s against the interests of an individual founder.</p>
<p>Say you’re going out to dinner with a wealthier friend, and you’ve agreed to split the bill. No matter where you go, you’ll be paying the same amount, and getting the same consumption, so returns are really well correlated:</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/1xKYiiW4zC4nalzLSNMW3GDOOTAFfYZPkE_exWKYChAdbiyUdzUmhUjWa7UvHZ1JqpFO6DkNIwqdhNNOd6lkt6AvkGsd2heXblpqyU_9PULjvjp5Y8_AbyQSk3VyetHqIAcq4_Ne" title="Chart"></p>
<p>In theory, this ought to mean that wealthy and less wealthy diners are well aligned. You should be willing to let your friend pick the restaurant, and visa-versa.</p>
<p>In practice, each party may pay the same financial cost, but has a different marginal utility for their money. Assuming utility is something like log(wealth), the utility cost to a $100 dinner are far greater for you than for your wealthier friend.</p>
<p>Even assuming you have the same gastronomic tastes, your incentives are not actually aligned. You should not trust your friend to pick a restaurant. [2]</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Taking “true alignment” to mean “would be willing to delegate decisions”, and “correlated returns” to mean “correlated first order financial returns”, everything I’ve said is true.</p>
<p>But in all these cases, the trick is just to think about the actual experienced utility rather than first order financial returns.</p>
<p>It’s presumably pretty straightforward to sell a home for a fair price, but much more work to sell for substantially more than what it’s worth. So the opportunity cost increases faster than the price of the home. Taking that into consideration, we can chart the agent’s returns with a consideration of non-linearly growing opportunity cost:</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/IuLwQmsMceCLRT63Q6myNoGTUrTdPha-3mHx2RxMWN5IMjBTzczzOTxFy3D_29J6EESiyLN0mKSBOGIv6R85Cv17GPvdcT3Kcf0OTBuqGJPHNvALdIH5iGtuLAgwMaESNkrXkhWL" title="Chart"></p>
<p>Which makes it clear that returns were never really correlated to begin with.</p>
<p>Similarly, risk-avoidance is a function of diminishing returns from wealth. As a result, founders would prefer a more certain return, while diversified VCs can afford to pay in risk for higher expected returns.</p>
<p>So the conclusion is not that something wacky is going on and alignment is impossible. It’s just that we have to take into account returns to actual utility rather than just naively looking at immediate finances.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Postscript</strong></p>
<p>I framed these as three different examples, but in a sense, they’re all the same.</p>
<p>The Venture Capitalist is risk-indifferent because they’re diversified. The founder is risk-averse because they experience diminishing returns from wealth to utility. Otherwise, a 1% chance of a billion dollar exit would be just as good as a guaranteed $10 million exit. So this is outwardly about risk, but really about second degree utility.</p>
<p>Arguably, diminishing returns to wealth are also just a function of opportunity cost. The more money you have, the less consumption in one place becomes a substitute for consumption elsewhere. This is also the case of a concave production-possibility frontier: the more you produce one good, the more the opportunity cost increases. This gives us a sense of diminishing returns, even without appeal to the hedonic treadmill or other psychological effects.</p>
<hr>
<p>[1] Note that this only works for early employees at startups. The more your compensation is defined by salary rather than equity, the more your returns are fixed, and the less aligned you’ll be with your founders.</p>
<p>[2] Unless of course, they offer to treat you.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p>Lambda School is the most incentive-aligned education in the world.</p>
<p>It is so incentive-aligned, that their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/the-commons/lambda-school-raises-74-million-incentive-aligned-education">fundraising announcement</a> was titled “Lambda School Raises $74 million for <strong>Incentive-Aligned</strong> Education”. Another <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/the-commons/baby-steps-incentive-aligned-higher-education-job-training">blog post</a>, tilted “Taking Baby Steps Toward <strong>Incentive-Aligned</strong> Higher Education and Job Training” includes the phrases</p>
<ul>
<li>With <strong>incentive alignment</strong>, schools don’t succeed unless their students do.</li>
<li>We’ll continue to share updates on <strong>incentive-aligned</strong> education</li>
<li><strong>Incentive alignment</strong> between schools and students is the objective.</li>
<li>As long as the underlying principles of student protection and <strong>incentive alignment</strong> hold true, that’s what matters.</li>
<li>…create an education model where the <strong>incentives of the school and student are aligned</strong></li>
<li>…keep financial risk low for students and maintain <strong>incentive alignment</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lambda’s big innovation is the Income Share Agreement, a mechanism that allows students to pay the bootcamp as a percentage of their salary, rather than paying tuition upfront. This ensures that the bootcamp is free to attend until you get a job, and endures that Lambda is <strong>extremely incentive aligned</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>But is it actually?</p>
<p>Here’s the details of the Lambda deal:</p>
<ol>
<li>Students pay 17% of their salary for 2 years,</li>
<li>Payments are capped at $30,000, no matter how much you’re making</li>
<li>Students only pay if they’re making over $50,000</li>
</ol>
<p>With this information, we can graph Lambda School’s 2-year returns against raw student income:</p>


<p>Those flat lines represent the cap and floor. The section in the middle is where Lambda Returns grow as a function of Student Income.</p>
<p>But remember that these returns come out of student income. So account for Lambda payments and taxation, here’s the same chart, but now with another line for Actual Student Income.</p>


<p>(<em><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PjV77gc-96D4PPWZelJSWvT_U0-XLqXPWjEgRFf06ps/edit?usp=sharing">Source</a></em>)</p>
<p>That huge drop at $50,000 is the point where tuition payments kick in, and Actual Student Income drops off.</p>
<p>This is a classic example of a perverse incentive: students would actually earn more with a lower salary [1]. As payments and taxes scale with earnings, students aren’t back to the actual income they had at a raw salary of $49,000 until they hit a raw salary of $67,000, nearly $20,000 later.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we can divide the graph into 4 segments, and for each, ask if incentives are actually aligned:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1) Not Aligned</strong>: Actual Student Income increases, but Lambda Returns do not.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>2) Misaligned</strong>: Actual Student Income drops, but Lambda Returns grow sharply.</li>
<li><strong>3) Aligned</strong>: Actual Student Income and Lambda Returns grow together.</li>
<li><strong>4) Not Aligned</strong>: Actual Student Income increases rapidly, but Lambda Returns are flat.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/images/lambda-sections.png"></p><p>To summarize, the actual incentive-alignment portion of this graph only happens&nbsp;in section 3 (when raw income is between $67,000 and $88,000). Despite their repeated claims, Lambda School is not actually incentive-aligned.</p>
<hr>
<p>Okay, fine, but does this actually matter? Maybe all salaries fall in that incentive-aligned range, and so in practice, Lambda is effectively incentive-aligned.</p>
<p>We can test this hypothesis against Lambda’s table of reported student outcomes:</p>
<p><img src="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/images/lambda-table.png"></p><p>We want to know how many students make between $67,000 and $88,000. Using a naive assumption of uniform distribution within buckets, we get 47 students, or 26% of the total population. [2]</p>
<p>To make a closer approximation, we can estimate an underlying normal distribution.</p>
<p>The range we’re curious about ($67k - $88k) doesn’t align with the bucketing, but we can make an educated guess by estimating the underlying normal distribution:</p>


<p>That’s with mean $72,000, SD $26,000. This is still naive, but seems to be a decent approximation, and probably better than the uniform assumption. Using this model, we estimate that 31% of graduates are earning $67,000 - $88,000.</p>
<p>To sum up, Lambda School appears to be incentive-aligned with around one third of their students.</p>
<hr>
<p>While Lambda School is not properly incentivized to improve income for the majority of its students, you might still argue that it is at least incentivized to get them a job.</p>
<p>This is fair, but also true of every other educational institution. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://flatironschool.com/jobs-reports/">Flatiron School</a> releases data on job placement outcomes, as does <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://generalassemb.ly/blog/outcomes-report-2018-2019/">General Assembly</a>, and does <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://poetsandquants.com/2017/06/26/draft-job-placement-rates-at-the-top-schools/">every university</a>. It doesn’t matter if you literally get paid as a portion of student income, every institution has a reputation to uphold, and a case to make for its value.</p>
<p>It is true that Lambda School only charges tuition if you get a job earning more than $50,000, and that’s great. For many students however, I expect this calculation to be dominated by the question of whether or not they’ll actually have a job at the end, a matter on which <a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/lambda-lies/">Lambda School has been notoriously deceptive</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>[1] This concept of being punished for earning money is at the heart of the libertarian critique of taxes. It’s absolutely bizarre that Lambda has appropriated libertarian rhetoric without any of the accomplaying economics.</p>
<p>[2] (75 - 67) / 25 * 71 + (88 - 75) / 25 * 46</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p>Lambda School is a coding bootcamp that only charges tuition if you get a job. Founder/CEO Austen Allred frequently takes to Twitter, defending his bootcamp against <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/lambda-schools-job-placement-rate-is-lower-than-claimed.html">allegations of fraud</a>, and rebutting critics with case after case of student success.</p>
<p>I was initially excited about Lambda School, but have slowly grown disillusioned over time. So when they released their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/reports/2019-outcomes-report#fast-facts">2019 H1 Outcomes Report</a>, I was excited to finally access a ground truth and put an end to all the speculation.</p>
<p>Instead, I found a consistent pattern of deception.</p>
<p>In the rest of this piece, I’ll walkthrough a number of examples, in which Allred:</p>
<ul>
<li>Claims a job placement rate of 86%, when the actual number is as low as 55%, and at least as bad at 70%</li>
<li>Misrepresents graduate salaries on Twitter, despite claiming a random sample</li>
<li>Calls regulatory approval a “significant endorsement”, despite a troubled history of bans</li>
<li>Lies about having been homeless</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these are blatant and explicit, some are more subtle. I’ve done my best to present the facts fairly, and leave the rest up to your judgement.</p>
<h3 id="1-Allred-Misrepresents-Student-Outcomes"><a href="#1-Allred-Misrepresents-Student-Outcomes" title="1. Allred Misrepresents Student Outcomes"></a>1. Allred Misrepresents Student Outcomes</h3><p>In early 2019, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/austen/status/1082815326960533504?lang=en">Allred took to Twitter</a> to share student outcomes, listing the following salaries:</p>
<ol>
<li>J: $80,000+</li>
<li>S: $80k</li>
<li>D: $110k base, ($130k total)</li>
<li>C: $130k</li>
<li>T: $90k</li>
<li>L: $140k</li>
<li>J: $85k</li>
<li>L: $89k</li>
<li>A: $85k</li>
<li>R: $75k</li>
<li>S: $70k</li>
</ol>
<p>A year later, when the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/reports/2019-outcomes-report#fast-facts">Outcomes Report</a> was released, it cited a median salary of just $70,000. In stark contrast, Allred’s 11 Tweets report exactly 0 students making less than $70,000. Statistically, that’s like flipping a coin and getting 11 heads in a row (probability .00049).</p>
<p>This seems bad, but whatever, Allred is just highlighting a few heartwarming anecdotes right? Surely he doesn’t actually claim that this is a randomly selected sample?</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/Austen/status/1082818077132091393">Except he absolutely does:</a><br><img src="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/images/allred-tweet.png"></p>
<p>To see just how poorly Allred’s claims line up against the official <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/reports/2019-outcomes-report#fast-facts">Outcomes Report</a>, we can plot the histograms side by side:<br><img src="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/images/lambda-outcomes.png"></p>
<p>Allred claims that his examples were randomly selected, but his own statements are contradicted by the official outcomes report.</p>
<h3 id="2-Allred-Repeatedly-Misrepresents-Job-Placement-Rates"><a href="#2-Allred-Repeatedly-Misrepresents-Job-Placement-Rates" title="2. Allred Repeatedly Misrepresents Job Placement Rates"></a>2. Allred Repeatedly Misrepresents Job Placement Rates</h3><p>Earlier this year, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/lambda-schools-job-placement-rate-is-lower-than-claimed.html">New York Magazine reported</a> that Lambda school had marketed itself as having an 86% job placement rate, but then released an investor memo reporting a much lower rate of just 50%.</p>
<p>Allred took to podcasts, explaining in an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osrytvuiU8Y&amp;t=3m20s">interview with Jason Calacanis</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we talk to investors, we talk in terms of enrolled students… of those students who were enrolled, X% were hired. Whereas when schools speak publicly, they speak in terms of graduated students. So obviously those two numbers are always going to be different.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to clarify:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That 86% was somewhat out of date… so we quickly put together what the real numbers would have been, which was 78%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so that seems reasonable enough. Case closed?</p>
<p>But then the official <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/reports/2019-outcomes-report#fast-facts">Outcomes Report</a> was released, and contradicted Allred’s own statements: </p>
<ul>
<li>Of the 448 students in the cohort, only 318 graduated</li>
<li>Of those 318, only 284 graduated on time</li>
<li>Of 284 graduates, Lambda could only reach 255</li>
<li>Of those 255, only 201 had jobs</li>
<li>Of those 201, Lambda “did not have salary data… due to our data collection methods”, giving us data for 178 students</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The job placement rate for enrolled students is 201 out of 448, or 45%. The job placement rate for graduated students is 201/318, or 63%.</strong></p>
<p>It actually gets worse. The original Lambda School claim was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>86% of Lambda School graduates are hired within 6 months and make over $50k a year</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But according to the outcomes report, 26 of the placed graduates are making under $50,000. <strong>The actual placement rate for graduates making over $50,000 is just 55%</strong>. That’s a far cry from the 86% they claim, and much closer to the 50% reported by New York Magazine.</p>
<p>To be clear about timing, the New York Magazine article was published February 19th 2020, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osrytvuiU8Y&amp;t=3m20s">interview</a> was on March 3rd, and the Outcomes Report was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/lambdaschool/status/1244054419471302664">published March 28th 2020</a>. So these should all be about the same cohort, or at least a similar set of students.</p>
<p>So where does the 78% come from? Following article, Allred published a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/note-outcomes-data-lambda-school-austen-allred?articleId=6637802701117882368">note on LinkedIn</a> with the following chart:<br><img src="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/images/lambda-flow.png"></p>
<p>So 78% is what you get if you ignore students who graduated late, ignore students who have yet to graduate,  ignore the “graduated and disengaged” students, and pretend everyone is making over $50,000.</p>
<p>To his credit, Allred does provide another table which includes disengaged sudents and reports a 70% placement rate. Not only is this a far cry from the 86% originally reported, it also includes the 15% of placed students making under $50,000.</p>
<p>Although it may seem fair to count late graduates in the H2 report, note that this is a misrepresentive sample. Students who graduate late will likely have worse results later on, and underperform students who graduated on time. If Lambda wanted to account for this, they could have included 2018 H2 late graduates in the 2019 H1 report, but they neglected to do so.</p>
<h3 id="3-Allred-Misrepresents-Legal-Action-Against-Lambda-School"><a href="#3-Allred-Misrepresents-Legal-Action-Against-Lambda-School" title="3. Allred Misrepresents Legal Action Against Lambda School"></a>3. Allred Misrepresents Legal Action Against Lambda School</h3><p>In March 2019, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19374417">Allred wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Regulators love us</strong> - they’re sick of for profit schools promising a lot and delivering little except debt. [emphasis mine]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>December the same year, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/sandofsky/status/1211717254712135680?lang=en">it was revealed</a> that Lambda was actually operating illegally, with no approval from regulators.</p>
<p>Okay, so this looks bad, but it doesn’t mean Allred is lying. It’s entirely possible that he thought regulators loved Lambda in March, and wasn’t corrected until a $75,000 fine hit the following month.</p>
<p>When Lambda finally did get approval to operate in California, Allred <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/the-commons/baby-steps-incentive-aligned-higher-education-job-training">wrote</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the past year, Lambda School worked to advance an ambitious goal: become the first online school approved by California regulators to offer ISAs. <strong>We achieved a major victory when state regulators licensed us as a school in August, representing a significant endorsement</strong> for our all-online, career-focused education model. However, in order to secure this approval, we made the difficult decision to stop offering our ISA option to students in California.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be clear, none of this is an outright lie, but it is a dishonest representation of the regulatory environment. To recap:</p>

</ul>
<p>Then Lambda applies for approval, leading to this saga in which:</p>

</ul>
<p>As best I can surmise, those are the facts of this case. You can decide for yourself if you think Allred is acting with integrity.</p>
<h3 id="Bonus-Allred-Lies-about-Experiencing-Homelessness"><a href="#Bonus-Allred-Lies-about-Experiencing-Homelessness" title="Bonus: Allred Lies about Experiencing Homelessness"></a>Bonus: Allred Lies about Experiencing Homelessness</h3><p>This has nothing to do with Lambda School, and is admitadely somewhat gratuitous. But it does point to continued dishonesty on the part of Allred, and is too blatant to ignore.</p>
<p>In 2017, Allred <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/Austen/status/940658401209491456">tweeted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was homeless, had no skills, no degree, just $300 and a laptop, but that’s all you need.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17938403">2018 Hacker News comment</a>, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m also formerly homeless…. I know how hard it is to focus on getting a job when you’re just trying to survive</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://bagholderreport.substack.com/p/lambda-school-is-the-culmination">article</a> includes a screenshot of an Allred’s reply to a tweet which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been homeless, slept on those same streets [1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The arc from homeless to multi-millionaire founder would be inspiring, except that it isn’t actually true.</p>
<p>In a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6758165">2013 Hacker News comment</a>. Allred writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I lived in a Honda Civic this summer as I was getting a startup off the ground… and <strong>I had a half dozen people offer to let me stay at their place or crash on their couch rent-free.</strong></p>
<p>….As a result, <strong>I wasn’t living in a car for lack of other options</strong>, but rather out of belief that I could create something by sheer will-power, and that I was going to do that come hell or high water. My homelessness was a matter of seeking something greater than myself, not being lost to poverty. [emphasis mine]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, in a now-deleted blog post titled <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://archive.is/OqxKP">Voluntary Homeless in Silicon Valley</a> Allred writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Candidly, living in a car in Silicon Valley had much more appeal to me than a single bed and a shared bathroom… Much more than money, what fuels me is obsession with minimalism, reading way too much Thoreau, and trying to continually see life from a different angles…&nbsp; It’s about questioning society at its fundamentals, and seeing what a life not tied down by a foundation really feels like. And so far I love it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So again, Allred’s claims are… not technically a lie? I mean he did sleep out of a car, but he did it voluntarily. You’re free to make your own judgements, but when I hear “I have been homeless, slept on those same streets”, I do not think of someone with half a dozen offers of free housing. That isn’t poverty, it’s cosplay.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion-Why-does-any-of-this-matter"><a href="#Conclusion-Why-does-any-of-this-matter" title="Conclusion: Why does any of this matter?"></a>Conclusion: Why does any of this matter?</h3><p>Am I just piling onto an already heavily criticized company? Am I guilty of being a critic rather than a creator?</p>
<p>I initially wrote about this purely using Lambda School as an example to illustrate a broader point about incentive alignment. But the more I read, the clearer it became that they were just consistently dishonest. Not outright fraudulent, but just really misleading about everything from student outcomes, to regulatory pressure, to the founder’s own history.</p>
<p>Still, why does any of this matter if Lambda is genuinely educating and helping students?</p>
<div><p>First of all, despite the outcomes report, we still have no idea what the median outcome actually is! They’re reporting data for 178 out of 448 enrolled students, which is just 40%. According to the report, the other 60% of enrolled students either:</p></div>
<ul>
<li>Remain unemployed (54 students, 12% of cohort)</li>
<li>Graduated late or not at all (164 students, 37%, of cohort)</li>
<li>Became mysteriously …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>

			
<p>A data scientist is a thriving career in this technology-oriented world. In fact, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-jobs-in-america-2019-1"><u>Glassdoor</u></a> named data scientists the number one job in the United States. Not to mention that the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-7/big-data-adds-up.htm"><u>U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</u></a> shared that the demand for data science skills will drive a 27.9% increase in employment in the field through 2026.</p>



<p>Considering the years-long consistent demand for data scientists, more and more people are taking their career in that direction. What this means for job-seeking data scientists is that the competition is fierce.</p>



<p>To stand out and catch the attention of hiring managers, you’ll need an optimized CV. Optimization will ensure that your CV is more attractive, but it will also ensure that it passes the ATS resume test.</p>



<p>Use the following tips to optimize your data scientist CV and get the job you want.</p>



<h2>Use the Keywords from the Job Description</h2>



<p>Hiring managers, as well as ATS, use keywords as one of the crucial filters for CVs. The job description is packed with specific keywords. Those keywords are what hiring managers should find in your CV.</p>



<p>Mine the keywords from the job description and put the same phrases on your CV. Using the exact words will further improve your chances. Why? Because hiring managers will be more attracted to the same words, they enlisted in the job description. It will simply signal that you are the perfect fit.</p>



<p>For example, the job description can list “machine learning,” “experienced in a fast-paced environment,” “<a href="https://selftaught.blog/how-to-optimize-your-cv-for-a-freelance-programmer-career/"><u>R programming</u></a>,” and “great written communication skills” as essentials. List those same skills in your CV. Within appropriate sections, of course.</p>



<p>To make the process of generating keywords easier, you can use a mining tool – <a href="https://resumeworded.com/job-description-keyword-finder"><u>Resume Worded</u></a>. Paste the job description within this online tool, and it will provide you with a list of main keywords.</p>



<p>Bear in mind that you should use keywords carefully. Stuffing your CV with keywords or listing qualities and experiences is frowned upon. Moreover, it can hurt your chances of getting the job.</p>



<h2>Personalize the CV for Different Job Postings</h2>



<p>Unless you plan to apply for a single job, your CV will need some personalization. Adapt the CV to match specific job descriptions.</p>



<p>First, optimize your CV for a certain job position. That initial document will serve somewhat as a <a href="https://digiperform.com/digital-marketing-resume-for-freshers-a-complete-guide-with-templates/"><u>resume template</u></a>.</p>



<p>Whenever you plan to send out your CV to a different company, revise it, and personalize it if necessary. What falls under personalization, you ask?</p>



<p>Check which keywords a different job position asks for. You might need to make slight changes to soft skills or rearrange hard skills for maximum attractiveness.</p>



<p>Tailor the CV for each job posting. Thus, you’ll ensure that your CV is the right match for each job position.</p>



<p>You can use <a href="https://www.jobscan.co/"><u>Jobscan’s ATS testing tool</u></a> to check the consistency between your CV and the job description. The tool can give you feedback on resume aspects that need some more work.</p>



<h2>List the Hard Skills at the Top</h2>



<p>Hard skills are of the highest relevance for the hiring managers. Save them some time and list the hard skills first.</p>



<p>Create a section that will be dedicated solely to hard skills. The hiring managers can take a quick scan and assess whether you have what it takes.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/top-10-skills-for-a-data-scientist-in-2020-2b8e6122a742"><u>Towards Data Science</u></a>, the top 10 must-have skills for a data scientist job are:</p>



<ol><li>Probability and statistics</li><li>Multivariate calculus and linear algebra</li><li>Programming languages (Python, R programming, SQL, to name the top three)</li><li>Data wrangling</li><li>Database management</li><li>Data visualization</li><li><a href="https://insights.ai-jobs.net/can-you-teach-yourself-machine-learning/"><u>Machine learning</u></a>/Deep learning</li><li>Cloud computing</li><li>Microsoft Excel</li><li>DevOps</li></ol>



<p>The preferable way of listing hard skills is based on their demand. The job description will reveal which hard skills your employers prioritize. List the skills in the same order. If you possess skills that aren’t enlisted in the job description, name those last.</p>



<p>Depending on your resume length, consider how you’ll list the skills. For example, <a href="https://blog.flexiple.com/how-to-craft-a-freelance-resume-as-a-developer/"><u>a freelancer’s resume</u></a> often includes lengthier work experience (due to a number of smaller data scientist projects). Thus, you need to be mindful about rearranging the information. Who has the time for a 5-page resume?</p>



<p>To save some resume space, you can list your skills in a row. Another space-saving tip is to use bullet points but split the list into two columns.</p>



<h2>Impress with Numbers</h2>



<p>Your relevant achievements will be more notable if you back them up with data. Get employers excited about your capabilities with quantifiable accomplishments.</p>



<p>For example:</p>



<ul><li><em>Used data mining techniques and machine learning to forecast the company’s sales of new services with a 97% accuracy rate.</em></li><li><em>Modernized data streamlining processes, resulting in 30% redundancy deduction.</em></li><li><em>Improved data mining processes, resulting in a 25% decrease in time needed to infer insights from customer data used for developing sales strategies.</em></li></ul>



<p>Whenever possible, state how your skills have contributed to the company or project. Quantifying the results will make a better impression on the hiring managers. It will make your accomplishments tangible.</p>



<p>It is recommendable that you use one sentence for the description per achievement.</p>



<h2>Provide a Description for Soft Skills</h2>



<p>To boost your chances of <a href="https://insights.ai-jobs.net/3-unintuitive-tips-on-getting-hired-for-data-science/"><u>getting hired for data science</u></a>, you need more than just suitable hard skills. Hiring managers will also pay close attention to your soft skills.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle-survey-2019"><u>State of Data Science report</u></a>, around 60% of data science professionals work in teams (5 or more people). Consequently, you need to prove that you can be a valuable member of a company’s team.</p>



<p>Besides listing the soft skills that make you the perfect employee, you should also include a one-sentence description for each skill.</p>



<p>For example:</p>



<ul><li><em><strong>Teamwork</strong></em><em> – Worked in a team of 5+ people for 4 years.</em></li><li><em><strong>Verbal communication</strong></em><em> – Led weekly round-up meetings with </em><a href="https://notbusinessasususal.com/benefits-of-remote-work/"><em><u>remote workers</u></em></a><em> to provide guidelines and give feedback.</em></li></ul>



<p>The description will clarify what that skill refers to. If listed just in bullet points, soft skills can be vague. They don’t tell much about your specific abilities in that way.</p>



<p>A concise description of every skill will paint the picture of what you can bring to the table.</p>



<h2>Apply a User-Friendly Design</h2>



<p>Lastly, you want the CV design to be optimized for the best UX. This means that it needs to be scannable, well-organized, and comprehensible.</p>



<p>Increase your CV’s UX by applying the following characteristics:</p>



<ul><li>Reverse-chronological layout for work experience</li><li>Relevant information only</li><li>Bullet points</li><li>White space</li><li>Minimalistic design</li><li>Single font type</li><li>Segmented sections</li></ul>



<p>The hiring managers should be able to glance at your CV and spot the information they are looking for. Browse the web for user-friendly resume templates. You’ll be able to get a better sense of how to organize your CV.</p>



<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>



<p>Whether your CV gets revised with a 10-second skim or it needs to pass the ATS test, optimization can get you that second round in the hiring process. Use these tips to craft a CV that is engaging, skimmable, and packed with attention-grabbing keywords.</p>



<p>All that is left for you to do after you write the perfect CV is to persistently send it out. With an impeccable and optimized CV in your hands, you can confidently apply for the jobs of your dreams.</p>

                    Introduction
                </h3>
                
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Data is the new gold!</strong><br>
                    </p>
                </blockquote>

                
                Browsers are the most widespread access medium that makes it incredibly easy for us humans to connect to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank">Word Wide Web</a>.<br>
                Due to the constant development of the Internet, such as the continuous elaboration of new standards and features, the introduction of powerful APIs and further interfaces on the browser side, the possibilities for collecting and analyzing data have also significantly expanded over the last few decades!
                <p>
                
                First and foremost, there is nothing wrong with collecting data at all. All of us collect data, whether unconsciously in private everyday life or completely consciously in school or at work - collecting data, interpreting it and drawing conclusions is actually incredibly important!
                </p><p>
                
                With the launch of the WWW for the public and the development of the first online services, data collection also started to become interesting for the various website providers, according to the motto <i>if I own a website, I also want to know who is surfing it</i>.
                <br>
                However, in most cases we as consumers only want to disclose as little as possible and only the data necessary for the intended service - in fact, <i>my private data is no one else's business</i>.
                </p><p>
                
                The above-mentioned further development of the WWW's capabilities has allowed data to be assigned to individual profiles, enabling the recognition of unique users and the ability to trace their browsing activities even across different pages - the so called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint" target="_blank">device fingerprinting</a>.
                <br>
                Some known methods for assigning a unique fingerprint to browsers are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint#Hardware_benchmarking" target="_blank">hardware benchmarking</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint#Canvas_and_WebGL" target="_blank">fingerprinting via Canvas and WebGL</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint#Browser_extensions" target="_blank">analysis of active browser extensions</a>. 
                <br><b>This article is about a less known way to achieve something similar!</b></p><h3>
                    
                    Background
                </h3>


                Modern browsers offer a wide range of features to improve and simplify the user experience.<br>
                One of these features are the so-called favicons: A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon" target="_blank">favicon</a> is a small (usually 16×16 or 32×32 pixels) logo used by web browsers to brand a website in a recognizable way. 
                Favicons are usually shown by most browsers in the address bar and next to the page's name in a list of bookmarks.

                <p>
                To serve a favicon on their website, a developer has to include an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link" target="_blank">&lt;link rel&gt;</a> attribute in the webpage’s header.
                If this tag does exist, the browser requests the icon from the predefined source and if the server response contains an valid icon file that can be properly rendered this icon is displayed by the browser. In any other case, a blank favicon is shown.
                </p><div>
                    <pre><span>&lt;link </span><span>rel</span><span>=</span><span>"icon" </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"/favicon.ico"</span> <span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"image/x-icon"</span><span>&gt;</span></pre>
                </div>

                The favicons must be made very easily accessible by the browser. Therefore, they are cached in a separate local database on the system, called the favicon cache (F-Cache).
                A F-Cache data entries includes the visited URL (subdomain, domain, route, URL paramter), the favicon ID and the time to live (TTL). 
                <br>While this provides web developers the ability to delineate parts of their website using a wide variety of icons for individual routes and subdomains, it also leads to a possible <b>tracking scenario</b>.
                <p>
                
                    When a user visits a website, the browser checks if a favicon is needed by looking up the source of the shortcut icon link reference of the requested webpage.<br>
                    The browser initialy checks the local F-cache for an entry containing the URL of the active website. If a favicon entry exists, the icon will be loaded from the cache and then displayed. 
                    However, if there is no entry, for example because no favicon has ever been loaded under this particular domain, or the data in the cache is out of date, the browser makes a GET request to the server to load the site's favicon.
                </p><h3>
                    
                    Threat Model
                </h3>
                In the article a possible threat model is explained that allows to assign a <b>unique identifier to each browser</b> in order to draw conclusions about the user and to be able to identify this user even in case of applied anti-fingerprint measures, such as the use of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network" target="_blank">VPN</a>, deletion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie" target="_blank">cookies</a>, deletion of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_cache" target="_blank">browser cache</a> or manipulation of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Request_header" target="_blank">client header information</a>.
                <p>
                A web server can draw conclusions about whether a browser has already loaded a favicon or not:<br>
                So when the browser requests a web page, if the favicon is not in the local F-cache, another request for the favicon is made. If the icon already exists in the F-Cache, no further request is sent.<br>
                By combining the state of delivered and not delivered favicons for specific URL paths for a browser, a unique pattern (identification number) can be assigned to the client.
                <br>When the website is reloaded, the web server can reconstruct the identification number with the network requests sent by the client for the missing favicons and thus identify the browser.
                </p><ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Write</b> identification
                        <div><p>
                            The goal of the <b>write</b> operation is to generate a unique identifier and store it on the client side.<br>
                            First step is to create a new N-bit ID on the server and translate it to a path vector as shown below.</p><p>
                            <strong>Example:</strong></p></div><div>
                                <pre><span>const</span> N<span> = </span><span>4</span>;<br><span>const</span> ROUTES<span> = </span>[<span><span>"</span>/a<span>"</span></span>, <span><span>"</span>/b<span>"</span></span>, <span><span>"</span>/c<span>"</span></span>, <span><span>"</span>/d<span>"</span></span>];<br><span>const</span> ID<span> = </span><span>generateNewID()</span>;<span> // -&gt; 1010 • (select unassigned decimal number, here ten: 10 -&gt; 1010b in binary)</span></pre>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <pre><span>const</span> vector<span> = </span><span>generateVectorFromID(<span>ID</span>)</span>;<span> // -&gt; ["/a", "/c"] • (because [a, b, c, d] where [1, 0, 1, 0] is 1 -&gt; a, c)</span></pre>
                            </div>
                        
                        Second step is to store the actual data inside the browser:<br>
                        The user will be redirected along all of the website paths, starting at <i>/a</i>, navigating to <i>/b</i>, to <i>/c</i> and finally to <i>/d</i>.
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>/a</li>
                            <li>/b</li>
                            <li>/c</li>
                            <li>/d</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                       
                        While the user is redirected on every load the browser requests a favicon for the respective route, going the same way like<i>/a/favicon.ico</i>, to <i>/b/favicon.ico</i>, to <i>/c/favicon.ico</i> and finally to <i>/d/favicon.ico</i>.
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>/a/favicon.ico</li>
                            <li>/b/favicon.ico</li>
                            <li>/c/favicon.ico</li>
                            <li>/d/favicon.ico</li>
                        </ul>

                        <br>

                        The webserver will now only process those favicon requests whose path is present in the previously created path vector. If the route is present the webserver answers with the favicon file and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/200" target="_blank">Status 200 OK</a>.<br>
                        If the requested route is not in the path vector, the webserver aborts the request with an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404" target="_blank">Error 404 Not Found</a>, or sends no response.<br>
                        Since the browser - as described earlier - only stores the delivered favicons in the F-Cache, we have now stored our unique identification number and the writing process is complete. <p>
                        In the above example, the webserver only responds to requests for the favicons under paths <i>/a/favicon.ico</i> and <i>/c/favicon.ico</i>. The F-Cache only has favicons-entries for these two paths.<br>

                    <li>
                        <b>Read</b> identification
                        <div><p>
                            Here the goal is to re-identify a returning user based on his existing F-Cache entries.</p><p>
                            In read mode the server always responds to favicon requests with an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404" target="_blank">Error 404 Not Found</a> status, but responds normally to all other requests. 
                            This preserves the <b>integrity of the cached favicons</b> during the read operation, since no new F-cache entry is created by the browser.<br>
                            To reconstruct a visitor's identifier, the browser must be routed through all available routes. The server records which favions are requested by the browser (those that are not present in the browsers F-cache) and which are not.
                            </p><p>
                            
                            <strong>Example:</strong></p></div><div>
                                <pre><span>const</span> visitedRoutes<span> = </span><span>[]</span>;<br><span>Webserver.onvisit</span><span> = <span>(route)</span> =&gt; </span><span><span>visitedRoutes.<span>push(</span></span></span>route<span>)</span>; <span> // -&gt; ["/b", "/d"]</span><br><span>Webserver.ondone</span><span> = <span>()</span> =&gt; </span><span><span>{ <span>const</span> ID = <span>getIDFromVector(</span></span></span>visitedRoutes<span>)</span> };<span> // -&gt; 10 • (because "/a" and "/b" are missing -&gt; 1010b)</span></pre>
                            </div>
                            The server can thus reconstruct the identification from the missing favicon requests and the reading process is complete.
                            <br>

  <p>This weekend, I attended <a href="https://pioneer.app/hackathon">Pioneer’s first Hackathon</a>.</p>
<p>Their call to action:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Help upload the real world to the Internet. Work on something to make the experience of working on the web more fun for the billions staying at home. Overlay heart-rate on Zoom calls. Improve video conferencing quality. Build a Tandem competitor, one for friends rather than coworkers. The stage is yours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My team of 1 had 48 hours to produce a working demo.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, I played with <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/pose_estimation/overview">TensorFlow Lite’s PoseNet</a> model. I thought it had a lot of potential and I figured that this hackathon would be a good opportunity to find a use for it.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>As a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self">quantified self</a> enthusiast, I track pretty much everything I do. While I’ve been able to <a href="https://miguelrochefort.com/blog/calendar/">automate a lot of what I track</a>, I’ve never been satisfied with the way I track my workouts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I tried manual tracking using the <a href="https://www.strong.app/">Strong</a> app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I tried <a href="https://miguelrochefort.com/blog/nfc-water/">NFC tracking</a> using NFC tags and the <a href="https://nomie.app/">Nomie</a> app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I tried voice tracking using <a href="https://assistant.google.com/">Google Assistant</a> on my Google Home speaker.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Could I use machine learning and a camera to automatically track my workouts? This hackathon would be my chance to find out.</p>
<p><em>You might wonder what workout tracking has to do with the hackathon’s theme of “mak[ing] the experience of working on the web more fun”. I think I might have stopped reading the prompt at “Help upload the real world to the Internet”, and decided that “the real world” would be my workout and that “the Internet” would be some cloud database. When I realized my mistake, I changed my pitch to “a way to encourage employees to be more active”.</em></p>

<h2 id="improving-performance">Improving performance</h2>
<p>The first thing I did was to grab the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/posenet/android">TensorFlow Lite PoseNet Android Demo</a> from GitHub. The app uses the phone’s camera to track the location of 17 distinct keypoints (feet, ankles, knees, hips, shoulders, neck, eyes, ears, elbows, and wrists), which it overlays on top of the video preview. After building it and deploying it to my phone, I noticed that the performance was terrible. On my Nokia 6.1—not exactly flagship material—the app struggled to maintain 10 FPS. That wouldn’t be fun to use or demo, so I investigated a bit.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://miguelrochefort.com/img/tensorflow-lite-posenet.png" alt="">
  <figcaption>Screenshot from <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/posenet/android">TensorFlow Lite PoseNet Android Demo</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After a couple hours of investigation, I had found and addressed <a href="https://github.com/miguelrochefort/fitness-camera/commit/83398fba33d09a4e306ff519ce0f65f851921ccc">3 important performance bottlenecks</a>. The app could now reach 25 FPS, improving performance by over 250%. While far from perfect, the app finally felt usable.</p>
<h2 id="assessing-accuracy">Assessing accuracy</h2>
<p>Over the next hour, I let my phone watch me perform all kinds of exercises, at different angles, distances, and lighting conditions. I paid close attention to the accuracy of the pose estimation overlay, to understand what kinds of exercises it would and wouldn’t be compatible with. For example, it’s extremely accurate at tracking all 17 keypoints when facing the camera and doing squats. Yet, it struggles to recognize anything other than my face (nose, eyes, ears) when facing the camera and doing push-ups. Likewise, it’s very good at tracking hand movements…until you hold a dumbbell and your hand suddenly disappear.</p>
<p>Initially, I planned to use pose estimation and a trained classifier to detect distinct phases of an exercise. For example, a burpee could be decomposed into these 3 phases: crouching, planking, and jumping.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://miguelrochefort.com/img/burpee.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Phases of a burpee (Photo: <a href="https://www.mensjournal.com/health-fitness/the-best-burpee-variations-to-burn-fat-and-build-explosive-power/">Men's Journal</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>However, due to PoseNet’s inconsistent accuracy and the hackathon’s time constraints, I pivoted to something much simpler. Instead of classifying exercises, it would only count repetitions. To further simplify the scope, I would only support 4 bodyweight exercises: squats, push-ups, sit-ups, and pull-ups.</p>
<h2 id="counting-repetitions">Counting repetitions</h2>
<p>As usual, I performed exercises in front of the camera, but this time I logged all frames (snapshot of 17 keypoints) to a CSV file. I then analyzed the data using Python and Google Colab, to look for patterns and find an appropriate repetition counting algorithm. <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OHTsNyr3Ry_bSw8dT9s77BZsXHe7i8HR#scrollTo=uIbljMew7Wje">You can view the notebook here</a>.</p>
<p>The data looked like this:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://miguelrochefort.com/img/fitness-camera-logs.png" alt="">
  <figcaption>Vertical position of 17 keypoints over time when performing 7 squats</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You don’t need to be a genius to look at this chart and figure out how many squats a person performed. I’m sure that many algorithms and machine learning models would equally qualified. But this was a hackathon and I couldn’t afford this level of sophistication.</p>
<p>Instead, I implemented the most basic algorithm imaginable:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ignore all keypoints other than the nose.</li>
<li>Record the lowest and the highest position of the nose.</li>
<li>Count a repetition whenever the nose crosses the halfway point.</li>
</ol>
<p>It worked with squats, push-ups, sit-ups, and pull-ups. I was satisfied.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<h2 id="polishing-the-app">Polishing the app</h2>
<p>With the core functionality working and a few hours left before the demo, I decided to polish the app. I tweaked the colors, adjusted the layout, added audio feedback (“One!”, “Two!”, “Three!"), implemented some settings, designed an app icon, and published the APK. You can find the final product below:</p>
<!-- <img src="/img/fitness-camera-logo.png" /> -->
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/miguelrochefort/fitness-camera">GitHub repository</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jdan-ZHiL6I">YouTube demo</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/miguelrochefort/fitness-camera/releases/tag/v0.1.0">Android APK</a></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, the hackathon was a great experience. I was lucky enough to be selected as a finalist and I had the opportunity to demo my app to the judges. Next time, I’ll make sure to join a team.</p>

<![CDATA[Key Ways We Fail as Engineering Managers]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<div itemprop="text">

<p>Management tends to get bad rap and unfortunately many times rightfully so. Having a bad manager can make one’s life miserable and hinder their growth. Managers can seem like politicians who don’t know anything about our trade yet they give us directions.</p>
<p>On the other hand having a good manager can make you feel supported, can boost your career (and sometimes personal) growth and help make your team and company a happy place.</p>
<p>For better or worse, managers have a huge impact on their teams’ and direct report’s lives. It’s extremely important to understand some usual failure scenarios so we can course correct and provide better service and support to them.</p>
<p>Let’s see four usual ways we fail as managers.</p>
<h2 id="0-1-low-self-confidence">1. Low self-confidence</h2>
<blockquote><p>It’s not the lack of ability or opportunity that holds you back; it is only a lack of confidence in yourself.</p><p>—&nbsp;Richard Monckton Milnes</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve known much more engineering managers with low self-confidence than otherwise. Honestly, I can relate! It’s usually really hard to see our work’s positive effect, feedback loops are just too long, and cause-and-effect relations aren’t always trivial to see.</p>
<p>This is especially true for new managers, who just stepped into a completely new skill area and often try to cling to what they already know. It’s really taxing on one’s confidence to suddenly be a beginner again after previously being highly performing (engineer, many times). The end result is that we are trying to prove to ourselves (and sometimes to others, too) that we do deserve the manager role.</p>
<p>Feeling like this is entirely natural, and it can motivate us to learn and do better. Troubles start, though when this inspires the wrong kinds of behaviors in managers.</p>
<p>For one, continually demonstrating insecurity, in general, can undermine people’s confidence in us as leaders who can enforce our negative thoughts and create a vicious circle – we start noticing others don’t have much faith in us.</p>
<p>People with low self-confidence usually have a hard time saying “I don’t know”, which is essential as an engineering manager. We cling to the thought that we have to know answers to everything that comes up; otherwise, we’re just not performing well.</p>
<p>I’ve seen some insecure managers trying to do team members’ jobs. They do this not because they don’t trust their team, but they need something they’re proficient with to feel more secure and confident. This was partially the motivation for me to write one of my old posts titled&nbsp;<a href="https://ochronus.online/engineering-managers-stop-coding/">Engineering Managers, Stop Coding!</a></p>
<p>Another way for such managers to feel that they are still worth something is to be too nitpicky, for example, in code reviews or simply when giving feedback. Among many things, all this can lead to the team’s engineers feeling that their engineering manager is competing against them in a way.</p>
<p>I’ve seen another behavior of low self-confidence managers: they sometimes complain about their direct reports to other direct reports (please&nbsp;<strong>never ever</strong>&nbsp;do this!) or their manager.</p>
<p>Usually, this is only a transition period, but sometimes managers get stuck in this for years. A good support circle (the other managers in the company) and a good manager of the manager can help tremendously. Being able to discuss insecurities and fears with others can make you understand that this is normal, you’re not alone, and you can learn good coping and growth strategies from more seasoned peers.</p>
<h2 id="1-2-the-silver-bullet-aka-the-one-trick-pony">2. The silver bullet a.k.a. the one-trick pony</h2>

<blockquote><p>Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.</p><p>—&nbsp;Jelaluddin Rumi</p></blockquote>
<p>We might not be conscious about it, but we all have a natural, default style when it comes to management. This is shaped by our general personality, our experiences and things we’ve learnt along the way.<br>As managers, we unconsciously rely on this style, and without guidance, we tend to use that style with every direct report. Even when it becomes conscious, we justify this with ‘this is who I am’ and sometimes even with core values and our self-image (see my earlier post&nbsp;<a href="https://ochronus.online/stories-we-tell-ourselves/">Stories We Tell Ourselves</a>). Also, in many cases this style is actually the way&nbsp;<em>we</em>&nbsp;prefer to be managed.</p>
<p>While having strong core values is vital to being a successful leader, using a single management style just simply won’t work with all your direct reports over the years. Acting this way will harm some of your direct reports (and of course hinder your performance as an engineering manager, too).</p>
<p>One-trick managers often talk about the one true way to do things. They get overprotective about their style as they face more and more challenge. They often see the failure to be with the direct reports who don’t respond well to their style instead of adapting to theirs.</p>
<p>This usually shows in hiring, too – engineering managers who are stuck with one single style of leadership often prefer to hire people who are like them instead of diversifying the team.</p>
<blockquote><p>INTERVIEWER 1: I think you’ll be a really good culture fit, Dave.<br>INTERVIEWER 2: I have to say Dave, your answers really impressed us.<br>CANDIDATE: Thank you, Dave. You too, Dave.<br><a href="https://twitter.com/tef_ebooks/status/1355757158458138624" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@tef_ebooks on Twitter</a></p></blockquote>
<p>These managers will have a fantastic relationship with some of the team members who’ll get most of their attention, leaving the others in the limbo a bit. These engineers who are left out will get frustrated and might end up doubting their performance if they don’t realize what’s happening.</p>
<p>As managers, it’s our core job to form a good working relationship with our direct reports. When this requires us to adapt our style or adopt new styles, it’s&nbsp;<em>our</em>&nbsp;job to do so. It’s not fair to expect our direct reports to adapt to our way of management.&nbsp;<a href="https://situational.com/situational-leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Situational Leadership</a>&nbsp;is a part of this.</p>

<h2 id="2-3-too-much-business-focus-vs-too-much-people-focus">3. Too much business focus vs. too much people focus</h2>
<blockquote><p>I still believe in synergy, but I call it natural law.</p><p>—&nbsp;Barry Diller</p></blockquote>
<p>We’ve all met managers who are only into business and view their direct reports as “resources”. They seemingly don’t care too much about their folks’ wellbeing and are only driven by deadlines, impact and KPIs. If the team is successful, it’ll make them happy, right?</p>
<p>We sometimes (much more rarely) see leaders who are only into the people part of their job. They create safe havens for their direct reports, try to protect them from the ‘evils’ of the world and the company and don’t seem to care about performance and business results too much. With a happy team, everything will just work out eventually, right?</p>
<p>These are obviously polar extremes – in reality, this works much more like a balance. Some business-focused managers actually do care a lot about their direct reports but firmly believe that the only way to happiness is a successful business. People-only leaders do sometimes nurture amazingly performing teams.</p>
<p>I just said ‘balance’, but I don’t view these to focuses as opposites. It’s much more about the balance of the short term and the long term. This balance manifests in many areas – solution quality vs. time to market, investing in the people vs. investing in the business, etc. etc..</p>
<p>Too much focus on the business in a leader will sometimes result in that leader prioritizing short term wins over long term ones. Such managers will talk a lot about holding people accountable. They are quick to ‘abandon’ direct reports who don’t fall in line in terms of team commitments and performance instead of coaching them and working on alignment. The sacrifice here can be tremendous: company culture suffers, and this setup won’t work in the long term. People will get burnt out and will leave. Sure, they will hire new engineers, but there’s the cost of onboarding and slowing down, lack of tenure and an overarching understanding of the product and systems and the job market will know what kind of place their company is.</p>
<p>Only focusing on the people without considering that you as a team are responsible for making the business successful can be equally detrimental. As an extreme case, a failed business won’t be able to eventually employ (as many) engineers. Individual and team success needs to align with the business’ success. Such leaders will often position themselves as gatekeepers of core values versus the rest of the company, or senior management. They will view their team as the last stand against the tides of evil.</p>
<p>This, in the end, is not about balance, I think, but rather about synergy (look, look, a buzzword!) – not building a silo of a safe haven for your team but finding a way for the individuals to grow and be successful in tandem with the business’ goals. Naturally, you need the right kind of company for this – if the company’s core values aren’t aligned with nurturing happy teams, it’ll naturally fail as a business, too. If you feel as a leader or as an individual contributor that you cannot stand by your company’s core values, by all means, do yourself the favor of finding a better place for yourself (unless you believe you can steer the company, of course).</p>
<p><strong>I’ve personally only seen high performing AND happy teams when business results and team happiness/health were aligned.</strong>https://newsletter.ochronus.online/embed</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>When working on LOGaritmical, I initially had my primary keys defined as UUIDs. I took this approach for two reasons: security and to avoid collisions even when there are many rows. My initial reasoning was that I will probably need to store each log line in a separate entry and considering that one log can have a few thousands of lines, there was a small risk of overflowing the Integer. Was my reasoning correct? Probably not.</p><p>Furthermore, I stumbled upon an interesting article about <a href="https://tomharrisonjr.com/uuid-or-guid-as-primary-keys-be-careful-7b2aa3dcb439" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">using UUIDs as primary keys</a>. There were some really great points about performance and query optimization. To keep it short, It is best to use numerical values as the primary key. So, I started to change my implementation. But then, another problem came into my head: security.</p><h4>Why is exposing the PK bad?</h4><p>By their nature, Auto Incremented primary keys grow by one for each new entry. This is great for avoiding collision, but it means that they are easily guessable. If you somehow find out that a user with the ID 27 exists, it most probably means that there are at least 26 other users with IDs 1 to 26. An attacker can try to exploit this by sending requests with different IDs. Furthermore, since the Administrator is usually the first user registered, it can easily guess the ID and try to get access.</p><p>There were also many reports, even on high-profile sites, where a full or partial dump of the contents could be done by simply incrementing the ID. This is how Parler data was exposed, for example. Other such attacks are rather easy to find, so exposing the internal ID is bad practice. You can still use an auto-incremented primary key internal and use it for all foreign keys as well, but whenever it is sent externally, an alternative must be found.</p><h4>The Play Session Cookie</h4><p>You may think that as long as your URLs does not contain the primary key, everything is ok. However, here is another scenario: cookies. Whenever a user is logged in, a session must be saved so that the user can remain logged in and can properly navigate the restricted pages. Play Framework does this by storing a Play Session Cookie that looks something like this:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="874" height="96" src="https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-3.png 874w, https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-3-300x33.png 300w, https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-3-768x84.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px"></figure><p>This can easily be found using the browser’s inspector. At first sight it may seem a random string of characters, however it is much more than that. It is actually a BASE64 encoded JSON string with some additional, non-human-readable data, at the end. Decoding the string is easy and, even though changing it in the cookie may not be possible, it can still provide valuable information to an attacker if the PK is stored.</p><h4>Solution: How to avoid exposing the PK</h4><p>You use an UUID! But wait, didn’t I just say that using UUIDs is bad? You still use a numerical, auto-incremented, value for the PK and FK, but attach to it, in a separate column, a UUID. Whenever you are dealing internally, in the same application/system with the data, the numerical primary key is used.</p><pre title="Example UserDO that has both the Integer PK and the UUID column"><code lang="java">@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class UserDO {
    @Id
    @Column(name = "id", nullable = false)
    @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.<em>IDENTITY</em>)
    private Integer id;

    @Column(name = "uuid", columnDefinition = "VARCHAR(36)")
    @Type(type = "uuid-char")
    private UUID uuid;

    @Column
    private String username;

    @Column
    private String email;

    @Column
    private String passwordHash;

    @Column
    private String passwordSalt;
}</code></pre><p>However, when the data needs to be sent externally, you provide the UUID. Now the attacker can’t guess the UUID (or at least he will have a really hard time in doing so) and the internal workings are hidden. You store the user UUID in the session and use that one when performing security checks. You provide the UUID to the article/user/what-ever in the URL and use that one when searching for the right item. Once you find it, internally, you can start referencing it by the PK, just be careful not to expose it outside.</p><p>Any additional data that is referenced using FK can still be easily retrieved by the DB and Hibernate since the numerical value is being used. In short, you get the best of both worlds by using a numerical PK internally and an UUID externally. Initial search for an item my be a bit slower, but I believe it is negligible.</p></div></div></div>]]>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Hi! I'm Marcel, web developer at <a href="https://www.q42.com/">Q42</a> and creator of the <a href="https://micr.io/">Micrio storytelling platform</a>.</p>
<p>In 2015, I started developing a JavaScript viewer for ultra high resolution 2D and 360° images with added markers, tours, audio, and more. Since then, I've been pushing to find the best balance between hardware performance, minimal CPU and bandwidth use, and compatibility for older browsers to deliver a sharp and high quality viewing experience.</p>
<p>For Micrio, it is vital that the performance on the client's browser is as good as possible. The reason for this is very simple: when you are being told a story, or watching a movie, even <em>a single frameskip</em> immediately takes you out of your experience.</p>
<p>Since Micrio is being used for an <a href="https://micr.io/showcases">ever growing list</a> of awesome projects, the most important thing is that for whoever visits a Micrio project, it must work, and <em>work well</em>: delivering fast load times, and a butter smooth interactive experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> (Wasm) is the ability for your browser to run <em>compiled</em> code at (near-) native speeds. It is now recognised by the W3C as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/12/pressrelease-wasm-rec.html.en">4th official web programming language</a>, after HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<p>With it, you can run compiled code written in a variety of programming languages (C/C++, Rust, Go, AssemblyScript, <a href="https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-wasm-langs">and many more</a>) in your browser, without any need for plugins.</p>
<p>Finding out about Wasm in late 2019 really made me want to try it out. Could I use this tech to make the Micrio client run smoother than the current version does? Would I need to rewrite everything in C++, and if so, how would that work? Would the effort be worth the gains it would give me? And not in the least.. <em>how does it work!?</em></p>
<p>This article describes my journey from upgrading the Micrio <strong>JavaScript-only client to use WebAssembly</strong>, with the hopes of improving performance, and taking my code to the next level.</p>
<h3 id="thecurrentversion">The current version</h3>
<p>To give a rough idea about the tech stack of the current latest JS-only revision of Micrio (<a href="https://b.micr.io/micrio-2.9.min.js">version 2.9</a>): This library as a single JS file works on all semi-modern browsers, including even Internet Explorer 10 for 2D, and IE 11 for 360° images.</p>
<p>It uses Canvas2D for the rendering of 2D images, and <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a>/WebGL rendering for 360° images. Written in <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=es6">ES6 JavaScript</a> (or ECMAScript 6, the latest version of JavaScript), it still <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler">compiles</a> to ES5 to support Internet Explorer 11.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, displaying a <a href="https://micr.io/i/xCSYV/">231.250 x 193.750 pixel image</a> in your browser in a matter of milliseconds, allowing the user to freely zoom in and navigate, requires a little bit of processing power.</p>
<p>Now, Micrio 2.9 <em>isn't bad</em>. It runs pretty smoothly on all devices. But with WebAssembly around the corner, allowing all calculations to be done at native CPU speeds, this could potentially make a big difference in making Micrio's performance even better, and could improve the code architecture a lot.</p>
<p>And, perhaps, this could also mark the setup for a new major version, where I will draw a clear line and drop all compatibility and polyfills for older browsers: <strong>Micrio 3.0</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="firstrewritecandemscripten">First Rewrite: C++ and emscripten</h2>
<p>As a first step into the world of WebAssembly, getting to know the ecosystem, I started to play around with <a href="https://emscripten.org/">emscripten</a>. With it, you can take almost any project made in C or C++, and compile it to a binary <code>.wasm</code> file that your browser can natively run.</p>
<p>At this point, I didn't really have a clear image of where WebAssembly starts and ends, and how autonomously it could run inside your browser. So I started a new project from scratch to see if I could make a C++-implementation of the basic Micrio logic: a virtual <em>zoomable</em> and <em>pannable</em> image consisting of a lot of separate tiles, using a virtual camera for displaying only the tiles necessary for what the user is viewing inside your screen.</p>
<p>It turns out, emscripten already had great compatibility for <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">libsdl</a>: a low-level audio, keyboard/mouse input, and OpenGL library. Which is awesome, because I could write my code using this very well documented library, even including mouse and key inputs and WebGL rendering. Since I was also working with downloading images, I also used the <a href="https://github.com/nothings/stb">stb_image.h</a> image library.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/cpp.png" alt="Setting up SDL and OpenGL" title="C++ in the 21st century"></p>
<p>The largest struggle of this was picking up C++ again, never having used it outside of hobby scope many years ago. But after a few days of cursing and second guessing myself, I had a working first version with all of the most important features written with help of the SDL library:</p>
<ul>
<li>A virtual camera and all necessary viewing logic;</li>
<li>Image tiles downloading;</li>
<li>Rendering using WebGL(/OpenGL) using a simple shader;</li>
<li>Mouse event handling for panning and zooming the image;</li>
<li>Resize event handling to fit Micrio to the desired <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> HTML element</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see this version running here: <a href="https://b.micr.io/_test/wasm/index.html">https://b.micr.io/_test/wasm/index.html</a> :</p>

<h3 id="firstresults">First Results</h3>
<p>As incredibly awesome it was to see Micrio in C++ running smoothly in my browser, and even handing all the user's input, there were a few reservations, which left me with an unsatisfied feeling.</p>
<h4 id="1codingcfeltoldfashioned">1. Coding C++ felt old-fashioned</h4>
<p>Writing C++ felt like going back in time. Incredibly powerful and fully proven, but also archaic, especially for me as a web developer. I spent more time fiddling with making an optimized <code>Makefile</code> than I care to admit.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/makefile.png" alt="The emscripten C++ Makefile" title="( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"></p>
<h4 id="2thecompiledwasmbinarywasverylarge">2. The compiled <code>.wasm</code> binary was very large</h4>
<p>As great as the help of <code>libsdl</code> and <code>stb_image.h</code> were to let me use OpenGL and JPG image functions, as much did they add to the final compiled binary file. Even with all <code>emcc</code> compiler optimizations (which can even use the awesome <code>closure</code> JS compiler), the resulting WebAssembly binary file was 760KB. Compared to the JavaScript version of Micrio being around 240KB, this was a major setback. These libraries packed a lot of functionalities that were not necessary for Micrio, but were still included in the compiled version.</p>
<h4 id="3tilagluefile">3. TIL: A <em>glue</em> file</h4>
<p>This is the part where I learnt where the limits of WebAssembly start and finish. <strong>WebAssembly is not a magical self-contained binary that lets you run full applications out of the box</strong>. It actually needs to be <em>bound</em> to the browser using JavaScript.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/glued.png" alt="glue clipart"><br>
<small><a href="http://www.clker.com/clipart-13445.html">Image source</a></small></p>
<p>Where I thought that all the SDL OpenGL code in C++ would automagically be recognised by the browser: <em>wrong</em>. What <code>emscripten</code> does, is to take all OpenGL operations from C++, and <em>convert them</em> to WebGL operations your browser can understand.</p>
<p>Same with the <code>libsdl</code> mouse and keyboard-inputs: these were <strong>glued</strong> to the browser using an extra JavaScript file that would set event listeners for the specific cases, and send them to the WebAssembly binary. This separate JavaScript file was generated by the emscripten compiler, and had to be included in the HTML alongside the compiled binary <code>.wasm</code> file.</p>
<p>Everything added together, the new total of the <em>base engine</em> of Micrio was a whopping <strong>791KB</strong>; a bit too much for my liking.</p>
<h2 id="secondrewriteassemblyscript">Second Rewrite: AssemblyScript</h2>
<p>Fast forward a few months, to just after having attended the awesome <a href="https://webassembly-summit.org/">WebAssembly Summit</a> in Mountain View in February 2020. With a bundle of fresh energy and inspiration, I decided to see if I could use WebAssembly to improve the Micrio JavaScript client a second time.</p>
<p>During the WebAssembly conference, I was very impressed by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8j_ieOm4vE">synth demo</a> written in <strong><a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/">AssemblyScript</a></strong>, a language created specifically for WebAssembly, using the TypeScript syntax. Basically you can write (near) TypeScript, which compiles to a <code>.wasm</code>-binary. So anyone familiar with either TypeScript or JavaScript ES6 will not have a lot of difficulties using it.</p>
<p>And the great thing-- it's all installed using <code>npm</code>, so <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/quick-start.html">getting it up and running</a> and compiling your program is super easy!</p>
<p>There are a few basic <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/types.html"><code>types</code> added in AssemblyScript</a>, which are required for compile-time optimizations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>f64</code> / <code>f32</code> : For 64 or 32-bit floats;</li>
<li><code>i8</code> / <code>i16</code> / <code>i32</code> / <code>i64</code> : For signed <code>int</code>s, ranging in precision</li>
<li><code>u8</code> .. <code>u64</code> : For unsigned <code>int</code>s</li>
<li><a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/types.html">And a few more</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="goingatomic">Going atomic</h3>
<p>This time, I wanted to see if it was possible to only let a small part of Micrio run inside WebAssembly, and still use most of the JavaScript that was already inside the client. <em>How small can we get it?</em> I decided to focus on a subset of camera functions, such as translating screen coordinates to image coordinates and vice versa. So this time no rendering, event handling, or writing shaders.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/assemblyscript.png" alt="Simple camera functions in AssemblyScript" title="My First AssemblyScript"><br>
<small><em>Simple camera functions in AssemblyScript</em></small></p>
<p>The result: a 3KB binary containing some basic math functions, that take an input and return an output. AssemblyScript offers some <em>glue-tooling</em> by providing its own <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/loader.html">Loader</a>, which will deal with importing the binary file and being able to call these functions.</p>
<p>However, this is optional and I ended up using the JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Using_the_JavaScript_API">WebAssembly API</a>, <em>neat</em>. And it turns out, this is super easy: simply use the <code>fetch</code> API to load your compiled <code>.wasm</code> file, cast it as an <code>ArrayBuffer</code>, and use the <code>WebAssembly.instantiate()</code> function to get it up and running.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/instantiate.png" alt="Loading a wasm file" title="Gluing it yourself"></p>
<p>The compiled binary will then offer an <code>exports</code> object, containing the functions that you have exported in the AssemblyScript file, which you can immediately call from JavaScript as if they were normal functions.</p>
<p>Wait.. "<em>which you can immediately call from JavaScript as if they were normal functions</em>"...</p>
<p><strong>WebAssembly is running synchronously to JavaScript!</strong> 🤯</p>
<p>Having worked with WebWorkers before, I honestly thought that WebAssembly would run inside its own CPU thread, and that any function calls would be <code>async</code>. Nope, the Wasm-functions you call will return immediately!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/exports-and-imports.html#exports"><em>This is, like, powerful stuff</em>!</a></p>
<h3 id="bundlingthecompiledwasminsidethejsfile">Bundling the compiled Wasm inside the JS file</h3>
<p>Since I now had some extra performing hands on deck for Micrio that was very easy to integrate, I decided to include this minimal WebAssembly binary in the then-stable release of Micrio (2.9).</p>
<p>However, I didn't want an extra HTTP request for the Wasm binary every time someone loaded the Micrio JS. So I included a <code>base64</code> encoded version of the Wasm-file <em>inside</em> the Micrio JS, and for browsers that support it, auto-loaded that. As a …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

Source: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning">Google</a></figcaption></figure><p>There is a smÃ¶rgÃ¥sbord of tools supporting each individual stage of this cycle, which forces data science teams to build custom pipelines for the various ML frameworks (or even individual algorithms) that they use. Something as inconsequential as training and deploying a simple Scikit Learn linear regression model to SageMaker can take weeks or months to productionize, if your team doesnâ€™t have a pipeline already built for these specific frameworks.</p><p>In a world where itâ€™s no longer enough to train a model once, deploy, and forget about it, organizations are facing ever-mounting challenges with developing in-house MLops frameworks and processes.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://mlflow.org/">MLflow</a> â€” an open source framework created by Databricks to unify the model lifecycle management, used by Facebook, Zillow, Microsoft, and a host of other AI-first companies. MLflow seeks to directly address the key problems of model tracking and interoperability between different ML tools. MLflow works with any ML library, framework, or language, removing barriers to rapid prototyping and leading to quicker turnaround times for solving business problems in production.</p><p>For the perspicacious ML engineer, MLflow provides an intuitive and straightforward approach to model deployment while solving many of the common problems, such as tracking model metadata and persisting models in a registry, within the framework itself. Instead of building complicated in-house infrastructure for keeping track of your models (and their performance), MLflow provides simple, powerful tools to manage your models from inception to serving happy customers.</p><h2 id="monitoring-in-mlflow">Monitoring in MLflow</h2><p>One of the key features in MLflow is the ability to capture detailed metrics for your models. The framework is not opinionated about what you should log. Instead it provides a simple API for recording whatever data you might find useful. This is accomplished via calls to <code>mlflow.log_metrics</code> in your MLflow runs, and you can find additional examples and documentation <a href="https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#performance-tracking-with-metrics">here</a>.</p><p>These metrics can later be <a href="https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#visualizing-metrics">visualized</a> via the MLflow server interface, which is super handy for tracking model metrics across different iterations of a model, or over time.</p><figure><div><div><div data-rmiz-wrap="visible"><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>MLflow metrics visualization. Source: <a href="https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#visualizing-metrics">MLflow</a></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, MLflow has <a href="https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#automatic-logging">autologging integrations</a> with all the commonly used ML frameworks, providing a straightforward method to logging performance metrics.</p><p>However, the logging solutions native to these frameworks generally focus on model performance itself, such as its accuracy and loss, and do not adequately capture information about the context and environment in which your models operate. Figuring out <em>why </em>your models may be underperforming is a nigh impossible task if you donâ€™t capture this context.</p><h2 id="monitoring-data-quality-with-whylogs">Monitoring Data Quality with whylogs</h2><p>Luckily, MLflow makes it easy to add integration with third party libraries, so that various additional metrics can be collected both during the training process and once the model is live. By integrating whylogs into the MLflow runtime, we can add data quality monitoring to the model pipeline. <a href="https://github.com/whylabs/whylogs-python">whylogs</a> is an open source, lightweight, and high performance statistical data logging library that enables a fire-and-forget approach to logging data quality by profiling the data during training and as it flows through the model once it has been deployed.</p><p>Profiling data with whylogs allows engineers and data scientists to catch data quality issues during training as well as detect data drift after deployment, which ultimately enables a more informed analysis of the modelâ€™s performance over time. Rapid response to issues in production is also made possible, as data quality degradation can be uncovered in near real-time.</p><p>Why use whylogs over an in-house solution or another library? Great question!</p><ul><li>whylogs is entirely open source. No hidden rocks, undocumented interactions, or unsolvable data governance concerns.</li><li>It profiles data in an extremely efficient manner, with a constant memory footprint and low CPU overhead, letting it easily scale from megabytes to terabytes of incoming data. Save those GPU cycles for your models!</li></ul><figure><div><div><div data-rmiz-wrap="visible"><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>whylogs Java performance metrics.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Two things that aren’t changing are (1) customers are always going to want simpler ways to interact with their cloud infrastructure and (2) they’re always going to want tools to understand where their cloud costs are coming from to make better business decisions. Vantage is aiming to help with both of these challenges but customers also use other tools to help make informed business decisions. One of the most popular tools we found people using is Ec2instances.info and today I’m happy to announce that Ec2instances.info is joining forces with Vantage.</p><p>Ec2instances.info will now reside at instances.vantage.sh and exists in its same form. The site will continue to be completely free and we have plans to add more features and functionality to it, including additional service prices beyond virtual machine pricing. We’ve ensured that the redirects have backwards compatibility with the prior domain so everything should continue to work as expected.&nbsp;</p><p>Garret Heaton, the creator of Ec2instances.info, says:<br></p><blockquote>After running ec2instances.info as a side project for <a href="https://powdahound.com/2011/03/hosting-a-static-site-on-amazon-s3-ec2instances-info/">almost a decade</a> I'm thrilled to hand over the reins to the Vantage team. Watching the site help people year after year has been a real pleasure and I'm very grateful for all the bug reports and improvements submitted by the public. In recent years the amount of choice available in instance types has grown significantly so comparing them is especially important, but I haven't had time to improve the site at the same rate. I'm very excited to see Vantage invest in the site as well as help people control costs across their entire infrastructure.</blockquote><p>‍</p><p>Vantage is built by working backwards from customer feedback and we hope to use the same playbook for instances.vantage.sh - so please join our <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/vantagecommunity/shared_invite/zt-mc723hg0-64opi05ckDf3gE56xapntg">Slack Community</a>, follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/joinvantage">Twitter</a> or email us at <a href="mailto:support@vantage.sh">support@vantage.sh</a> to let us know your use-cases and how we can help.</p><p><strong>Q&amp;A</strong><br></p><p><strong>What is Vantage?</strong></p><p>Vantage is an alternative AWS console with a focus on developer experience and cost transparency.&nbsp;<br></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>What is EC2Instances.info?</strong></p><p>Ec2Instances.info, now instances.vantage.sh, is a tool for comparing hundreds of EC2 Instance Types across different instance type attributes.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p><strong>I use EC2Instances.info - how will this impact me?</strong></p><p>Only the domain is changing and all existing links will redirect in a way that preserves filters. For all intents and purposes, you shouldn’t be impacted.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p><strong>Do I need to be a registered Vantage user to use instances.vantage.sh?</strong></p><p>No. That being said, we are offering a one-time coupon code of $25 to all EC2Instances users that you can apply to your Vantage account using the coupon code of INSTANCES. This offer will expire on March 31st, 2021.</p><p><strong>I have a feature request for ec2instances.info - how can I submit it to you?</strong></p><p>You can continue to leave feedback on the existing <a href="https://github.com/powdahound/ec2instances.info">Github repository</a>, email <a href="mailto:support@vantage.sh">support@vantage.sh</a> with the subject line “Product Feedback Request” or join the “instances-vantage-sh” channel in the Vantage <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/vantagecommunity/shared_invite/zt-mc723hg0-64opi05ckDf3gE56xapntg">Slack community</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]>

In 2001, Mike Cannon-Brookes sent an email to his college classmates in Sydney, asking if anyone was interested in helping him launch a tech startup after graduation. Back then, entrepreneurship wasn't a popular career path in Australia; and Mike's only taker was Scott Farquhar, a fellow student who shared Mike's passion for computers and his frustration for the corporate grind. Together they launched Atlassian, a two-man tech support service that they managed from their bedrooms at all hours of the night. Unable to make money, Scott and Mike decided to pivot and sell some of the software they'd developed for themselves. Out of that grew Jira, a project-management tool that's used in all sorts of endeavors, from pizza delivery to the exploration of Mars. Today, Atlassian is valued at over $50 billion and Scott and Mike are Australia's first startup-to-IPO tech billionaires. </p><p>HIBT Virtual Event with Jay Shetty - information and tickets at: <br><a href="https://nprpresents.org/">https://nprpresents.org</a></p></div></div>]]>

      <p>This blog post is about what makes it so difficult to balance different needs in a good setup for cloud and email accounts, and my journey to a good solution. For those who want to see the ending right away, here's the ultimate setup I've landed on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email: Fastmail, with aliases forwarding my family's email to their respective Gmail accounts</li>
<li>Neither Google nor Microsoft having special handling for my domain name (<code>snoyman.com</code>)</li>
<li>Cloudflare for domain name registration (via transfers) and domain name serving</li>
<li>Netlify for hosting static sites, though I'll look into Cloudflare Pages soon hopefully</li>
<li>Code for sites on Github</li>
<li>Dynamic sites still hosted on an <a href="https://www.fpcomplete.com/products/kube360">FP Complete Kube360 cluster</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, does that jumble of words mean anything to you? Probably not much. The real questions are what I had tried previously, what problems I encountered, and how these choices overcame them. Let's hit it!</p>
<h2 id="michael-unmarried-sets-up-email">Michael, unmarried, sets up email</h2>
<p>Many years ago, I purchased <code>snoyman.com</code> so that I could host my own email and have the nifty looking email address <code>michael@snoyman.com</code>. I was probably around 20 at the time, and this seemed like the coolest thing in the world to me at the time. (Or so I think, I really can't remember that long ago well.) In any event, the first question is: where should I set up my mail hosting? I'm not sure if I tried other providers first, but at some point Google offered Google Apps for free (later renamed G Suite, later renamed Google Workspace), and I signed up and began using it for hosting my own email.</p>
<p>The first problem with this was that <code>michael@snoyman.com</code> became a <em>quasi Google account</em>. What I mean by that is that, on all Google systems, <code>michael@snoyman.com</code> was a valid username/account ID/whatever you want to call it. But not all of them supported Google Apps. If I remember correctly, in the glory days of Google Reader, I wasn't able to access it from Google Apps. And this is the first lesson in this saga:</p>
<p><strong>The cloud providers offer neutered accounts on their business-geared email hosting.</strong> We'll see this issue get worse with kids on Google, and completely repeat with Microsoft.</p>
<p>So I ended up creating a separate Gmail account <code>@gmail.com</code>, and setting up forwarding from one email address to the other. That meant I got full access to Google services, had a single inbox to check, and kept my snazzy <code>michael@snoyman.com</code> account. Downside: I often had the annoying question of "which Google account did I log into this service with?"</p>
<h2 id="forwarding-for-the-family">Forwarding for the family</h2>
<p>Others in the family decided they liked these <code>@snoyman.com</code> email addresses, and wanted them too. It was easy enough to set up some forwarding for various family members through Google Apps to their Gmail accounts. I don't know if they ran into similar issues with the multiple-sorta-Google-accounts issue.</p>
<h2 id="the-kids-need-accounts">The kids need accounts</h2>
<p>At some point, many years later, my parents bought my kids Android tablets. This necessitated setting up Google accounts for them. And this is where things broke down completely. Assuming I had a daughter Alice, the obvious email address would be <code>alice@snoyman.com</code>. Which would most directly mean creating a user account on the Google Apps instance (now called G Suite).</p>
<p>However, G Suite accounts didn't have full support for the family sharing and child protection limits we wanted to place. So again, we ran into the situation of needing both regular Gmail accounts and Google Apps accounts. So instead, I decided to go towards the forwarding setup I'd used for other family members:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each child gets a Gmail account, joined to our family's Google Family account</li>
<li>Children log into their tablets using those accounts, allowing us to control screen limits and other issues</li>
<li>I set up forwarding from G Suite from their <code>alice@snoyman.com</code> address to <code>alice.snoyman@gmail.com</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, within Gmail, I set up aliases for each child, so that <code>alice@snoyman.com</code> can be used as a login for their Gmail account. This means that if anyone tries to invite them to a document, for example, it goes to the correct Gmail account, which is nice.</p>
<h2 id="dropping-g-suite">Dropping G Suite</h2>
<p>At this point, the only person who had email actually hosted on G Suite was me. I was the only one left with two of these Google-ish accounts (a real <code>@gmail.com</code> address and the G Suite <code>michael@snoyman.com</code>). Getting rid of that was pretty easy: have G Suite forward emails from <code>michael@snoyman.com</code> to my <code>@gmail.com</code> account, and set up an alias in my Gmail account.</p>
<p>This left two problems, one minor, one slightly-less-minor. The first is that I had this entire G Suite setup for no reason other than forwarding emails around, which is silly. That's minor. The other problem is about email security. When you have forwarding set up like this, and when you send email from a different domain through Gmail, the security protocols of email don't perfectly reconcile things. I'm probably getting some of the details wrong, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email sent to <code>michael@snoyman.com</code> would arrive in my Gmail inbox with a DKIM failure, since the domain names (snoyman.com vs gmail.com) didn't match</li>
<li>Email sent from Gmail through my <code>michael@snoyman.com</code> address would say "via gmail.com" on the receiving end</li>
<li>If I used a desktop mail client instead of the web interface, there wasn't a way to have the email come from <code>michael@snoyman.com</code> at all</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're not familiar with the email security systems of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, consider yourself lucky. But suffice it to say that I realized I was pushing the limit of what "correct" email usage was.</p>
<p>Was this a big deal? Arguably not. Arguably I should have just stopped here. And for a while I did. But it always irked me.</p>
<h2 id="microsoft-to-the-rescue-nah">Microsoft to the rescue? Nah</h2>
<p>The real issue above was that I was trying to use Gmail to handle a different domain name, which it's definitely not intended to do. And on the other hand, using G Suite for that domain name—which <em>is</em> intended to work—doesn't work well for accessing the full suite of Google services. So I got a great idea: what if I moved <code>snoyman.com</code> from G Suite over to Microsoft's online offering? I had made that move for work, where we'd recently embraced Microsoft 365, and the migration was fairly painless.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the <em>exact same issue</em> immediately popped up. On the Microsoft side, there are two kinds of accounts: A "Microsoft Account" and a "Microsoft Work or School Account." Both Google and Microsoft could really do a better job of signposting the differences between their account types and giving them useful names. But the exact same restrictions came into play. If I put <code>snoyman.com</code> as a domain in Microsoft 365 (and/or Azure AD, for anyone keeping score at home), I would have conflicts with normal Microsoft Accounts for myself and the kids. And as the kids were right then getting into online classes due to COVID, using Windows 10 laptops with Microsoft account logins, and playing a lot of <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2021/01/parents-guide-minecraft/">Minecraft</a>, I didn't want to go down this path.</p>
<p>Instead of all that, on the Microsoft side, I created each kid their own Microsoft account with their <code>@snoyman.com</code> email address, and never had Microsoft manage our emails at all.</p>
<h2 id="dropping-g-suite-hello-google-domains">Dropping G Suite, hello Google Domains</h2>
<p>At some point, I noticed that Google Domains had support for some useful features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bare name redirects (e.g. redirecting from <code>http://snoyman.com</code> to <code>https://www.snoyman.com</code>)</li>
<li>Email forwarding</li>
</ul>
<p>I moved a few of my domains over to Google as the registrar, configured some email forwarding and various website redirect rules, and I was finally free of my G Suite account. And just in time to avoid Google renaming <em>yet again</em> to Google Workspace. Hurrah!</p>
<p>I still had the email security issues I mentioned above. I solved one of them by setting up outgoing email to be sent via Mailgun, which allowed proper handling of SPF and DKIM. But this was yet another component I needed to maintain, and still didn't feel satisfactory.</p>
<h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>
<p>I realized at some point in all of this that I was obsessing over fairly unimportant details around email. No one really cares if my emails said snoyman.com or gmail.com in the headers. I wasn't checking DKIM signatures on incoming messages. Why was I still bothered by all of this?</p>
<p>And the reality was that I simply wanted to get off of Google for my email. Like many others, I'm bothered by Google's (lack of) privacy practices, and them knowing too much about me. I didn't really like them controlling my domain names either.</p>
<p>So over the weekend, I decided to finally bite the bullet and look into a solution one of my coworkers had told me about.</p>
<h2 id="moving-to-fastmail">Moving to Fastmail</h2>
<p>I'd investigated Fastmail earlier in this saga, but was concerned I wouldn't be able to handle the large number of email forwards needed for all my family members. Maybe when I initially investigated, that was in fact correct. However, when I investigated this weekend, I found out that Fastmail does, in fact, support "600+ alias addresses." I was out of excuses.</p>
<p>I purchased a standard account for myself at $50/year, set up aliases for all of my family members, and switched over my DNS records. I imported my email and contacts from Gmail into Fastmail. I configured my local Outlook desktop client (which I was already using for work) to talk to Fastmail. I installed the Fastmail app on my phone. And just like that, I had everything I wanted! Plus a mail storage limit of 30GB instead of 15GB. And honestly, I was starting to edge towards that 15GB limit.</p>
<p>Since the rest of my family is happily using Gmail and doesn't intend to switch, no additional changes were necessary. But it's very nice to know that, any time they want, I can sign them up for a Fastmail account on our domain and switch over fairly seamlessly.</p>
<h2 id="moving-to-cloudflare">Moving to Cloudflare</h2>
<p>Now that I didn't have any email forwarding going on with Google Domains, the only …</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>

<p>Ever so softly, European politicians are beginning to voice a once unthinkable threat by suggesting they could snatch patents from drug companies to make up for massive shortfalls in the supply of coronavirus vaccines.</p>



<p>Big Pharma businesses have for many years regarded EU countries as unquestioningly loyal allies over intellectual property rights in the international trade arena. The EU could always be relied upon to defend U.S., Japanese and European drugmakers from poor nations in Africa and South Asia that have long wanted the recipe of critical medicines to be handed over to generic manufacturers. </p>



<p>But fury over the inability of companies to deliver on contracts amid the COVID-19 pandemic means that now even European politicians, from the Italian parliament to German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, are arguing, albeit cautiously, that patents may no longer be as sacrosanct as they once were. </p>



<p>The big question is whether they are just saber-rattling, knowing full well that any patent raid would shatter an ultimate commercial taboo and risk an exodus of leading companies from Europe over fears about the loss of IP.  </p>



<p>The European Commission's Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton, a doyen of French big business, is at pains to stress that there is <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1598714">no question of redistributing patents.</a> On Wednesday, he insisted that he would lead efforts by Brussels to help pharmaceutical companies expand their production sites and cooperate on output. “I will make sure they get everything they need,” he said.</p>



<p>That more traditional pro-business stance from Breton will prove comforting to pharma executives, who are now facing far more hostile messaging from other quarters of the EU. </p>



<p>European Council President Charles Michel last week raised the prospect that the EU could adopt “urgent measures” by invoking an emergency provision in the EU treaties in response to supply shortfalls. Commission officials have pointed to powers in Article 122 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which ostensibly could be used to force vaccine makers to share their patents or other licenses — known as compulsory licensing.</p>



<p>Europe's most powerful economy minister, Germany’s Altmaier, who hails from the business-friendly center-right Christian Democratic Union, also seemed open to the possibility. During a<a href="https://www.zdf.de/politik/maybrit-illner/corona-virus-ohne-grenzen-hat-europa-die-kontrolle-verloren-sendung-vom-28-januar-2021-100.html" target="_blank"> television talk show</a> last week, Altmaier said compulsory licenses wouldn’t help to increase production in the next couple of months because it would take time to set up additional production centers. But if cooperation among pharmaceutical companies to increase production should fail, he said, he “would be willing to talk about coercive measures.”</p>



<p>Adding to the chorus, Alexis Tsipras, former Greek prime minister and current leader of the main opposition Syriza party, has called for a European patents pool. In an opinion piece for <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-vaccines-public-good-not-corporate-product/">POLITICO</a> last week, he warned that depending on a few pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines for the whole of Europe is a “weak” strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Going nuclear</h3>



<p>India and South Africa are pushing for a nuclear option, above and beyond compulsory licensing. They want a temporary international waiver on the agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) for all coronavirus-related medical products, including vaccines and treatments.</p>



<p>This is set to come up on the agenda of the informal <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/trips_e.htm" target="_blank">TRIPS Council meeting</a> Thursday, but is set to meet almost universal opposition from wealthy countries at the World Trade Organization, with the EU, U.K., U.S., and Switzerland all coming out against it. </p>



<p>Intriguingly, however, even here, potential cracks are emerging in the longer term European position. In early December, the Italian parliament passed a resolution <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.camera.it/leg18/410?idSeduta=0440&amp;tipo=documenti_seduta" target="_blank">calling on the government to support the waiver</a>.</p>



<p>Civil society’s hopes were further boosted during the C20 — a civil society meeting that runs parallel to the G20 — from January 25 to 27. According to several attendees, Italian officials suggested that the Italian G20 presidency this year could support the waiver. </p>



<p>However, other attendees have played down the importance of those comments, since they weren't issued at the ministerial level and were conciliatory in tone. Indeed, at the official level in Geneva, the Italian foreign ministry said Rome's position was still fully in line with the European Commission's. </p>



<p>Nevertheless, Brandon Locke, policy and advocacy manager at ONE Campaign anti-poverty advocacy group, believes the Italian debate “might just be the crack in the ice to sort of get things rolling.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The fallout from the AstraZeneca and Pfizer [vaccine] delays are really causing a massive shift in how a lot of member states are thinking about vaccine supply and the traditional frameworks through which manufacturing was supposed to be carried out,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tommaso Valletti, former chief competition economist at the Commission, has also signaled support for the waiver and the issuing of compulsory licenses. "Do we really believe that this would 'jeopardize' future innovation? 2.2m people are dead," he <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/TomValletti/status/1356609791527964677" target="_blank">tweeted</a> on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, there remains the formidable hurdle that WTO decisions must pass by consensus: Even if Italy did support the waiver, it's unlikely to make any difference.</p>



<h3>Push for unilateral action </h3>



<p>While unified WTO action is unlikely, the EU, U.S., U.K., Switzerland and Japan have offered to help members that want to implement existing "flexibilities" in the WTO’s intellectual property agreement, according to one Geneva trade official.&nbsp;That brings compulsory licensing into play, and countries can implement this individually. Several countries, including <a href="https://www.taylorwessing.com/fr/insights-and-events/insights/2020/04/covid-19-and-public-compulsory-licensing-of-drugs-in-europe" target="_blank">Germany</a> and <a href="https://www.cliffordchance.com/content/dam/cliffordchance/briefings/2020/04/compulsory-licensing-and-new-provisions-affecting-ip-holders-during-the-coronavirus-crisis-in-france-and-globally.pdf" target="_blank">France</a>, have already even strengthened legislation to make these measures easier to implement. </p>



<p>Usually seen as a last resort, there are very few cases of compulsory licensing of medicines. But one could make the case in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, explains Ceyhun Pehlivan, a lawyer at Linklaters’ Madrid office: Governments could say it's an appropriate option if the license holder can't produce enough vaccines or medicines. Opponents of compulsory licenses argue they would discourage companies from producing these kinds of products in the future, Pehlivan added. </p>



<p>Historically, compulsory licensing has certainly not proved an attractive option. Only once in WTO history has a developing country lacking production capabilities forced an export license onto a patent-holding country. In 2007, Rwanda sought to import antiretroviral HIV medicines from Canada — and Ottawa granted the license over a year after the initial ask.</p>



<p>There's another problem — possibly the Achilles' heel of the push for IP waivers and compulsory licenses: While granting a compulsory license may mean that another manufacturer can produce a drug or vaccine without being sued by the license holder, it doesn't give them the all-important know-how or technology transfer to actually make the drug. These are separate from patents and are particularly important for the manufacture of complex drugs, such as mRNA vaccines, which up until now, had never been made before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Geneva-based diplomat pointed to the know-how issue as a significant obstacle. “That’s the $1 million question,” the diplomat said.</p>



<p>One possible avenue is the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/covid-19-technology-access-pool#:~:text=The%20COVID%2D19%20Technology%20Access,knowledge%2C%20intellectual%20property%20and%20data." target="_blank">Technology Access Pool</a> (C-TAP), which was meant to become a source for open-access knowledge on COVID-19 science and technology. However, as yet, not a single patent-holding drugmaker has agreed to sign up.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>‘Guerilla war’ against IP rights&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Behind the spat at the WTO, a larger question looms: Is this an attempt to permanently override aspects of intellectual property rights that some countries disagree with?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You can essentially see it as a play by two countries, India and South Africa, who never really liked the current intellectual property rights rules of the WTO,” said Simon Evenett, an economics professor at St. Gallen University in Switzerland. “I see it in a broader 25-year-long context of this sort of guerilla war against these rules.”</p>



<p>But for now, patent-defending countries are unlikely to let their guard down on intellectual property at the WTO, even during the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Almost every major pharmaceutical exporter except India has objected to this,” Evenett said. “I don’t see that proposal going ahead, unless circumstances dramatically change.</p>



<p>"But that doesn’t mean that India and South Africa can’t act unilaterally," he added.</p>

				<p>If I could go back in time and give a younger me one piece of advice when starting my company, it would be - don't start a business, build a side project instead. Build it for fun, see where it goes, let curiosity be your carrot as opposed to the expectation of success being a stick.</p><p>Side projects are simple. In fact they're so simple that you work on them just for the fun of it. You get deep into it, with no expectations, let what you learn evolve what you do next and let the project basically pull itself out of you.</p><p>When you start a business there is an expectation of success attached to it, otherwise the business is a failure. You need to find a business model, figure out what your vision is and what the market size is. "Is it a big enough idea?" is often the question asked by friends, parents and investors. There's nothing more demotivating than talking about your business to a cynical aunt.</p><p>Secondly, you need to be able to sell your ideas to those around you, and do it without fear. The best way to shed the fear of appearing foolish is to actually do something foolish for the fun of it. Strangely, you'll find that everyone around you is a lot more encouraging in this scenario than if you set out claiming you're going to build a big business.</p><p>Big things are accomplished by the compounding effect of many foolish little things done over a long time. If you start off trying to do a big thing, you'll always feel unaccomplished because you're too focused on what you haven't achieved yet. Focus on the small things, work on little projects, make an app for your friends as a joke, file your aunt's taxes, write a blog, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyrobots/">build a shitty robot</a>. Keep doing that and just enjoy the process of building and creating things, and keep that child-like sense of curiosity alive. </p><p>The main reason for this is that you need to do the groundwork to prepare yourself to be receptive to opportunities when they come up. You never know when they will, but unless you are knee deep in something you love already, you just won't notice it.</p><blockquote>“You want to know how to paint a perfect painting? It's easy.

    <div>
      
      <p>by Dietrich Ayala on 2021-02-08</p>

      

      

<p>
  <img src="https://blog.ipfs.io/img/opera-ipfs-header.png" alt="IPFS in Opera Touch for iOS">
</p>

<p>In 2020 we announced a big moment for IPFS: The first official support of IPFS protocol addressing in a major browser, when <a href="https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-03-30-ipfs-in-opera-for-android/">Opera released IPFS support in their Android browser</a>. This was an important step in IPFS browser support generally, by building interest and momentum. We didn’t stop there, and we’ve got not just one… BUT TWO releases to share with you today!</p>

<p>First, Opera has now added support for IPFS addressing to Opera Touch, their iOS browser.</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://blog.ipfs.io/img/opera-ios-wikipedia-short.png" alt="A screenshot of Wikipedia on IPFS in Opera Touch">
</p>

<p>Second, support for IPFS addressing in Opera desktop browser for Windows, macOS, and Linux will be coming in their next release, currently planned for March 2021.</p>

<p>As a special surprise for EthDenver, you can download a preview build of Opera for desktop which has IPFS addressing support! Give it a spin at <a href="https://ethdenver2021.opera.com/">ethdenver2021.opera.com</a>.</p>

<p>With these releases, Opera will now support <code>ipfs://</code> and <code>ipns://</code> addressing across their browser product line on all major operating systems: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-it">How do I use it?</h2>

<p>First, install Opera Touch on your iOS device. If you’re reading this on an iOS device, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/opera-touch-web-browser/id1411869974">click to install now</a>.</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://blog.ipfs.io/img/opera-ios-app-store-short.png" alt="Opera Touch in the iOS app store">
</p>

<p>Then you can open content using IPFS protocol addresses, like the <a href="ipns://blog.ipfs.io">blog you’re reading now</a>, <a href="ipns://en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org">Wikipedia</a>, or this <a href="ipfs://bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi">Persian room guardian</a> by <a href="https://www.anyabozartist.com/the-persian-cat">Anya Boz</a>. You can easily upload files to IPFS using the <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/install/ipfs-desktop/">IPFS desktop application</a> or <a href="https://share.ipfs.io/">Share.ipfs.io</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>

<p>Opera Touch supports navigating to addresses for <code>ipfs://</code> and <code>ipns://</code> protocol schemes, which are handled by a remote HTTP gateway. By default the gateway used is <code>dweb.link</code>, which is operated by Protocol Labs. The ability to select a different gateway is coming in the next update of Opera Touch.</p>

<p>Native representation of IPFS addresses in browsers is important, even when the content is loaded from an HTTP gateway as IPFS URIs are resolved out of the box, without the need for any additional extensions or opt-in settings, which familiarizes users and developers with decentralized concepts of content-addressing and creates a path to readiness for when native nodes are available.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>Opera desktop browser support for IPFS addressing will ship soon, and we’re discussing what additional features to add next to build on top of this foundation of universal addressing support across the Opera browser line. Have ideas for what you’d like to see in Opera next? Let us know on the <a href="https://discuss.ipfs.io/">IPFS forums</a>, or tweet your ideas to <a href="https://twitter.com/opera">@Opera</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ipfs">@IPFS</a> on Twitter!</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/opera-touch-web-browser/id1411869974">Install Opera Touch on iOS now!</a></p>

he turn of the millennium brought a wave of improved 3D and CG technology that we've seen proliferate through fully animated properties as well as live action visual effects. This can be attributed to a mixture of things including an insatiable desire on the consumer side for higher quality CG content, a continuation of Moore's Law, and James Cameron.

<span>“</span>
<span>"When you're making a movie that costs $200 million… your target audience is people with a pulse and $15 - or even just $15."<br>- <a href="https://ew.com/article/2009/12/11/avatar-james-cameron-2/">-James Cameron, 2009</a></span>
<span>”</span>
</blockquote> <div><p>
James Cameron's obsession with technology, perfection, and thus, massive risk-taking in filmmaking has been well-documented. In 1977 Cameron quit his job as a truck driver and entered the film industry after seeing <i>Star Wars</i>. He worked his way up from a miniature model maker to special effects and design work, culminating in a special effects director role in 1982 (which he was fired from). Cameron had always been obsessed with science fiction and wrote the screenplay for <i>The Terminator (1984)</i> after dreaming about the story while he had food poisoning, eventually releasing the $6.5M budget film to an over $78M worldwide box office success.
</p><p>
After a string of successes, Cameron took the biggest risk of his career with <i>Titantic</i> in 1997. Cameron's perfection led to him deep-sea exploratory filming, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4bx0Y2Udg4">expensive large-scale sets</a>, and other boundary-pushing digital effects done by Digital Domain, a VFX company Cameron helped start in the early 1990s. <i>Titanic</i> became the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a budget that ballooned all the way to $200M. The bet paid off and <i>Titanic</i> went on to make $1.8B and win 11 Academy Awards.
</p><p>
In 1994 Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for an epic science fiction film that he planned to make after the completion of <i>Titanic</i> in 1997. He planned to release the film in late 1999 but after <i>Titanic</i>, he realized that the visual effects technology was not yet ready to achieve his grandiose vision of an entirely CG world with hybrid human-CG actors. Cameron would wait over 10 years (<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/read-james-camerons-sworn-declaration-avatar-399979">or as he would later argue for legal sake, 50 years</a>) for the technology to catch up to make his dream into a reality, eventually beginning preliminary work on what would be known as <i>Avatar</i> in 2006.

<blockquote>
<span>“</span>
<span>"There's a term in Hollywood for Cameron's style of directing…They call this 'building the parachute on the way down.'" <br>
- Bruce Davis, Executive Director of Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</span>
<span>”</span>
</blockquote> <div><p>
Cameron continued to push the envelope of technical possibilities in film across motion capture (or as Cameron would create, <i>performance capture</i>), real-time rendering, and CGI with <i>Avatar</i>.
</p><p>
Cameron wanted to improve upon the past decades worth of technological development by blending human actors into their CG characters, mapping their emotions in real-time, and allowing him to see how their acting performed in the entirely CG world of the film in real-time. To do so Cameron worked with Peter Jackson's Weta Digital to create a new device that would incorporate every facial movement into the hybrid CG/3D character with minimal post processing.
</p><p>
<i>"…the process of motion capture served only as a starting point for animators, who would finish the job with digital brush strokes. "Gollum's face was entirely animated by hand…King Kong was a third or so straight performance capture. It was never automatic." This time, Cameron wanted to keep the embellishment by animators to a minimum and let the actors drive their own performances." </i> <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/movies/a5067/4339455/"><b>- Joe Letteri, Weta Digital effects master</b></a></p></div>

</figure>
<div><p>
After seeing early renders of their first attempts, he complained about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">uncanny valley</a> effects and Weta spent an entire year perfecting Cameron's invention with improved algorithms that would allow for raw motion capture data from the rig to render into a realistic, hybrid character. The results were groundbreaking.
</p><p>
Leading up to its release, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/media/09avatar.html">rumors were flying</a> about the film's near $300M budget (an additional $150M was spent on promotion) and concerns around any original story being able to reach the high bar for such a budget, even with Cameron attached. Avatar premiered on December 10th 2009 and went on to be the highest grossing film of all-time, doing $2.79B at the box office (<i>Avengers: Endgame</i> recently took 2nd place from <i>Titanic</i> at $2.77B).
</p><p>
Like <i>Toy Story</i> did for 3D Animation, <i>Avatar</i> is often considered one of the most important films in CGI technology history. As time has gone on, we've only seen these pioneers like Pixar and others continue to push the limits through the 2010s.&nbsp;
</p><p>
James Cameron is currently working on four consecutive sequels to <i>Avatar</i> due for release in 2020, 2021, 2024, and 2025, at a collective budget of over $1B.
</p><p>
What parachutes he is building on the way down is anyone's guess. </p></div>  <figure>

</figure> <div><p>
Since <i>Avatar</i>, we have seen a steady progress of CGI technology innovation. <i>The Lego Movie (2014)</i> was widely praised (ironically) for its photorealism of entirely CG lego characters. Earlier this year the internet recently collectively freaked out about <a href="https://www.distractify.com/p/pixar-then-now">the staggering progress</a> in physics simulation and photorealism for a <i>Toy Story 4 (2019)</i> cat. Pixar had been building towards this in public through simulations of hair physics and rendering since the creation of the hairy Sulley from <i>Monsters Inc.</i>, to <i>Ratatouille</i>'s <a href="https://graphics.pixar.com/library/500MillionHairs/paper.pdf">simulation of hair</a> when Remy jumps in water, and through Merida from <i>Brave</i>'s large red hair. The team at Pixar has covered their technical progress across <a href="https://graphics.pixar.com/library/Hair/paper.pdf">multiple</a> <a href="https://graphics.pixar.com/library/CurlyHairA/paper.pdf">research</a> <a href="https://graphics.pixar.com/library/SigAsia2015/paper.pdf">papers</a></p></div><figure>

</figure> 
<div><p>
Pixar has taken a similar approach when it came to modeling humans. The team rarely showed full humans in the original <i>Toy Story</i>, but as their technical abilities progressed through their next four films from 1995-2004, they were able to fully feature humans for the first time with <i>The Incredibles'</i> release in November 2004.

<figcaption>The Lion King is entirely done via CGI</figcaption>
</figure> 
<div><p>
Later this year we'll see the live action remake of <i>The Lion King (2019)</i> (as Disney continues to trot out once profitable or popular 2D animated film remakes) which has started a debate about what constitutes "live action" anymore.
</p><p>
While <i>The Lion King</i> is no longer 2D animated, it is entirely done via CGI as tech has continued to blur the lines between animation and live action, or as Sean Bailey, President of Production at Walt Disney Studios put it:
</p></div>
<blockquote>
<span>“</span>
<span>"It is a new form of filmmaking. Historical definitions don't work. It uses some techniques that would traditionally be called animation, and other techniques that would traditionally be called live action. It is an evolution of the technology Jon used in Jungle Book.</span>
<span>”</span>
</blockquote> <div><p>
While these properties all continue to push the envelope on blurring the lines between what's real or not, perhaps none has done so more aggressively than Netflix's series of shorts <i>Love Death and Robots (2019)</i>.
</p><p>
Led by David Fincher and Tim Miller, LDR is a tour de force of state-of-the-art and experimental animation, featuring 13 studios and animators from nine countries. </p></div>

<p>
One of the shorts, <i>Lucky 13</i>, has been applauded for its incredible photorealistic CG animation which featured face scanning, a proprietary facial rig, and intense photorealistic environments which allowed the team to "cross the uncanny valley". </p>

<div><p>
Another episode titled <i>The Witness</i>, utilized a piece of software from the fashion industry (along with keyframing) to create an aesthetic and physics surrounding clothing that led the internet to accuse the filmmakers of lying about their lack of use of motion capture and live action actors. Creator Alberto Mielgo described it in detail below: </p><p> 
<i>"The characters were animated naked, and then we started putting clothes on top…We used a software called Marvellous Designer. It's a fashion software that was originally created to help designers to create their clothes, but it has a brilliant way of simulating clothes. However, the program is not ready for a pipeline inside of it, so it's not the main program that people use. It's my favorite for the look of it, and I pushed my team to use it. We created a pipeline that doesn't actually exist, and that's why people are in shock because they've never seen clothes move that well." </i> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/04/02/how-netflixs-love-death-robots-created-that-eye-popping-animation">IGN, 2019</a></p><p>
<i>LDR</i> wasn't without its issues, specifically surrounding <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/love-death-and-robots-review-netflix">claims of sexism</a>, excessive nudity, as well as complaints about the actual stories. Despite these shortcomings it was the result of something larger happening within animation; a shifting distribution model, expansion of capital, and perhaps more opportunity for experimentation.&nbsp;
</p><p>
Today's over-the-top (OTT) players are the 10,000 pound gorillas in the room, and while the animation throne of tomorrow could start with Netflix and possibly end with Disney+, two decades before <i>BoJack Horseman</i> was a twinkle in Netflix's eye, we had Cartoon Network. </p></div>

After Turner Broadcasting acquired a portfolio of animation IP from MGM/United Artists as well as the entire Hanna-Barbera catalogue for $320M in 1991, they created Cartoon Network. The creation of Cartoon Network in 1992 helped push forward the idea of single-genre …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Normal situations should not be warnings (especially not repeated ones)</h2>

	<p><small>February  9, 2021</small></p>
</div><div><p>Every so often (or really, too often), people with good intentions
build a program that looks at some things or does some things, and
they decide to have that program emit warnings or set status results
if things are not quite perfect and as expected. This is a mistake,
and it makes system administrators who have to deal with the program
unhappy. <strong>An ordinary system configuration should not cause a
program to raise warnings or error markers</strong>, even if it doesn't
allow all of the things that a program is capable of doing (or that
the program wants to do by default).  In addition, every warning
should be rate-limited in any situation that can plausibly emit
them regularly.</p>

<p>That all sounds abstract, so let's make it concrete with some
examples drawn from the very latest version (1.1.0) of the <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter">host agent</a>. The host agent gathers
a bunch of information from your system, which is separated into a
bunch of 'collectors' (one for each sort of information). Collectors
may be enabled or disabled by default, and as part of the metrics
that the host agent emits it can report if a particular collector
said that it failed (what consitutes 'failure' is up to the collector
to decide).</p>

<p>The host agent has collectors for a number of Linux filesystem types
(such as XFS, Btrfs, and ZFS), for networking technologies such as
Fibrechannel and Infiniband, and for network stack information such
as IP filtering connection tracking ('conntrack'), among other
collectors. All of the collectors I've named are enabled by default.
Naturally, many systems do not actually have XFS, Btrfs, or ZFS
filesystems, or Infiniband networking, or any 'conntrack' state.
Unfortunately, of these enabled by default collectors, zfs, infiniband,
fibrechannel, and conntrack all generate metrics reporting a collector
failure on Linux servers that don't use those respective technologies.
Without advance knowledge of the specific configuration of every
server you monitor, this makes it impossible to tell the difference
between a machine that doesn't have one of those things and a real
collector failure on a machine that does have one and so should be
successfully collecting information about them. But at least these
failures only show up in the generated metrics. At least two
collectors in 1.1.0 do worse by emitting actual warnings into the
host agent's logs.</p>

<p>The first collector is for Linux's new <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/accounting/psi.html">pressure stall information</a>. This
is valuable information but of course is only supported on recent
kernels, which means recent versions from Linux distributions (so,
for example, both Ubuntu 18.04 and CentOS 7 use kernels without
this information). However, if the host agent's 'pressure' collector
can't find the /proc files it expects, it doesn't just report a
collector failure, it emits an error message:</p>

<blockquote><pre>level=error ts=2021-02-08T19:42:48.048Z caller=collector.go:161 msg="collector failed" name=pressure duration_seconds=0.073142059 err="failed to retrieve pressure stats: psi_stats: unavailable for cpu"
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>At least you can disable this collector on older kernels, and automate
that with a cover script that checks for /proc/pressure and disables the
pressure collector if it's not there.</p>

<p>The second collector is for ZFS metrics. In addition to a large
amount of regular ZFS statistics, recent versions of <a href="https://zfsonlinux.org/">ZFS on Linux</a> expose kernel information about the overall
health of each ZFS pool on the system. This was introduced in ZFS
on Linux version 0.8.0, which is more recent that the version of
ZoL that is included in, for example, Ubuntu 18.04. Unfortunately,
in version 1.1.0 the Prometheus host agent ZFS collector insists
on this overall health information being present; if it isn't, the
collector emits a warning:</p>

<blockquote><pre>level=warn ts=2021-02-09T01:14:09.074Z caller=zfs_linux.go:125 collector=zfs msg="Not found pool state files"
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Since this is only part of the ZFS collector's activity, you can't
disable just this pool state collection. Your only options are to either
disable the entire collector, losing all ZFS metrics on say <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/ZFSFileserverSetupIII">your
Ubuntu 18.04 ZFS fileservers</a>, or have
frequent warnings flood your logs. Or you can take the third path of
not using version 1.1.0 of the host agent.</p>

<p>(Neither the pressure collector nor the ZFS collector rate-limit
these error and warning messages. Instead one such message will be
emitted every time the host agent is polled, which is often as
frequently as once every fifteen or even every ten seconds.)</p>

February 9, 2021 | https://www.polarsignals.com/blog/posts/2021/02/09/announcing-polar-signals-continuous-profiler/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.polarsignals.com/blog/posts/2021/02/09/announcing-polar-signals-continuous-profiler/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Today we are pleased to introduce Polar Signals <strong>Continuous Profiler</strong>, an open source based SaaS for Continuous Profiling. Profiling has long been a tool in the developer's toolbox. It allows CPU, memory, I/O usage and more to be understood down to a line of code. It is an immensely valuable tool for debugging. <em>Continuous profiling</em> is the act of taking profiles of programs in a systematic way. Polar Signals Continuous Profiler, based on the open source <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/conprof/conprof">Conprof</a> project, collects, stores and makes <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/google/pprof">pprof</a> profiles available to be queried over time. This is useful in post-mortem analysis, when it is too late to take measurements. In short, Continuous Profiling allows for profiling to be systematic, instead of a search for the needle in the haystack.</p><h3>Traditional Workflow</h3><p>To understand how Polar Signals Continuous Profiler works, and why we built it, let's go through the traditional workflow of what a developer goes through when profiling. A typical scenario starts out with either a production incident or the intent to optimize a piece of code. Optimization is often driven by the intention to make a system faster, or for example to reduce resource usage in order to save cost.</p><p>Incidents caused by running out of memory (OOMKill) can be a very stressful situation, the process has already been killed by the operating system, and so it is not possible to obtain profiles about the situation anymore. Obtaining profiles often requires SSHing onto production machines and capturing profiles manually. This is problematic for security and auditability, besides that, it is also easy to make mistakes when SSHing in production environments. Above all, profiling manually in this fashion is a search for the needle in the haystack. It is impossible to know whether a situation is reproducible in a way that allows capturing the right data.</p><h3>Polar Signals Continuous Profiler Workflow</h3><p>The goal of Polar Signals Continuous Profiler is to turn the search for the right data into a systematic one. With Polar Signals Continuous Profiler, profiles are captured periodically, ensuring that profiles are available for any moment in time, that way the right data is always only a search away. This way, when a process ran out of memory, a latency spike happens or when we want to start optimize code, the data is already available! This saves time obtaining the data manually, but more importantly the <em>right</em> data is already captured - no need to wait or try and reproduce a past situation.</p><img src="https://www.polarsignals.com/blog/posts/2021/02/09/announcing-polar-signals-continuous-profiler/query-over-time.png" alt="Polar Signals Continuous Profiler Query Over Time"><p>Once the data is available over time, new useful workflows are unlocked. Take the scenario of optimizing a piece of code for reducing resource usage for example. A profile of a particular moment of time is useful, but it is only representative of that exact moment in time. When the data is collected over time, it can for example be summarized into a single report, making it not only representative of that moment of time, but the entire time range. We have found this to be particularly useful to summarize performance characteristics of an entire version of code.</p><img src="https://www.polarsignals.com/blog/posts/2021/02/09/announcing-polar-signals-continuous-profiler/merge.png" alt="Polar Signals Continuous Profiler Merge Feature"><p>And last but not least, not only is the data available over time, but also across deployment-rollouts. It allows answering questions that thus far have been notoriously difficult to answer, which boils down to "What changed in my code, that caused a change in performance?" This typically originates from one of two questions. Why did our resource usage increase? And did my optimization changes work?</p><img src="https://www.polarsignals.com/blog/posts/2021/02/09/announcing-polar-signals-continuous-profiler/compare.png" alt="Polar Signals Continuous Profiler Compare Feature"><p>To sum up, using Polar Signals Continuous Profiler an organization can:</p><ol><li>Save money on their cloud bill, by optimizing resource usage.</li><li>Boost conversion rate, by improving application latency.</li><li>Save time and stress, by make systems more reliable.</li></ol><h3>How Polar Signals Continuous Profiler Works</h3><p>Polar Signals Continuous Profiler periodically scrapes <a href="https://github.com/google/pprof">pprof</a> compatible profiles from HTTP endpoints. We are launching with support for <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, which supports profiling in pprof format via its standard library. Many programs written in Go already have these endpoints, so organizations that already use Go are likely to not need any changes to their code to start using Polar Signals Continuous Profiler! Rust, Python, NodeJS and JVM are already on the roadmap, but let us know what languages and runtimes you would like to see!</p><p>The collector is configured to discover targets using service discovery, this happens to be identical to <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus'</a> service discovery, so organizations already using Prometheus can re-use configuration from it! And if not, we have automated deployment and configuration strategies prepared for you, for example to get started on Kubernetes seamlessly.</p><p>The collector regularly scrapes the HTTP endpoints and sends the results to Polar Signals. Once received by Polar Signals the exploration for improvements can start!</p><h3>Next steps</h3><p>Polar Signals Continuous Profiler is in private beta starting today! We are working hard to bring it to General Availability. We are in the process of onboarding users to our private beta, and if you want to participate, request access:</p></article></div>]]>

First Wave Antiracism battled slavery and segregation. Second Wave Antiracism, in the 1970s and 1980s, battled racist attitudes and taught America that being racist was a flaw. Third Wave Antiracism, becoming mainstream in the 2010s, teaches that racism is baked into the structure of society, so whites’ “complicity” in living within it constitutes racism itself, while for black people, grappling with the racism surrounding them is the totality of experience and must condition exquisite sensitivity toward them, including a suspension of standards of achievement and conduct.</p><p>Third Wave Antiracist tenets, stated clearly and placed in simple oppositions, translate into nothing whatsoever:</p><ol><li><p>When black people say you have insulted them, apologize with profound sincerity and guilt. <strong>But </strong>don’t put black people in a position where you expect them to forgive you. They have dealt with too much to be expected to.</p></li><li><p>Black people are a conglomeration of disparate individuals. “Black culture” is code for “pathological, primitive ghetto people.” <strong>But </strong>don’t expect black people to assimilate to “white” social norms because black people have a culture of their own.</p></li><li><p>Silence about racism is violence. <strong>But </strong>elevate the voices of the oppressed over your own.</p></li><li><p>You must strive eternally to understand the experiences of black people. <strong>But </strong>you can never understand what it is to be black, and if you think you do you’re a racist.</p></li><li><p>Show interest in multiculturalism.&nbsp;<strong>But </strong>do not culturally appropriate. What is not your culture is not for you, and you may not try it or do it. But—if you aren’t nevertheless <em>interested</em> in it, you are a racist.</p></li><li><p>Support black people in creating their own spaces and stay out of them. <strong>But </strong>seek to have black friends. If you don’t have any, you’re a racist. And if you claim any, they’d better be <em>good</em> friends—in their private spaces, you aren’t allowed in.</p></li><li><p>When whites move away from&nbsp;black neighborhoods, it’s white flight.&nbsp;<strong>But </strong>when whites move into black neighborhoods, it’s gentrification, even when they pay black residents generously for their houses.</p></li><li><p>If you’re white and only date white people, you’re a racist. <strong>But </strong>if you’re white and date a black person you are, if only deep down, exotifying an “other.”</p></li><li><p>Black people cannot be held accountable for everything every black person does. <strong>But </strong>all whites must acknowledge their personal complicity in the perfidy throughout history of “whiteness.”</p></li><li><p>Black students must be admitted to schools via adjusted grade and test score standards to ensure a representative number of them and foster a diversity of views in classrooms. <strong>But </strong>it is racist to assume a black student was admitted to a school via racial preferences, and racist to expect them to represent the “diverse” view in classroom discussions.</p></li></ol><p>I suspect that deep down, most know that none of this catechism makes any sense. Less obvious is that it was not even composed with logic in mind. The self-contradiction of these tenets is crucial, in revealing that Third Wave Antiracism is not a philosophy but a religion. </p><p>The revelation of racism is, itself and alone, the point, the intention, of this curriculum. As such, the fact that if you think a little, the tenets cancel one another out, is considered trivial. That they serve their true purpose of revealing people as bigots is paramount—sacrosanct, as it were. Third Wave Antiracism’s needlepoint homily <em>par excellence</em> is the following:</p><blockquote><p>Battling power relations and their discriminatory effects must be the central focus of all human endeavor, be it intellectual, moral, civic or artistic. Those who resist this focus, or even evidence insufficient adherence to it, must be sharply condemned, deprived of influence, and ostracized.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Third Wave Antiracism is losing innocent people jobs.</strong> It is coloring, detouring and sometimes strangling academic inquiry. It forces us to render a great deal of our public discussion of urgent issues in doubletalk any 10-year-old can see through. It forces us to start teaching our actual 10-year-olds, in order to hold them off from spoiling the show in that way, to believe in sophistry in the name of enlightenment. On that, Third Wave Antiracism guru Ibram X. Kendi has written a book on how to raise antiracist children called <em>Antiracist Baby</em>. You couldn’t imagine it better: Are we in a Christopher Guest movie? This and so much else is a sign that Third Wave Antiracism forces us to pretend that performance art is politics. It forces us to spend endless amounts of time listening to nonsense presented as wisdom, and pretend to like it.</p><p>I write this viscerally driven by the fact that all of this supposed wisdom is founded in an ideology under which white people calling themselves our saviors make black people look like the dumbest, weakest, most self-indulgent human beings in the history of our species, and teach black people to revel in that status and cherish it as making us special. Talking of <em>Antiracist Baby</em>, I am especially dismayed at the idea of this indoctrination infecting my daughters’ sense of self. I can’t always be with them, and this anti-humanist ideology may seep into their school curriculum. I shudder at the thought: teachers with eyes shining at the prospect of showing their antiracism by teaching my daughters that they are poster children rather than individuals. </p><p>Ta-Nehisi Coates in <em>Between the World and Me</em> wanted to teach his son that America is set against him; I want to teach my kids the reality of their lives in the 21st&nbsp;rather than early-to-mid-20th century. Lord forbid my daughters internalize a pathetic—yes, absolutely pathetic in all of the resonances of that word—sense that what makes them interesting is what other people think of them, or don’t.</p><p>Many will see me as traitorous in writing this as a black person. They will not understand that I see myself as serving my race by writing it. One of the grimmest tragedies of how this perversion of sociopolitics makes us think (or, not think) is that it will bar more than a few black readers from understanding that I am calling for them to be treated with true dignity. However, they and everyone else should also realize: I know quite well that white readers will be more likely to hear out views like this when written by a black person, and consider it nothing less than my duty as a black person to write it.</p><p>A white version of this would be blithely dismissed as racist. I will be dismissed instead as self-hating by a certain crowd. But frankly, they won’t really mean it, and anyone who gets through <a href="https://johnmcwhorter.substack.com/p/the-elect-neoracists-posing-as-antiracists">my new book</a> on this subject, which I am now publishing in serial, will see that whatever traits I harbor, hating myself or being ashamed of being black is not one of them. And we shall move on. As in, to realizing that what I am documenting matters, and matters deeply. Namely, that America’s sense of what it is to be intellectual, moral, or artistic; what it is to educate a child; what it is to foster justice; what is to express oneself properly; what it is to be a nation—all is being refounded upon a religion. </p><p>This is directly antithetical to the very foundations of the American experiment. Religion has no place in the classroom, in the halls of ivy, in our codes of ethics, or in deciding how we express ourselves, and almost all of us spontaneously understand that and see any misunderstanding of the premise as backward. Yet since about 2015, a peculiar contingent has been slowly headlocking us into making an exception, supposing that this new religion is so incontestably good, so gorgeously surpassing millennia of brilliant philosophers’ attempts to identify the ultimate morality, that we can only bow down in humble acquiescence.</p><p>But a new religion in the guise of world progress is not an advance; it is a detour. It is not altruism; it is self-help. It is not sunlight; it is fungus. It’s time it became ordinary to call it for what it is and stop cowering before it, letting it make people so much less than they—black and everything else—could be.</p><p><strong>Third Wave Antiracism exploits modern Americans’ fear</strong> of being thought racist, using this to promulgate an obsessive, self-involved, totalitarian and unnecessary kind of cultural reprogramming. One could be excused for thinking this glowering kabuki is a continuation of the Civil Rights efforts of yore, the only kind of new antiracism there could be. Its adherents preach with such contemptuous indignation, and are now situated in the most prestigious and influential institutions in the land—on their good days they can seem awfully “correct.”</p><p>However, there is nothing correct about the essence of American thought and culture being transplanted into the soil of a religious faith. Some will go as far as to own up to it being a religion, and wonder why we can’t just accept it as our new national creed. The problem is that on matters of societal procedure and priorities, the adherents of this religion—true to the very nature of religion—cannot be reasoned with. They are, in this, medievals with lattes.</p><p>We need not wonder what the basic objections will be: Third Wave Antiracism isn’t really a religion; I am oversimplifying; I shouldn’t write this without being a theologian; it is a religion but it’s a good one; and so on. I will get all of that out of the way as we go on, and then offer some genuine solutions. But first, what this is not.</p><ol><li><p><em>It is not an argument against protest.</em> I am not arguing against the basic premises of Black Lives Matter, although I have had my differences with some of its offshoot developments. I am not arguing that the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s would have been better off sticking to quiet negotiations. I am not arguing against the left. I am arguing against a particular strain of the left that has come to exert a grievous influence over American institutions, to the point that we are beginning to …</p></li></ol></div></div>

  <div>
    <section>  </section> <string></string> <section><p>If you haven't worked in a typed language before, it may not be obvious at first the power that it brings.  This article will show you how to leverage the type system to make your code easier to use and more reusable.</p> <h4>Target Audience</h4> <p>This article is aimed at developers that are new to Go and have little to no Go experience.</p> <h2>The Problem</h2> <p>For this article, we will look at how to handle <code language="plain">categorical</code> data.  In this case, specifically how to handle the <code language="plain">genre</code> category for classifying a book.</p> <p>To start, we'll define a data structure for a <code language="plain">Book</code> , in which we'll want to categorize it via the <code language="plain">genre</code> :</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="book" src="./src/v1/books.go">package books

type Book struct {
	ID    int
	Name  string
	Genre string
}</code></pre>   <p>Now that we have the book defined, let's go ahead and define some constants for <code language="plain">genre</code> :</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="genre" src="./src/v1/books.go">const (
	Adventure     = "Adventure"
	Comic         = "Comic"
	Crime         = "Crime"
	Fiction       = "Fiction"
	Fantasy       = "Fantasy"
	Historical    = "Historical"
	Horror        = "Horror"
	Magic         = "Magic"
	Mystery       = "Mystery"
	Philosophical = "Philosophical"
	Political     = "Political"
	Romance       = "Romance"
	Science       = "Science"
	Superhero     = "Superhero"
	Thriller      = "Thriller"
	Western       = "Western"
)</code></pre>   <p>So far, this seems fine.  However, the <code language="plain">genre</code> constants are strings.  While this makes for a very "humanized" way of reading the code, it's not very efficient as it pertains to a computer program.  Strings will take up more storage space, and more memory in the program (not to mention if we stored millions of data records to a database).  As such, we really want to use a smaller data type to represent this data.</p> <p>In Go, one way we can do this is to create constants that are based on the <code language="plain">int</code> type.</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="genre" src="./src/v2/books.go">const (
	Adventure     = 1
	Comic         = 2
	Crime         = 3
	Fiction       = 4
	Fantasy       = 5
	Historical    = 6
	Horror        = 7
	Magic         = 8
	Mystery       = 9
	Philosophical = 10
	Political     = 11
	Romance       = 12
	Science       = 13
	Superhero     = 14
	Thriller      = 15
	Western       = 16
)</code></pre>   <p>We also need to change the <code language="plain">Book</code> structure to now represent <code language="plain">Genre</code> as an int:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="book" src="./src/v2/books.go">type Book struct {
	ID    int
	Name  string
	Genre int
}</code></pre>   <p>While we now have a more effecient memory model for <code language="plain">Genre</code> , it's not as "human" friendly.  If I print out the value of a <code language="plain">Book</code> , we now just get an integer value.  To show this, we'll write a quick test showing the output:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="test" src="./src/v2/books_test.go">package books

import (
	"testing"
)

func TestGenre(t *testing.T) {
	b := Book{
		ID:    1,
		Name:  "All About Go",
		Genre: Magic,
	}

	t.Logf("%+v\n", b)

	if got, exp := b.Genre, 8; got != exp {
		t.Errorf("unexpected genre.  got %d, exp %d", got, exp)
	}
}</code></pre>   <p>And here is the output.</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="output" src="./src/v2/books_test.go">$ go test -v ./...
=== RUN   TestGenre
    books_test.go:14: {ID:1 Name:All About Go Genre:8}
--- PASS: TestGenre (0.00s)
PASS
ok      github.com/gopherguides/corp/_blog/types/leveraging-types/src/v2     (cached)</code></pre>   <p>Notice that the <code language="plain">Genre</code> just shows a value of <code language="plain">8</code> .  Any time we debug the code, or write a report, etc, we now need to figure out what <code language="plain">8</code> actually represents for a human being.</p> <p>To do this, we can write a helper function that takes the <code language="plain">Genre</code> value, and determines what the "human" representation should be:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="string" src="./src/v2/books.go">func GenreToString(i int) string {
	switch i {
	case 1:
		return "Adventure"
	case 2:
		return "Comic"
	case 3:
		return "Crime"
	case 4:
		return "Fiction"
	case 5:
		return "Fantasy"
	case 6:
		return "Historical"
	case 7:
		return "Horror"
	case 8:
		return "Magic"
	case 9:
		return "Mystery"
	case 10:
		return "Philosophical"
	case 11:
		return "Political"
	case 12:
		return "Romance"
	case 13:
		return "Science"
	case 14:
		return "Superhero"
	case 15:
		return "Thriller"
	case 16:
		return "Western"
	default:
		return ""
	}
}</code></pre>   <h2>A Better Way</h2> <p>While all the above code works fine, it's really missing some key points.</p> <ul><li><p>If a value for a <code language="plain">Genre</code> has to change in the future, we not only have to change the constant value, but we also have to update the <code language="plain">GenreToString</code> function.  If we don't, this will create a bug in our code.</p></li> <li><p>We aren't leveraging the type system to encapsulate this behavior for <code language="plain">Genre</code> .  We'll show you what we mean by that shortly.</p></li></ul> <p>The first thing we really need to do is write a more resilient <code language="plain">GenreToString</code> function.  What we mean by resilient is that even if the value of the <code language="plain">Genre</code> constant changes in the future, the <code language="plain">GenreToString</code> function will not need to change.</p> <p>The correct way to do that is no longer use hard coded values, but use the value of the constant themselves:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="string" src="./src/v3/books.go">func GenreToString(i int) string {
	switch i {
	case Adventure:
		return "Adventure"
	case Comic:
		return "Comic"
	case Crime:
		return "Crime"
	case Fiction:
		return "Fiction"
	case Fantasy:
		return "Fantasy"
	case Historical:
		return "Historical"
	case Horror:
		return "Horror"
	case Magic:
		return "Magic"
	case Mystery:
		return "Mystery"
	case Philosophical:
		return "Philosophical"
	case Political:
		return "Political"
	case Romance:
		return "Romance"
	case Science:
		return "Science"
	case Superhero:
		return "Superhero"
	case Thriller:
		return "Thriller"
	case Western:
		return "Western"
	default:
		return ""
	}
}</code></pre>   <p>Ok, that's much cleaner (and readable), but we still haven't solved the fact that when we print it out, it shows a data value ( <code language="plain">int</code> ), and not a "human" readable value.</p> <h2>Types to the Rescue</h2> <p>Instead of using a generic <code language="plain">int</code> type for <code language="plain">Genre</code> , we can create our own type based on an existing type.  In this case, we'll create a new type called <code language="plain">Genre</code> based on the <code language="plain">int</code> type:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="genre" src="./src/v4/books.go">type Genre int</code></pre>   <p>Now, we'll define our constants as <code language="plain">Genre</code> types:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="constants" src="./src/v4/books.go">const (
	Adventure     Genre = 1
	Comic         Genre = 2
	Crime         Genre = 3
	Fiction       Genre = 4
	Fantasy       Genre = 5
	Historical    Genre = 6
	Horror        Genre = 7
	Magic         Genre = 8
	Mystery       Genre = 9
	Philosophical Genre = 10
	Political     Genre = 11
	Romance       Genre = 12
	Science       Genre = 13
	Superhero     Genre = 14
	Thriller      Genre = 15
	Western       Genre = 16
)</code></pre>   <p>So far, the code doesn't really feel different.  However, now that <code language="plain">Genre</code> is it's own type, we can add methods to it.  This allows us to encapsulate the "human" behavior we want to the type, and not as a generic function.</p> <p>To do this, we'll add a <code language="plain">String</code> method to the <code language="plain">Genre</code> type:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="string" src="./src/v4/books.go">func (g Genre) String() string {
	switch g {
	case Adventure:
		return "Adventure"
	case Comic:
		return "Comic"
	case Crime:
		return "Crime"
	case Fiction:
		return "Fiction"
	case Fantasy:
		return "Fantasy"
	case Historical:
		return "Historical"
	case Horror:
		return "Horror"
	case Magic:
		return "Magic"
	case Mystery:
		return "Mystery"
	case Philosophical:
		return "Philosophical"
	case Political:
		return "Political"
	case Romance:
		return "Romance"
	case Science:
		return "Science"
	case Superhero:
		return "Superhero"
	case Thriller:
		return "Thriller"
	case Western:
		return "Western"
	default:
		return ""
	}
}</code></pre>   <p>Now, we'll be able to use the <code language="plain">String</code> method when we want to see what the "human" value of a <code language="plain">Genre</code> is:</p> <pre><code language="go">b := Book{
	ID:    1,
	Name:  "All About Go",
	Genre: Magic,
}
fmt.Println(b.Genre.String())</code></pre> <p>Output:</p> <pre><code language="sh">Magic</code></pre> <h2>Magic Formatting</h2> <p>In Go, if you add a <code language="plain">String</code> method to any type, the <code language="plain">fmt</code> package will now use your <code language="plain">String</code> method to "pretty print" the representation of your type.  Because of this, we will now see that if we print out the <code language="plain">book</code> in our tests, we get a "human-readable" <code language="plain">Genre</code> as well:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="test" src="./src/v4/books_test.go">func TestGenre(t *testing.T) {
	b := Book{
		ID:    1,
		Name:  "All About Go",
		Genre: Magic,
	}

	t.Logf("%+v\n", b)

	if got, exp := b.Genre.String(), "Magic"; got != exp {
		t.Errorf("unexpected genre.  got %q, exp %q", got, exp)
	}
}</code></pre>   <p>Output:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="output" src="./src/v4/books_test.go">$ go test -v -run=TestGenre -count=1 .
=== RUN   TestGenre
    books_test.go:16: {ID:1 Name:All About Go Genre:Magic}
--- PASS: TestGenre (0.00s)
PASS
ok      book    0.059s</code></pre>   <p>We now see the value for <code language="plain">Genre</code> in the printed output is <code language="plain">Magic</code> , and not <code language="plain">8</code> .

<p><em><strong>Abstract : </strong><span lang="en">In this post we describe the construction of a small amateur radio telescope operating at the frequency of 11.2 GHz. The construction of the radio telescope takes advantage of the satellite TV market which has made it easy and cheap to find parabolic reflector antennas with relative illuminator (feed horn) and LNB block (low noise amplifier-frequency converter). The performances of a similar instrument are naturally rather limited, however they still allow to make interesting observations of some of the most intense radio sources.</span></em></p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Radio astronomy is a difficult and fascinating science. It requires the use of bulky and expensive antennas, uses sophisticated radio-electronic technologies and sophisticated algorithms for signal processing. At first glance it would seem completely beyond the reach of an “amateur”. In reality it is possible to make interesting radio astronomical observations even at an amateur level.<br>
On our site we have already described some radio astronomy projects for specific applications:</p>

</ul>
<p>Now we want to try to make an “amateur” radio telescope based on the principle of the <strong>radiometer</strong>. This is certainly not the place to give detailed information on radio astronomy and radio telescopes (there is a lot of information on the net and specific texts), so we limit ourselves to providing some hints on the main points that guided us in the construction of the radio telescope.</p>
<p>Radio astronomy studies celestial bodies by analyzing the radio waves emitted by objects in the sky: any object emits electromagnetic waves through various physical processes (thermal and non-thermal), these waves are picked up by the antenna and analyzed with appropriate instruments: in general the characteristics of the captured signal are no different from those that characterize a <strong>broad spectrum electrical noise</strong>. The purpose of the radio telescope is to pick up this radiation and measure the signal strength, such an instrument is called a radiometer. To be precise, we speak of power per unit area and per unit of bandwidth and is expressed in Jansky&nbsp;: <strong>1Jy = 10<sup>-26</sup> W/m<sup>2</sup> Hz</strong>.</p>
<p>The range of radio frequencies useful for radio astronomy observations is between <strong>20 MHz</strong> and about <strong>20 GHz</strong>: below 20 MHz there is absorption by the ionosphere, above 20 GHz there is absorption by of the gases present in the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="tw-target-text" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Traduzione"><span lang="en">To choose the most suitable frequency band for an amateur radio telescope we must make a compromise between the observation possibilities and the cost and feasibility constraints. The frequency spectrum of the radio-source emissions depends on the underlying physical process: for “thermal” emissions such as the sun or the moon, the intensity follows the <strong>law of the black body</strong> with maximums at high frequencies (according to the approximation of Rayleigh-Jeans<strong> I ∝ 1/λ<sup>4</sup></strong>), while for non-thermal emissions (for example synchrotron emission) the maximums are at lower frequencies, as can be seen in the graph below which shows the intensity of some radio sources as a function of frequency.</span><a href="http://physicsopenlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/radiosorgenti.png"><img data-attachment-id="14927" data-permalink="https://physicsopenlab.org/2020/10/10/un-semplice-radiotelescopio-a-11-2-ghz/radiosorgenti/" data-orig-file="https://physicsopenlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/radiosorgenti.png" data-orig-size="658,756" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="radiosorgenti" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://physicsopenlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/radiosorgenti-261x300.png" data-large-file="https://physicsopenlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/radiosorgenti.png" loading="lazy" src="http://physicsopenlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/radiosorgenti.png" alt="" width="450" height="515"></a></p>
<p>As we know the dimensions of the antenna are related to the wavelength of the radiation to be received, furthermore our antenna must be sufficiently directive, otherwise it would be practically useless: this means that to receive frequencies below 1 GHz the dimensions of the antenna should be significantly greater than 1m: large antennas are expensive and difficult to move.<br>
Another aspect to consider is external radio interference. The ether, especially in the city, is now saturated with transmissions and RF signals from the most heterogeneous origin: radio and TV broadcasting, cellular networks, WiFi networks, disturbances from power lines, etc …. Not having the possibility to install the radio telescope in “quiet” places we must choose a frequency band that is not too disturbed.</p>
<p>For the reasons described above, the choice is almost obligatory: the <strong>10-12 GHz frequency band</strong> is the one that seems most suitable for an amateur project like ours. At these frequencies, parabolic reflector antennas and devices designed for satellite television can be re-used. The costs of the equipment are affordable, the spatial resolution of the antenna is quite good and the interference is low (basically broadcasting satellites) and easily avoidable.<br>
Working at lower frequencies would make it possible to easily receive more radio sources but with a considerable increase in terms of costs, not to mention the problem of interference.</p>
<h3>Parabolic Dish Antenna</h3>
<p id="tw-target-text" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Traduzione"><span lang="en">The antenna we found on the second-hand market is a <strong>prime focus dish</strong> with a diameter of 120 cm. For radio astronomy applications it is better that the dish is of the prime focus type: in these antennas the feed horn is placed in the focus of the dish. In offset-type dishes, the feed-horn is not placed in the center but on the side, this type has constructive advantages but is more difficult to aim to the source than the prime focus.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Traduzione">For this antenna we can calculate the gain and the directivity intended as half power band width HPBW (half power band width) :</p>
<p><strong>G = η*(π*D/λ) = 40 dB</strong></p>
<p><strong>HPBW = 65*λ/D = 1.45°</strong></p>
<p>Where<br>
<strong>η : efficiency = 0.5</strong><br>
<strong>D : diameter = 120 cm</strong><br>
<strong>λ : wavelength = 2.68 cm (correspond to 11.2 GHz)</strong></p>
<p id="tw-target-text" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Traduzione"><span lang="en">The images below show the antenna and the metal structure used for manual movement.</span></p>

<h3>LNB</h3>
<p dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Traduzione"><span lang="en">The first component of the system is the converter-amplifier block, the so-called <strong>LNB</strong>. This is the most important component because system performance largely depends on it. Our system receives in the 10-12 GHz band, at these frequencies the use of cables is problematic, for this reason the LNB block provides for a frequency down conversion in a lower band so that normal coaxial cables can be used.<br>
</span><span lang="en">The following image shows the basic scheme of the LNB block: there is a first <strong>RF amplification stage</strong>, followed by the mixer which multiplies the RF signal with the signal generated by a <strong>local oscillator (LO)</strong>. The resulting signal contains the sum and difference frequencies, the next filter eliminates the high frequency sum components to let pass only the frequencies in the band of interest, called <strong>intermediate frequencies (IF)</strong>, which are further amplified by another amplifier stage. In practice it is a heterodyne scheme, in which the frequency of the local oscillator is fixed.</span></p>

<p>The LNB block we use is<strong> Invacom’s SNF-031</strong> model which has<strong> low noise</strong> and <strong>good stability</strong> of the gain parameters with respect to variations in operating temperature. The actual antenna is located inside the waveguide which has a C120 flange on the outside to which the feed horn is fixed, which has the task of collecting the waves reflected by the dish and conveying them to the inside the waveguide.</p>
<p>LNB features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating frequency band : 10.7 – 12.75 GHz</li>
<li>Intermediate frequencies (IF) : 950 – 2150 MHz, LO = 9.75 GHz</li>
<li><strong>Noise Figure NF = 0.3 dB</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gain G = 50 – 60 dB</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>The Receiver</h3>
<p id="tw-target-text" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Traduzione"><span lang="en">The receiver consists of the few components, shown in the following image: there is a bias-T for feeding the LNB block, a bandpass filter centered at 1420 MHZ, a wide-band amplifier and the <strong>Airspy R2 SDR receiver</strong>. The “hardware” part has the function of limiting the receiving band and giving the signal a second amplification after the LNB stage. The signal is then acquired by Airspy and subsequently processed for the determination of the total power using <strong>GNURadio</strong> software. The <strong>radiometer</strong> function is practically realized through software.</span></p>

<p><strong>Features of our receiver :</strong><br>
Frequency Band = 80 MHz<br>
G<sub>LNB</sub> = 55 dB ; NF<sub>LNB</sub> = 0.3 dB<br>
G<sub>Filter</sub> = 3.5 dB (insertion loss)<br>
G<sub>Ampli</sub> = 15 dB ; NF<sub>Ampli</sub> = 0.75 dB<br>
<strong>Gain : G<sub>LNB</sub> – G<sub>Filter</sub> + G<sub>Ampli</sub> = 55 -3.5 +15 = 66.5 dB</strong><br>
<strong>Noise Figure : F = F<sub>LNB</sub> + (F<sub>Ampli</sub> – 1)/G<sub>LNB</sub> = 0.3 dB<br>
T<sub>e</sub> = (F – 1) * T<sub>0</sub> = 20.3 °K (Receiver equivalent temperature)</strong></p>
<h4>Bias-T</h4>
<p>The Bias-T has the function of “injecting” the supply voltage to the LNB block along the coaxial cable. In practice it is a simple circuit with a coupling capacitor to filter the DC component towards the RF side and an inductance at the DC input. Obtained on eBay, it can be easily self-built but attention must be paid to the “RF” quality of the components and the shielding.</p>

<h4>1420 MHz Band Pass Filter</h4>
<p>This filter is dedicated to amateur radioastronomers interested in the hydrogen line observations. It uses the TA2494A SAW component and measures only 50 x 10mm. It features edge pads for an easy soldering of a RF shield. Insertion loss is typically less than 3.5dB and bandwith 80MHz.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Data</strong> :<br>
Center Frequency <strong>1420MHz</strong><br>
Usable Bandpass <strong>1380-1460MHz</strong><br>
Insertion Loss, 1380 to 1460 MHz <strong>3.5dB</strong><br>
Amplitude Ripple, 1380 to 1460 MHz 1.0 dBpp<br>
VSWR, 1380 &nbsp;to 1420 MHz 1.9:1<br>
Rejection referenced to 0dB :<br>
DC to 1300 MHz 28dB<br>
1550 to 3000 MHz 30dB<br>
Impedance 50Ω<br>
Maximum Input Power Level 10 dBm</p>
<p>In the images below we show the unit and its frequency response. We have soldered two wires between the SMA female headers and we wrapped the filter with aluminum tape in order to shield the filter.</p>

<h4>Wideband Amplifier</h4>
<p>This unit HAB-FLTNOSAW built by UPUTRONICS is a preamp designed to go between a software defined radio receiver and an antenna. The LNA used inside is a MiniCircuits PSA4-5043. This particular model has the SAW filter removed to cover the 0.1MHz to 4GHz. There are 2 options for powering the unit : either by the USB header or via bias-tee. Devices such as the Airspy can enable bias-tee and power the device. Alternatively any mini USB cable can be used to power the device. We chose to power the unit via USB line.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Data</strong> :<br>
Gain 24db @ 100MHz -&gt; <strong>15.2db @ 1415MHz</strong><br>
<strong>NF 0.75dB</strong><br>
Supply Voltage USB or Bias tee 5V</p>

And for good reason. It’s <em>relatively</em> high-performance and easy to learn, and more importantly, has a large ecosystem around it. Just about anything you want to create, there’s a good chance someone’s made it, and has it available as a package. But React is not perfect and not always the right choice. This is an exploration of libraries I’ve used and I consider to be, in certain cases, better alternatives.</p>
<h3 id="going-reactless">Going React…less?<a href="https://www.dshomoye.dev/you-may-not-need-react/#going-reactless"></a></h3>
<p>I still primarily use react, I am confidently productive writing in the hooks/functional pattern - in fact, I <em>enjoy</em> the pattern. However, I think it can be an overkill for simple use cases. Responding to events, making http calls, and substituting elements on a page, is <em>not</em> that hard at small scale. Having to transpile and bundle - fiddling with <code>webpack</code> and <code>babel</code> etc… just to get some interactivity — is a little too much. The same complaint applies to <code>Angular</code> and <code>Vue</code> (with single file components) or any other library that requires a build step and has a non-trivial runtime. For creating a new web app (site?) - its worthwhile considering something simpler than react - it will remove a lot of complication and reduce the time it takes to create a working app - and maintaining it.</p>
<p>For the most basic “sample” app: this is what a react component that has a counter looks like:</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> useState <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react"</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>function</span> <span>App</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> name <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>count<span>,</span> setCount<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span>div className<span>=</span><span>"App"</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>p<span>&gt;</span>My name is <span>{</span>name<span>}</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>p<span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>h1<span>&gt;</span>Button Clicked<span>:</span> <span>{</span>count<span>}</span> times<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>h1<span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>div<span>&gt;</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Most of this code is tiny compared to what the browser will <em>actually</em> run - all of the <code>JSX</code> (html-looking part) inside the <code>return</code> statement isn’t valid javascript - it’s syntactic sugar for more complex function calls to React APIs and it all gets transpiled and bundled before shipping. This is what I sometimes find unnerving about react, especially with smaller apps. It sometimes feels like too much abstraction. There are many, many alternatives to React. JavaScript isn’t exactly short on libraries (for better or worse), but I want to focus on three.</p>
<h3 id="vanillajs">VanillaJS<a href="https://www.dshomoye.dev/you-may-not-need-react/#vanillajs"></a></h3>
<p>The first option here, is, well, the “use nothing” option. Just write JavaScript, inside html (or a script file) and make use of all the native DOM (the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model">document object model</a>) apis; the same ones every other library depends on anyway. The <code>"vanillaJs"</code> route. I recommend reading the tongue-in-cheek site created for <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="http://vanilla-js.com/">vanillajs</a>. It’s impressive is just how much more efficient using plain/vanilla is over adding a library - essentially a middle-man to DOM operations. This is definitely going to be the best-performing approach. Bundle size is 0Kb+ - you only have to worry about how much code <em>you</em> write. Nothing beats that. And of course, there’s no build step. Just write, save. And you’re done.</p>
<h4 id="vanilla-js-example">Vanilla JS Example<a href="https://www.dshomoye.dev/you-may-not-need-react/#vanilla-js-example"></a></h4>
<p>Here’s a working example of an incrementing button in vanilla js.</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>html</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>app<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
      <span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>label<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>Button clicked: 0 times<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
      <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>click<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>Add 1<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>
      <span>const</span> btn <span>=</span> document<span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>"click"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
      <span>const</span> label <span>=</span> document<span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>"label"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
      <span>let</span> clicked <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

      btn<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"click"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        clicked <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
        label<span>.</span>innerText <span>=</span> <span><span>`</span><span>Button clicked :</span><span><span>${</span>clicked<span>}</span></span><span> times</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
      <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    </span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>html</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>I consider this a clearer, more explicit code than the react example. It is <em>exactly</em> how the browser works. Creating a non-trivial web page using this vanillajs is a good learning experience; even if for no other reason than understanding how the browser APIs work.</p>
<p>**This <em>looks</em> like a stateful component in vanilla, but it’s definitely not. Based on context, it could be buggy. It’s intentionally simple, the point isn’t state management. I’m simply highlighting what’s <em>possible</em>.</p>
<h3 id="alpinejs">AlpineJS<a href="https://www.dshomoye.dev/you-may-not-need-react/#alpinejs"></a></h3>
<p>I consider alpinejs the perfect bridge between repeatedly writing code to CRUD (create, read, update, delete) DOM elements/listen for events (like above), and reaching for a full-fledged library like react. With vanilla js, these operations are as fast as they will ever get, but it also gets very redundant calling <code>document.getElementById</code>. Many <del>lazy</del> good developers will get sick of doing this, create helper functions and classes to reduce the repetition, and by the time they’re done, they would have created the ten-thousandth javascript UI library - or they might accidentally recreate alpineJS.
<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine">AlpineJS</a> is a “script” in the strict meaning in html. It’s bundle comes in at 4Kb, and provides exactly 14 directives for working with the dom (plus 6 properties that I think are more for edge cases). Yes, the entire API is just 14 basic concepts to learn. It literally takes reading a readme file to learn all of alpinejs. I doubt there are a lot more frameworks that can boast such simplicity. And using alpinejs only requires adding a script tag in an html file, and…that’s it. Directives are used by adding them to the respective element, these are native dom elements, not JSX or some other syntax magic. Example:</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>h1</span> <span>x-show</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>false<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>I will be hidden<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>x-show</code> to toggle the visibility of an element, like above. <code>x-data</code> directive that creates a scope (essentially, a state) for an html element. <code>x-model</code> to 2-way bind an input element to a variable - this takes multiple lines in react, as you need to declare state, bind the value of an input (one-way) to the state, and then set up an event listener to update the state when the input changes. That gets tedious, but it needs to be done — always.
<code>x-for</code> for loops… and others in the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine#learn">docs</a>.
These directives are similar to how vue works as well. With the added benefit of not requiring any build step, and being a much smaller bundle and API.<sup><a href="https://www.dshomoye.dev/you-may-not-need-react/#notes">1</a></sup>
For adding new elements, alpine cleverly uses <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template"><code>&lt;template&gt;</code></a> elements which is <em>meant</em> to be used precisely as fragments to be referenced in scripts - essentially a simpler model for what a <strong>component</strong> is in react. I really like that alpineJs embraces and properly utilizes native DOM apis this way.</p>
<p>Here’s the same counter but with alpinejs:</p>
<h4 id="alpine-js-example">Alpine JS Example<a href="https://www.dshomoye.dev/you-may-not-need-react/#alpine-js-example"></a></h4>
<p>This is a working example of a stateful component (click counter). This, just like the vanilla example, can be served as an html file, as-is - and it will work in a browser.</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>html</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>head</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span>

  <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>head</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>x-data</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>clicks()<span>"</span></span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>click-counter<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>

    <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

      <span>}</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
  </span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>html</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="svelte">Svelte<a href="https://www.dshomoye.dev/you-may-not-need-react/#svelte"></a></h3>
<p>Another qualm I have is with react’s the virtual dom (the existence of it). It’s part of why every react app has to ship a minimum of 40kb+ of js bundle (react + react-dom) to work with react; that and its pretty extensive API. This isn’t earth-shatteringly large but it’s also not zero. And <em>not</em> using react will definitely bring that size down by a lot. Shipping very small bundle size is just great, with no downsides…? This is one of the reasons I really like <a href="https://www.dshomoye.dev/trying-rust-lang">Rust</a> - you don’t pay for what you don’t use.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://svelte.dev/docs">Svelte</a> is akin to Rust in this sense. It <em>has no</em> runtime. All of svelte magic is done during compilation. The script that’s generated is all <em>your</em> logic with svelte helper functions added around it. Unlike vanilla and alpine however, I find svelte to be a much steeper climb when it comes to learning. I built a basic <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/dshomoye/image-my-contact">contact image generator</a> with svelte to learn it and that was definitely not as simple as working alpinejs (an admittedly very high bar). So yes, svelte is probably as complex as react, to learn, but actually functions much simpler than react.</p>
<p>For example, to create a stateful component in svelte looks like:</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>
	count <span>=</span> <span>0</span> 
	<span>export</span> name <span>=</span> <span>""</span><span>;</span> 
	<span>const</span> <span>increment</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> count <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
	<span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>My name is {name}<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
	<span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>count: {count} <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span><span>on:</span>click</span><span><span>=</span>{increment}</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Add 1<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Updating state is just a reassignment of that variable. I think this is more natural than in react. Although, I still prefer the functional/no mutation approach in react, since it reduces chances of unintentional state updates and the bugs that come with that.</p>
<p>And for a component property (values passed from a parent), its just a variable export. The reason I like Svelte, is because, it’s <em>more succinct</em> than react - you write less code to achieve essentially the same functionality. And less, well, less is more (always). Of course, the fact that Svelte is compile-time instead of a run time library is just icing on top. I would still recommend even it <em>if</em> it had a run time like react <sup><a href="https://www.dshomoye.dev/you-may-not-need-react/#notes">2</a></sup>. Just because it presents this more approachable API.</p>
<p>So yes, you <em>may</em> not need React. There’s a certain level of, <em>bliss</em> I’ll call it, when using something like alpinejs - where your html and script <strong>is</strong> your application - no more, no less. It goes to show that web development can be uncomplicated. I think the ecosystem would be a little better, if us developers focus more on Keeping It Simple.</p>
<h5 id="notes">Notes:<a href="https://www.dshomoye.dev/you-may-not-need-react/#notes"></a></h5>
<ol>
<li>Vue can technically be used as a script tag - but that’s not really how it’s expected to be used, and so most of its API is designed around a project structured with a bundler.</li>
<li>It could be debatable want “counts” as a run time. But svelte has no minimum bundle size like react does - your bundle size grows linearly with your code. I think that’s a good place to draw the line.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="issue">
  <p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l1WYFHoNxsPt3z45j8/giphy.gif"></p><p><strong>Product Managers are&nbsp;Detectives</strong></p>

<p>Last year, I wrote an article about the <a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/product-management-skills">top skills you need to succeed as a Product Manager</a>. It covers the usual suspects: requirements gathering, sprint planning, communication, etc. and I stand by&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>But I left something out, something that will make you <em>indispensable</em>: detective&nbsp;skills.</p>

<p><strong>Walking the (bug)&nbsp;beat</strong></p>

<p>As part of my team’s triage process, Product Managers review incoming bugs and support issues, before assigning them to Engineering. I like this, because a lot of issues can be addressed with an <span>API</span> call, a link to the documentation, or a kind, but firm&nbsp;no.</p>

<p>When I can’t defer, close, or ignore an issue, I investigate it, with a goal of identifying the root cause and potential solutions. Once I can reliably replicate and document the problem, I can give Engineering the full story they need to fix&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>If you hand off an issue too early, before you understand the underlying issue, you’ll waste developer time and derail your whole sprint&nbsp;schedule.</p>

<p><strong>Tools of the&nbsp;trade</strong></p>

<p>The first thing I like to do is identify the frequency of the problem, severity, and systems involved. This helps me prioritize my workload and figure out where to start&nbsp;looking.</p>

<p>Like any good investigator you’ll need to collect and analyze the evidence. Clear, concise documentation will help newcomers onboard to the problem quickly, and prevent you from having to explain everything from&nbsp;scratch:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maintain test credentials and dummy email accounts for various user states and&nbsp;configurations.</li>
  <li>Replicate bugs using test accounts and isolated Chrome profiles or Firefox&nbsp;Containers.</li>
  <li>Record videos or markup screenshots to illustrate expected vs. actual behavior. Android and i<span>OS</span> offer these features natively, and Mac<span>OS</span> has a really nice extended screenshot + recording menu that you can markup with the Preview&nbsp;app.</li>
  <li>Meticulously document expected behavior (requirements), actual behavior (the bug), and other minor details like platform, mobile app version, exact <span>UX</span> flow,&nbsp;etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have a technical background, you can go a step further by digging into the logs, code, and&nbsp;data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Validate <span>API</span> calls and responses using c<span>URL</span> or Postman. A very smart engineer once told me, <em>“if you’re having the same problem on two different platforms, it’s probably a backend&nbsp;issue.”</em></li>
  <li>Navigate <span>JSON</span> <span>&amp;</span> XMLs objects – most APIs will return data in one of these formats. A decent text editor will come in&nbsp;handy.</li>
  <li>Write <span>SQL</span> queries, export data, and analyze it. Brush up on your selects, joins, and group by clauses – the data you want is rarely in the format you&nbsp;want.</li>
  <li>Query and filter application logs to identify customer-specific actions, errors, and&nbsp;patterns.</li>
  <li>Debug web apps using your browser’s Developer Tools (network traffic, JavaScript console) or <a href="https://www.charlesproxy.com/">CharlesProxy</a> for mobile&nbsp;apps.</li>
  <li>Look for references to specific error strings and codes in your code or environment&nbsp;configuration.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hitting the&nbsp;Bricks</strong></p>

<p>Product Management isn’t a job you can do with your head down and earphones cranked up. You have to get out there and talk to&nbsp;people.</p>

<p>Detectives build relationships with <em>informants</em>, who can guide them in areas where they lack experience or exposure. I urge you to do the same, especially within big organizations. The clue that blows the case wide open may come from another <span>PM</span>, an Engineer across the globe, your Operations team, vendors, or quite frequently, a&nbsp;customer.</p>

<p>True story: I spent half of last week trying to validate a new feature which relied on some APIs maintained by different teams. Despite hours of searching for and reading documentation, I made zero progress on my own. Finally, I called another <span>PM</span> for&nbsp;help.</p>

<p>I spent <em>five minutes</em> explaining my situation, before she sprung into action. She set up a Slack channel, tagged representatives from each team, and said <em>“Neal needs a hand with X, Y, and Z.”</em> Two days later, my features were live in&nbsp;prod!</p>

<p><strong>Stay&nbsp;curious</strong></p>

<p>In the real world, detective work is fairly mundane: interviewing witnesses, pulling financial records, requesting warrants. High profile heists and car chases are pretty rare. But at every step, detectives ask why. They look for inconsistencies, and question&nbsp;motives.</p>

<p>The same goes for Product Management. Day in and day out, you’re doing discovery, setting priorities, grooming tickets, and putting out small fires. But, no matter how ordinary a task seems, you should take a deeper&nbsp;look.</p>

<p>When you investigate, ask open ended questions to uncover the problem the customer is facing, what they were trying to do, and what actions led them there. Try using the <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Five_whys">Five Whys</a> method and remember, your job isn’t to fix problems in real time, it’s to <em>detect</em> what’s going&nbsp;on.</p>

<p>This applies to product requests too. When Marketing says <em>“can you please build us this very specific feature that does X?”</em> Your first instinct shouldn’t be to give them a yes or no&nbsp;answer.</p>

<p>In my experience, people are better at articulating symptoms and solutions, than they are at <em>causes and needs</em>. But if you get someone to open up and explain what they’re really after, then you can identify what to&nbsp;build.</p>

<p><strong>Call for&nbsp;backup</strong></p>

<p>Whenever my investigation hits a wall, I recruit a partner. With a fresh set of eyes, we can apply a different perspective, bounce ideas off each other, and hopefully make a&nbsp;breakthrough.</p>

<p>I’m a damn good partner too, because I’ll do whatever I can to make my partner’s life easier. That includes scheduling meetings, writing tickets, documenting everything in Confluence, or taking the heat when we’re behind. It’s my approach to building trust: ask for their best, and never give ‘em your&nbsp;worst.</p>

<p>Of course, everyone has their own priorities, so you may have to flex in order to motivate them. Whether that’s calling in a favor or highlighting the customer impact, (frequency! severity! <span>NPS</span>!), it’s part of their job, so don’t feel too bad. But do remember to pay the favor back, or ideally,&nbsp;forward.</p>

<p><strong>Hard, but not <em>hard-boiled</em></strong></p>

<p>It’s frustrating to work products where you’re pulled in different directions every day because of a new bug or some priority request. It’s even worse when you’re under pressure to get it all done&nbsp;yesterday.</p>

<p>In the movies, detectives are often sour mavericks with little regard for their own health and other people’s feelings. But that won’t fly in real life. No matter how frazzled you are, there’s no excuse to be a jerk. If you’re feeling burnt out, take a break and get&nbsp;help.</p>

<p>A story has been making the rounds today about a criminal in Germany that held over $60 million in Bitcoin before being arrested. Incredibly, the media still doesn’t understand what it means to “own” Bitcoin, claiming that the government “confiscated” the funds but “can’t unlock” them…</p>



<p>It’s a fundamental misunderstanding of Bitcoin’s underlying technology. Unlike other currencies (like cash or gold), one does not own Bitcoin simply by holding something in their material possession (in this case, a computer or a wallet). Instead, one owns Bitcoin when one has access to the Bitcoin by way of a private key.</p>



<p>So no, German prosecutors have in fact <em>not</em> “confiscated more than $60 million worth of Bitcoin.” Instead, they’ve confiscated a worthless piece of hardware.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The misunderstanding stems from the fact that Bitcoin is “stored” on a the public blockchain (a digital ledger that keeps track of all transactions), <em>not</em> on a personal hard drive or cryptocurrency wallet. Those devices were used to access the Bitcoin by the fraudster in this case, but the “password” that the media speaks of —&nbsp;which the prosecutors can’t access —&nbsp;is really <em>the Bitcoin itself</em>. It’s the private key associated with this criminal’s coins.</p>



<p>In this case, the criminal’s Bitcoin are <em>literally </em>stored in the criminal’s mind, and they refuse to give them up. As long as this fraudster is still alive and has functioning memory, their bitcoin will remain securely in their possession. </p>



<p>Obviously this has ramifications for a governments’ ability to properly punish criminal activity, but it’s also a radical new idea in money that provides security and true ownership to legal citizens. Just like this criminal can retain ownership of his Bitcoin despite being jailed for life, a person living under an oppressive regime can retain ownership of their Bitcoin in their mind no matter how much their government wishes to unfairly confiscate it.</p>



<p>It’s critical to understand the ramifications of this, and for that reason, it’s critical that the media understands what it means to own Bitcoin. Never in human history has money been truly trustless digital information, which clearly benefits criminals that would prefer not to part with their stash, but it also benefits law-abiding citizens who wish to truly own their wealth. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-3c75a6d7=""><h2 id="1---reducing-customer-churn-is-the-best-way-to-boost-growth" data-v-3c75a6d7="">1 &nbsp; Reducing customer churn is the best way to boost growth</h2>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">The very unfortunate truth about customer churn is that it scales with your business. <strong data-v-3c75a6d7="">Meaning, the more your business grows, the more customers you'll have cancelling every month</strong>. In order to keep pace with your expanding churn numbers, you'll either need to find magical exponential growth, reduce your churn, or risk hitting an early growth ceiling.</p>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">Let's say, for example, our software-as-a-service (SaaS) product has an average monthly revenue of $50/customer. When we first start up, we're adding 100 customers a month, growing our MRR by $5,000 each month. In the second month, 7 of those customers cancel their subscriptions (a 7% churn rate - the industry average for B2C SaaS companies). Not a big deal - we're still netting 93 new customers! In the following month, another 7% churn - 13 of our 193 customers entering the month. But, we've added another 100 new customers, still netting 87 new subscriptions and a healthy $4,350 uptick in MRR. </p>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">So we continue on our merry way adding to our top line revenue each month. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, churn rears its ugly head. Midway through our second year, we've reached 1400 customers, and guess what? Thanks to our 7% churn rate, we're only breaking even with the 100 new customers that sign up each month. Our customer base (and revenue) is no longer growing. We have officially hit our growth ceiling - 1,400 customers and $71,000 MRR.</p>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">Unfortunately, this is far from a hypothetical example for me. Churn became a very real problem very quickly for Wavve.co. <strong data-v-3c75a6d7="">Luckily for all of us, a small reduction in churn can yield a massive boost in the growth ceiling</strong>. To continue with the numbers above, let's cut the churn rate from 7% to 5%. With this reduction, the growth ceiling suddenly jumps up from $71,000 MRR to $100,000 MRR - an increase of more than 40% and $350K ARR. </p>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">Below, you can play around with how a 30% reduction in churn rate can impact future growth.</p>
<div data-v-3c75a6d7=""><div> <div><div><p>
          $301,500
        </p> <p>
          more revenue over 24 months
           with a 30% churn reduction.
        </p> <div>  <div> <p>
              MRR growth in 24 months with
               a 30% churn reduction:
              $25,950
            </p></div> <div> <p>
              MRR growth in 24 months  at previous pace:
              $5,302
            </p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">I would argue that reducing customer churn is the single best thing that most SaaS companies can be doing right now. As fun as growth is, keeping the customers you do have is far cheaper than acquiring new ones. With this in mind, let's take an in depth look at what can be done to reduce churn. First, we're going to be diving into churn prediction, where companies try to figure out which customers are going to cancel their subscriptions, and try to do something about it before that happens. This is often one of the first steps that a company will take once they realize their churn rate is becoming the limiting factor with their future growth.</p>
<h2 id="2---how-churn-prediction-works-in-practice" data-v-3c75a6d7="">2 &nbsp; How churn prediction works in practice</h2>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">At its core, churn prediction attempts to put customers into two buckets:</p>
<ol data-v-3c75a6d7="">
<li data-v-3c75a6d7="">Customers who will churn</li>
<li data-v-3c75a6d7="">Customers who will not churn.</li>
</ol>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">Simple enough, right?</p>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">As far as the data science is concerend, churn prediction can be treated as a standard classification problem. We can look at a user’s behavior – how long they’ve been a customer, when they were last active, how much they’ve been paying per month, whether they’ve used your new feature, etc. – and train a machine learning model to predict how likely that user is to cancel their subscription in the next month.</p>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">There are a variety of machine learning models that can predict churn reasonably well. In practice, decision trees and logistic regression tend to be commonly used. I full-heartedly predict that we will see a shift towards recurrent neural net (RNN) models in the near future, as they provide a much more natural model for this problem - and I’ll be writing on that soon, but for now, let’s put aside which ML model is used, and turn our focus to how they are used.</p>
<h3 id="21-what-is-done-with-churn-predictions" data-v-3c75a6d7="">2.1 What is done with churn predictions</h3>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">Once we’ve trained a model to predict how likely a customer is to churn in the next month - how can we use that information to improve our bottom line? In particular, how can we use it to prevent cancellations? Below, I've plotted a hypothetical distribution of our customers and their likelihood to churn in the next month following what a typical distribution may look like for a SaaS company. You'll note that I've also marked a cutoff at 80%, highlighting the customers that our model predicted had at least an 80% probability to churn in the coming month.</p>
<p><img alt="Likelihood of churn histogram" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ed7ff531a516bff2e6e614dc56d153f3ca017503/09dd7/img/likelihood-of-churning-wide-alt.png" data-v-3c75a6d7=""></p><p data-v-3c75a6d7="">In developing our churn prediction model, the general idea is that <strong data-v-3c75a6d7="">we pick out the customers that are deemed “likely to churn” and hit them with a retention campaign</strong>, hoping to reinvigorate their love of the product, and, with a bit of luck on our side, prevent them from cancelling their subscription.</p>
<h3 id="22-the-retention-campaign" data-v-3c75a6d7="">2.2 The retention campaign</h3>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">A good retention campaign is product specific, but in general they tend to follow a lot of the same patterns. The objectives here are to (i) re-engage customers so they get more value out of your product and/or (ii) present a customer offer to get them to stick around. Common retention tactics can include:</p>
<ol data-v-3c75a6d7="">
<li data-v-3c75a6d7="">An email newsletter to bring your product to the front of customer’s minds<ol data-v-3c75a6d7="">
<li data-v-3c75a6d7="">A new product feature announcement</li>
<li data-v-3c75a6d7="">Showcase how other customers are using your product</li>
</ol></li>
<li data-v-3c75a6d7="">Initiating “customer success” calls, or sending direct emails to customers you want to re-engage</li>
<li data-v-3c75a6d7="">Reminding users to use the credits left in their account (ex. Audible)</li>
<li data-v-3c75a6d7="">Offer a one-time discount for users (ex. Uber)</li>
<li data-v-3c75a6d7="">Offer to put a customer’s subscription on pause (ex. Audible)</li>
<li data-v-3c75a6d7="">Offer to switch (downgrade) a customer’s plan</li>
</ol>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">Depending on your product, these campaigns should see varying (but typically pretty strong) engagement rates. At Wavve.co, we’ve had nearly 35% of customers accept an offer to temporarily pause their account.</p>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">So, we’re getting after the right customers using our churn prediction model, and the retention campaigns are sufficiently engaging – all is well, right?</p>
<h2 id="3---where-churn-prediction-goes-wrong" data-v-3c75a6d7="">3 &nbsp; Where churn prediction goes wrong</h2>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">Let’s briefly back up and refocus on what our end goal is. We set out to reduce churn. In an attempt to do this, we designed a machine learning model which sifted through customer data and found the customers who were most likely to cancel their accounts. We then targeted these high risk customers with retention campaigns, hoping to prevent them from churning.</p>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">Unfortunately, it isn’t so simple. In this section, I’ll dig into what can go wrong with this pattern of churn prediction and customer re-engagement, including disturbing the “do-not-disturb” customers, sending discounts to people who wouldn’t have churned anyway, and the self-biasing nature of churn prediction once we start using its predictions to decide who to target with retention campaigns.</p>
<h3 id="31-churn-prevention-≠-churn-minimization" data-v-3c75a6d7="">3.1 Churn prevention ≠ churn minimization</h3>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">When we marked a customer to be targeted with a retention campaign, we took action. We reached out to these people ― to ask if they wanted to check out our new feature, or if they wanted more credits or a discount, etc. And some of these customers, who would have otherwise cancelled their subscription, decided to stick around. Great! But, at the same time, <strong data-v-3c75a6d7="">by knocking on these user's doors, we’ve also prompted some customers, who would not have otherwise churned, to cancel their subscriptions</strong>. Just a few weeks ago, Audible sent me a reminder that I had 2 credits to use. As luck would have it, that was just the reminder I needed to cancel my subscription! Clearly, this is exactly the opposite result Audible had hoped for with their churn prevention campaign.</p>
<h4 id="311-four-customers" data-v-3c75a6d7="">3.1.1 Four customers</h4>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">To make things concrete, let’s categorize our customers into four groups based on their churn behavior with and without us taking action on them by using a retention campaign. We’ll get into the details of using different retention campaigns later, but for now let’s look at simply either "targeted" and "not targeted" to represent customers who were treated with a retention campaign or not, respectively.</p>
<p><img alt="The 4 customer types" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e46516789adfbf402a4c2301140ea190e38032ae/13971/img/4-customers.png" data-v-3c75a6d7=""></p><p data-v-3c75a6d7="">Breaking these down:</p>
<ol data-v-3c75a6d7="">
<li data-v-3c75a6d7=""><strong data-v-3c75a6d7="">Do-not-disturbs.</strong> Customers who won’t churn <em data-v-3c75a6d7="">unless</em> we use a retention campaign. This is me cancelling my Audible subscription when they told me I had credits to use. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have thought about it and would have stayed a subscriber.</li>
<li data-v-3c75a6d7=""><strong data-v-3c75a6d7="">Sure things.</strong> These are your adamant subscribers – the customers who will be with you next month whether or not we use a retention campaign on them. Love this group.</li>
<li data-v-3c75a6d7=""><strong data-v-3c75a6d7="">Lost causes.</strong> This is just the opposite. The customers in this group are going to cancel their subscription no matter what we do.</li>
<li data-v-3c75a6d7=""><strong data-v-3c75a6d7="">Persuadables.</strong> This is the group we want to go after with retention campaigns. These customers are going to churn if we don’t do anything but will stick around if we use a retention campaign on them.</li>
</ol>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">In an ideal world, our churn prevention techniques would strictly target the fourth group, the persuadables. In reality, our predictive models are far from perfect and, regrettably, <strong data-v-3c75a6d7="">we are actually losing profits every time we target a customer who belongs to any of the other three groups</strong>:</p>
<ol data-v-3c75a6d7="">
<li data-v-3c75a6d7=""><strong data-v-3c75a6d7="">Do not disturbs.</strong> Worst case scenario – by intervening, we lose customers who would otherwise would have continued as subscribers.</li>
<li data-v-3c75a6d7=""><strong data-v-3c75a6d7="">Sure things.</strong> When we allocate retention campaigns to this group, we are lowering profits by giving credits, discounts, and other costly perks to customers who would have kept paying us at full cost.</li>
<li data-v-3c75a6d7=""><strong data-v-3c75a6d7="">Lost causes.</strong> For these customers, we are losing the cost of running the retention campaign. This can vary largely between companies. If we’re just sending an email, then not much lost. If we’re a B2B SaaS company doing manual outreach and customer calls, this can get quite costly.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="32-churn-prediction-is-self-biasing" data-v-3c75a6d7="">3.2 Churn prediction is self-biasing</h3>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">Ok, so we’ve seen how important it is to nail down specifically the segment of customers who are planning to churn unless we do something …</p></div></div>

An application that is not prepared for this will start showing strange behavior. Especially under heavy load, because that is when the risk for multiple deliveries is higher. This is because high load means there is less time to do housekeeping for the queuing service.

      <p>
	Part of the origin myth of modern computing is the story of a
	golden age in the 1960s and 1970s. In this story, visionary
	pioneers pursued a dream in which computers enabled powerful
	tools for thought, that is, tools to augment human
	intelligence<span> E.g., Douglas
	Engelbart, <a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/Engelbart1962.pdf">Augmenting Human
	Intellect: A Conceptual Framework</a> (1962).</span>. One of
	those pioneers, Alan Kay, summed up the optimism of this dream
	when he wrote of the potential of the personal computer:
	“the very use of it would actually change the thought
	patterns of an entire
	civilization”<span> Alan
	Kay, <a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/Kay1989.pdf">User Interface: A Personal
	View</a> (1989).</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
	It's an inspiring dream, which helped lead to modern
	interactive graphics, windowing interfaces, word processors,
	and much else. But retrospectively it's difficult not to be
	disappointed, to feel that computers have not yet been nearly
	as transformative as far older tools for thought, such as
	language and writing. Today, it's common in technology circles
	to pay lip service to the pioneering dreams of the past. But
	nostalgia aside there is little determined effort to pursue
	the vision of transformative new tools for thought.
      </p>

      <p>
	We believe now is a good time to work hard on this vision
	again. In this essay we sketch out a set of ideas we believe
	can be used to help develop transformative new tools for
	thought. In the first part of the essay we describe an
	experimental prototype system that we've built, a kind
	of <em>mnemonic medium</em> intended to augment human memory.
	This is a snapshot of an ongoing project, detailing both
	encouraging progress as well as many challenges and
	opportunities.  In the second part of the essay, we broaden
	the focus. We sketch several other prototype systems. And we
	address the question: why is it that the technology industry
	has made comparatively little effort developing this vision of
	transformative tools for thought?
      </p>

      <p>
	In the opening we mentioned some visionaries of the past. To
	those could be added many others – Ivan Sutherland,
	Seymour Papert, Vannevar Bush, and more. Online there is much
	well-deserved veneration for these people. But such veneration
	can veer into an unhealthy reverence for the good old days, a
	belief that giants once roamed the earth, and today's work is
	lesser. Yes, those pioneers did amazing things, and arguably
	had ways of working that modern technologists, in both
	industry and academia, are poorly equipped to carry on. But
	they also made mistakes, and were ignorant of powerful ideas
	that are available today. And so a theme through both parts of
	the essay is to identify powerful ideas that weren't formerly
	known or weren't acted upon. Out of this understanding arises
	a conviction that a remarkable set of opportunities is open
	today.
      </p>

      <p>
	A word on nomenclature: the term “tools for
	thought” rolls off neither the tongue nor the
	keyboard. What's more, the term “tool” implies a
	certain narrowness. Alan Kay has
	argued<span> Again, in Alan
	Kay, <a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/Kay1989.pdf">User Interface: A Personal
	View</a> (1989), among other places.</span> that a more
	powerful aim is to develop a new <em>medium for
	thought</em>. A medium such as, say,
	Adobe <em>Illustrator</em> is essentially different from any
	of the individual tools <em>Illustrator</em> contains. Such a
	medium creates a powerful immersive context, a context in
	which the user can have new kinds of thought, thoughts that
	were formerly impossible for them. Speaking loosely, the range
	of expressive thoughts possible in such a medium is an
	emergent property of the elementary objects and actions in
	that medium. If those are well chosen, the medium expands the
	possible range of human thought.
      </p>

      <p>
	With that said, the term “tools for thought” has
	been widely used since Iverson's 1950s and 1960s
	work<span> An account may be found in
	Iverson's Turing Award
	lecture, <a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/Iverson1979.pdf">Notation as a Tool
	of Thought</a> (1979). Incidentally, even Iverson is really
	describing a medium for thought, the APL programming language,
	not a narrow tool.</span> introducing the term. And so we
	shall use “tools for thought” as our catch all
	phrase, while giving ourselves license to explore a broader
	range, and also occasionally preferring the term
	“medium” when it is apt.
      </p>

      <p>
	Let's come back to that phrase from the opening, about
	changing “the thought patterns of an entire
	civilization”. It sounds ludicrous, a kind of tech
	soothsaying. Except, of course, such changes have happened
	multiple times during human history: the development of
	language, of writing, and our other most powerful tools for
	thought. And, for better and worse, computers really have
	affected the thought patterns of our civilization over the
	past 60 years, and those changes seem like just the
	beginning. This essay is a small contribution to understanding
	how such changes happen, and what is still possible.
      </p>

      <p>
	The musician and comedian Martin Mull has observed that
	“writing about music is like dancing about
	architecture”. In a similar way, there's an inherent
	inadequacy in writing about tools for thought. To the extent
	that such a tool succeeds, it expands your thinking beyond
	what can be achieved using existing tools, including
	writing. The more transformative the tool, the larger the gap
	that is opened.  Conversely, the larger the gap, the more
	difficult the new tool is to evoke in writing. But what
	writing can do, and the reason we wrote this essay, is act as
	a bootstrap. It's a way of identifying points of leverage that
	may help develop new tools for thought. So let's get on with
	it.
      </p>


      

      <h2 id="introducing-mnemonic-medium">Introducing the mnemonic medium</h2>
      
      <p>
	Few subjects are more widely regarded as difficult than
	quantum computing and quantum mechanics. Indeed, popular media
	accounts often regale (and intimidate) readers with quotes
	from famous physicists in the vein of: “anyone who
	thinks they’ve understood quantum mechanics has not understood
	quantum mechanics”.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	What makes these subjects difficult? In fact, individually
	many of the underlying ideas are not too complicated for
	people with a technical background. But the ideas come in an
	overwhelming number, a tsunami of unfamiliar concepts and
	notation. People must learn in rapid succession of qubits, the
	bra-ket notation, Hadamard gates, controlled-not gates, and
	many, many other abstract, unfamiliar notions. They're
	imbibing an entire new language. Even if they can follow at
	first, understanding later ideas requires fluency with all the
	earlier ideas. It's overwhelming and eventually disheartening.
      </p>

      <p>
	As an experiment, we have developed a
	website, <a href="https://quantum.country/"><em>Quantum
	Country</em></a>, which explores a new approach to explaining
	quantum computing and quantum
	mechanics. Ostensibly, <em>Quantum Country</em> appears to be
	a conventional essay introduction to these subjects. There is
	text, explanations, and equations, much as in any other
	technical essay. Here's an excerpt:
      </p>
			
      <p><img src="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/quantum_country_sample-2x.png" srcset="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/quantum_country_sample.png, https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/quantum_country_sample-2x.png 2x" alt="Screenshot depicting prose and math in Quantum Country, typical of a technical essay."></p><p>
	But it's not a conventional essay. Rather, <em>Quantum
	Country</em> is a prototype for a new type of <em>mnemonic
	medium</em>. Aspirationally, the mnemonic medium makes it
	almost effortless for users to remember what they read. That
	may sound like an impossible aspiration. What makes it
	plausible is that cognitive scientists know a considerable
	amount about how human beings store long-term
	memories. Indeed, what they know can almost be distilled to an
	actionable recipe: follow these steps, and you can remember
	whatever you choose.
      </p>

      <p>
	Unfortunately, those steps are poorly supported by existing
	media.<span>For more on this argument, see
	Andy Matuschak, <a href="https://andymatuschak.org/books/">Why
	books don’t work</a> (2019).</span> Is it possible to
	design a new medium which much more actively supports
	memorization? That is, the medium would build in (and, ideally,
	make almost effortless) the key steps involved in memory. If we
	could do this, then instead of memory being a haphazard event,
	subject to chance, the mnemonic medium would make memory into a
	choice. Of course, on its own this wouldn't make it trivial to
	learn subjects such as quantum mechanics and quantum computing
	– learning those subjects is about much more than memory.
	But it would help in addressing one core difficulty: the
	overwhelming number of new concepts and notation.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	In fact, there are many ways of redesigning the essay medium
	to do that. Before showing you our prototype, please pause for
	a moment and consider the following questions: how could you
	build a medium to better support a person's memory of what
	they read?  What interactions could easily and enjoyably help
	people consolidate memories? And, more broadly: is it possible
	to 2x what people remember? 10x? And would that make any
	long-term difference to their effectiveness?
      </p>

      <p>
	Let's sketch the user experience of <em>Quantum
	Country</em>. At the time of this writing the site contains
	three mnemonic essays (i.e., particular instances of the
	mnemonic medium). We'll focus on the introductory essay,
	<a href="https://quantum.country/qcvc">“Quantum
	  Computing for the Very Curious”</a>. Embedded within
	  the text of the essay are 112 questions about that
	  text. Users are asked to create an account, and quizzed as
	  they read on whether they remember the answers to those
	  questions. Here's what the interaction looks like, as a user
	  answers three questions.
      </p>

			<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">
				<source src="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/qc_interaction.mp4" type="video/mp4">
				<source src="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/qc_interaction.webm" type="video/webm">
				<source src="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/qc_interaction.ogv" type="video/ogg">
			</video>

      <p>
	Note that this interaction occurs within the text of the essay
	itself. Here's a zoomed-out view, so you can see how such
	questions are surrounded by essay text both above and below:
      </p>

	<p><img src="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/qc_zoom_out-2x.png" srcset="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/qc_zoom_out.png, https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/qc_zoom_out-2x.png 2x" alt="Screenshot depicting the interactive quiz interleaved in a few paragraphs of prose."></p><p>
	We use the term <em>cards</em> for these interface elements
	pairing questions and answers.
      </p>

      <p>
	Of course, for long-term memory it's not enough for users to
	be tested just once on their recall. Instead, a few days after
	first reading the essay, the user receives an email asking
	them to sign into a review session. In that review session
	they're …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>A few years ago, when the IETF’s Crypto Forum Research Group was deeply entrenched in debates about elliptic curves for security (which eventually culminated in RFC 7748 and RFC 8032), an IT Consultant <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/VXLC6cj2KwecsWRhp0yJXLF9jEw/">showed up on the mailing list</a> with their homemade cipher, Crystalline.</p>



<p>Mike Hamburg <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/4c-nx0N9YGh6Qb3SBmM-B6ICaA8/">politely</a> informed the consultant that the CFRG isn’t the right forum for proposing new symmetric ciphers, or even new modes for symmetric ciphers, and invited them to email them off-list.</p>



<p>If you’re not familiar with the CFRG, let me just say, this was on the more patient and measured responses I’ve ever read.</p>



<p>Naturally, the author of Crystalline responded with this:</p>



<blockquote><p>I’m somewhat disappointed in your reply, as I presumed that someone with a stated interest in ciphers would be eager to investigate anything new to pop up that didn’t have obvious holes in it.

<p>The discussion continued until Tony Arcieri dropped <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/e-jEGddvSbManBMppC8XAc5i8GY/">one of the most brutal takedowns</a> of a cryptographic design in CFRG history.</p>



<blockquote><p>I think the biggest problem though is all of this has already been pointed out to you repeatedly in other forums and you completely refuse to acknowledge that your cipher fails to meet the absolute most minimum criteria for a secure cipher.</p><cite>Tony Arcieri, landing a cryptographic 360 no-scope on Crystalline.</cite></blockquote>



<p>In spite of this mic drop moment, the author of Crystalline continued to double down and insist that a symmetric cipher doesn’t need to be indistinguishable from randomness to be secure (which, to severely understate the affairs, is simply not true).</p>



<p>Normally, when a cipher fails at the indistinguishable test, it’s subtle. This is what Crystalline ciphertexts look like.</p>

<p>Modern ciphers produce something that will look like white noise, like an old TV without the cable plugged in. There should be no discernible pattern.</p>



<p>Crystalline’s author remained convinced that Crystalline’s “131072-bit keys” and claims of “information-theoretic security” were compelling enough to warrant consideration by the standards body that keeps the Internet running.</p>



<p>This was in 2015. In the year 2021, I can safely say that Crystalline adoption never really took off.</p>



<h2>Against Crackpot Crypto</h2>



<p>Instances of Crackpot Cryptography don’t always look like Crystalline. Sometimes the authors are more charismatic, or have more financial resources to bedazzle would-be <s>suckers</s>^<sup>investors</sup>. Other times, they’re less brazen and keep their designs far away from the watchful gaze of expert opinions–lest their mistakes be exposed for all to see.</p>



<p>Crackpot cryptography is considered dangerous–not because we want people to avoid encryption entirely, but because crackpot cryptography offers a false sense of security. This leads to users acting in ways they wouldn’t if they knew there was little-to-no security. Due to the strictly performative nature of these security measures, I also like to call them <strong>Security Theater</strong> (although that term is more broadly applicable in other contexts).</p>



<p>The Cryptology community has a few defense mechanisms in place to prevent the real-world adoption of crackpot cryptography. More specifically, we have pithy mottos that distill best practices in a way that usually gets the intent across. (Hey, it’s something!) Unfortunately, the rest of the security industry outside of cryptology often weaponizes these mottos to promote useless and harmful gatekeeping.</p>



<p>The best example of this is the, “Don’t roll your own crypto!” motto.</p>



<h3 id="roll-your-own">They See Me Rollin’ [My Own Crypto]</h3>



<p>Crackpots never adhere to this rule, so anyone who violates it immediately or often, with wild abandon, can be safely dismissed for kooky behavior.</p>



<p>But if taken to its literal, logical extreme, this rule mandates that nobody would ever write cryptographic code and we wouldn’t <em>have</em> cryptography libraries to begin with. So, clearly, it’s a rule meant to be sometimes broken.</p>



<p>This is why some cryptography engineers <a href="https://www.cryptofails.com/post/75204435608/write-crypto-code-dont-publish-it">soften the message a bit</a> and encourage tinkering for the sake of education. The world needs more software engineers qualified to write cryptography.</p>



<p>After all, you wouldn’t expect to hear “Don’t roll your own crypto” being levied against Jason Donenfeld (WireGuard) or Frank Denis (libsodium), despite the fact that both of those people did just that.</p>



<p>But what about <a href="https://dholecrypto.com/">a high-level library that defers to libsodium for its actual crypto implementations</a>?</p>







<p>In a twist that surprises no one, lazy heuristics have a high false positive rate. In this case, the lazy heuristic is both, “What qualifies as rolling one’s own crypto?” as well as, “When is it safe to break this rule?”</p>



<p>More broadly, though, is that these knee-jerk responses are a misfiring defense mechanism intended to stop quacks from taking all the air out of the room.</p>



<p>It doesn’t always work, though. There have been a few downright absurd instances of crackpot cryptography in the past few years.</p>



<h2>Modern Examples of Crypto Crackpottery</h2>



<h3 id="craig-wright">Craig Wright’s Sartre Signature Scam</h3>



<p>Satoshi Nakamoto is the alias of the anonymous cryptographer that invented Bitcoin. In the years since Satoshi has gone quiet, a few cranks have come out of the woodwork to claim to be the real Satoshi.</p>



<p>Craig Wright is one of the more famous Satoshi impersonators due to his <a href="https://dankaminsky.com/2016/05/02/validating-satoshi-or-not/">Sartre Signature Scam</a>.</p>



<p>Satoshi’s earliest Bitcoin transactions are public. If you can lift the public key and signature from the transaction and then replay them in a different context as “proof” that you’re Satoshi, you can produce a proof of identity that validates without having to possess Satoshi’s private key. Then you can just wildly claim it’s a signature that validates the text of some philosopher’s prose and a lot of people will believe you.</p>



<p>With a little bit of showmanship added on, you too can convince Gavin Anderson by employing this tactic. (Or maybe not; I imagine he’s learned his lesson by now.)</p>



<h3 id="time-ai">Time AI</h3>



<p>Crown Sterling’s sponsored talk at Black Hat USA 2019 is the most vivid example of crackpot cryptography in most people’s minds.</p>



<p>Even the name “Time AI” just screams buzzword soup, so it should come as no surprise that their talk covered a lot of nonsense: “quasi-prime numbers”, “infinite wave conjugations”, “nano-scale of time”, “speed of AI oscillations”, “unified physics cosmology”, and “multi-dimensional encryption technology”.</p>



<p>Naturally, this pissed a lot of cryptographers off, and the normally even-keeled Dan Guido of Trail of Bits actually called them out on their bullshit during their presentation’s Q&amp;A section.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I yelled at the Time AI guy. It’s ok to get angry at someone trying to harm people. I was shocked that more people haven’t done the same. <a href="https://t.co/Mwe7yrihgk">https://t.co/Mwe7yrihgk</a></p>— Dan Guido (@dguido) <a href="https://twitter.com/dguido/status/1159579063540805632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2019</a></blockquote></div>

<p>For most people, the story ended with a bunch of facepalms. But Crown Sterling doubled down and <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/09/crown_sterling_.html">published a press release claiming the ability to break 256-bit RSA keys</a>.</p>

<p>Amusingly, their attack took 50 seconds–which is a lot slower than the standard RSA factoring attacks for small key sizes.</p>



<p>(For those who are missing context: In order to be secure, RSA requires public key sizes in excess of 2048 bits. Breaking 256-bit RSA should take less than a minute on any modern PC.)</p>



<h3 id="terra-quantum">Terra Quantum</h3>



<p>Earlier this week, Bloomberg news ran a story titled, <em><a href="https://archive.md/sZ1Q5">A Swiss Company Says It Found Weakness That Imperils Encryption</a></em>. If you only read the first few paragraphs, it’s really clear that the story basically boils down to, “Swiss Company realizes there’s an entire discipline of computer science dedicated to quantum computers and the risks they pose to cryptography.”</p>



<p>Here’s a quick primer on quantum computers and cryptography:</p>



<p>If a practical quantum computer is ever built, it can immediately break all of the <em>asymmetric</em> cryptography used on the Internet today: RSA, DSA, Diffie-Hellman, Elliptic Curve Cryptography, etc. The attack costs to break these algorithms vary, but are generally in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B32%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{32}" title="2^{32}"> range (for numbers of queries).</p>



<p>The jury is still out on whether or not quantum computers will ever be practical. Just in case, a lot of cryptographers are working on <strong>post-quantum cryptography</strong> (algorithms that are secure even against quantum computers).</p>



<p>Symmetric cryptography fares a lot better: The attack costs are roughly reduced by a factor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt+N&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="\sqrt N" title="\sqrt N">. This makes a 128-bit secure cipher have only a 64-bit security level, which is pretty terrible, but a 256-bit secure cipher remains at the 128-bit security level even with practical quantum computers.</p>



<p>So it’s a little strange that they open with:</p>



<blockquote><p>The company said that its research found vulnerabilities that affect symmetric encryption ciphers, including the Advanced Encryption Standard, or AES, which is widely used to secure data transmitted over the internet and to encrypt files. Using a method known as quantum annealing, the company said its research found that even the strongest versions of AES encryption may be decipherable by quantum computers that could be available in a few years from now.</p><cite>From the Bloomberg article.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Uh, no.</p>



<p>Let’s do some math: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B32%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{32}" title="2^{32}"> calculations can be performed in <em>seconds</em> on modern computers. If we assume that practical quantum computers are also as fast as classical computers, it’s safe to assume this will hold true as well.</p>



<p>You can break 128-bit ciphers in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B64%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{64}" title="2^{64}"> time, using <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/63068/attacking-aes-128-with-grovers-algorithm">Grover’s algorithm</a>. You can’t break 256-bit ciphers <a href="https://pthree.org/2016/06/19/the-physics-of-brute-force/">in any practical time</a>, even with the quantum computer speed-up. Most software prefers 256-bit AES over 128-bit AES for this reason.</p>



<p>What does <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B64%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{64}" title="2^{64}"> time look like?</p>

      <p>If you didn't see it, please check out <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/10/haskell-bad-parts-1">part 1 of this series</a> to understand the purpose of this. Now, for more bad parts!</p>
<h2 id="partial-functions-in-general">Partial functions (in general)</h2>
<p>Laziness very likely belongs in this list. My favorite part of criticizing laziness is how quickly people jump to defend it based on edge cases. So let's be a bit more nuanced before I later get far <em>less</em> nuanced. Laziness is <strong>obviously</strong> a good thing. Strictness is <strong>obviously</strong> a good thing. They also both suck. It depends on context and purpose. Each of them introduce different kinds of issues. The real question is: what's a more sensible default? We'll get to that another time.</p>
<p>I called this section partial functions. Am I having a senior moment? Maybe, but I intentionally started with laziness. In a strict language, function calls can result in exceptions being thrown, segfaulting occurring, or panicking. (And if I write a "Rust: The Bad Parts", believe me, I'll be mentioning panicking.) The fact that a function <em>acts</em> like it can successfully perform something, but in fact fails in a predictable way (like failing a <code>HashMap</code> lookup), it should be reflected at the type level. If not, ya dun goofed.</p>
<p>Also, if you have a language that doesn't let you reflect this information at the type level: ya dun goofed.</p>
<p>Partial functions are the antithesis of this concept. They allow you to say "yeah dude, I can <em>totally</em> give you the first value in an empty list." Partial functions are like politicians: you can tell they're lying because their lips are moving. ("But Michael," you say. "Functions don't have lips!" Whatever, I'm waxing poetical.)</p>
<p>Alright, so plenty of languages screw this up. Haskell tells those languages "hold my beer."</p>
<p><img src="https://www.snoyman.com/static/images/holdmybeer.jpg"></p><p>Haskell screws up partial functions way, way worse than other languages:</p>
<ol>
<li>It promotes a whole bunch of them in the standard libraries and <code>Prelude</code>.</li>
<li>Some libraries, like <code>vector</code> (I'm getting to you, don't worry) make it <em>really</em> confusing by providing an <code>index</code> and <code>unsafeIndex</code> function. Hint: <code>index</code> isn't really safe, it's just less unsafe.</li>
<li>There's no obvious way to search for usages of these partial functions.</li>
<li>And, by far, the worst...</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="values-are-partial-too">Values are partial too!</h3>
<p>Only in a lazy language does this exist. You call a function. You get a result. You continue working. In any other non-lazy language, that means you have a value. If I have a <code>u32</code> in Rust, I actually have a <code>u32</code> in Rust. Null pointers in languages like C and Java somewhat muddy this situation, but at least primitive types are really there if they say they're there.</p>
<p>No, not Haskell. <code>x :: Int</code> may in fact not exist. It's a lie. <code>let x = head [] :: [Int]</code> is a box waiting to explode. And you find out <em>much</em> later. And it's even worse than that. <code>let alice = Person { name = "Alice", age = someAge }</code> may give you a valid <code>Person</code> value. You can evaluate it. But Cthulhu help you if you evaluate <code>age alice</code>. Maybe, just maybe, <code>someAge</code> is a bottom value. Boom! You've smuggled a dirty bomb out.</p>
<p>I'm not advocating for removing laziness in Haskell. In fact I'm not really advocating for much of anything in this series. I'm just complaining, because I like complaining.</p>
<p>But <em>if</em> I was to advocate some changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deprecate partial functions</li>
<li>Introduce a naming scheme for partial functions to be more obvious</li>
<li>Introduce a compiler warning to note partial function use (with a pragma to turn off specific usages)</li>
<li>Warn by default on partial pattern matches</li>
<li>Advocate strict data fields by default</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="but-ackshualllly-infinite-loops">But ackshualllly, infinite loops</h3>
<p>Someone's gonna say it. So I'll say it. Yes, without major language changes, you can't prevent partial functions. You can't even detect them, unless Turing was wrong (and I have my suspicions.) But Haskell community, please, please learn this lesson:</p>
<p><strong>DON'T LET THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD</strong></p>
<p>We can get rid of many of the most common partial functions trivially. We can detect many common cases by looking for partial pattern matches and usage of <code>throw</code> (again, horribly named function). "But we can't get everything" doesn't mean "don't try to get something."</p>
<h2 id="hubris">Hubris</h2>
<p>Given what I just said, we Haskellers have a lot of hubris. Each time you say "if it compiles it works," a thunk dies and collapses into a blackhole. We've got plenty of messes in Haskell that don't sufficiently protect us from ourselves. The compiler can only do as good a job as our coding standards and our libraries allow.</p>
<p>"But Haskell's at least better than languages like PHP." I mean, obviously I agree with this, or I'd be writing PHP. But since I'm being ridiculously hyperbolic here, let me make a ridiculous claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>PHP is better than Haskell, since at least you don't get a false sense of security</strong></p>
<p><em>- Michael Snoyman, totally 100% what he actually believes, you should totally quote this out of context</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've said this so many times. So I'll say it again. Using a great language with safety features is one tiny piece of the puzzle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you get the software requirements right?</li>
<li>Did you leverage the type system to prevent the bugs you're trying to prevent?</li>
<li>Do your underlying libraries have bugs?</li>
<li>Did you find a way to implement a function with correct types but incorrect semantics?</li>
<li>Did you host the thing on a dinky server sitting under your desk and forget that you have power outages on a daily basis?</li>
<li>Did you forget to write a single test case?</li>
<li>Do your test cases actually test anything meaningful?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are <em>so many ways</em> for software to fail outside the purview of the type system. We've got to stop thinking that somehow Haskell (or, for that matter, Rust, Scala, and other strongly typed languages) are some kind of panacea. Seriously: the PHP people at least know their languages won't protect them from anything. We should bring some of that humility back to Haskell.</p>
<p>Haskell provides me tools to help prevent certain classes of bugs, so I can spend more of my time catching a bunch of other bugs that I'm absolutely going to write. Because I'm dumb. And we need to remember: we're all dumb.</p>
<h2 id="more-partial-functions">More partial functions!</h2>
<p>You know what's worse than partial functions? Insidiously partial functions. We've all been screaming about <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> for years. My hackles rise every time I see a <code>read</code> instead of <code>readMaybe</code>. I can't remember the last time I saw the <code>!!</code> operator in production code.</p>
<p>But there are plenty of other functions that are just as dangerous, if not more so. More dangerous because they aren't well known to be partial. They are commonly used. People don't understand why they're dangerous. And they fail only in edge cases that people aren't thinking about.</p>
<p>Exhibit A: I present <code>decodeUtf8</code>. (Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/kerckhove_ts/status/1321390954172063745?s=20">Syd</a>.)</p>
<p>Go ahead, search your codebase. Be dismayed that you've found it present.</p>
<p>What's wrong with <code>decodeUtf8</code>? As we established last time, character encoding crap breaks stuff in production. UTF-8 works about 99% of the time, especially for people in Western countries. You'll probably forget to even test for it. And that function looks so benign: <code>decodeUtf8 :: ByteString -&gt; Text</code>.</p>
<p><strong>DO NOT BE FOOLED</strong></p>
<p>This function is a ticking time bomb. Use <code>decodeUtf8'</code> (yes, it's named that badly, just like <code>foldl'</code>) and explicitly handle error cases. Or use I/O functions that explicitly handle UTF-8 decoding errors and throw a runtime exception.</p>
<p>"I can't believe Michael still thinks runtime exceptions are a good idea." I'll get to that another time. I don't really believe they're a good idea. I believe they are omnipresent, better than bottom values, and our least-bad-option.</p>
<h2 id="law-abiding-type-classes">Law-abiding type classes</h2>
<p>Now I've truly lost it. What in tarnation could be wrong with law-abiding type classes? They're good, right? Yes, they are! The section heading is complete clickbait. Haha, fooled you!</p>
<p>There's a concept in the Haskell community that all type classes should be law-abiding. I've gone to the really bad extreme opposing this in the past with early versions of <code>classy-prelude</code>. In my defense: it was an experiment. But it was a bad idea. I've mostly come around to the idea of type classes being lawful. (Also, the original namespacing issues that led to <code>classy-prelude</code> really point out a much bigger bad part of Haskell, which I'll get to later. Stay tuned! Hint: Rust beat us again.)</p>
<p>Oh, right. Speaking of Rust: they do <em>not</em> believe in law-abiding type classes. There are plenty of type classes over there (though they call them <code>trait</code>s) that are completely ad-hoc. I'm looking at you, <code>FromIterator</code>. This is Very, Very Bad of course. Or so my Haskell instincts tell me. And yet, it makes code Really, Really Good. So now I'm just confused.</p>
<p>Basically: I think we need much more nuanced on this in the Haskell community. I'm leaning towards my <em>very</em> original instincts having been spot on. So:</p>
<ul>
<li>Law abiding type classes: great</li>
<li>Flippantly non-law-abiding type classes ala the original <code>classy-prelude</code>: bad</li>
<li>"You know what I meant" typeclasses like <code>ToContent</code> in Yesod: also great</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn't exactly in line with a "bad part" of Haskell. Up until now I've been giving a nuanced reflection on my journeys in Haskell. Let me try something better then. Ahem.</p>
<p><strong>DON'T LECTURE ME ON LAW ABIDING TYPE CLASSES AND FLAGRANTLY VIOLATE LAWS</strong></p>
<p>I'm staring at you, <code>Eq Double</code>. No, you cannot do equality on a <code>Double</code>. (And thanks again to Syd for this idea.) Rust, again, Got It Right. See <code>PartialEq</code> vs <code>Eq</code>. Floating point values do not allow for total equality. This makes things like <code>Map Double x</code> dangerous. Like, super dangerous. Though maybe not as dangerous as <code>HashMap Double x</code>, which deserves its own rant later.</p>
<p>So come down from your high horses. We don't have law abiding type classes. We have "if I close my eyes and pretend enough then maybe I have law abiding type classes."</p>

<p><span>B</span>y the time Mudassir Azeemi wrote to Apple CEO Tim Cook in 2014, he’d tried everything he<em> </em>could think of to make it easier to type in his native language, Urdu. In 2010, the now 42-year-old Pakistani-American developed a keyboard app you could use on iOS devices; within two years, it had been downloaded over 165,000 times. But even with an Urdu-language keyboard, the characters appeared on the screen in an entirely different font.</p>



<p>“Dear Mr Tim Cook,” he wrote. “Urdu language’s beauty lies in the typeface.”</p>



<p>Spoken by nearly 170 million people in South Asia and the South Asian diaspora, Urdu is written in an alphabet derived from Arabic. But while Arabic is written in a script called <em>naskh</em>, simpler and more linear in its appearance, many other people — including Iranians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Urdu-speakers in India, and Uighur-speakers in parts of China — employ an ornate style of writing that originated in 14th-century Persia called <em>nastaʿlīq</em>. When Azeemi sat down to write his letter to Cook, nastaʿlīq was almost nowhere to be found online. To communicate in Urdu, you either had to type in naskh or spell words phonetically in Latin script.</p>



<p>Azeemi, a software developer now working and living in Silicon Valley, grew up in Pakistan’s sprawling seaside city, Karachi. As a teenager during the days of dial-up, he once racked up an internet bill that cost half of his father’s monthly salary; in his early 20s, he learned to code on one of those old calculator-sized computers called palmtops. He didn’t give much thought to Urdu’s digital future until he moved to California and became a father. Watching his children learn English through songs on YouTube, he’d felt a pang of loss — the anxiety that they might never speak or appreciate Urdu the way he does. One of the earliest apps Azeemi developed, even before the keyboard, was for nursery rhymes in Urdu.</p>



<p>These early attempts at yanking Urdu on to the internet hadn’t been particularly profitable — Azeemi says he lost over $50,000 in the process. He remained determined. In 2013, Apple introduced an Urdu keyboard for iOS devices, but, much to the chagrin of Urdu users, the default font was still naskh, the Arabic font. In Azeemi’s eyes, the solution was now pretty straightforward: operating systems — Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others — had to be persuaded to adopt nastaʿlīq.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His open letter, addressed to Cook and Apple’s chief design officer at the time, Jonathan Ive, described the need for a nastaʿlīq font on iOS platforms. “The only hurdle for us is to bring the typeface that truly represent[s] the language,” wrote Azeemi. “And every language, when it is written, shines when using the typeface which it truly presented in the world.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Urdu calligraphers speak of nastaʿlīq, it is with deep reverence. In the subcontinent, it was the script that disseminated the Quran, considered the word of God. Mir Ali of Tabriz, a 14th-century Persian calligrapher known as the father of the script, is said to have developed it after a dream in which Ali, son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad, instructed him to draw letters that looked like “the wings of flying geese.” Squint at an Urdu verse in nastaʿlīq, and it might very well begin to resemble a flock of birds taking flight, or a branch in bloom. Nastaʿlīq characters, <a href="https://archive.org/stream/fromconcepttocon00fush/fromconcepttocon00fush_djvu.txt">per one observation</a>, appear to “swing from the upper right to the lower left of each word as if suspended by an imaginary line.”</p>



<p>In some ways, this emphasis on the <em>form</em> of writing a language runs contrary to conventional wisdom. We tend to think of text as a means to an end, that the characters depicted are there only to convey meaning. If you could write the same Urdu word in the Arabic naskh script, even if it looked a little different — naskh is smaller, simpler, and sans serif — wasn’t the demand for digitized nastaʿlīq just a minor typographical quibble?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nastaʿlīq, after all, is a nightmare to code. It moves right to left, like all Arabic scripts, but also slopes downward: the longer the word, the steeper the slope. The shape of each letter changes, depending on the letter that comes before and after; in a 39-letter alphabet, there are thousands of permutations. Its multifaceted nature is precisely why coders haven’t developed nastaʿlīq fonts as easily as, say, Cyrillic.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>We tend to think of text as a means to an end, that the characters depicted are there only to convey meaning.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>It didn’t have to be this way. As early as 1951, just four years after wresting off British rule, Pakistan — where Urdu is both the official language and played a key role in the movement for independence — set up a national printing press that could compose in both English and Urdu, a substantial investment for the young, cash-strapped country and an indication, perhaps, of Urdu’s importance for its nation-building project. But even though Monotype and Linotype, the predominant printing technology firms of the time, kept developing typefaces for the Urdu market, local publishers kept rejecting them because they just didn’t match up to the local nastaʿlīq aesthetic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Part of the reason nastaʿlīq ran into trouble was because the technology at the time — specifically the typewriter — was built with English in mind. Subsequently, as historian Thomas S. Mullaney notes in his book, “The Chinese Typewriter,” all other languages are seen as permutations from that norm. Hebrew is English but backward. Arabic is English backward and in cursive. Russian: English with different letters. Siamese: English with too many letters. Perhaps the only major language to escape the thumb of Latin hegemony was Chinese, a script that is neither alphabetic nor syllabic, and thus <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/wubi-effect">had to be imagined entirely outside the box of existing technology</a>. But nastaʿlīq, presumably not quite significant enough to send typographers back to the drawing board, remained stalled until the 1970s, its mechanical rendering nowhere close to the sweep and flourish of the handwritten script.</p>



<p>In modern-day Iran, where nastaʿlīq originated, the font changed to meet the limitations of the existing technology. Over the years, Farsi slowly developed a typographical identity that worked within the constraints of the block printing press but was stylistically different enough from the Arabic naskh to feel sufficiently “Persian.” If you pick up a newspaper in Tehran today, it looks significantly different from a paper in Karachi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why didn’t Urdu, and Pakistan, go down a similar typographical route as Farsi did in Iran? Stubborn fidelity to nastaʿlīq aside, one reason may be the ways in which Urdu differed from other nastaʿlīq-favoring languages. One letter, “the <em>baṛī ye</em> (ے), is particularly influential on the look of written Urdu,” writes typographer and historian Titus Nemeth in “Arabic Type-Making in the Machine Age” (2017), “and its typographic rendering is among the most challenging design questions in an Arabic font.”</p>



<p>The baṛī ye, which resembles a bent elbow, produces all sorts of mechanical obstacles with regard to kerning and the placement of dots and diacritics. Baṛī ye and letters like it posed a problem that seemed so insurmountable, in fact, that, in the 1960s — mimicking Mustafa Kemal Atatürk’s <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2013-06-25/some-turks-reconsidering-arabic-connection-turkish-language">mission to convert Turkish script into a Latin alphabet</a> — Pakistan’s military ruler Ayub Khan proposed officially writing Urdu in Latin letters. He was met with near-instant pushback: the nastaʿlīq script, protested local religious leaders, was an essential marker of Pakistan’s Islamic identity. Without meaningful progress in the printing process, Urdu publications in Pakistan, including dailies, continued to be written by hand well into the 1980s, armies of calligraphers scribbling furiously day and night.</p>

<p><strong>Ahmed Mirza Jamil,</strong> owner of a printing business in Karachi, inherited his love for nastaʿlīq from his father, who, in his later life, took up the daunting task of writing the Quran in his own hand. He’d completed only a third of the holy book before he fell ill and died, but his sons vowed to finish his cherished project. They photographed their father’s nine handwritten chapters, then cut and pasted his letter formations to piece together — like a jigsaw puzzle — the remaining two-thirds of the Quran. It was a staggeringly elaborate labor of love that took 14 years to complete. And it sowed the seeds for a long-awaited breakthrough in Urdu typesetting.</p>



<p>In 1980, Mirza Jamil wrote out every combination of Urdu letters that he could think of — roughly 20,000 by most accounts. These combinations, known as ligatures, became the basis of a new Urdu typeface: Noori Nastaliq, a font Jamil named after his father. It solved the difficulty posed by the shape-shifting nature of nastaʿlīq: instead of representing letters, it represented entire <em>combinations</em> of letters written together. The 20,000 ligatures were by no means exhaustive, but the chances of any other combination cropping up, Mirza Jamil reckoned, were negligible. He’d been inspired to address Urdu typographical troubles after encountering a Chinese keyboard, a 48-inch contraption with up to 500 characters, on a trip to Singapore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I thought, if the Chinese could do it,” he told a journalist in 1996, “so could we.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the advent of Noori Nastaliq, Mirza Jamil was hailed as Pakistan’s Gutenburg and bestowed with state honors. Urdu’s path to progress, <a href="http://elite.com.pk/epl/portfolio/noori-nastaliq/revolution/">one writer wrote</a>, “will be lit with the candle of Noori Nastaliq.” Still, adoption was tentative: for a while, according to the historian Nemeth, the country’s largest national newspaper, <em>Daily Jang,</em> carried typographically composed text alongside columns that were still handwritten, hoping to convince the nastaʿlīq purists that their beloved font could be printed too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For decades, Noori Nastaliq remained the …</p></div></div>

		<p>Audio brings games and projects to life! Web developers have it easy, they can publish their apps on the web and play audio using the browser API no problem. However, what about those of us that are command-line and graphics apps in other languages? Repl.it is a special place on the web where you can publish any app in any language, but so far it’s been missing audio capabilities because code executes in a container on the backend. This summer, for my internship I set out to solve this problem and make it possible to play audio in any repl in any language. In this post I’ll show you how to play audio in your repl and then I will chronicle the journey that got us here. </p>
<p><img src="https://repl.art/music-01.png" alt="music art"></p>
<h2 id="how-you-play-audio">How you play audio</h2>
<p>Before we get to the technical parts, let's talk about how you can use audio in your app or game.</p>
<p>As of this writing we support two libraries: Python and JavaScript. The Python library is built right in so you shouldn't need to install it. However, the JavaScript library you'll have to install and you can do that by simple importing (<code>@replit/audio</code>).</p>
<p>You can learn more on our <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/audio">docs for audio</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a quick demo before I tell how it all works:</p>


<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>It started out with an idea, I wanted to add audio to Repl.it because I wanted to use it and many users were asking for it, so it seemed like a good project to take on.  To be honest, I thought it was going to be a lot easier than it turned out to be. I thought I’d just throw in a Pulseaudio stream over TCP, play it in the browser, and be done with it. I was wrong. But who would’ve thought that real-time audio streaming from an isolated Docker container using fake audio devices without the use of an always-on daemon would be difficult? I sure didn’t.</p>
<p>At first, my goal was to get something simple that worked. My first attempt was to use a combination of portaudio and loopback devices native to the host machine but isolated to each container but that didn’t end up working because the infrastructure was far too complicated to be maintainable and we’d have to install C libraries for each language so they could play audio. Moving on.</p>
<p>My second attempt was to prototype something so I could see how I could build the client. I wanted to make sure that I had at least one part of the setup correct.  For this attempt, I just searched for files named “PlayMeAudio.wav (or .aiff)” which would be decoded and sent to the client in a buffer when the client opened the repl. Although this worked, it was only a prototype and we didn’t ship it.</p>
<p>For my third attempt, I figured I’d decode the audio and relay that to the client via a pipe file. Although this worked, it was using a ridiculous amount of CPU in Python and just simply not fast enough. I had concerns it might be an issue in other languages as well.</p>
<p>For my final and fourth attempt, I made a request based system. Instead of decoding the audio files in userland and putting a strain on resources, I’d have the user language tell me which files to play, and we’d do the heavy lifting in Go, which is the language that we write the container service in, which we call PID1.  Although the code was a mess, it worked and ended up being the first version of audio we released to explorers, despite its many shortcomings.</p>
<p>Although it worked, this attempt had three issues: 
All files had to be at a sample rate of <code>44,000</code> hertz
All files had to have a bit depth of <code>32</code>
Only <code>.aiff</code> and <code>.wav</code> files were supported.</p>
<p>The reason for the first issue was that I couldn't find a good polyphase filter (for sample rate conversion) and I needed a C library to cross compile. This proved to be challenging, as we needed to static link it and it had libm as a dependency, which means we’d have to static link all of libc -- more on that later.  I ended up having to dynamically build it. Including its source wasn't an option because it had very large generated files, so I had to build it before we built PID1, more on this later on.</p>
<p>For the second issue, I really didn’t have an excuse other than not really understanding bit depth, but once I did I was able to quickly fix it.</p>
<p>For the third one, it wasn't so much that those files were the only ones supported - it was more so that we didn’t support <code>.mp3</code> files- for this, I ended up needing to use C again. I used minimp3 library and its Go bindings.</p>
<p>I also had plans to include <code>.opus</code> file support, so I was going to need another C library… Well to clarify, I needed both opus and opusfile. Opusfile requires opus, which requires OpenSSL, so I had to build OpenSSL the build opus and opusfile, without root. Well needless to say, this was starting to get a bit ridiculous to do more than once. I made a <a href="https://github.com/repl-it-discord/audio/">github repo</a> which would serve as a repo to house all the C libraries we needed along with the Go bindings, and I included a file I found from a source that would let me static link libm without all of libc. </p>
<p>After all of this, we have the dependencies resolved, and everything sounds good - except for one thing: Changes in audio take <code>~.74</code> -  <code>~1.48</code> seconds to take effect. Why? Well we were sending audio in chunks, instead of streaming. Every <code>~.74</code> seconds, we prepare audio and send exactly <code>32,768</code> samples (<code>2^15</code>, no particular reason for this magic number other than the buffer rarely runs out and the latency isn't unbearable) but this wasn't enough.  </p>
<p>The client was designed to append audio samples at the end of what it had scheduled, so what I did was send audio initially and then immediately send it again, so we’d give the client  <code>65,536</code> samples at the start, and send an additional <code>32,768</code> samples every <code>~.74</code> seconds. Where did I get <code>.74</code> seconds from? As we are playing the audio at <code>44,100</code> hertz, we play <code>44,100</code> samples per second - so <code>32,768/44,100</code>. </p>
<p>This setup was great for smooth audio, but I felt that the latency makes your repl experience feel rather shoddy. I mean, imagine you’re playing a game, you open the chest and go through a door. Once you go through the door, the sound from the chests plays because you as a user have that <code>.74</code> - <code>1.48</code> second buffer, which just makes using audio for games useless for anything other than background music.</p>
<p>So we had to rewrite this and unfortunately to solve the timing issue we had to complicate the solution. We made the server send overlapping buffers of samples and the client used a timing system along with a sample index the server sent to calculate and compensate for latency and try to make it “real-time” streaming.</p>
<p>Now I know this is hard to understand, in fact I was told it was also hard to code review, so I’ll do my best to illustrate it. </p>
<p>Normally, this is how our makeshift stream would look:</p>
<pre><code>Message 1: 1 2 3 4 5
Message 2:         5 6 7 8 9 
Message 3:                 9 10 11 12 13
...</code></pre><p>This keeps us from audio cutting out due to (network) latency (to an extent), allowing us for smaller buffer sizes without as much (audio) latency</p>
<p>That alone isn't very special, what's really the star of the show is for the server to be able to send:</p>
<pre><code>Message 1: 1 2 3 4 5  
Message 2:   2 3 4 5 6
Message 3:           6 7 8 9 10</code></pre><p>The client is where the difficult processing for this takes place, when we receive new samples we immediately stop playing and start playing those samples… well… mostly. </p>
<p>You see, there's still the one thing that we can’t control. Networking.  Maybe there's a <code>.1</code> second delay for one of the messages, well now look - we’re playing audio we already played!</p>
<p>So now the client has to calculate LATENCY too, which is even MORE difficult. At this point, we’re on multiple devices, and we need less than a <code>1/44,100</code> second difference in time in order to figure this out! That seemed too hard. Instead, what I did was give each message in the protocol the sample index of the first sample, i.e. the first message would have sample index <code>0</code>.  The client then determines how many samples the player has played in total and if that's greater than the sample index it will compensate for that by skipping samples. </p>
<p>Now too get back to the request system I mentioned earlier -- how does one use that? As I mentioned, there’s two libraries above for Python and JavaScript, however this should work for any language, and you’re free to implement your own libraries.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-libraries-work">How do libraries work?</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, users can determine what is played via requests to a named pipe which PID1 reads.  I opted for a simple approach for encoding - json. While making libraries is fun and all, I can’t update libraries for many languages every time I change the requests, so I figured I’d make the request system pretty simple.</p>
<p>The user’s script must only write json data to <code>/tmp/audio</code> (a named pipe) and the go script will then parse the data and fulfill the request.  However, this might error - for example the file isn't found or has invalid encoding. Since we’re sending requests through a named pipe, we can't get errors very easily.
This means that the library the client uses must determine when there’s an issue with a source being created - the setup I made for the libraries which I used would wait up to a set amount of time then if the source wasn’t created in time it times out - while this isn’t always perfect, it's better than nothing.</p>
<p>A typical request to play a tone might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
  <span>"Paused"</span>: <span>false</span>,
  <span>"Name"</span>: <span>"My tone"</span>,
  <span>"Type"</span>: <span>"tone"</span>,
  <span>"Volume"</span>: <span>1</span>,
  <span>"DoesLoop"</span>: <span>false</span>,
  <span>"LoopCount"</span>: <span>0</span>,
  <span>"Args"</span>: {
    <span>"Pitch"</span>: <span>400</span>,
    <span>"Seconds"</span>: <span>5</span>,
    <span>"Type"</span>: <span>1</span>,
    <span>"Path"</span>: <span>""</span>
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>A quick explanation of the above fields: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>Paused</code> - Whether the source is paused or not - this can only be set when updating the source.</li>
<li><code>Name</code> - the name of the source - this can be used to identify the source when it's being created - if it's not set the name will be set by pid1.</li>
<li><code>Type</code> - the type of the source, supported types when I wrote this are:<ul>
<li><code>wav</code> - A <code>.wav</code> file</li>
<li><code>aiff</code> - A <code>.aiff</code> file </li>
<li><code>mp3</code> - A <code>.mp3</code> file</li>
<li><code>tone</code> - A generated tone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Volume</code> - The volume of the source as a floating point number - <code>1</code> would be <code>100</code>%</li>
<li><code>DoesLoop</code> - Whether the source should loop or not …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>Just for fun, here is a quick run-down of how I deploy my personal projects. If
you’re reading this and you have projects of your own that you might like to
deploy, then hopefully some part of this will be helpful to you.</p>



<p>Whenever I register a domain, I use <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>, not necessarily
because it’s the best option, but just because I’ve always found Namecheap to be
easy and intuitive, and it does everything that I need when it comes to
registering and managing domains.</p>

<p>Namecheap <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9434/10/using-default-nameservers-vs-hosting-nameservers/">gives you a few options</a> about what DNS
nameserver to use. Depending on the project, I use either their free, default
DNS service, or I choose the “Custom DNS” option and use DigitalOcean’s
nameservers if the project is hosted there. (I’ll say more about DigitalOcean
below.)</p>

<p>Namecheap also makes it straightforward to define <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/579/2237/which-record-type-option-should-i-choose-for-the-information-im-about-to-enter/">all kinds of host
records</a>. I’m pretty far from understanding what all of
the different kinds of records (A, AAAA, ALIAS, CNAME, NS, SRV, …) are for,
but I’ve learned just enough to be able to do the basic stuff that you usually
need to do when you’re building small websites and web applications.</p>



<p>Just as an aside: When I was a kid, I learned how to write HTML and CSS, built a
lot of stupid-looking websites, and put them up on the Internet for the world
(well, mostly just my friends) to see. This was the late 90’s and early 00’s,
and as far as I could tell at the time, the only way you could do this was to
keep a copy of your website on your computer and copy the files over to your web
space any time you make changes, using an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol">FTP</a> client. Git didn’t exist
yet, let alone GitHub Pages, and I couldn’t have told you what source control
was if you’d asked me. This felt alright to me at the time, but in retrospect,
it’s funny how painfully manual it was to deploy my websites back then.</p>

<p>Thankfully, it’s a lot easier these days to whip up a simple, nice-looking
website and make it publicly available on the Internet, even on a custom domain
with an SSL certificate.</p>

<p>When I first created this blog in 2014, I built it using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and
deployed it via <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. This was the path of least
resistance, as GitHub did (and still does) an excellent job of documenting how
to set up your own GitHub Pages site with Jekyll. I still think this is a pretty
nice setup for new programmers who want to get into building their own websites.</p>

<p>Fun fact: this blog is <em>still</em> built using Jekyll. I’ve re-styled the template a
few times, and I’ve migrated the site away from GitHub Pages, but as much as I’m
not crazy about Jekyll, it still gets the job done well enough that I have no
interest in building it all again using some other static website generator.
Maybe if I were to start over, I would explore other options that are available
now, like <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> or something. But for now, Jekyll is working out just
fine.</p>

<p>I mentioned just now that at one point, I migrated this site away from GitHub
Pages. That was because I found <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. Netlify does a lot of
things, but the big thing they do is that they make it easy to automate
deploying your static sites for free. It’s trivial to take a site that you’re
deploying to GitHub Pages and convert it to use Netlify instead. Why would you
want to do that? Because Netlify gives you a lot more control over the way your
site is deployed. The reason I switched is that I ended up wanting to use some
Jekyll feature that will only work on newer versions of Jekyll, and I found that
with GitHub Pages, I couldn’t control the version of Jekyll that was used to
build the site. With Netlify, I can control pretty much everything about the
build, including which dependencies to bring in and what command to run to build
the site. Another awesome thing about Netlify is that they make it super easy to
set up your site to serve on a custom domain, and they’ll even generate an SSL
certificate for you automatically. After a quick and painless setup, you can
deploy your site by simply pushing commits to the default branch of your repo.</p>



<p>I first started using <a href="https://digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> as a way to explore having my
own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">VPS</a> that I could use to deploy arbitrary static sites and web
applications. I ended up only using my VPS to host static sites, which I now
realize was kind of pointless, because I could have just used Netlify to host
all of them, and it would have been a lot easier and more convenient. But it
really wasn’t pointless, because learning how to set up a VPS was a valuable
exercise in itself.</p>

<p>If you’re curious about setting up a VPS, I will say that it’s easy and fun to
do it with DigitalOcean. I paid $5 per month for a Droplet (i.e. server) that
ran 24/7 and could do anything I wanted. There are all kinds of useful things
that you can do with a VPS, but I ended up only using mine to host web pages and
other files. The setup for that was kind of interesting. I set up a wildcard
CNAME (<code>*.djy.io</code>) to direct to the IP address of my Droplet. Then, I followed
one of DigitalOcean’s guides to set up <a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/">nginx</a> to serve the content from
various folders in <code>/var/www</code> (sites that I had written and uploaded to the
VPS). With this setup in place, I was able to create a new site whenever I
wanted by syncing the HTML and assets into a folder in <code>/var/www</code> and using a
simple nginx config file to specify which sites were to serve on which
subdomains (e.g. <code>something.djy.io</code>).</p>

<p>I got rid of the $5/month VPS once I figured out that I wasn’t using it for
anything that Netlify couldn’t handle for me in a much better way, and for free.</p>

<p>Lately, though, I have been using DigitalOcean again, to host an actual web
application. I built an API to provide information about new <a href="https://alda.io/">Alda</a>
releases, as part of the ground-up rewrite (Alda v2) that I’ve been working on
over the last couple of years.</p>

<p>There are two components to the Alda Releases API: the API server and the asset
storage. For the asset storage, I found DigitalOcean’s <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/">Spaces</a> to do
the job nicely. Spaces is an Amazon S3-compatible file storage service that is
affordable and has some nice features like a built-in CDN. I’ve set up a
<a href="https://circleci.com/">CircleCI</a> automated build pipeline that uploads the executables to a
DigitalOcean Space whenever I push a release tag up to the GitHub remote. The
API server has a background thread that regularly checks for updates to the
executables in the Space so that it can provide up-to-date information about
Alda releases.</p>

<p>I deploy the Alda API using the DigitalOcean <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/">App Platform</a>, a
platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering that automates building and deploying the
app every time I push a commit to my repo’s default branch. App Platform is very
new (it was only released to the general public four months ago, in October
2020), and accordingly has some rough edges, but overall, using it to deploy the
Alda API has been a nice experience. There is the usual trade-off with using any
PaaS product, which is that you don’t have to worry about infrastructure,
however, when something goes wrong, it can be difficult to see what’s going on
under the hood. For a simple, low-maintenance (and low-cost) application like
this one, I think the trade-off makes sense, but it’s not the kind of thing I
would do in my day job.</p>



<p>I hope you found this at least somewhat interesting!</p>

<p>This blog post is an in-depth dive into the security features of the Intel/Windows platform boot process. In this post I'll explain the startup process through security focused lenses, next post we'll dive into several known attacks and how there were handled by Intel and Microsoft. My wish is to explain to technology professionals not deep into platform security why Microsoft's SecureCore is so important and necessary.</p>



<p>We must first begin with a brief introduction to the hardware platform. Skip this if you have read the awsome material available on the web about the Intel architecture, I'll try to briefly summarize it here.</p>

<p>The Intel platform is based on one or two chips. Small systems have one, the desktop and server ones are separated to a CPU complex and a PCH complex (PCH = Platform Controller Hub).</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/image2020-4-19_14-3-0.png" alt="Intel architecture"></p>

<p>The CPU complex deals with computation. It holds the "processor" cores, e.g. Sunny Cove that implement the ISA, as well as cross core caches like the L3 cache, and more controllers that are grouped together as "the system agent" or the "uncore". The uncore contains the memory controller and display, e.g. GPU and display controller.</p>

<p>The PCH handles all other IO, including access to the firmware through SPI or eSPI, wifi, LAN, USB, HD audio, SMBus, thunderbolt and etc'. The PCH also hosts several embedded processors, like the PMC, the Power Management Controller.</p>

<p>An additional part of the PCH is a very important player in our story, the CSME, or Converged Security &amp; Management Engine, a i486 IP block (also called Minute IA). CSME is responsibly for much of the security model of Intel processors as well as many of the manageability features of the platform. The CSME block has its own dedicated ~1.5mb of SRAM memory and 128KB of ROM, as well as a dedicated IOMMU, called the A-Unit (that even has its own <em>acode</em> microcode) located in the CSME's <em>uncore</em>', thats allows access from ME to the main memory, as well as DMA to/from the main memory and using the main memory as an encrypted paging area ("virtual memory"). The CSME engine runs a customized version of the Minix3 microkernel, also recent versions have changed it beyond recognition adding many security features.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/image2020-4-19_14-14-4.png" alt="CSME structure"></p>

<h2 id="buses">Buses</h2>
<p>Lets use this post to also introduce the main interconnects in the system. The main externally facing interconnect bus is PCI-E, a fast bust that can reach 64GBps in its latest incarnations. A second external bus is the LPC, or Low Pin Count bus, a slow bus for connecting devices such as SPI flash, the TPM (explained below), and old peripherals such as PS/2 touchpads.</p>

<p>Internally the platform is based around the <strong>IOSF</strong>, or Intel On-chip System Fabric, which is a pumped up version of PCI-E that supports many additional security and addressing features. For addressing IOSF adds SourceID and DestID fields that contain the source and destination of any IOSF transaction, extending PCI-E Bus-Device-Function (BDF) addressing to enable routing over bridges. IOSF also extends addressing by adding support for multiple address root namespaces, currently defining three: RS0 for host memory space, RS1 for CSME memory space, and RS2 for the Innovation-Engine (IE), another embedded controller currently present only on server chipsets.
There are two IOSF busses in the PCH - the Primary Fabric and the Sideband Fabric. The Primary Fabric is high speed, connecting the CPU to the PCH (through a protocol call DMI), as well as high speed devices such as Gigbait Ethernet, WiFi and eSPI. The Sideband Fabric is used to connect the CSME to low-speed devices, including the PMC (Power Management Controller), the RNG generator, GPIO pins, USB, SMBus, and even debugging interfaces such as JTAG.</p>

<h2 id="more-components">More Components</h2>
<p>Another interesting component is the <strong>ITH</strong>, or Intel Trace Hub, which is codenamed North Peak (NPK). The ITH can trace different internal hardware component (VIA - Visualization of Internal Signals, ODLA - On-chip logic analyzer, SoCHAP - SOC performance counters, IPT - Intel Process Trace, AET - Intel Architecture Trace), and external component like CSME, the UEFI firmware, and you can even connect it to ETW. This telemetry eventually finds its way to Intel in various methods.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/image2020-4-22_0-52-2.png" alt="Intel Trace Hub"></p>

<p>The <strong>TPM</strong> is designed to provide a tamper proof environment to enforce system security through hardware. It implements in hardware many essential functions: sha1 &amp; sha256 hashing algorithms, many crypto and key derivation functions, measurment registers call the Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs), a secret key - Endorsment Key - used to derive all other keys, and non-volatile storage slots for storing keys and hashes. Discrete TPM chips (i.e. those that are a separate chip on the mainboard or SOC and connected through the LPC) are call dTPMs, or can be implemented in the CSME module's firmware and called fTPMs.</p>

<p>The TPM's <strong>PCR</strong> are initialized to zero when the platform boots and are filled up with measurements through the boot process. PCRs 0-15 are intended for "static" use - they reset when the platform boots; They are supposed to give the OS loader a view of the platform initialization state.
PCRs 17-22 are for "dynamic" use - they get reset on each secure launch (GETSEC[SENTER]); They are supposed to be used by the attestation sofware that checks if the OS is trusted.</p>

<h2 id="the-flash-chip">The Flash Chip</h2>
<p>SPI flash has 5 major regions: the Descriptor regions, the CSME region, the Gigabit Ethernet Region, the Platform Data Region, and the UEFI region. In the image below you can see an example of how the flash is organized.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/image2019-11-11_1-18-53_1.png" alt="Partition regions in SPI flash">
<img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/image2019-11-11_1-19-12.png" alt="Serial flash sizes"></p>

<p>Later versions added more regions:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/image2019-11-25_22-49-41.png" alt="SPI region evolution"></p>

<p>These regions are categorized as fault tolerant (FTPs) and non fault tolerant partitions (NFTPs).
Fault tolerant partitions are critical for boot, and verified during early boot (like the RBE, the CSME ROM Boot extensions will discuss in a few paragraphs). If verification fails - the system does not boot. Examples of non fault tolerant partitions are the Integrated Sensor Hub (or ISH) firmware.</p>

<p>SPI flash protection is applied at multiple levels: On the flash chip itself, in the SPI flash controller (in the PCH), in UEFI code and in CSME code.</p>

<p>The SPI controller maps the entire flash to memory at a fixed address, so reads/writes are usually done simply by reading/writing memory. The SPI controller translates this to flash-specific commands issued on the SPI bus, using a table of flash-specific commands stored in the flash descriptor region.
This is called "Hardware Sequencing", meaning the SPI controller issues the actual SPI commands
When hardware sequencing is in use, the SPI controller enforces several flash protections based on the masters region table in the flash (but can be overriden using a hardware PIN).</p>

<p>The SPI controller also implements a FLOCKDN flag. FLOCKDN is a write-once bit that, when set, disables use of software sequencing and modification of the PR registers until the next reset. The CSME sets this in the Bring-UP process (bup_storage_lock_spi_configuration(), see below). This happens when the UEFI notifies it that it is at the end of POST. In addition to the region access control table, the SPI controller also has an option to globally protect up to five regions in the flash from write access by the host using five registers, called Protected Registers (PRs), which are intended for the UEFI firmware to protect itself from modification while the OS is running.</p>

<p>It is also possible to issue direct flash commands using "Software Sequencing" by writing to the OPTYPE/OPMENU registers, since this can be used circumvent the SPI-enforced protections, software sequencing is usually disabled after POST using the FLOCKDN bit.</p>

<p>How is the flash updated?</p>

<p>UEFI region is updated through an UEFI capsule, This update happens during POST, before PRs and FLOCKDN is set, therefore, the BIOS region is still accessible to UEFI code.</p>

<p>Many OEMS have then own UEFI anti-tamper protections. For example, HP has SureStart on laptops and workstations, and Dell has TrustedDevice SafeBIOS. SafeBIOS copies bad firmware images to the EFI system partition, and the Dell Trusted Device software on Windows sends their hashes plus the hash of the UEFI firmware currently in memory to a Dell cloud server (*.delltrusteddevicesecurity.com) to check against a list of "authorized" hashes. Server platforms have similiar protections, including iLO for HP and iDRAC in Dell.
The CSME region can usually be updated only from within the CSME. However, for more complicated upgrades CSME can temporarily unlock the ME region for host read &amp; write.</p>


<p>In the next sections we'll look over all the stages of boot.
<img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/image2020-4-20_14-56-23.png" alt="Serial flash sizes"></p>


<p>Boot starts the PMC, the Power Management Controller.
In modern Intel systems the PMC is an ARC core and its the first controller to execute code once electricity is applied to the system. We'll talk more about PMC in a later post as its quiet interesting and has its own microcode and firmware, and event generates telemetry over the IOSF SB bus (which we'll talk about in a moment).</p>

<p>While the PMC does its init, the rest of the system is held at bay at a RESET state.</p>

<p>The next part to start running is the CSME. Recall from the first post in the series, CSME, or Converged Security and Managment Engine is a MinuteIA (i486 CPU IP block) embedded in the Platform Controller Hub (PCH).
The CSME begins running from its own embedded 128KB ROM - the CSME-ROM. This ROM is protected with a hardware fuse that is burned by Intel during production.
When started the CSME ROM starts like a regular 486 processor BIOS - in the reset vector in real mode. Its first order of business is to …</p></section></div>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>

Ideally, there would have been an entry between this one and <a href="http://pete.akeo.ie/2011/06/extracting-and-using-modified-vmware.html">the last</a>, where I'd give you some pointers on how to disassemble the VMware BIOS we extracted using <a href="http://www.hex-rays.com/idapro/">IDA Pro</a>. However, one of the points of this series is to explore ways of improving/revisiting the too often ignored x86 bootloader recovery process (a.k.a. <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.bios/25740/focus=26022">'panic room'</a>), that really ought to be part of any system boot operations. As such, we might as well jump straight into the fun by <b>creating a VMware BIOS from scratch</b>.</p><p>

Your first question might be <i>"Why would anyone want to craft their own BIOS from scratch (apart for an academical exercise)?"</i>. Well, in an ideal world, chipmakers such as intel and AMD <b>would</b> follow the example of the <a href="http://www.realtek.com.tw/">few SoCs manufacturers</a> <a href="http://www.ali.com.tw/index.php">who got it right</a> and provide both an UART and a small serial boot recovery ROM, <i>ondie</i>, to relegate the prospect of a non-functional system because of bad/uninitialized flash, to the footnotes of history. Alas, with CPUs well into their 4th decade of existence, that still hasn't happened. Therefore, to compensate for this missing feature, we'll have to implement such a feature ourselves, in the flash ROM, and that means writing a BIOS bootblock from scratch. And if you know how to write a BIOS bootblock, then you know how to write a complete BIOS. As to why one would actually want to replace a fully functional BIOS on <b>actual</b> hardware, just wait till you purchase a 3TB (or larger) HDD, or create a &gt;2TB RAID array, on an not so old machine, with the intent of booting Windows from it...</p><p>

Of course, crafting a fully featured BIOS, that can actually boot an OS, is something better left to large projects such as <a href="http://www.coreboot.org/">coreboot</a> with a payload of either <a href="http://www.coreboot.org/SeaBIOS">SeaBIOS</a> or <a href="http://www.tianocore.org/">Tianocore</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface">UEFI</a>), so we're not going to do that here. Instead, our aim will be to produce a very simple BIOS, that just does serial I/O, and that can be used as a development base for more interesting endeavours, such as 'panic room' type flash recovery, or regular BIOS instrumentation, to help with the development of an UEFI 'BIOS' for legacy platforms. Trying things out with a virtual machine, before jumping onto actual hardware, seems like the smart thing to do.</p><p>


<b>Know thy enemy, a.k.a. "Which SuperIO?"</b></p><p>

Hardware wise, the only subsystem we want to access then is the SuperIO chip, since it provides the (virtual) UART we are after. We're not going to bother about PCI, RAM, Video, or even Cache as RAM (CAR) access: just plain good old serial debug will do. And while I'm not going to go as far as saying that implementing the items listed above would be trivial, the fact is, as long as you have serial debug, at least you don't have to shoot in the dark, and that's big help.</p><p>

In the case of VMware, all you need to know is that the SuperIO is a (virtual) National Semiconductor PC97338 (<a href="http://pdf.datasheetcatalog.com/datasheet/nationalsemiconductor/PC97338.pdf">datasheet here</a>). Unfortunately neither coreboot's <a href="http://www.coreboot.org/Superiotool"><code>superiotool</code></a> or <a href="http://www.lm-sensors.org/">lm-sensors</a>'s <a href="http://www.lm-sensors.org/wiki/man/sensors-detect"><code>sensors-detect</code></a> seem to detect it at the moment, which is quite unfortunate (Didn't someone mention they were porting coreboot/LinuxBIOS to VMware <a href="http://www.coreboot.org/pipermail/coreboot/2007-March/019030.html">some time ago</a>? What happened?), as a lot of time was wasted on the SuperIO errand.</p><p>

And maybe I missed a step somewhere, but from what I can see, the VMware virtual chip is not set to run in PnP mode. Thus, what I'm going to expose in the code below with regards to accessing the serial port is very specific to the VMware PC97338 non-PnP implementation, and may not translate so well to SuperIO chips that run in PnP mode. Oh well... Also, if you disassemble the VMware BIOS, you'll see some mucking around with a SuperIO chip located at port <code>0x398</code> early in the bootblock, with <code>0x398</code> being one of the possible bases for the PC97338... Except the VMware SuperIO base is indeed at the <code>0x2e</code> location, so all that early stuff is a wild goose chase. Thanks a lot guys!</p><p>

Therefore, just to reiterate, all you need to know is that the VMware SuperIO is a PC97338, at port <code>0x2e</code> and running in non PnP mode. With that you can run along, and get going implementing early serial in your own BIOS.</p><p>


<b>Toolchain considerations and software constraints</b></p><p>

With the hardware in check, and before we start writing anything, it might help to have a look at our other requirements.</p><p>

First of all, as far as the development toolchain is concerned, and even more so as what follows is aimed at being usable by the largest number of people, we will use a GNU toolchain all the way. That means, as soon as you have a gcc setup on your platform that can produce x86 code, you should be good to go. And for the record, I have verified that the files I'm presenting below can produce a BIOS ROM on Windows, with either MinGW32, MinGW-w64 or cygwin, as well as Linux x86 or x64, with regular gcc. OSX (with a <b>proper</b> gcc toolchain) as well as cross compilers on other UNIX architectures are expected to work too. So if you don't have gcc setup on your system, go get it now!</p><p>

Then comes our choice of language. The coreboot and other projects seem to be quite adamant about developing as little as possible in assembly, but I don't see it that way for the two following reasons:</p><ol>
<li>We have no stack after reset but unless we plan on doing non 'panic room' type things, we <b>actually</b> don't have much use for one in the first place. From experience (<a href="https://github.com/pbatard/xtreamerdev/tree/master/rtdsr">with Realtek SoCs</a>) I can tell you that if your 'panic room' needs any form of memory to be initialized to be able to run, and that applies to Cache as RAM, you're not doing it right.</li>
<li>RAM space is infinite. BIOS bootcode blocks aren't. If there's one space you want to optimize it's that 4K or 8K BIOS recovery bootblock that you'll keep <b>and never re-flash</b> at the end of your BIOS. Flash manufacturers are providing features to help with flash recovery - make use of them dammit!!</li>
</ol><p>
Therefore, assembly it is.</p><p>

Now, the one caveat is that the GNU assembler seems to be the only tool still around defaulting to the AT&amp;T syntax which, while arguably more sensible than the intel one, nobody else, and especially not IDA, uses. Instead the intel syntax prevails. While this could have been an annoyance, any recent versions of GNU <code>as</code> also supports the Intel syntax, which can be be switched on in your code with <code>.intel_syntax noprefix</code>. Now that's better!</p><p>

Finally, we know we'll have to follow the following constraints:</p><ol>
<li>First instruction must be located at address <code>4GB-0x10</code> (or <code>FFFF:FFF0</code> if you prefer), and the whole BIOS must reside at the very end of the 32 bit address space. This is an x86 CPU initialization requirement</li>
<li>The processor starts in real address mode on reset. Another x86 reset constraint. Now, some people choose to switch to protected mode as soon as they can (so that they can use C), but we have optimization in mind, so we'll keep real address mode all the way.</li>
<li>The BIOS ROM size must be 512 KB. This time it's a VMware requirement.</li>
<li>We are also supposed to be careful about far jumps in our code, as another x86 boottime constraint. But that won't be an issue for a bootblock section of a few KB, which we plan to locate at the end of the BIOS anyway.</li>
</ol>
<p>

<b>Producing a BIOS ROM</b></p><p>

Now we jump into the gory details at last.</p><p>

Since the reset vector is located at the end of the BIOS, we need to have at least two sections in our sourcecode: one that contains the bulk of our code, which I'll call <code>main</code> and which I'll <b>arbitrarily</b> set to start at 4 KB before the end of the ROM, and another, starting at <code>FFFF:FFF0</code> and going to the end of the ROM, which I'll call <code>reset</code> and whose only purpose will be to jump into our entrypoint in the <code>main</code> section.</p><p>

Below is an example of how one can establish these two sections in the assembly source, as well as the associated GNU <code>ld</code> script that ensures they will be located at the right destination address in the ROM. Because our BIOS is short, I'll use a single <code>bios.S</code> source for the code, and I'll call the <code>ld</code> script <code>bios.ld</code>. Hence <b>bios.S</b>:</p><pre>.section main
init:   &lt;insert useful code here&gt;
        ...

.section reset
        jmp init
        .align 16</pre><p>
NB: the <code>.align 16</code> at the end is there to ensure that the reset section is exactly 16 bytes. This way, we're sure that our <code>reset</code> section will occupy [FFFF:FFF0 - FFFF:FFFF] and we won't have to do extra padding.</p><p>

<b>bios.ld</b>:</p><pre>MEMORY { ROM (rx) : org = 4096M - 512K, len = 512K }
SECTIONS { 
        .main 4096M - 4K    : { *(main) }
        .reset 4096M - 0x10 : { *(reset) }
        }</pre><p>
As you can see above, the ld script simply sets the ROM to be 512 KB in size, located at the end of the 4 GB (=4096M, since GNU <code>ld</code> doesn't know the G suffix yet) and, as indicated, we placed our bootcode segment (<code>main</code>) to start at the last 4 KB block of ROM. <br>
The script should sort out our addresses as we want them then, and once <code>ld</code> has churned through it and produced a new object file (which I'll call <code>bios.out</code>), we should be able to use <code>objcopy</code> with option <code>-j</code> to extract the various binary payloads of interest to us.</p><p>

Now, the problem is that <code>objcopy -j</code> will only extract the payload data. We could of course use a trick like<code>.align 4K-0x10</code> at the end of our main section, but that would mean we'd then have to edit our bootcode size in two separate files when we update it. The smarter approach is to use the <code>--gap-fill</code> option of <code>objcopy</code>, to conveniently fill any gap between sections <code>main</code> and <code>reset</code>.</p><p>

Another problem we face is that the above script only produces the binary data starting with the 4K at the end of the ROM, since the first section we extract (<code>main</code>) starts there. So at most objcopy will create 4 KB of data, far from the 512 KB we actually need. The solution: create a dummy section in our source, which I'll call <code>begin</code> and which I'll also use to put a BIOS ID string, and tell <code>ld</code> either explicitly, or better simply with a <code>&gt;ROM</code> directive (so that we don't have to fill in the ROM size a 3rd time in the script) where it should reside. </p><p>

After that, if we extract the <code>begin</code>, <code>main</code> and <code>reset</code> sections in order, with the <code>--gap-fill</code> option, we should have a 512 KB binary file with everything mapped where it should be. Neat!</p><p>

<p><strong>How Figma and Canva are taking on Adobe—and winning</strong></p>



<p>In 2010, Photoshop was ubiquitous. Whether you were editing a photo, making a poster, or designing a website, it happened in Photoshop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Adobe looks incredibly strong. They’ve had spectacular stock performance, thanks to clear-eyed management who’ve made bold bets that have paid off. Their transition to SaaS has been seamless, for which the public markets have rewarded them handsomely. And they’re historically one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_acquisitions_by_Adobe">best companies at M&amp;A</a>; their product lineup is a testament to their ability to acquire new product lines and integrate them well into their multi-product ecosystem. Perhaps most importantly and least appreciated, they have dramatically sped up the cadence of their internal product development process and feedback loop. Like Microsoft, they have successfully shifted from a legacy company operating on an annual (or longer) release schedule to a truly cloud company shipping updates at a sub-weekly pace.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, there are a few segments of design where they’re no longer the market leader. Companies like Figma, Sketch, and Canva are examples of products that have been able to become top products despite Adobe’s ubiquity in all things design. Figma showed up in Adobe’s annual report for the first time in <a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/79634320000013">2019</a>. They reprised in <a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/79634321000004">2020</a>, and I’m not uncertain they will continue to be in it going forward.</p>



<p>How should we understand these market transitions and why these young companies are able to thrive, even against a strong incumbent like Adobe?</p>



<p>These companies have distinct atomic concepts from Adobe. The primitives that their products are built around are fundamentally different from those of Adobe’s product lineup. It’s these different fundamental atomic concepts that turn Adobe’s advantage of an established product and existing userbase into a weakness that hinders their ability to counter these upstarts. The opportunity for these new atomic concepts to thrive is driven by the new use cases and types of users unearthed during market transitions.</p>



<p>Understanding the phases of market transition and what drives them is a universal process worth examining.</p>



<h2>New use cases: designing for digital</h2>



<p>For most markets, there are advantages to being an incumbent. Markets converge as companies arrive at the preference frontier of customers. This leaves little potential energy for new startups to take advantage of.</p>



<p>Market entropy is good for new entrants.</p>



<p>It’s not impossible to break into a market by brute force, but it’s hard. Very hard. Most successful companies, especially startups, have found tailwinds to harness that help pull them forward.</p>



<p>Changing customer needs are the largest source of entropy in markets. When customer needs rapidly change, there is less advantage in being an incumbent. Instead, legacy companies are left with all the overhead and a product that no longer is what customers want.</p>



<p>There are many causes of changing customer needs. Often there are new and growing segments of customers with different use cases. Existing products may work for them, but they aren’t ideal. The features they care about and how they value them are very different from the customers the legacy company is used to. Companies resist changing core parts of their product for every new use case since it’s costly in work, money, and attention. But every once in a while, what was once a small use case grows into one large enough to support its own company.</p>



<p>Other times the scale or dynamics of a market shift enough to make a product no longer work despite having been a great fit. Companies are often caught flat-footed by these situations because what they have done successfully for years suddenly starts to falter—and they aren’t sure why. Ebay is a good example of this. Their decentralized auction model was very good in a nascent internet economy when there was a scarcity of items being sold online. Once ecommerce became commonplace, price and speed became much more important factors and Ebay’s decentralized model was at a disadvantage. Amazon was much better at building economies of scale in this post-liquidity ecosystem.</p>



<p>Another source is when the customers themselves change. Often the function of a tool remains the same, but the type of user changes. These new types of customers often have different things they care about and resulting product needs.</p>



<p>The internet drove entirely new design use cases. Photoshop was built for editing photos and images. It’s a powerful tool that operates at the pixel level. However, many of these new uses weren’t about image manipulation. Images were a component—not the essence—of the job users were trying to accomplish.</p>



<p>For some users, this was designing digital products. Designers at software companies or any company with a website wanted to create the websites and software products they worked on. This is less about image manipulation and more about designing the UI and UX of these digital products. Vectors are more important than raster graphics. The complexity and process of designing these high-value designs also got increasingly more sophisticated. These designers worked with teams of other designers and non-designers. Their designs are part of a larger product development process and what mattered wasn’t just making a design, but how that the entire process could be improved to make collaboration easier and handoff of designs better. Iteratively.</p>



<p>The complexity of the designs and the components in the resulting code became more complex, too. The need for their tools to have a higher-level understanding of the components and variants became more important. It’s increasingly useful for designs to understand the same concepts and abstraction levels as the HTML and CSS in the resulting end product.</p>



<p>For some users, this was designing content for social platforms, digital ads, or even wedding invitations. These were often made in Photoshop, but again, pixels are the wrong abstraction level. Images are not the sole component; they are just past of a larger design that includes graphics, text, and more. Similarly, the customers are very different. Many of the people now doing what is, in essence, design work don’t think of themselves as designers. They just have a very specific thing they want to create, with the least friction possible.</p>



<p>The internet dramatically scales up the volume and type of new use cases for design. In many ways, this helps Adobe. With platforms like Instagram, the number of people editing photos has expanded by many orders of magnitude. While editing on platforms like Instagram may have increased significantly, Adobe has been a huge beneficiary of the internet and the shift to cloud—and their <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/ADBE:NASDAQ">stock price</a> is a testament to this.</p>



<p><em>[KK Note: Platforms like Instagram strapping editors onto their social platforms and eating into Lightroom from the bottom up is well worth its own discussion. And perhaps someone will convince Mike Krieger to do the definitive piece on that.]</em></p>

But it’s also building new worlds? I’m going to need a refresher on remembering the Andreessen Horowitz talking points</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is even more true in video. There are orders of magnitude more video creators as the ability to record video has become ubiquitous and the platforms where video is the default format have grown. Even more striking, many of the dominant video platforms—like Youtube—are purely distribution focused. They don’t even have any editing capabilities. Instead, companies like Adobe end up being large beneficiaries of this need.</p>



<p><em>[KK Note: Platforms like Youtube still having not built any semblance of an editor into their platform is *also* well worth its own discussion. I’d say we’ll never know what could be, but then I look at TikTok and all is right with the world.]</em></p>



<p>But Adobe hasn’t captured it all. And in many of these new emergent use cases and customer types, Adobe has lost the lead to new startups.</p>



<h2>Tapping into the right level of abstraction</h2>



<p>The best products map to how customers think about their workflow. They match the abstraction level of their customers: not too high that it’s unusable, but not too low that it’s hard to use easily or extend in more complex ways.</p>



<p>They choose the right atomic concepts.</p>



<p>These are the core concepts around which the entire product is built. They not only align with how customers think of their workflow, but often crystallizes for customers how they ought to. Great atomic concepts are honed and then extended and built upon in more complex compounds that…well for lack of a better word…<em>compound</em>.</p>



<p>Similar companies often have slightly different atomic concepts that end up making them meaningfully distinct. Photoshop is focused on pixels and images. Its focus is on editing images and pictures. And its functions operate by transforming them on a pixel level.</p>



<p>Illustrator is similar, but it operates on vectors, not pixels. This is a higher level abstraction. Neither is better or worse, they are just more suited to different use cases. Photoshop is better for modifying images, while illustrator is built for designs where scale-free vectors are best.</p>



<p>Sketch, like Illustrator, is vector based. But is designed for building digital products which means things like operating at a project level. It is not individual designs, but crafting entire products and user interfaces—and the needs for repeatability and consistency inherent to that.</p>



<p>Figma builds on Sketch’s approach, but also includes a greater focus on not just projects but the entire collaborative process as the relevant scope. Similarly, it also treats higher level abstractions like plugins, community, and more as equally important concepts.</p>



<p>Canva is similar to Photoshop and Illustrator, but its users aren’t designers who care about low level tools. Instead Canva’s core atomic concepts are around the different …</p></div></div>

<p>Zhazgul Zuridinova hikes for fun almost every month, but trekking the narrow mountain pass to Zardaly, a remote village near Kyrgyzstan’s southwest border, still makes her anxious. The 12-kilometer trail carved through the barren rocks is unpaved and bridged by wooden planks. One misstep could send her tumbling down the steep cliffs, a fate that has befallen many locals over the years.</p>



<p>“Zardaly is a place that no one goes to,” said Zuridinova, a 28-year-old project manager from Bishkek, the capital. “They don’t have the internet or electricity. While all the world is changing, they’re still living in the past, like a hundred years ago.”</p>



<p>It was Zardaly’s isolation that brought Zuridinova, two colleagues, and a donkey there last November. All three are employees of the Internet Society, a nonprofit that builds community broadband networks and teaches digital literacy around the world. Their aim was to bring the internet to the local school’s dozen students — who had been cut off from education during the coronavirus pandemic — using a tissue-box-sized digital library called Ilimbox.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Ilimbox, whose name translates to “science in a box,” stores 500 books, 250 videos, and 4 million Wikipedia articles in Kyrgyz, Russian, and English. The device is only an interim solution for the lack of an internet connection — a thin facsimile of being online, but it has become a lifeline for students in the most remote areas of Kyrgyzstan, who faced being left behind <a href="https://www.unicef.org/kyrgyzstan/stories/lights-camera-action">when the country moved to e-learning last year</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s a window for a person who wants to access knowledge,” Zuridinova said. “It’s not the door.”</p>



<p>Building internet infrastructure has been a great challenge in Kyrgyzstan, which is further away from an ocean than any other country in the world and is almost entirely mountainous — 94% of the country lies at over 1,000 meters altitude. That makes laying cables expensive and difficult. <a href="https://www.internetworldstats.com/asia.htm#kg">More than 60% of Kyrgyzstan’s population</a> is still not covered by any form of internet, and those with a connection are concentrated in a handful of urban areas.</p>



<p>Talant Sultanov, co-founder of the Internet Society’s Kyrgyzstan chapter, first came across the concept of the “internet-in-a-box” when he attended the 2016 Internet Governance Forum in Mexico. The devices — repositories of downloaded internet content that can be accessed by offline communities — were being used <a href="https://vimeo.com/195038843">to connect indigenous communities in the Yucatán peninsula</a>.</p>



<p>“That’s when it occurred to us that, in Kyrgyzstan, we had a similar situation,” Sultanov said. “And that’s when we decided to also apply this experience in Kyrgyzstan and bring the internet-in-a-box to schools and libraries in remote areas.”</p>



<p>With funding from international organizations and an endorsement from the Ministry of Education, the project team — which most of the time comprised Zuridinova and one other engineer — created an Android app and assembled the boxes using low-cost microcomputers and hard drives. When connected to a power source, the Ilimbox becomes a local Wi-Fi hot spot, which students can use to install the app and download the content stored on the drive. The app also functions as a PDF reader and video player, so there’s no need to download other apps.</p>

<p>Even though there is no data network in rural Kyrgyzstan, many people there have Android smartphones, which are often brought in by Kygrgyz migrant workers living in neighboring countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Choosing content was a challenge. Schools in rural Kyrgyzstan have suffered from a lack of textbooks and other learning materials in the local language. Higher education institutions increasingly prefer to use Russian or English. “[Rural schools] have to share books or get worn-out books, if they’re lucky. And oftentimes they don’t even have that,” Sultanov said. That didn’t give the Internet Society much to work with. “There really wasn’t much to choose from, so we were happy just for any content,” Sultanov said. “We’re beggars, not choosers.”</p>



<p>Wikipedia has been a surprisingly important source of their material. There are currently more than 80,000 articles on the Kyrgyz version of the site, the majority of which were written after 2010 in <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/und-44">an effort </a><a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/und-44">organized</a> <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/und-44">by Kyrgyzstani social worker Chorobek Saadanbekov</a>, who mobilized academics and college students to translate Wikipedia articles from other languages. Saadanbekov said he was motivated by his own experience of growing up in the countryside and receiving education in only Kyrgyz. “And now I have hopes in our country,” he told <em>Rest of World</em>, “that if you only speak Kyrgyz, you can [still] access knowledge.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Between 2017 and early 2020, the Internet Society delivered Ilimboxes to around 100 schools across the country. But the urgency of their efforts increased dramatically last March, when the Covid-19 pandemic forced schools across the country to close. In August, the Ministry of Education announced that, of all public schools in Kyrgyzstan, 2,106 were already connected to the internet, while the state-owned telecommunications company was laying fiber optic cables for 11 more. Twenty schools, however, would be left out, either because they had no electricity or there were plans to resettle villagers in the future.</p>



<p>“When we learned that,” Sultanov said, “we took it as a challenge and a goal — that we should definitely go to these villages first.”</p>



<p>The school in Zardaly was on the list. The village has around 100 families but no electricity, fixed internet, or mobile data. On November 2, Zuridinova and two colleagues arrived at Zardaly after hours of driving and walking. They brought with them an Ilimbox, a big solar panel, some batteries, and two solar-powered streetlamps. The digital library was placed in the primary school, the only public institution in the village, and 11 students between 7 and 12 came to learn how to use it.</p>



<p>Many older students already had a smartphone, but the team had learned in advance that the only girl in the school, Raiana, didn’t. So, two weeks before the trip to Zardaly, they posted a request on Facebook asking if someone could donate a used handset. A woman saw the post, cleaned and repaired her phone, and sent it to the Ilimbox team. “Thank you, sister,” said Raiana, holding the phone and the Ilimbox in a video recorded by Zuridinova. “I took the phone. I will study hard.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Chakmak-Suu, another village on the list, a cell tower put up four years ago offers relatively stable mobile connections. There, Aitunuk Talaibekova, a 15-year-old student, has been able to send homework to her teachers over WhatsApp and conduct searches on Google. However, most of the information she finds online is in Russian.</p>



<p>Because she reads much quicker in Kyrgyz, her native language, she had to use a physical dictionary to translate material she didn’t understand. The Ilimbox, installed in her school in October, gave her access to all the Krygyz language content scattered around the internet and put it in one place.</p>



<p>“Learning has become more interesting for me,” she told <em>Rest of World</em>. “I used Wikipedia to study the biographies of historical figures, authors, and poets, for example, to find their poems that we had in our lessons.” She also uses it to look up textbooks, so she can help her younger siblings with their homework.</p>



<p>With the last of the remote schools connected in November, the Ilimbox team is now planning to expand the program to include Kyrgyzstan’s <a href="https://www.akdn.org/project/bringing-kindergarten-high-pastures">recently created <em>jailoo</em> kindergartens,</a> which allow thousands of children to receive preschool education while they keep an eye on grazing sheep in the pastures. Zuridinova and her colleagues decided to include the jailoos after realizing that the Ilimboxes could work without access to the electrical grid.</p>



<p>Zuridinova says that, the next time they visit Zardaly, she wants to bring the real internet to the village. “We thought about going there to teach [them] how to use Booking.com for tourists, how to use e-commerce websites,” she said. “Not only bringing the internet there, but also teaching [them] how to use it for work, study, and other things.”</p>

	<p>February 9, 2021<span></span></p>
	
	<div><p>My take: it’s an app where you can listen to and sometimes join people having conversations about topics that might interest you. You do this by joining <em>rooms</em>, which are temporary spaces where a conversation is taking place around a certain topic. Rooms have moderators, who can invite speakers on the <em>stage</em>. You can raise your hand if you have something to add to the conversation and the moderator will invite you to the stage at their own discretion.</p><p>I have joined a few rooms, heard some interesting conversations, and in general, it has been fun. <strong>However, has it been <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/clubhouse-audio-social-app-venture-capitalists-hype-during-quarantine-2020-4">$100 million valuation</a> kind-of-fun</strong>? </p><p>I’m not sure.</p><p>My biggest problem: <strong>the current core value experience only works with</strong> <strong>real-time</strong> <strong>interaction/attention.</strong></p><p>My hypothesis is that <strong>Clubhouse is essentially a (user-generated) content network, not a social network.</strong></p><p>It might be a <em>social</em> app, where social interactions happen, but I see very little relationship building happening, which is an essential component of a social network. The nodes in a social network should have the opportunity to independently connect to each other, and have (<em>at least the possibility for</em>) a meaningful interaction.</p></div><figure><img src="https://www.sjurd.com/content/images/2021/02/classic-social-network-1.jpg"></figure><p>In Clubhouse, <strong>meaningful interactions</strong> only occur within rooms and are routed through the people on <em>stage</em>. You can follow someone, also from the audience, but you can’t send them a private message or have any other meaningful interaction with them. I guess you can start a private room and only invite that person, but the bar for that seems extremely high. So in essence, the majority of the nodes in the network can’t connect directly, but are routed through main nodes who are the creators and speakers of the rooms.<br></p><figure><img src="https://www.sjurd.com/content/images/2021/02/Clubhouse-content-network.jpg"></figure><p>Is that a problem? I’m not sure. But I would argue it disqualifies Clubhouse as a social network.</p><div><p>So, if we accept that Clubhouse is just a content network, then it faces a big challenge: <strong>distribution</strong>.</p><p>We have to give credit to how elegantly Clubhouse has solved the content creation problem through user generation: no shortage of people who love to hear themselves talk.</p></div><div><p>But, if you’re not the one doing the talking: what is the value interaction that you can get? </p><p>That’s right. <strong>Listening</strong>. Listening to a meaningful conversation.</p><p>And in Clubhouse, you can only listen<em> live</em>, in real-time, while the room is “alive”.</p><p>This is the core of the problem. Demanding real-time goes against a macro-development in our world: <strong>the move to asynchronous/on-demand delivery. </strong> <br>All other content networks (even TV and radio) have moved or are rapidly moving towards asynchronous and/or on-demand delivery, so that you can enjoy the content in your own time. Netflix, Hulu anyone? As consumers of content we no longer have to schedule our life around our content consumption, e.g. X-files (yeah, I’m that old) only on Tuesday at 10PM. Instead, we decide when we consume it.</p></div><div><p>And in fact, most, if not all other social networks have moved to a similar distribution model. All of the meaningful interactions on Twitter you can enjoy in your own time. A tweet from 18 hours ago, not a problem, here it is. Your experience of that tweet, in most cases, is exactly the same quality, as if you would get it in real-time. Facebook switched to showing relevancy-based content years ago, rather than keeping chronological order. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-time/">On TikTok time does not even exist</a>.</p><p>Clubhouse however demands real-time. And, unlike many other social networks, you can’t just pop-in and out, or scroll through it while paying half-attention to something else, or even while being in a conversation with someone. It demands full attention.</p><p>We can have long discussions on whether or not the move to on-demand and bite-sized content is a positive development, but it does seem to be where the world is going.</p><p>Clubhouse seems completely antithetical to those developments.</p><p>This contrarian move could be a stroke of genius: a move early into a direction that not a lot of people are seeing this going. I’m not a futurist, and healthily skeptical of some new developments, so this wouldn’t be the first, nor the last time that I am completely wrong.</p><p>But my best bet right now is that after the initial excitement wears off, and the scarcity marketing play has run its course, not many people are willing to adjust their life to listen in on the type of conversations we are seeing now. I doubt we will see the average user spending “more than a dozen hours per week”, like Andrew Chen. </p></div><p>Still, without monetization in place, it's difficult to say what is needed to make $100M a good bet. But to me the current model doesn't seem to be it.</p>

<div>

<div>
<p>This module contains the most used types, type aliases, traits and functions that you can import easily as a group:</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>This gives us access to the following: <code>ArrayBase</code>, <code>Array</code>, <code>RcArray</code>, <code>ArrayView</code>, <code>ArrayViewMut</code>, <code>Axis</code>, <code>Dim</code>, <code>Dim</code>, <code>Dimension</code>, <code>Array0</code>, <code>Array1</code>, <code>Array2</code>, <code>Array3</code>, <code>Array4</code>, <code>Array5</code>, <code>Array6</code>, <code>ArrayD</code>, <code>ArrayView0</code>, <code>ArrayView1</code>, <code>ArrayView2</code>, <code>ArrayView3</code>, <code>ArrayView4</code>, <code>ArrayView5</code>, <code>ArrayView6</code>, <code>ArrayViewD</code>, <code>ArrayViewMut0</code>, <code>ArrayViewMut1</code>, <code>ArrayViewMut2</code>, <code>ArrayViewMut3</code>, <code>ArrayViewMut4</code>, <code>ArrayViewMut5</code>, <code>ArrayViewMut6</code>, <code>ArrayViewMutD</code>, <code>Ix0</code>, <code>Ix0</code>, <code>Ix1</code>, <code>Ix1</code>, <code>Ix2</code>, <code>Ix2</code>, <code>Ix3</code>, <code>Ix3</code>, <code>Ix4</code>, <code>Ix4</code>, <code>Ix5</code>, <code>Ix5</code>, <code>Ix6</code>, <code>Ix6</code>, <code>IxDyn</code>, <code>IxDyn</code>, <code>arr0</code>, <code>arr1</code>, <code>arr2</code>, <code>aview0</code>, <code>aview1</code>, <code>aview2</code>, <code>aview_mut1</code>, <code>ShapeBuilder</code>, <code>NdFloat</code>, and <code>AsArray</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction<a href="#Introduction">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>The <code>ndarray</code> crate provides us with a multidimensional container that can contain general or numerical elements. If you're familiar with Python, then you can consider it to be similar to the <code>numpy</code> package. With <code>ndarray</code> we get our $n$-dimensional arrays, slicing, views, mathematical operations, and more. We'll need these in later sections to load in our datasets into containers that we can operate on and conduct our analyses.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>


<div>

<div>
<p>Let's take a look at how we can create a two-dimensional ndarray <code>Array</code> from a <code>Vec</code> with the <code>arr2()</code> function.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>

</div>

</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>It's as easy as that, This has given us a 2 by 3 array with our desired floating point values. We can also use the <code>array!</code> macro as a shorthand for creating an array.</p>

<h2 id="Dimensions">Dimensions<a href="#Dimensions">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>It's often the case that we need to find out the dimensionality of our arrays. There are many ways to do this, and the following contains some of the common approaches.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h3 id="From-Length">From Length<a href="#From-Length">¶</a>
</h3>
<p>We can use <code>Array.len()</code> to return the shape along a single axis.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>This is simple enough if we have a one-dimensional array. However, for higher dimensions, we can see that for a <code>len()</code> returns the flattened length.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>If we want to get the length along one of the axes instead, e.g. the second one, we can use <code>Array.len_of(Axis(n))</code></p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<div>
<h3 id="From-Shape">From Shape<a href="#From-Shape">¶</a>
</h3>
<p>Another approach is to use <code>Array.shape()</code> which returns more information.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>We can see it has returned an array that indicates the length along all of our axes. This can be indexed to get the length along a specific axis.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div>

<div>
<p>Like most data structures, the indexing starts at $0$. To access the first element in our one-dimensional arrays we can do the following.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>For higher dimensions, we need to use a primitive array.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>Likewise, to access the second element in our one-dimensional arrays we need to index with $1$.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>Again, for our higher dimensions, we use a primitive array..</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>To select the last element in our one-dimensional arrays we can index with <code>Array.len() -1</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>Let's look at some common mathematical operations that can operate on our arrays.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>All elements in an array can be summed with <code>sum()</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>We may instead wish to sum all elements along a specific axis in an array, e.g. the first axis.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>In&nbsp;[22]:</p>
<div>
    <div>
<div><pre><span></span><span>data_2D</span><span>.</span><span>sum_axis</span><span>(</span><span>Axis</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>))</span><span></span></pre></div>

    </div>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<div>


<div>

    <p>Out[22]:</p>




<div>
<pre>[5.0, 7.0, 9.0], shape=[3], strides=[1], layout=CF (0x3), const ndim=1</pre>
</div>

</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>

<div>
<div>
<p>In&nbsp;[23]:</p>
<div>
    <div>
<div><pre><span></span><span>data_2D</span><span>.</span><span>sum_axis</span><span>(</span><span>Axis</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>))</span><span></span></pre></div>

    </div>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<div>


<div>

    <p>Out[23]:</p>




<div>
<pre>[6.0, 15.0], shape=[2], strides=[1], layout=CF (0x3), const ndim=1</pre>
</div>

</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>It's quite common to apply mathematical operations to each element of an array. Let's have a look at some examples.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>We can add values, e.g. $1.0$, to every element.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>


<div>
<div>


<div>

    <p>Out[24]:</p>




<div>
<pre>[[2.0, 3.0, 4.0],
 [5.0, 6.0, 7.0]], shape=[2, 3], strides=[3, 1], layout=C (0x1), const ndim=2</pre>
</div>

</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>We can also add the elements of one array to another.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>


<div>
<div>


<div>

    <p>Out[25]:</p>




<div>
<pre>[[2.0, 4.0, 6.0],
 [8.0, 10.0, 12.0]], shape=[2, 3], strides=[3, 1], layout=C (0x1), const ndim=2</pre>
</div>

</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>Finally, we can add a one-dimensional array to a two-dimensional array.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>


<div>
<div>


<div>

    <p>Out[26]:</p>




<div>
<pre>[[2.0, 4.0, 6.0],
 [5.0, 7.0, 9.0]], shape=[2, 3], strides=[3, 1], layout=C (0x1), const ndim=2</pre>
</div>

</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Warning</p>
<p>When summing two arrays together they don't need to have the same shape, but their shapes must be compatible. This means we should be able to broadcast one array across another, i.e. they must be identical in the size of at least one dimension.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>We can subtract values, e.g. $1.0$, from every element.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>


<div>
<div>


<div>

    <p>Out[27]:</p>




<div>
<pre>[[0.0, 1.0, 2.0],
 [3.0, 4.0, 5.0]], shape=[2, 3], strides=[3, 1], layout=C (0x1), const ndim=2</pre>

</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>We can also subtract elements of one array from another.</p>

</div>

</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>We can multiply every element by a value, e.g. by $2.0$.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>If you turn to</strong> great works in moral philosophy to find out when complaining is permissible, youâ€™ll get a â€˜neverâ€™. Complaining is not recommended by philosophers. Many <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/a-duty-to-resist-9780190872199?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">defend</a> political protest, and some <a href="https://profilebooks.com/work/complaint/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">defend</a> the â€˜constructive complainingâ€™ that contributes to making the world better, but ordinary griping about subjective pains should never be done. It doesnâ€™t change anything, or so the argument goes.</p>
<p>I disagree with most philosophers (although Iâ€™m not alone), and I defend the form of complaining thatâ€™s not seen as productive. I suspect that our reports of our pains can be more socially beneficial, even more morally generous, than naysayers think. Of course, not all complaints are equal and not all contexts are great. Complaining <em>well</em> is a complex skill, to be exercised more than never and less than excessively.</p>
<p>When I said this in an <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/sunday/the-sunday-edition-for-october-27-2019-1.5335017/how-complaining-can-actually-bring-us-closer-together-1.5335023?x-eu-country=false" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">interview</a>, the host described people who reply to the most casual â€˜How are you?â€™ with a catalogue of their pains as â€˜a menaceâ€™. I had to laugh. Complaining can be thoughtless, and it can be unwelcome. But complaining can also be thoughtful. At times itâ€™s so useful to a situation that I describe it as an <em>affective duty</em>. That means that there are times when we ought to be sensitive and attuned to the emotional environment and offer a complaint as a way of offering an opportunity for solidarity. You ought not to act as if no one has anything in common with you and, instead, you ought to extend your vulnerability and say: â€˜Let us share it.â€™</p>
<p>To observe the duty to complain, we need skills of complaining well. And to do any skill excellently, we need to practise, so that we know what occasions call for complaining. Such occasions include times when you think you could help someone else and invite them to complain because you think they need to. My journal <a href="https://philarchive.org/archive/NORCC-2v1" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">article</a> â€˜Canâ€™t Complainâ€™ (2018) includes the example of two coworkers plodding from opposite directions in a cold rain. They step inside, shivering, and one says: â€˜Awful weather weâ€™re having!â€™ The point is to open that interpersonal door so that the other person feels free to complain. It is friendly but, more importantly, itâ€™s a recognition that someone might need to disclose that theyâ€™re uncomfortable or vulnerable, if only to the weather. Some might refrain from complaining merely because theyâ€™re polite, but they might also refrain because they donâ€™t think youâ€™ll agree. Offering the opening complaint is a way of indicating that youâ€™ll agree. Itâ€™s <a href="http://www.blackwellpublishing.co.uk/content/hewstonesocialpsychology/chapters/chapter9.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">prosocial</a>.</p>
<p>If you complain and no one affirms you, youâ€™ll feel worse</p>
<p>This affective duty can also be towards oneself â€“ a duty to complain so that weâ€™re not misrepresenting ourselves. We donâ€™t associate quotidian gripes with authenticity, but letting people know that youâ€™re not perfect, that you, too, suffer from some things that others might be suffering from, can indicate a healthy self-awareness. In complaining well, weâ€™re both honest about who we are and helpful to other people who might need to know that theyâ€™re not alone. It might take personal courage to admit that one is in pain or vulnerable, but itâ€™s important to our own wellbeing to find that weâ€™re not alone.</p>
<p><strong>Of course, complaining excessively</strong> or inaptly risks making others worse off instead of binding us together. Everyone knows someone who complains <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300209747/complaining-teasing-and-other-annoying-behaviors" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">too much</a>. And because we all know someone who complains too much, it seems obvious that complaining to excess is bad. It can <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jclp.10095" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">effect</a> a kind of mood contagion where your complaint brings other people down rather than allowing them to help you. And in some roles, people depend on us to be the recipients of complaining and to not return the feelings in kind. So the good life requires complaining to the right people, in the right amounts, for the right reasons.</p>
<p>That sounds like Iâ€™m saying complaining is a virtue but, at best, itâ€™s what the philosopher Lisa Tessman <a href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0195179145.001.0001/acprof-9780195179149?rskey=80wv7b&amp;result=1" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">called</a> a â€˜burdened virtue<em>â€™</em>. In an ideal society, you wouldnâ€™t have to complain much because there wouldnâ€™t be much to complain about â€“ weâ€™d all be healthy, happy and well-supported. Instead of being a virtue, complaining is more like the skill of people who are really successful at sociality, who know when to share themselves, when to help others, and when to contribute to a relationship.</p>
<p>It is, by nature, risky. Psychological <a href="http://journals.pan.pl/Content/107612/PDF/38.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">research</a> suggests that if you complain and someone confirms your complaint â€“ not agrees with you, just acknowledges (â€˜That sounds hard; you sound like youâ€™re sufferingâ€™) â€“ then that affirmation lifts your mood higher than it was before you complained. But if someone doesnâ€™t affirm you, your mood is lower than ever. Itâ€™s bad news that, if you complain and no one affirms you, youâ€™ll feel worse. But it reveals the times when complaining is better â€“ that is, when you have reason to believe that thereâ€™s an opportunity for someone to affirm you.</p>
<p>Complaining helps ameliorate isolation and helps people bond. It reduces our loneliness and reveals us to each other in a way that can build relationships. I worry that social structures and workplaces are often set up to isolate us. I worry about students of mine who go into service professions and jobs with high risk of burnout ceasing to care about other people. Employers canâ€™t help but prefer that weâ€™re without complaints. Better that we show up every day, never miss work, and never give in to our feelings when weâ€™re caring for the vulnerable or trying to sell something or trying to conduct business. But I think the fact that our workplaces tend toward, intentionally or not, exploiting and isolating workers is all the more reason to make a space for telling each other that sometimes itâ€™s important to complain â€“ not just to make the workplace better, but to build relationships in workplaces where we can trust each other to understand when weâ€™re having a bad day.</p>
<p>If someone apologises for complaining, theyâ€™re saying, implicitly, that their listener shouldnâ€™t complain in turn</p>
<p><strong>All the topics I</strong> write on ultimately return to the same fact: we live in a nonideal world. It would be hard to describe many people as so powerful that they have nothing to complain about. Most people are simply in differently constrained positions and, when they share similar positions, complaining gets them together â€“ not to make the world a better place, but to help each other bear up under it better.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s the job of ethics, the job of life â€“ to be happy anyway because we have robust capacities for happiness. We just have to figure out how to exercise them in a nonideal world. The â€˜Likeâ€™ button on social media platforms took off in part for this reason, that we are so unconsciously searching for affirmation, so naturally hungry for it. And the more we work remotely, or precariously, the more we commute, or see no one at all, the less chance we have to get affirmation of how we feel.</p>
<p>I would be remiss not to note that there are ways to complain badly, even when turning to people as friends whom you think you can trust with a complaint. One mistake is to include an apology for complaining in every complaint. At moments when you need to contribute to your relationship or disclose your pain, routinely apologising for complaining is not skilful. Doing so implies that we all agree that complaining is bad. But if someone apologises for complaining, theyâ€™re saying, implicitly, that their listener shouldnâ€™t complain in turn. Thatâ€™s going to continue to maintain a culture that says none of us should be complaining. I worry for people I know who start complaints on social media with the statement that they know other people are worse off, <em>but</em>â€¦ I want to encourage people to recognise that no oneâ€™s life is free of suffering. No one is untouched by trouble, and therefore everybody gets to complain a little. We should help each other be vulnerable together. Weâ€™re stronger together, even when we feel like weâ€™re not strong.</p>
<p>Skilled affirmation takes practice. This means developing a friendship on purpose, where you say: â€˜I believe that you are someone I can trust and to whom I can occasionally complain.â€™ We tend not to think of developing friendships as a practice. But, as Aristotle says, friendships are like good habits: they bear cultivating. For example, social media helped me deliberately enter some small, close-friend networks where we agree to check in with each other regularly, ask each other how weâ€™re doing, and give each other honest answers.</p>
<p>I know social media doesnâ€™t always seem to encourage that because so much of it is pictorial. What it encourages is putting up the best possible photos of yourself, your family, and your dog. But we need this other thing, too â€“ and weâ€™re bad at it, so we ought to practise it all the more. So consider some skill-building homework: find a trusty person and tell them explicitly: â€˜I want you to hear a complaint of mine and just let me know if you share it.â€™ Build that trust network, one person at a time, and try to start complaining excellently.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>There are many kinds</strong> of pseudosciences: astrology, homeopathy, flat-Earthism, anti-vaxx. These â€˜fieldsâ€™ traffic in bizarre claims with scientific pretensions. On a surface level, these claims <em>seem</em> to be scientific and usually appear to comment on the same kind of things that science does. However, upon closer inspection, pseudoscience is revealed to be <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/why-bullshit-is-no-laughing-matter" rel="noopener">bullshit</a>: it is indifferent to the truth. Analogous to pseudoscience, can there be such a thing as pseudophilosophy, in which one makes claims with philosophical pretensions which on closer inspection turn out to be bullshit? I think there is.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s begin with the concept of pseudophilosophy. If there is something deserving of that name, then it would be deficient with respect to philosophical issues in the same way that pseudoscience is deficient with respect to scientific issues. So, in order to get a grip on pseudophilosophy, we should first <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/theo.12271" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">look</a> more closely at the way in which pseudoscience is deficient, and then see whether we can find something analogous in the philosophical domain.</p>
<p>What makes pseudoscientific beliefs deficient is that theyâ€™re formed in an <em>epistemically unconscientious</em> way. Thatâ€™s to say, these beliefs are made from culpably confused and uninformed reasoning. For example, the belief that the Earth is flat can be sustained only by self-willed disregard of the massive amounts of evidence to the contrary, accumulated over several centuries by several different sciences.</p>
<p>However, such unconscientiousness doesnâ€™t presuppose insincerity or charlatanry. A charlatan is someone who has a hidden, usually profit-seeking, agenda and who is fundamentally indifferent to whether their beliefs are true. Often bullshit is produced without such insincerity, however, since one can <em>care</em> about the truth of oneâ€™s beliefs without <em>taking care</em> with respect to it.</p>
<p>A problem is that most of us are lacking in epistemic conscientiousness, at least sometimes and to some extent. In order for something to count as pseudoscience, some minimal degree of unconscientiousness is therefore required. A good rule of thumb for being conscientious is to keep an eye out for classical fallacies such as <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/how-ad-hominem-arguments-can-demolish-appeals-to-authority" rel="noopener">ad hominem</a>, straw man, false dilemma and cherry-picking. Such fallacies occur in all kinds of contexts, but in pseudoscience they occur more systematically.</p>
<p>Whether there is a God or whether there are objective moral truths have to be answered largely via a priori reflection, if at all</p>
<p>Epistemic unconscientiousness is an essential but not exhaustive component of pseudoscience. To count as pseudoscientific, a belief must also be about some scientific issue, and this is precisely where pseudoscience and pseudophilosophy differ. Just like pseudoscience, pseudophilosophy is defined by a lack of epistemic conscientiousness, but its subject matter is philosophical rather than scientific.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, the difference between scientific and philosophical issues is that the latter arenâ€™t in any straightforward way resolvable via empirical investigation. Whether there is a God, for example, or whether there are objective moral truths, are questions that have to be answered largely via a priori reflection, if at all. These questions are thus different from questions such as whether the Earth is flat or spherical, or whether anthrax is caused by bacteria, which do have empirically accessible answers.</p>
<p><strong>There are two kinds of</strong> pseudophilosophy, one mostly harmless and the other insidious. The first variety is usually found in popular scientific contexts. This is where writers, typically with a background in the natural sciences, walk self-confidently into philosophical territory without realising it, and without conscientious attention to relevant philosophical distinctions and arguments. Often implicit empiricist assumptions in epistemology, metaphysics and the philosophy of language are relied upon as if they were self-evident, and without awareness of the threat that those very assumptions pose to the authorâ€™s own reasoning. We can call this phenomenon scientistic pseudophilosophy.</p>
<p>An illustrative example is Sam Harrisâ€™s <a href="https://samharris.org/books/the-moral-landscape/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">book</a> <em>The Moral Landscape</em> (2010), in which straw men are lined up due to Harrisâ€™s failure to grasp the content of many of the philosophical claims and arguments that he criticises, such as Humeâ€™s law (or the is/ought problem) and <span>G E Mooreâ€™s</span> open-question argument (ie, that no moral property is identical to a natural property). Similarly, in <em>A Universe from Nothing</em> (2012), Lawrence Krauss engages with philosophical arguments for theism without understanding them properly. Most saliently, he ends up criticising a caricature version of the so-called cosmological argument about the existence of God.</p>
<p>Usually, the prose is infused with arcane terminology and learned jargon, creating an aura of scholarly profundity</p>
<p>The insidious kind of pseudophilosophy, which I will focus on here, is an academic enterprise, pursued primarily within the humanities and social sciences. I donâ€™t mean to suggest that the disciplines in question are <em>inherently</em> pseudophilosophical, only that, for some reason, a whole lot of pseudophilosophy goes on within them (although this will vary greatly between different universities and departments). Often philosophical issues are raised concerning knowledge, truth, objectivity, rationality and scientific methodology, and, again, without conscientious attention to relevant philosophical distinctions and arguments. A characteristic trait is a deferential attitude toward some supposedly great continental European thinker or thinkers, such as <span>G W F Hegel,</span> Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Martin Heidegger or Jean-Paul Sartre (who might or might not have themselves been guilty of pseudophilosophy). Usually, the prose is infused with arcane terminology and learned jargon, creating an aura of scholarly profundity. We can <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/theo.12047" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">call</a> this phenomenon obscurantist pseudophilosophy.</p>
<p>While pseudoscience is particularly prone to causal fallacies and cherry-picking of data, the most common fallacy in obscurantist pseudophilosophy is equivocation. This fallacy <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0392192112444984" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">exploits</a> ambiguities in certain key terms, where plausible but trivial claims lend apparent credibility to interesting but controversial ones. When challenged, the obscurantist will typically retreat to the safe house provided by the trivial interpretation of his claims, only to reoccupy the controversial ground once the critic has left the scene.</p>
<p>Let me <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9973.2005.00370.x" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">illustrate</a> how this works, focusing on <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-foucaults-work-on-power-is-more-important-than-ever" rel="noopener">Michel Foucault</a>, one of the central figures of French postmodernism. A central theme in Foucaultâ€™s writings is a critique of the notion of objective truth. Although there are controversies about interpretation, at least on the face of it Foucault maintains that truth is socially constructed and subject to ideological influence, and therefore not objective. However, his arguments for this claim focus entirely on the way in which what is assumed or believed to be true is influenced by what he refers to as â€˜powerâ€™. It is, of course, a plausible claim that our assumptions or beliefs are susceptible to ideological influence, especially in emotionally charged areas such as politics, but also in supposedly rational areas such as science. But Foucault doesnâ€™t explain how this rather mundane observation is supposed to imply or support the philosophically controversial claim that what is true, or which facts obtain (concerning the shape of the Earth, for example), is susceptible to ideological influence. Instead, by using the word â€˜truthâ€™ in an impressionistic fashion, the distinction between belief and truth is smudged over, allowing Foucault to make seemingly profound statements such as:</p>
<blockquote>[T]ruth isnâ€™t outside power, or lacking in power: contrary to a myth whose history and functions would repay further study, truth isnâ€™t the reward of free spirits, the child of protracted solitude, nor the privilege of those who have succeeded in liberating themselves. Truth is a thing of this world: it is produced only by virtue of multiple forms of constraint.</blockquote>
<p>I leave it as an exercise to the reader to disambiguate this statement and see what remains.</p>
<p>This kind of fallacious critique of the notion of objective truth is a particularly pernicious aspect of obscurantist pseudophilosophy in general. Often, itâ€™s due to simple misunderstandings (such as confusing truth with belief or knowledge), but sometimes itâ€™s due rather to wilful obscurity (as in the case of Foucault).</p>
<p>Perhaps due to its aura of academic legitimacy and profundity, obscurantist pseudophilosophy is often used to give credence to dogmatic and bellicose political agendas, both on the Left and on the Right. Beyond that, it encourages confused and self-indulgent thinking in university students, and consumes vast resources that could be put to better use.</p>
<p>While pseudoscience can perhaps be counteracted by science education, the cure for pseudophilosophy is not science education but philosophical education. More specifically, it is a matter of developing the kind of basic critical thinking skills that are taught to undergraduates in philosophy. This doesnâ€™t need to be anything fancy. Students should be taught things like learning to distinguish in a disciplined way between central philosophical concepts such as belief, truth, rationality and knowledge. They should be aware of the way ambiguities can be exploited by equivocating arguments, and become adept at how to spot other fallacies such as ad hominem and straw man. With these fundamental tools in hand, there would be a good deal less pseudophilosophy going around.</p></div></div></div>]]>

February 9, 2021 | https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/introduction.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/introduction.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><nav id="sidebar" aria-label="Table of contents"></nav><div id="page-wrapper"><div class="page"><div id="content"><main><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Wikipedia</a> does a great job of describing about Python in a few words. So, I'll just copy-paste relevant information here:</p><blockquote><p>Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.</p><p>Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p><p>As of December 2020 Python ranked third in TIOBE’s index of most popular programming languages, behind <code>C</code> and <code>Java</code>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/info.svg" alt="info"> See also <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html">docs.python: General Python FAQ</a> for answers to questions like "What is Python?", "What is Python good for?", "Why is it called Python?", etc.</p></blockquote><h2><a href="#installation" id="installation">Installation</a></h2><p>On modern Linux distributions, you are likely to find Python already installed. It may be a few versions behind, but should work just fine for most of the topics covered in this book. To get the exact version used here, visit <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python downloads page</a> and install using the appropriate source for your operating system. Should you face any issues in installing, search online for a solution. Yes, that is something I expect you should be able to do as a prerequisite for this book, i.e. you should have prior experience with basic programming and computer usage.</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/info.svg" alt="info"> See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/index.html">docs.python: What's New</a> to track changes across versions. As mentioned in the Preface chapter, <strong>3.9.0</strong> is the version used in this book.</p></blockquote><h2><a href="#online-tools" id="online-tools">Online tools</a></h2><p>In case you are facing installation issues, or do not want to (or cannot) install Python on your computer for some reason, there are plenty of options to execute Python programs using online tools. Some of the popular ones are listed below:</p><ul><li><a href="https://repl.it/languages/python3">Repl.it</a> — Interactive playground. Code, collaborate, compile, run, share, and deploy Python and more online from your browser</li><li><a href="http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit">Pythontutor</a> — Visualize code execution, also has example codes and ability to share sessions</li><li><a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/">PythonAnywhere</a> — Host, run, and code Python in the cloud</li></ul><p>The <a href="https://www.python.org/">offical Python website</a> also has a <em>Launch Interactive Shell</em> option (<a href="https://www.python.org/shell/">https://www.python.org/shell/</a>), which gives access to a REPL session.</p><h2><a href="#first-program" id="first-program">First program</a></h2><p>It is customary to start learning a new programming language by printing a simple phrase. Create a new directory, say <code>Python/programs</code> for this book. Then, create a plain text file named <code>hello.py</code> with your favorite text editor and type the following piece of code.</p><pre><code># hello.py
print('*************')
print('Hello there!')
print('*************')
</code></pre><p>If you are familiar with using command line on a Unix-like system, run the script as shown below. Other options to execute a Python program will be discussed in the next section.</p><pre><code>$ python3.9 hello.py
*************
Hello there!
*************
</code></pre><p>A few things to note here. The first line is a comment, used here to indicate the name of the Python program. <code>print()</code> is a built-in function, which can be used without having to load some library. A single string argument has been used for each of the three invocations. <code>print()</code> automatically appends a newline character by default. The program ran without a compilation step. As quoted earlier, Python is an <em>interpreted</em> language. More details will be discussed in later chapters.</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/info.svg" alt="info"> All the Python programs discussed in this book, along with related text files, can be accessed from my GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/learnbyexample/100_page_python_intro/tree/main/programs">learnbyexample: 100_page_python_intro</a>. However, I highly recommend typing the programs manually by yourself.</p></blockquote><h2><a href="#ide-and-text-editors" id="ide-and-text-editors">IDE and text editors</a></h2><p>An <strong>integrated development environment</strong> (IDE) might suit you better if you are not comfortable with the command line. IDE provides features likes debugging, syntax highlighting, autocompletion, code refactoring and so on. They also help in setting up <strong>virtual environment</strong> to manage different versions of Python and modules (more on that later).</p><p>If you install Python on Windows, it will automatically include <strong>IDLE</strong>, an IDE built using Python's <code>tkinter</code> module. On Linux, see if you already have the program <code>idle3.9</code>. Otherwise you may have to install it separately, for example, <code>sudo apt install idle-python3.9</code> on Ubuntu.</p><p>When you open IDLE, you'll get a Python shell (discussed in the next section). For now, click the <strong>New File</strong> option under <strong>File</strong> menu to open a text editor. Type the short program <code>hello.py</code> discussed in the previous section. After saving the code, press <strong>F5</strong> to run it. You'll see the results in the shell window.</p><p>Screenshots from the text editor and the Python shell are shown below.</p><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/hello.png" alt="hello.py program on IDLE editor"></p><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/Python_shell_run.png" alt="Python shell example with output from an executed program"></p><p>Popular alternatives to IDLE are listed below:</p><ul><li><a href="https://thonny.org/">Thonny</a> — Python IDE for beginners, lots of handy features like viewing variables, debugger, step through, highlight syntax errors, name completion, etc</li><li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">Pycharm</a> — smart code completion, code inspections, on-the-fly error highlighting and quick-fixes, automated code refactorings, rich navigation capabilities, support for frameworks, etc</li><li><a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/">Spyder</a> — typically used for scientific computing</li><li><a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> — web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text</li><li><a href="https://vscodium.com/">VSCodium</a> — community-driven, freely-licensed binary distribution of VSCode</li><li><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">Vim</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, <a href="https://www.geany.org/">Geany</a>, <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit">Gedit</a> — text editors with support for syntax highlighting and more</li></ul><h2><a href="#repl" id="repl">REPL</a></h2><p>One of the best features of Python is the interactive shell. Such shells are also referred to as REPL, which is an abbreviation for <strong>R</strong>ead <strong>E</strong>valuate <strong>P</strong>rint <strong>L</strong>oop. The Python REPL makes it easy for beginners to try out code snippets for learning purposes. Beyond learning, it is also useful for developing a program in small steps, debugging a large program by trying out few lines of code at a time and so on. REPL will be used frequently in this book to show code snippets.</p><p>When you launch Python from the command line, or open IDLE, you get a shell that is ready for user input after the <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt.</p><pre><code>$ python3.9
Python 3.9.0 (default, Dec  2 2020, 10:42:13) 
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre><p>Try the below instructions. The first one displays a greeting using the <code>print()</code> function. Then, a user defined variable is used to store a string value. To display the value, you can either use <code>print()</code> again or just type the variable name. Expression results are immediately displayed in the shell. Name of a variable by itself is a valid expression. This behavior is unique to the REPL and an expression by itself won't display anything when used inside a script.</p><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print('have a nice day')
have a nice day

&gt;&gt;&gt; username = 'learnbyexample'
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(username)
learnbyexample

# use # to start a single line comment
# note that string representation is shown instead of actual value
# details will be discussed later
&gt;&gt;&gt; username
'learnbyexample'

# use exit() to close the shell, can also use Ctrl+D shortcut
&gt;&gt;&gt; exit()
</code></pre><p>I'll stress again the importance of following along the code snippets by manually typing them on your computer. Programming requires hands-on experience too, reading alone isn't enough. As an analogy, can you learn to drive a car by just reading about it? Since one of the prerequisite is that you should already be familiar with programming basics, I'll extend the analogy to learning to drive a different car model. Or, perhaps a different vehicle such as a truck or a bus might be more appropriate here.</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/info.svg" alt="info"> Depending on the command line shell you are using, you might have the <code>readline</code> library that makes it easier to use the REPL. For example, <code>up</code> and <code>down</code> arrow keys to browse code history, re-execute them (after editing if necessary), search history, autocomplete based on first few characters and so on. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Readline">wikipedia: GNU readline</a> and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/readline">wiki.archlinux: readline</a> for more information.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/info.svg" alt="info"> You can use <code>python3.9 -q</code> to avoid <em>version and copyright messages</em> when you start an interactive shell. Use <code>python3.9 -h</code> or visit <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html">docs.python: Command line and environment</a> for documentation on cli options.</p></blockquote><h2><a href="#documentation-and-getting-help" id="documentation-and-getting-help">Documentation and getting help</a></h2><p>The offical Python website has an extensive documentation located at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/">https://docs.python.org/3/</a>. This includes a tutorial, which is much more comprehensive than the contents presented in this book, several guides for specific modules like <code>re</code> and <code>argparse</code> and various other information.</p><p>Here's a couple of annotated screenshots:</p><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/py_docs_1.png" alt="Python documentation: part 1"></p><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/py_docs_2.png" alt="Python documentation: part 2"></p><p>Python provides a <code>help()</code> function, which is quite handy to use from the REPL. If you type <code>help(print)</code> and press the Enter key, you'll get a screen as shown below. If you are using IDLE, the output would be displayed on the same screen. Otherwise, the content might be shown on a different screen depending on your <code>pager</code> settings. Typically, pressing the <code>q</code> key will quit the <code>pager</code> and get you back to the shell.</p><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/help_print.png" alt="help print"></p><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/info.svg" alt="info"> Quotes are necessary, for example <code>help('import')</code> and <code>help('del')</code>, if the topic you are looking for isn't an object.</p></blockquote><p>If you get stuck with a problem, there are several ways to get it resolved. For example:</p><ol><li>read/search for that particular topic from documentation/books/tutorials/etc</li><li>reduce the code as much as possible so that you are left with minimal code necessary to reproduce the issue</li><li>talk about the problem with a friend/colleague/inanimate-objects/etc (see <a href="https://rubberduckdebugging.com/">Rubber duck debugging</a>)</li><li>search about the problem online</li></ol><p>You can also ask for help on forums.

What would we find if we opened the safe of this tiny State located in the heart of the European Union, listed by many researchers in the world’s top&nbsp;5 tax havens&nbsp;? The OpenLux investigation, conducted by <em>Le Monde</em> along with ten media partners for more than a year, provides answers&nbsp;: 55,000&nbsp;offshore companies managing assets worth at least 6&nbsp;trillion euros.</p>          <p>These phantom companies without offices or employees were created by billionaires, multinationals, sportsmen, artists, high-ranking politicians and even royal families. Luxembourg acts as a magnet for the wealth of the world&nbsp;: in a territory of 2,586&nbsp;km2, Tiger Woods and Cristiano Ronaldo rub shoulders with Shakira and the King of Bahrain. Hundreds of multinationals (LVMH, Kering, Altice, Pfizer, Amazon…) have opened financial subsidiaries. Wealthy families increase their real estate assets there.</p>            <p>More surprisingly, OpenLux reveals that questionable funds, suspected of originating in criminal activity or linked to criminals targeted by judicial investigations, have been concealed in Luxembourg. This is the case of companies linked to the Italian Mafia, the’Ndrangheta, and the Russian underworld. The League, Italy’s far-right party, has hidden a secret fund which is sought by the Italian authorities. People close to the Venezuelan regime have recycled corrupt government procurement funds.</p>          <p>To conduct this investigation, <em>Le Monde </em>has compiled a huge database that lists the beneficiaries of the 124.000&nbsp;commercial companies registered in Luxembourg, i.e. their true owners, along with 3.3&nbsp;million administrative acts and financial reports. These are documents that have recently been made public, but are only available on the Luxembourg trade register website. <em>Le Monde </em>was able to extract them in their entirety for analysis, in partnership with the <em>Suddeutsche</em> <em>Zeitung </em>in Germany, <em>Le Soir</em> in Belgium, McClatchy in the United States, Woxx in Luxembourg, <em>IrpiMedia</em> in Italy, and the OCCRP Consortium of investigative journalists.</p>          <h2>157 nationalities represented</h2>          <p>These investigations confirm that the Grand Duchy is, contrary to what the Luxembourg authorities claim, a veritable offshore centre, halfway between the City of London and the British Virgin Islands. Nearly 90&nbsp;% of its <em>«&nbsp;companies&nbsp;»</em> are controlled by non-Luxembourgers. Among the 157&nbsp;nationalities represented in this amazing <em>«&nbsp;Who’s who&nbsp;»</em>, the French stand out&nbsp;: they head the list with, in total, more than 17.000 companies<strong>.</strong></p>            <p>What they house is surprising&nbsp;: valuable property, here a castle near Paris owned by a Saudi prince, there a vineyard in Provence owned by Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, and an endless list of villas on the French Riviera and well-appointed Parisian apartments. But also flagships of the French economy, such as Yves Rocher, Chanel, JCDecaux and Decathlon. It’s almost as if Luxembourg owned small pieces of France.</p>                     <p>The case of France is not isolated&nbsp;: it is also through Luxembourg companies that some investment funds buy whole swathes of cities such as Berlin and London, causing real estate prices to rocket without being identifiable or paying taxes. The list of international assets held in Luxembourg is a gigantic inventory, including luxurious residences, chalets, yachts, helicopters, private jets and big planes, music catalogues, the rights to images, works of art, in short, the list is endless.</p>          <p>In total, as confirmed by the list of 64,458&nbsp;beneficiaries identified by OpenLux&nbsp;: the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg concentrates a large part of the world’s wealth. It is home to at least 279 of the more than 2,000&nbsp;billionaires listed by <em>Forbes</em> magazine. But also 37 of the 50&nbsp;wealthiest French families, such as the Mulliez, Guerrand-Hermès and Bernard Arnault, who structure their group, their assets and their investments through dozens of Luxembourg holding companies.</p>          <h2>A prime location for tax planning</h2>          <p>There are various reasons for choosing Luxembourg&nbsp;: a central position in the European Union, high-quality financial engineering, financial regulations tailored to business, direct access to the country’s institutions, and political stability. But let there be no mistake&nbsp;: the first reasons are taxation and discretion. They are the result of political choices dating back to the time of former Prime Minister, Jean-Claude Juncker (1995-2013), who later became President of the European Commission.</p>            <p>Luxembourg has certainly turned its back on its former tax rescripts, these ultra- advantageous arrangements granted to large multinationals, following the revelations on the subject in 2014 by the <em>«&nbsp;LuxLeaks&nbsp;»</em> investigation. But it remains a hotbed of tax planning for companies and wealthy individuals through preferential tax regimes. This encourages, in some cases, abuse and, possibly, fraud.</p>          <p>The scale of the financial centre is such that the Grand Duchy seems, moreover, insufficiently equipped to guarantee effective control over all the flows it handles. Its services seem to be more calibrated to the size of the country than to its offshore activity. The trade register has only 59&nbsp;employees to enforce the legal obligation to declare the actual beneficiaries of more than 100.000&nbsp;entities and to carry out an initial control of the declarations. The Financial Sector Supervisory Commission (CSSF) has only 900 employees, even though the financial sector accounts for a quarter of the country’s economy.</p>          <p>Of course, Luxembourg is not the only country to have entered the race for the lowest tax bill. But this is the first time that an investigation has exhaustively documented the phenomenon, through the analysis of the microeconomic fabric of a State.</p>          <blockquote> <p>The many flaws discovered by the OpenLux investigation question the ability of States to effectively monitor their financial ecosystem</p> </blockquote>         <p>This truth operation would not have been possible without a directive voted by the European Union in 2018, which required the creation of public registers of the real owners of companies in all member states. This historic reform came after a decade of financial scandals, culminating in the <em>«&nbsp;Panama papers&nbsp;»</em> in 2016, that revealed the extent of the role played by opaque companies and offshore arrangements in laundering criminal activities, including tax fraud. A decade in which at the same time anti-corruption judges and tax authorities saw their investigations coming up against front companies and front men.</p>            <p>Luxembourg was one of the first to apply the European directive, making its register public in autumn 2019. In a way, it is therefore paying the price of transparency. The many flaws discovered by the OpenLux investigation question the ability of States to effectively monitor their financial ecosystem by guaranteeing the reliability of these registers. For example, almost half of the companies, funds and foundations registered in Luxembourg have no real identifiable beneficiaries to date. However, as the European directive states, <em>«&nbsp;public access to information on the actual recipients allows greater control of information by civil society (…) and helps to preserve confidence in the integrity of commercial transactions and the financial system&nbsp;»</em>.</p>                                 </section>    </article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-f2fc11fb4d616c1f00b5"><div><p>Whenever someone asks which <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs#database" target="_blank">Node.js ORM</a> they should use, one of the first answers is always some version of “<em>don’t use an ORM, just write SQL</em>”. This answer is then usually attacked with an opposite opinion along the lines of “<em>you need to use an ORM to hide all that nasty SQL</em>”. People always seem to ignore the third option: using <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/" target="_blank">an ORM that embraces SQL</a>!</p><p>I completely understand where the hatred comes from though. There are real problems in many ORMs, that <a href="https://medium.com/u/ac187d616e0b" target="_blank">Thomas Hunter II</a> summarizes well in his post <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/why-you-should-avoid-orms-with-examples-in-node-js-e0baab73fa5" target="_blank">Why you should avoid ORMs</a>. The main points Thomas listed were</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>You learn the ORM, not SQL and that knowledge is usually not transferable to other tools.</p></li><li><p>Complex ORM calls are inefficient. ORMs have their own object-oriented query language which they try to convert to SQL, and it’s usually really difficult.</p></li><li><p>ORMs can’t do everything. The object oriented approach of most ORMs doesn’t map well to SQL. For many SQL operations, there is no object oriented equivalent.</p></li></ol><p>These problems arise from the fact that most ORMs are designed to abstract away SQL in favor of some object oriented interface. But not all ORMs are like that!</p><p>I created an ORM called <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/" target="_blank">objection.js</a> for exactly the reasons Thomas listed. The design goal of objection.js is to allow you to use SQL whenever possible and only provide a DSL (Domain Specific Language) or a custom concept when something cannot be easily done using SQL. I’ll get back to objection.js soon. First, I’ll introduce you to the most common argument for avoiding ORMs:</p><blockquote><p>It’s easier to write &lt;something&gt; in plain SQL than using an ORM</p></blockquote><p>This argument is usually followed by a contrived example like this:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1554837408459_4953"><p>Yes, if you only need a flat list of items from one table at a time, by all means, don’t use an ORM! Of course you can use joins, subqueries and multiple queries to access related items in other tables, but that easily becomes tedious. For example, here’s a very basic query that joins a many-to-many relationship (children of a person) and a has-many relationship (pets of a person)</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1554837408459_6074"><div><p>That’s already quite a bit of SQL. What if you want to join more relationships? How about nested relationships? You also need to repeat that every time you want to fetch the related objects. Not to mention the result of that query is a flat list of items and not a nested tree of objects.</p><p>The next thing any ORM hater would do is to use a library that converts that flat result list into a nicely nested object tree and then proceed to writing a bunch of helper functions for adding those joins to queries so that you don’t need to repeat yourself. You quickly realize that most of these helper functions look the same and only the table names and foreign keys are different. Then the obvious choice is to go ahead and define the relationships in a single place as objects and create a generic function that takes a relationship description object and outputs the needed joins.</p><p>Congratulations, you’ve just reinvented the ORM!</p><p>In my opinion, that’s all a good ORM is: a set of tools to make using SQL easier! It allows you to fully use all the features of SQL and the underlying database engine and only provides helpers and custom solutions to things that are difficult to achieve with just plain SQL.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1554837408459_8837"><div><p>With objection.js, you always work with a<a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/api/query-builder/#class-querybuilder" target="_blank"> query builder</a>. You can build any query and use as much SQL as you want but it also helps you to deal with the repetitive stuff like relations if you want it to. The <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/api/query-builder/join-methods.html#joinrelation" target="_blank">leftJoinRelation</a> method is given the names of the relations you want to join and objection.js uses the <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/guide/relations.html#examples" target="_blank">relation mappings</a> to create the joins. </p><p>Now you may be thinking, “that’s not much shorter and I still need to define the relationships somewhere”. Well yeah, but you only need to do that once. If your project is so simple that defining the relationships and models takes a significant part of your development time, it doesn’t matter whether you use an ORM or not.</p><p>The <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/api/query-builder/join-methods.html#joinrelation" target="_blank">joinRelation</a> query above is 100% equivalent to the previous SQL query and would still produce a flat list of result rows. You can easily get a tree of objects using the <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/guide/query-examples.html#eager-loading" target="_blank">joinEager</a> method:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1554837408459_9918"><p>Loading nested relations is just as easy:</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1554871633687_10767"><p>And in the next code block is the minimal SQL needed to carry out that query. The selects with aliases are needed to be able to build the object tree from the flat list.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555046254723_11559"><p>For many ORMs, SQL concepts like subqueries are difficult or impossible to write. Since all objection.js operations return a <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/api/query-builder/" target="_blank">query builder</a>, writing <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/recipes/subqueries.html" target="_blank">subqueries</a> is just as easy as using plain SQL. For example, fetching all people that have at least one pet called ‘Fluffy’</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1554837408459_14131"><p>But there’s also an easier way to write this in objection.js if you have defined the <code>pets</code> relationship for the <code>Person</code> model:</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1554837408459_15231"><div><p>But that requires you to learn the ORM (which was one of the arguments against ORMs). You can still start by writing the SQL solution you are familiar with. Once you learn more about objection.js, you find helpers like this that improve your productivity.</p><p>Here’s another example of using the <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/api/model/static-methods.html#static-relatedquery" target="_blank">relatedQuery</a> helper</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1554876097081_10902"><div><p>If your application is simple and you rarely need to deal with nested data and relations, using plain SQL or a query builder like <a href="https://knexjs.org/" target="_blank">knex</a> can be a good option. However, in most applications you want to work with nested data and a lot of relations and an ORM can be a helpful tool. With objection.js, you don’t need to make a compromise. You get the flexibility of a query builder and the relational power of an ORM in the same package.</p><p>If you found any of this interesting, take a closer look at <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/" target="_blank">objection.js.</a></p><p>Some links to get you started</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/guide/installation.html" target="_blank">Getting started</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/guide/query-examples.html#eager-loading" target="_blank">Eager loading</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/guide/query-examples.html#graph-inserts" target="_blank">Graph inserts</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/issues/1069" target="_blank">Who is using objection</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/guide/query-examples.html" target="_blank">Query examples</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/recipes/relation-subqueries.html" target="_blank">Relation subqueries</a></p></li></ul></div></div></div>]]>

February 9, 2021 | https://thibault.uk/posts/why-give-id-card/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://thibault.uk/posts/why-give-id-card/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Youtube asked me to verify my age. To do so, I got asked to either enter a credit card in my name, or to upload my ID card.</p><p><img src="https://thibault.uk/images/why-give-id-card-01.png" alt="Youtube age verification"></p><p>And that’s a no. I won’t. Why should I?</p><p>Digging more into this, I find out that Youtube posted <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/using-technology-more-consistently-apply-age-restrictions/">a blog</a> on September 22, 2020, annoucing the new changes to their policy. In this blog post, titled <em>Using technology to more consistently apply age restrictions</em>, Youtube team goes over the forthcoming European Union’s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/revision-audiovisual-media-services-directive-avmsd">Audiovisual Media Services Directive</a>, and how, under this directive, they have to make sure their user is over 18 to access restricted content.</p><p>Fair enough. Let’s check <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32018L1808&amp;from=EN#d1e1323-69-1">this directive</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Article 6a</p><p>Member States shall take appropriate measures to ensure that audiovisual media services provided by media service providers under their jurisdiction which may impair the physical, mental or moral development of minors are only made available in such a way as to ensure that minors will not normally hear or see them. Such measures may include selecting the time of the broadcast, age verification tools or other technical measures. They shall be proportionate to the potential harm of the programme.</p></blockquote><p>Indeed, the directive mentions age verification tools. This is used as an example, and clearly balanced based on the content. Like, I may be young, but I know there is porn on TV. In short, this age verification is not something Youtube has to do, it’s something they decided to implement.</p><p>They could have leveraged:</p><ul><li>the age of the account, mine is 14 years old, and I did not open it at age 4</li><li>the kind of videos/channels I’m subscribe to</li><li>or ask me to come at a later time, if the content is too sensitive</li></ul><p>This is not a legal advice. I’m not a lawyer. Nevertheless, I’m sure there were better way to handle this.</p><h2 id="everyone-does-it">Everyone does it
<a href="#everyone-does-it"></a></h2><p>The ask from Youtube feels an extension of showing a card to buy alcohol or to enter a club. It is a weird moment between you and what you are looking for, protected by a bored guardian.</p><p>And to their defence, they are not the only one asking for my ID card. In fact, most services I use are moving to this type of check. This is labelled as Know Your Customer (KYC) policies.</p><p>For what I recall, the first service asking me to upload my identity card was my bank. Then came an airline company. Then a company mandated by an estate agent. Now Youtube.</p><p>Is this really necessary? I put money on my bank account monthly, I fly regularly with my airline company, and I have a deposit with my estate agent. Youtube probably has more data than all of these companies combined, and is still asking for some verification.</p><p>The thing that depresses me the most is when they all come at the end of the year with shiny web interfaces telling me how great the year with me was. The bank telling me I spent hundreds in groceries, the airline that it’s missing me, the estate agent that my rented flat is the best they’ve ever seen. And Youtube celebrating creators I don’t follow. So clearly, they have data, they know me. Nevertheless, they still ask me.</p><h2 id="the-cost-to-user">The cost to user
<a href="#the-cost-to-user"></a></h2><p>I should not feel concern but I am. We are in 2021. It is easier than ever to <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US7370015B2/en">impersonate a website</a>. Most users do <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858214">not know basic security principles</a>. I probably don’t either.</p><p>And with all this in mind, most companies require users to upload sensitive information via web forms. Companies that do not have an actual need for it! Youtube does not, my estate agent does not, my airline company falls into a category I wish would not. And my bank, well, is my bank.</p><p>The KYC system is worse than it looks. Once one of the company you have KYC-ed with falls victim of a breach, your online identity is compromised everywhere. With a manual verification, the attacker can now impersonate you in most of your accounts. ID cards don’t lie.</p><p>A remedial to this issue came when companies started asking for a unique passcode (usually 6 digits) to be written down when uploading the picture of your ID card. I am still unsure how this helps. Sure, it delays the scammers that got ID before, but we are in 2021; Adobe Photoshop is more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop">30 years old</a>. Moreover, computer generated pictures start to look good, very good.</p><p><img src="https://thibault.uk/images/why-give-id-card-02.png" alt="Picture of generated.photos"></p><p>In the end, users pay the cost. They are the ones which credentials get compromised. It is their identity that is placed at risk. Their life being uploaded online. I trust companies saying they are complying with the law. I trust Youtube telling me they have to check my age. I simply think that these checks do not fulfil their goals and place an immense burden on users.</p><h2 id="a-better-path">A better path
<a href="#a-better-path"></a></h2><p>This post could have ended here. Me ranting that things were better before, pointing out issues in the way data is being handle by tech companies. However, the picture would not be complete. I think there are ways to make this better.</p><p>First, no company should ask me for documents defining my identity. These are <em>very</em> sensitive data and I don’t trust any company with them. No matter how secure they are, they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches">will have a breach</a>. This is <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/lsi.12303">trickier</a> for services that have actual legal requirements to do so, such as my bank.</p><p>Second, if your password system does not offer Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), do not bother ask for secure documents. Asking for specific letters in a second password does not count as MFA. If you are expecting me to trust you are doing everything possible to store my documents securely, apply standard security practices. I don’t care about “but our telephone support needs to know the 3rd character of your password”. This is a no!</p><p>Thirdly, look at cryptography. Recent research in Fully Homomorphic Encryption and Zero Knowledge Proof made secure assessment on the client side feasible. I imagine a company valued over a trillion dollar, and with some of the best researchers on the planet, has resources to unearth privacy preserving age verification tools.</p><p>Finally, companies should be more transparent on their policy enforcement. Internet has become a central place of exchange for a lot of people online. New policies have a huge impact on users, and their daily life. I applaud the effort of the Youtube team to share a blog about their policy change, but I can only deplore the absence of user quotes. An additional requirement places content <a href="https://twitter.com/yopalmm/status/1344806043881189383?s=20">one step away from the user</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

quarter circle will be roughly proportional to the area. More specifically, the fraction of all the grid points inside

<p>The great ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes figured out the circle area over two thousand years ago without
integral calculus (or trigonometric functions for that matter). He started with an elegant insight about regular (i.e.,
equal-sided) polygons.</p>
<p>The famous <a href="https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/propI37.html">“half base times height”
formula for the area of a triangle already had a well-known proof in the first book of Euclid’s Elements of
Geometry</a> (easily derived from <a href="https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/propI35.html">a
theorem about parallelograms</a>). Conveniently, any regular polygon can be split into equal triangles joined to the
centre. For example, a regular hexagon splits into six triangles, as in the figure below. We can take any one of the
triangles (they’re all the same) and call the “base” the side that’s also a side of the polygon. Then the “height” is
the line from the centre of the base to the centre of the polygon.</p>

</figure>
<p>Now here’s Archimedes’s neat insight: The ratio of the triangle area to the base is <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">

<p>Of course, Archimedes was a respected mathematician who couldn’t get away with just assuming that anything true of a
polygon is true of a circle (counterexample: all polygons have bumpy corners, but circles don’t). He used the kind of
geometric proof by contradiction that was popular in his day. (He even took it further and analysed spheres, cylinders,
parabolas and other curved objects, almost inventing something like modern real analysis a couple of millenia early.)
Sadly, not all of his mathemetical work has survived, but <a href="https://flashman.neocities.org/ARCHCI1set.htm">the
key part of his Measurement of a Circle</a> has.</p>
<p>Here’s the high-level version. Archimedes claimed that the area of a circle is <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p><a href="https://cppinsights.io/">C++ Insights</a> is a <a target="_blank" href="https://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a>-based tool which does a source to source transformation. Its goal is to make things visible, which normally and intentionally happen behind the scenes. It's about the magic the compiler does for us to make things work. Or looking through the classes of a compiler.</p> <p>Some time ago, I started looking into some new things we got with C++11, C++14, C++17 and C++20. Amazing things like lambdas, range-based for-loops, and structured bindings. I put it together in a talk. You can find the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.andreasfertig.info/talks_dl/afertig-ndcolo-2017-fast-and-small.pdf">slides</a> and a <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/Bt7KzFxcbgc">video</a> online.</p> <p>However, all that research and some of my training and teaching got me to start thinking about how it would be if we could see with the eyes of the compiler. Sure, there is an AST-dump, at least for clang. With tools like <a target="_blank" href="https://godbolt.org/#">Compiler Explorer</a>, we can see what code the compiler generates from a C++ source snippet. However, what we see is assembler. Neither the AST nor the <a target="_blank" href="https://godbolt.org/#">Compiler Explorer</a> output is in the language I write code, and therefore I'm most familiar with. Plus, when teaching students C++ showing an AST and explaining that it is all there was not quite satisfying for me.</p> <p>I started to write a <a target="_blank" href="https://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a>-based tool able to transform a range-based for-loop into the compiler-internal version. Then, I did the same for structured bindings and lambdas. In the end, I ended up doing a lot more as initially planned. It shows where operators are invoked, places in which the compiler does some casting. <a href="https://cppinsights.io/">C++ Insights</a> is able to deduce the type behind <code>auto</code> or <code>decltype</code>. The goal is to produce compilable code. However, this is not possible in all places.</p> <p>Still, there is work to do.</p> <p>I do not claim to get all the things right. This is just the initial version of <a href="https://cppinsights.io/">C++ Insights</a> I consider good enough to hand it to the public. Also, keep in mind that it is solely based on clang and my understanding of C++ and the AST.</p> <p>You can see, for example, the transformation of a <a href="https://cppinsights.io/s/f7710a4b">lambda</a>, <a href="https://cppinsights.io/s/40f6a267">range-based for-loop</a>, or <a href="https://cppinsights.io/s/e1a8cf40">auto</a>. Of course, you can transform any other C++ snippet.</p> <p>For those who like videos, there is a C++ Insights series on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhIubRbFfuM&amp;list=PLm0Dc2Lp2ycaFyR2OqPkusuSB8LmifY8D" target="_blank">Youtube</a>. If you have topics you like me to speak about, please reach out to me.</p> <p>The version information of the C++ Insights version running on this website can be found here: <a href="https://cppinsights.io/version">https://cppinsights.io/version</a>.</p> <p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/andreasfertig/cppinsights-web">source</a> of the web front-end and the tool <a href="https://github.com/andreasfertig/cppinsights">C++ Insights</a> on Github.</p> <p>If you like to support the project, consider <a href="https://github.com/andreasfertig/cppinsights/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">submitting</a> a patch.

Lieberman caused an international stir nearly a decade ago when he published a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08723">paper</a> showing that running in cushioned sneakers encourages people to hit the ground harder than running barefoot.</p><p data-reactroot="">Lieberman, a professor of biological sciences at Harvard University, also started running barefoot himself as an experiment and kept doing it because he enjoyed it. Every spring, after running the Boston Marathon, he would trade his traditional sneakers for a pair of minimal shoes or no footwear at all. The more he ran barefoot, the more callused and protected his feet became. “But I could still feel the ground just as well as when my calluses were really thin,” Lieberman says. From an evolutionary standpoint, it made sense that callused feet would still feel: they are the body’s only contact with the ground, and ancient people could not afford to lose that sensation, he thought.</p><p data-reactroot="">Now Lieberman and his colleagues at Harvard and in Germany and Kenya have conducted another study, published Wednesday in <i><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1345-6">Nature</a></i>, that confirms his suspicions. It finds that although calluses thicken as people walk barefoot more often, there is no trade-off in sensation from that extra protection. Essentially, the hard surface of the callus transmits mechanical force through the foot to the nerves deep inside the skin equally well as an unprotected sole.</p><p data-reactroot="">Calluses are made out of the protein keratin, the same material as fingernails, glued together with another special protein. “There’s no viscosity to calluses, so forces from the ground go right into deeper layers of skin, and you don’t lose any information,” Lieberman says.</p><p data-reactroot="">Lieberman and his colleagues measured the sensitivity of the sole to mechanical stimuli, showing that people with thick calluses were as sensitive to vibrations as those with thin or no calluses. The researchers compared calluses and foot sensitivity among 81 people from western Kenya, some of whom regularly went without footwear and some of whom did not. They also collected similar data from 22 people in Boston.</p><p data-reactroot="">With cushioned shoes, the stiffness of the sole slows the rate at which the body hits the ground, making the impact more comfortable, but the force is the same, Lieberman says. “The energy that gets shot up your leg is about three times bigger in a cushioned shoe than if you’re barefoot,” he says, adding that “we have no idea what that means” for joint health. It is theoretically possible, he says, that this extra impact is behind the doubling of rates of arthritis of the knee since World War II—about the time that technological advances in footwear design allowed for more cushioned soles. But there is no solid evidence to support such a connection.</p><p data-reactroot="">In some ways, walking barefoot is better for the body than wearing deeply cushioned soles, Lieberman says. But he insists he is not antifootwear: “I’m not saying people shouldn’t wear shoes.” Rather he thinks that scientists do not yet understand the impact of footwear on the body over the course of millions of steps. Lieberman says it would be challenging to study the effects of wearing shoes for millions upon millions of steps over the course of 70-plus years in humans, but he is currently exploring the impact of such cushioning on animal locomotion.</p><p data-reactroot="">Balance might also be a casualty of soft soles. People’s feet become less sensitive as they age. If they have also lost touch with the ground, they might become more vulnerable to falls, Lieberman explains. “If your feet can’t sense what’s going on on the ground, maybe you’re more susceptible and more vulnerable [to falls], and shoes may be a part of that,” he says. “If we can give people’s brains, their reflexes, more information, that might help them.”</p><p data-reactroot="">Gymnasts and martial artists go barefoot to increase their connection with the ground, and Formula One race car drivers wear hard-soled shoes that actually boost their sensitivity, according to one <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19277695">study</a>.</p><p data-reactroot="">With today’s cushioned shoes, “we add comfort, but we reduce functionality,” says Thorsten Sterzing, a footwear scientist who designs high-performance shoes. He was not involved in the new research but hopes to build on it in his own work. Too often, people opt for footwear that fits society’s idea of beauty, yet that does not promote healthy walking, he says. Studies like Lieberman’s can lead to better-designed shoes that complement the body’s natural abilities rather than undermine them.</p><p data-reactroot="">Kristiaan D’Août, a senior lecturer in musculoskeletal biology at the University of Liverpool in England, says the foot is one of the least understood structures in the body because of individual variation, the complexity of foot bones and ligaments, and because so much of what happens inside the foot is impossible to see. D’Août was not involved in the recent paper, but he conducts related work and wrote a commentary about the study that appears in the same issue of <i>Nature</i>. In one of his research studies, D’Août had participants wear minimal shoes for six months. Although they were uncomfortable at first, “quite a few people prefer them now,” he says. “One of the things that I would really hope would come out of this research and footwear research in general is that people will start to realize that shoes can be quite invasive.” (D’Août admits he usually wears regular shoes himself because of the wet, gloomy weather in Liverpool.)</p><p data-reactroot="">People have probably been wearing shoes for about 40,000 years, Lieberman says, although some suspect that Neandertals remained shoeless. In some parts of the world, including India and Kenya, where Lieberman conducts research, many people still go their whole lives without wearing shoes. “I find it unimaginable to be barefoot in middle of Europe in the Ice Age, but then again, all the other animals in Europe during the Ice Age were barefoot—so maybe our cousins, the Neandertals, were able to handle it just fine,” Lieberman says.</p><p data-reactroot="">Still, he says, he has no plans to test going barefoot himself during a New England winter.</p><p data-reactroot=""><i>Karen Weintraub is a freelance health and science journalist who writes regularly for the </i>New York Times<i>, </i>STAT<i> and </i>USA Today<i>, among others.</i></p></section></div></div></article></div></article></div>]]>

February 9, 2021 | https://brooker.co.za/blog/2020/10/05/consensus.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://brooker.co.za/blog/2020/10/05/consensus.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">


<p>And it looks pretty hard.</p>


<p>In his classic paper <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.61.8330&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">How to Build a Highly Available System Using Consensus</a> Butler Lampson laid out a pattern that's become very popular in the design of large-scale highly-available systems. Consensus is used to deal with unusual situations like host failures (Lampson says <em>reserved for emergencies</em>), and leases (time-limited locks) provide efficient normal operation. The paper lays out a roadmap for implementing systems of this kind, leaving just the implementation details to the reader.</p>

<p>The core algorithm behind this paper, Paxos, is famous for its complexity and subtlety. Lampson, like many who came after him<sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>, try to build a framework of specific implementation details around it to make it more approachable. It's effective, but incomplete. The challenge is that Paxos's subtlety is only one of the hard parts of building a consensus system. There are three categories of challenges that I see people completely overlook.</p>

<p><strong>Determinism</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>"How  can  we  arrange  for  each  replica  to  do  the  same  thing?  Adopting  a  scheme  first proposed  by  Lamport,  we  build  each  replica  as  a  deterministic  state  machine;  this means that the transition relation is a function from (state, input) to (new state, output). It is customary to call one of these replicas a ‘process’. Several processes that start in the same state and see the same sequence of inputs will do the same thing, that is, end up in the same state and produce the same outputs" - Butler Lampson (from <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.61.8330&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">How to Build a Highly Available System Using Consensus</a>).</p></blockquote>

<p>Conceptually, that's really easy. We start with a couple of replicas with <em>state</em>, feed them <em>input</em>, and they all end up with <em>new state</em>. Same inputs in, same state out. Realistically, it's hard. Here are just some of the challenges:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Concurrency</em>. Typical runtimes and operating systems use more than just your program's state to schedule threads, which means that code that uses multiple threads, multiple processes, remote calls, or even just IO, can end up with non-deterministic results. The simple fix is to be resolutely single-threaded, but that has severe performance implications<sup><a href="#foot2">2</a></sup>.</li>
<li><em>Floating Point</em>. Trivial floating-point calculations are deterministic. Complex floating point calculations, especially where different replicas run on different CPUs, have code built with different compilers, may not be<sup><a href="#foot3">3</a></sup>. In <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi20-paper-brooker.pdf">Physalia</a> we didn't support floating point, because this was too hard to think about.</li>
<li><em>Bug fixes</em>. Say the code that turns <em>state</em> and <em>input</em> into <em>new state</em> has a bug. How do you fix it? You can't just change it and then roll it out incrementally to different replicas. You don't want to deploy all your replicas at once (we're trying to build an HA system, remember?) So you need to come up with a migration strategy. Maybe a flag sequence number. Or complex migration code that changes <em>buggy new state</em> into <em>good new state</em>. Possible, but hard.</li>
<li><em>Code updates</em>. Are you sure that version <em>N+1</em> produces exactly the same output as version <em>N</em> for all inputs? You shouldn't be, because even in the well-specified world of cryptography <a href="https://hdevalence.ca/blog/2020-10-04-its-25519am">that's not always true</a>.</li>
<li><em>Corruption</em>. In reality, <em>input</em> isn't just <em>input</em>, it's also a constant stream of failing components, thermal noise, cosmic rays, and other similar assaults on the castle of determinism. Can you survive them all?</li>
</ul>


<p>And more. There's always more.</p>

<p>Some people will tell you that you can solve these problems by using <em>byzantine</em> consensus protocols. Those people are right, of course. They're also the kind of people who solved their rodent problem by keeping a leopard in their house. Other people will tell you that you can solve these problems with blockchain. Those people are best ignored.</p>

<p><strong>Monitoring and Control</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Although using a single, centralized, server is the simplest way to implement a service, the resulting service can only be as fault tolerant as the processor executing that server. If this level of fault tolerance is unacceptable, then multiple servers that fail independently must be used. - Fred Schneider (from <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/fbs/publications/SMSurvey.pdf">Implementing Fault-Tolerant Services Using the State Machine Approach: A Tutorial</a>)</p></blockquote>

<p>The whole point of building a highly-available distributed system is to exceed the availability of a single system. If you can't do that, you've added a bunch of complexity for nothing.</p>

<blockquote><p>Complex systems run in degraded mode. - Richard Cook (from <a href="https://how.complexsystems.fail/">How Complex Systems Fail</a>)</p></blockquote>

<p>Depending on what you mean by <em>failed</em>, distributed systems of <em>f+1</em>, <em>2f+1</em> or <em>3f+1</em> nodes can entirely hide the failure of <em>f</em> nodes from their clients. This, combined with a process of repairing failed nodes, allows us to build highly-available systems even in the face of significant failure rates. It also leads directly to one of the traps of building a distributed system: clients can't tell the difference between the case where an outage is <em>f</em> failures away, and where it's just one failure away. If a system can tolerate <em>f</em> failures, then <em>f-1</em> failures may look completely healthy.</p>

<p>Consensus systems cannot be monitored entirely <em>from the outside</em> (see <a href="https://brooker.co.za/blog/2016/01/03/correlation.html">why must systems be operated?</a>). Instead, monitoring needs to be deeply aware of the implementation details of the system, so it can know when nodes are healthy, and can be replaced. If they choose the wrong nodes to replace, disaster will strike.</p>

<blockquote><p>Control planes provide much of the power of the cloud, but their privileged position also means that they have to act safely, responsibly, and carefully to avoid introducing additional failures. - Brooker, Chen, and Ping (from <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi20-paper-brooker.pdf">Millions of Tiny Databases</a>)</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Do You Really Need Strong Consistency?</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>It is possible to provide high availability and partition tolerance, if atomic consistency is not required. - Gilbert and Lynch</p></blockquote>

<p>The typical state-machine implementation of consensus provides a strong consistency property called <em>linearizability</em>. In exchange, it can't be available for all clients during a network partition. That's probably why you chose it.</p>

<p>Is that why you chose it? Do you need <em>linearizability</em>? Or would something else, like <em>causality</em> be enough? Using consensus when its properties aren't really needed is a mistake a lot of folks seem to make. Service discovery, configuration distribution, and similar problems can all be handled adequately without strong consistency, and using strongly consistent tools to solve them makes systems less reliable rather than more. Strong consistency is not better consistency.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Despite these challenges, consensus is an important building block in building highly-available systems. Distribution <a href="http://brooker.co.za/blog/2020/01/02/why-distributed.html">makes building HA systems easier</a>. It's a tool, not a solution.</p>

<p>Think of using consensus in your system like getting a puppy: it may bring you a lot of joy, but with that joy comes challenges, and ongoing responsibilities. There's a lot more to dog ownership than just getting a dog. There's a lot more to high availability than picking up a Raft library off github.</p>

<p>Rust support in Emacs improved <em>a lot</em> during the past two years. This post will walk you through setting up Emacs to allow for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigating the source code (go to to implementation, list references, outline module structure)</li>
<li>Code completion</li>
<li>Code snippets</li>
<li>Highlighting errors and warnings inline</li>
<li>Apply code fixes and refactorings</li>
<li>Automatically import definitions if necessary (such as for Traits)</li>
<li>Code formatting with rustfmt</li>
<li>Building &amp; running other cargo commands</li>
</ul>
<p>This setup will be based on <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/">rust-analyzer</a>, a LSP server that is under very active development and powers the Rust support in VS Code as well.</p>
<p>This post is accompanied by a <a href="https://github.com/rksm/emacs-rust-config">github repository</a> that you can use as a reference or directly checkout and run Emacs with (<a href="#quickstart">see below</a>). I’ve tested the configuration with Emacs 27.1, rust stable 1.49.0 and on macOS 11.1, Ubuntu 18.04 and Windows 10.</p>
<p>For a setup that uses the emacs-racer backend<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> please see <a href="https://github.crookster.org/my-emacs-rust-language-config/">David Crook’s guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="quickstart">Quickstart</h2>
<p>If you have already Rust and Emacs installed (see <a href="#prerequisites">prerequisites</a>) you can get quickly up and running without modifying any of your existing configuration. The <a href="https://github.com/rksm/emacs-rust-config">rksm/emacs-rust-config github repo</a> contains a <code>standalone.el</code> file that you can use to start Emacs with:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">$ git clone https://github.com/rksm/emacs-rust-config
$ emacs -q --load ./emacs-rust-config/standalone.el
</code></pre></div><p>This will start Emacs with an <code>.emacs.d</code> directory set to the location of the checked out repository (and a different elpa directory). This means, it will not use or modify your <code>$HOME/.emacs.d</code>. If you are unsure if you are happy with what is described here, this is an easy way to figure it out.</p>
<p>All dependencies will be installed on first startup, this means the first start will take a few seconds.</p>
<p>On windows you can use a shortcut to start Emacs with those parameters. If you are on macOS and have installed the Emacs.app you will need to start Emacs from the command line with:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">/Applications//Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs -q --load ./emacs-rust-config/standalone.el
</code></pre></div><h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Before we get to the actual Emacs configuration, please make sure your system is setup with the following.</p>
<h4 id="rust">Rust</h4>
<p>Install the rust toolchain with cargo. <a href="https://rustup.rs/">rustup</a> makes that easy. Install rust stable and make sure that the <code>.cargo/bin</code> directory is in your PATH. rustup will do this by default. rust-analyzer will also need the Rust source code and you can install that with <code>rustup component add rust-src</code>.</p>
<h4 id="rust-analyzer">rust-analyzer</h4>
<p>You need the rust-analyzer server binary. You can install it following the rust <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#rust-analyzer-language-server-binary">analyzer manual</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/releases">pre-compiled binaries</a> are available. However, since rust-analyzer is so actively developed I usually just clone the github repository and build the binary myself. This makes upgrading (and downgrading should it be necessary) very straightforward:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">$ git clone https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer.git
$ cd rust-analyzer
$ cargo xtask install --server <span># will install rust-analyzer into $HOME/.cargo/bin</span>
</code></pre></div><h4 id="emacs">Emacs</h4>
<p>I have tested the setup with Emacs 27.1. On macOS I normally use <a href="https://emacsformacosx.com/">emacsformacosx.com</a>. On Windows I use the “nearby GNU mirror” link at <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html">gnu.org/software/emacs</a>. On Ubuntu <a href="https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2020/09/install-emacs-27-1-ppa-ubuntu-20-04/">adding another apt repository</a> is necessary. Note that the config will likely work with older Emacs versions but Emacs 27 got substantial improvements around JSON parsing which speeds up LSP clients quite a bit.</p>
<p>Note that I use <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package">use-package</a> for Emacs package management. It will be auto-installed in the standalone version of this config. Otherwise you can add a snippet like below to your <code>init.el</code>:</p>
<pre><code>(unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-install 'use-package))
</code></pre><h2 id="rust-emacs-configuration-in-detail">Rust Emacs Configuration in Detail</h2>
<p>The essential modes being used are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>rustic</li>
<li>lsp-mode</li>
<li>company</li>
<li>yasnippet</li>
<li>flycheck</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="rustic">Rustic</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/brotzeit/rustic">rustic</a> is a fork of <code>rust-mode</code> and extends it with a number of useful features (see the its github readme). It is the core of the setup and you can use just it without any other Emacs packages (and without rust-analyzer) if you just want code highlighting and cargo commands bound to emacs shortcuts.</p>
<pre><code>(use-package rustic
  :ensure
  :bind (:map rustic-mode-map
              ("M-j" . lsp-ui-imenu)
              ("M-?" . lsp-find-references)
              ("C-c C-c l" . flycheck-list-errors)
              ("C-c C-c a" . lsp-execute-code-action)
              ("C-c C-c r" . lsp-rename)
              ("C-c C-c q" . lsp-workspace-restart)
              ("C-c C-c Q" . lsp-workspace-shutdown)
              ("C-c C-c s" . lsp-rust-analyzer-status))
  :config
  ;; uncomment for less flashiness
  ;; (setq lsp-eldoc-hook nil)
  ;; (setq lsp-enable-symbol-highlighting nil)
  ;; (setq lsp-signature-auto-activate nil)

  ;; comment to disable rustfmt on save
  (setq rustic-format-on-save t)
  (add-hook 'rustic-mode-hook 'rk/rustic-mode-hook))

(defun rk/rustic-mode-hook ()
  ;; so that run C-c C-c C-r works without having to confirm
  (setq-local buffer-save-without-query t))
</code></pre><p>Most of rustics features are bound to the <code>C-c C-c</code> prefix (that is press Control-c twice and then another key):</p>

    <!-- <div><pre style="font-size: small; display: inline;">C-c C-c</pre> which key</div> -->
  </figure>


<p>You can use <code>C-c C-c C-r</code> to run the program via <code>cargo run</code>. You will be asked for parameters and can for example specify <code>--release</code> to run in release mode or <code>--bin other-bin</code> to run the target named “other-bin” (instead of main.rs). To pass parameters to the executable itself use <code>-- --arg1 --arg2</code>.</p>
<p>The shortcut <code>C-c C-c C-c</code> will run the test at point. Very handy to run inline tests and to not always have switch back-and-forth between a terminal and Emacs.</p>
<p><code>C-c C-p</code> opens a popup buffer that will give you similar access to the commands shown above but will stick around.</p>
<p>Rustic provides even more helpful integration with cargo, e.g. <code>M-x rustic-cargo-add</code> will allow you to add dependencies to your projects <code>Cargo.toml</code> (via <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-edit">cargo-edit</a> that will be installed on demand).</p>
<p>If you would like to share a code snippet with others, <code>M-x rustic-playpen</code> will open your current buffer in <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/">https://play.rust-lang.org</a> where you can run the Rust code online and get a shareable link.</p>
<p>Code formatting on save is enabled and will use rustfmt. To disable it set <code>(setq rustic-format-on-save nil)</code>. You can still format a buffer on demand using <code>C-c C-c C-o</code>.</p>

<p>lsp-mode provides <a href="https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-rust/">the integration</a> with rust-analyzer. It enables the IDE features such as navigating through source code, highlighting errors via flycheck (see below) and provides the auto-completion source for company (also below).</p>
<pre><code>(use-package lsp-mode
  :ensure
  :commands lsp
  :custom
  ;; what to use when checking on-save. "check" is default, I prefer clippy
  (lsp-rust-analyzer-cargo-watch-command "clippy")
  (lsp-eldoc-render-all t)
  (lsp-idle-delay 0.6)
  :config
  (add-hook 'lsp-mode-hook 'lsp-ui-mode))

(use-package lsp-ui
  :ensure
  :commands lsp-ui-mode
  :custom
  (lsp-ui-peek-always-show t)
  (lsp-ui-sideline-show-hover t)
  (lsp-ui-doc-enable nil))
</code></pre><p>lsp-ui is optional. It provides inline overlays over the symbol at point and enables code fixes at point. If you find it to flashy and prefer not activating it just remove <code>:config (add-hook 'lsp-mode-hook 'lsp-ui-mode)</code>.</p>
<p>The config shown above already disables the documentation normally shown inline by lsp-ui. This is too much for my taste as it often covers up source code. If you want to also deactivate the documentation shown in the minibuffer you can add <code>(setq lsp-eldoc-hook nil)</code>. To do less when your cursor moves consider <code>(setq lsp-signature-auto-activate nil)</code> and <code>(setq lsp-enable-symbol-highlighting nil)</code>.</p>
<h4 id="code-navigation">Code navigation</h4>
<p>Having setup lsp-mode, you can use <code>M-.</code> to jump to the definition of function, structs, packages etc. when your cursor is over a symbol. <code>M-,</code> to jump back. With <code>M-?</code> you can list all references of a symbol. A little demo:</p>

    <img src="https://robert.kra.hn/posts/2021-02-07_rust-with-emacs/rust-lsp-demo-1.png">
  </figure>


<p>With <code>M-j</code> you can open up an outline of the current module that allows you to quickly navigate between functions and other definitions.</p>

  </figure>


<h4 id="code-actions">Code actions</h4>
<p>Refactorings are possible using <code>M-x lsp-rename</code> and <code>lsp-execute-code-action</code>. Code actions are basically code transformation and fixes. For example the linter may find a way to express code more idiomatically:</p>


  <figure>
    <img src="https://robert.kra.hn/posts/2021-02-07_rust-with-emacs/rust-lsp-demo-2.gif">
  </figure>


<p>The number of available code actions continuously growth. A full list is available in the <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#assists-code-actions">rust-analyzer documentation</a>. Favorites include automatically importing functions or fully qualifying symbols. E.g. in a module that does not yet use HashMap, type <code>HashMap</code> and then select the option to <code>Import std::collections::HashMap</code>. Other code actions allow you to add all possible arms in a match expression or converting a <code>#[derive(Trait)]</code> into the code needed for a custom implementation. And many, many more.</p>
<p>If you developing macros, quickly seeing how they expand can be really useful. Use <code>M-x lsp-rust-analyzer-expand-macro</code> or the shortcut <code>C-c C-c e</code> to macroexpand.</p>
<h4 id="code-completion-and-snippets">Code completion and snippets</h4>
<p>lsp-mode directly integrates with <a href="https://company-mode.github.io/">company-mode</a>, a completion framework for emacs. It will display a list of possible symbols that could be inserted at the cursor. It is very helpful when working with unknown libraries (or the std lib) and reduces the need for looking up documentation. Rust’s type system is used as a source for the completions and thus what you can insert makes (mostly) sense.</p>
<p>By default the code completion popup will appear after <code>company-idle-delay</code> which is set to 0.5 seconds by default. You can modify that value or disable the auto popup completely by setting <code>company-begin-commands</code> to <code>nil</code>.</p>
<pre><code>(use-package company
  :ensure
  :custom
  (company-idle-delay 0.5) ;; how long to wait until popup
  ;; (company-begin-commands nil) ;; uncomment to disable popup
  :bind
  (:map company-active-map
	      ("C-n". company-select-next)
	      ("C-p". company-select-previous)
	      ("M-&lt;". company-select-first)</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><b>New study found that electrons can reach ultra-relativistic energies for very special conditions in the magnetosphere when space is devoid of plasma</b></p><p>Recent measurements from NASA’s Van Allen Probes spacecraft showed that electrons can reach ultra-relativistic energies flying at almost the speed of light. Hayley Allison, Yuri Shprits and collaborators from the German Research Centre for Geosciences have revealed under which conditions such strong accelerations occur. They had already demonstrated in 2020 that during solar storm plasma waves play a crucial role for that. However, it was previously unclear why such high electron energies are not achieved in all solar storms. In the journal Science Advances, Allison, Shprits and colleagues now show that extreme depletions of the background plasma density are crucial.  
</p><p><b>Ultra-relativistic electrons in space </b></p><p>At ultra-relativistic energies, electrons move at almost the speed of light. Then the laws of relativity become most important. The mass of the particles increases by a factor ten, time is slowing down, and distance decreases. With such high energies, charged particles become most dangerous to even the best protected satellites. As almost no shielding can stop them, their charge can destroy sensitive electronics. Predicting their occurrence - for example, as part of the observations of space weather practised at the GFZ - is therefore very important for modern infrastructure. 
</p><p>To investigate the conditions for the enormous accelerations of the electrons, Allison and Shprits used data from a twin mission, the "Van Allen Probes", which the US space agency NASA had launched in 2012. The aim was to make detailed measurements in the radiation belt, the so-called Van Allen belt, which surrounds the Earth in a donut shape in terrestrial space. Here - as in the rest of space - a mixture of positively and negatively charged particles forms a so-called plasma. Plasma waves can be understood as fluctuations of the electric and magnetic field, excited by solar storms. They are an important driving force for the acceleration of electrons.  
</p><p><b>Data analysis with machine learning </b></p><p>During the mission, both solar storms that produced ultra-relativistic electrons and storms without this effect were observed. The density of the background plasma turned out to be a decisive factor for the strong acceleration: electrons with the ultra-relativistic energies were only observed to increase when the plasma density dropped to very low values of only about ten particles per cubic centimetre, while normally such density is five to ten times higher.  Using a numerical model that incorporated such extreme plasma depletion, the authors showed that periods of low density create preferential conditions for the acceleration of electrons - from an initial few hundred thousand to more than seven million electron volts. To analyse the data from the Van Allen probes, the researchers used machine learning methods, the development of which was funded by the GEO.X network. They enabled the authors to infer the total plasma density from the measured fluctuations of electric and magnetic field.  
</p><p><b>The crucial role of plasma </b></p><p>"This study shows that electrons in the Earth's radiation belt can be promptly accelerated locally to ultra-relativistic energies, if the conditions of the plasma environment - plasma waves and temporarily low plasma density - are right. The particles can be regarded as surfing on plasma waves. In regions of extremely low plasma density they can just take a lot of energy from plasma waves. Similar mechanisms may be at work in the magnetospheres of the outer planets such as Jupiter or Saturn and in other astrophysical objects”, says Yuri Shprits, head of the GFZ section Space physics and space weather and Professor at University of Potsdam.  “Thus, to reach such extreme energies, a two-stage acceleration process is not needed, as long assumed - first from the outer region of the magnetosphere into the belt and then inside. This also supports our research results from last year," adds Hayley Allison, PostDoc in the Section Space physics and space weather.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
   <article>

        

        <section>
            <div><p>I wanted to write to you all and share that I've launched my first eBook called <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/serverless-for-everyone-else">"Serverless For Everyone Else"</a> - within the first three hours of launch, nobody bought a single copy and I thought that I'd got it all wrong.</p>
<p>The "everyone else" is a reference to how complicated and difficult cloud-based and Kubernetes-based FaaS has become. The eBook sets out to help indie developers, and individuals within corporations build and deploy functions using a new version of OpenFaaS (<a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a>) which is open source and can run on a single VM or VPS without much overhead.</p>
<p>The real power of functions comes in extending existing systems through webhooks, polling, or querying and updating state. I'll share some of these use-cases below including how I used functions to extend how the Gumroad marketplace worked.</p>
<h2 id="whywriteanebookanyway">Why write an eBook anyway?</h2>
<p>Why did I decide to write an eBook? If you've ever written about tech or spoken at a conference, then Packt has probably approached you on LinkedIn about writing for them. From what I hear, that kind of arrangement means writing in a word doc, with tight deadlines and cranking out 300+ pages. It wasn't for me.</p>
<p>I'd seen <a href="https://twitter.com/dvassallo">Daniel Vassallo</a> create an eBook about AWS and Twitter. Daniel had really good results using Gumroad to sell his self-published eBooks. Then there's <a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">Adam Wathan</a> who built Tailwind CSS and trained himself up as a UI designer. He wrote his own eBook and in his yearly review mentioned that it did 600k USD in passive sales, without any promotion.</p>
<p>Whilst I didn't expect to get anywhere close to those numbers with a specialist topic, I did want to know if people would buy something from me.</p>
<h2 id="thetiersatlaunch">The tiers at launch</h2>
<p>I launched with three tiers, with names and clear differentiation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimalist - 25 USD - just the eBook</li>
<li>DevOps PRO - 50 USD - the eBook, plus a Grafana dashboard and the YAML for faasd to enable it</li>
<li>The learner - 99 USD - the eBook, plus a Grafana dashboard,  the YAML for faasd to enable it and a video workshop ready in 7 days</li>
<li>The team player - the learner, but for 5 people in your company</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as your options add some value, it seems that people enjoy the choice and are willing to pay a little more.</p>
<p>So I tweeted about the eBook and then nothing happened for three hours.</p>
<p>I interpreted this as a failure. I'd been reading <a href="https://amzn.to/38N5uZy">"The Right It: Why So Many Ideas Fail and How to Make Sure Yours Succeed"</a>, and had convinced myself that this was a sign that nobody wanted the material.</p>
<p>Then I got my first sale, and felt a little relief, maybe I was wrong?</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6358735/104810538-27b57080-57ed-11eb-905b-d042d3046adf.png" alt="Sale email"></p>
<p>My sales graph had one initial spike on the Friday, and kept going into the Sunday. What had happened? My Twitter audience and GitHub Sponsors came to lend their support.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErzMnuOXMAA_REk?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="Initial spike"></p>
<p>Then things died down, and over the course of the week I wondered if I'd failed to find market fit. <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a> was sending me almost no organic traffic, and nobody was landing on the page via SEO.</p>
<p>It was still more money than I had expected to earn from the eBook within the first week, but I felt like with so much interest in OpenFaaS, that there was a broader audience to reach.</p>
<h2 id="gettingasecondpeak">Getting a second peak</h2>
<p>After the first week, I released the video workshop to the people who'd purchased that tier (99USD), and to get some feedback, I offered a free upgrade to the workshop for the tier just below (50USD). That resulted in another large spike in interest.</p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4e204e93dcfc33679c997c739fbf4f651fdf268d23961bae6f9b4c25ad4ec145/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f45735a3372753258634155513451673f666f726d61743d6a7067266e616d653d6d656469756d" alt="Video workshop"></p>
<p>How did I fulfil the upgrade / discount? I did it by writing a function and deploying it to my Raspberry Pi, so that Gumroad would send a webhook, my code would query the dollar amount, and then send out an email to the customer over AWS SES.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EscxNxbXAAEHD8z?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="The function running"></p>
<p>Get the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/gumroad-responder">alexellis/gumroad-responder</a></p>
<p>After the second peak, I saw a complete drop-off again - and started to wonder why?</p>
<p>99% of referrals came from Twitter and email, so had I exhausted my network?</p>
<p>I went ahead and added a link on openfaas.com and on my blog at the end of each post, to try and get more views on the eBook. It's too early to tell if that is going to work out, but has resulted in a few conversions already.</p>
<p>One of the bits of feedback I got on the eBook was how users enjoyed the use-cases, and practical examples. I'd recently started video streaming, so invited a friend to my YouTube channel to talk about serverless use-cases.</p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/544dffaf339a4ff44439db1c14cd953de385640b99231688f8a49db61294a02e/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f457378444745505841415968724c4f3f666f726d61743d6a7067266e616d653d6c61726765" alt="Video on use-cases"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzuXVuccaqI&amp;feature=youtu.be">Watch the recording</a></p>
<p>The recording generated a lot of interest and engagement for existing eBook customers, but no additional sales.</p>
<p>You can get the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alexellis/c72d7a385f801cc9b8deb7fcaa531b69">show notes</a> here which have lots of links for use-cases from hobbyists, indie devs and corporate users of OpenFaaS.</p>
<h2 id="mynextmilestone">My next milestone</h2>
<p>I am pleased with the results so far, and have learned a lot along the way. I also had a few people reach out to me directly asking for help who had taken inspiration from seeing someone actually go ahead and take a calculated risk.</p>
<p>I haven't quite got to 10k USD, which is a nice round number to aim for, but I can roughly understand what each peak means here, and whether they are repeatable.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtARGclXMAg7nJ-?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="Approaching 10k"></p>
<p>Once the sales do cross that threshold, I'll write-up a how to guide and share the command lines and tools I used to generate the eBook.</p>
<h2 id="whatsnext">What's next</h2>
<p>I committed to providing free updates - because the eBook was partially experimental and I wanted to validate that it was useful. Using the <a href="https://slack.openfaas.io/">OpenFaaS Slack</a> helped here - I opened a new channel for people who'd bought the book, and enjoyed the feedback and engagement from this.</p>
<p>Some people charge extra for community, but it felt too hard to enforce the access for this.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6358735/104810333-b628f280-57eb-11eb-8be9-a2f6c773346b.png" alt="Original cover"></p>
<p>I generated my own eBook cover originally and then only later, got a professional designer involved.</p>
<p><img src="https://static-2.gumroad.com/res/gumroad/2028406193591/asset_previews/741f2ad46ff0a08e16aaf48d21810ba7/retina/social4.png" alt="New design"></p>
<p>It turns out that the cover may not matter with Gumroad, as long as it's not awful. Since changing cover, I've only seen two new sales.</p>
<p>Now that I have some initial feedback and have learned that people will buy things from me, I want to let goodwill rebuild, and my audience "recover" before launching a second eBook. I've done a lot of free blog posts and writing on Kubernetes, Docker, Golang and Raspberry Pi and analytics from my blog shows me what's popular.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 14 days, I've received more money than OpenFaaS corporate users have paid into the project over 4 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just because something you give away for free is popular, doesn't mean that anyone will be willing to pay for it. OpenFaaS itself is testament to that, with many corporations using it in production, without contributing code or finances back.</p>
<p>The Right It has taught me not to invest too much effort up front in any one idea - as it's likely to fail. Instead I'll be testing ideas - getting feedback by investing a few hours or days, not weeks.</p>
<p>I am sure I've missed out lots of details here, so feel free to ask me questions.</p>

			<p>One recently-completed project I mentioned in January’s <a href="https://www.dzombak.com/blog/2021/01/Now-Jan-2021.html">“Now” post</a> was locking down SSH in my personal computing infrastructure using Yubikeys. In this post, I’ll outline my goals, the strategy I took, and the problems and solutions I ran into along the way.</p>

<h2>Goals &amp; Strategy</h2>

<p>Historically, I’ve used a pretty basic SSH setup for my personal projects: my user account on every laptop/desktop/server had its own key in <code>~/.ssh</code>, and I’d try to keep the <a href="https://www.ssh.com/ssh/authorized_keys/"><code>authorized_keys</code></a> lists on all my servers more-or-less up-to-date. This presents a number of obvious security problems.</p>

<p>I wanted to ensure that, should an attacker gain access to one of my servers, they can’t use that access to move onto any other computer I control. To do this, I moved to using a few <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">Yubikeys</a> to store my SSH keys; there’s no longer key material stored on any server for a hypothetical attacker to steal. The Yubikeys require a PIN, so this is an example of two-factor authentication: something I physically have, and something I know.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/25/what-is-ssh-agent-forwarding-and-how-do-you-use-it/">SSH agent forwarding</a> is used to allow me to SSH from one server to another or fetch code from GitHub on a remote server. With <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/yubikey-agent"><code>yubikey-agent</code></a>, my preferred agent software, every single SSH operation — yes, even those performed via agent forwarding — requires a physical touch to confirm.</p>

<p>I use a private Git repository to synchronize SSH configuration (including <code>authorized_keys</code>, the list of public keys corresponding to my Yubikeys) between machines, with a modular local configuration system allowing me to quickly enable commonly-used SSH configuration blocks which only apply to a subset of my machines.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<h3>Yubikeys</h3>

<p>I found it easiest by far to use <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/yubikey-agent"><code>yubikey-agent</code></a> for this project. It’s pretty straightforward to set this up; the real work was figuring out how to smooth out the various difficulties I encountered later.</p>

<p>(The commands and configuration changes under this heading apply to client machines with attached Yubikeys.)</p>

<p>Install <code>yubikey-agent</code> with <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>:</p>

<pre><code>brew tap filippo.io/yubikey-agent https://filippo.io/yubikey-agent
brew install yubikey-agent
brew services start yubikey-agent
</code></pre>

<p>Run <code>yubikey-agent -setup</code> to generate a new SSH key on your Yubikey.</p>

<p>Set the <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> environment variable (do this in your <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.zshrc</code>). In <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/dotfiles/blob/800ca4e760da36171643e8a116e038cc4c4dcf31/zsh/.zshrc#L24">my dotfiles</a>, I first check that <code>yubikey-agent</code> is installed, then proceed:</p>

<pre><code>command -v yubikey-agent &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;&amp; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="/usr/local/var/run/yubikey-agent.sock"
</code></pre>

<p>Enable SSH agent forwarding for a specific, trusted host (don’t enable it for all hosts; that’s a potential security issue) by adding <code>ForwardAgent yes</code> to that host’s block in your <code>~/.ssh/config</code>. A complete example might look like:</p>

<pre><code>Host dzombak.com
    User chris
    HostName dzombak.com
    ForwardAgent yes
</code></pre>

<p>This is a bit of a spoiler for a topic later in this blog post, but we’ll also add this to our <code>~/.ssh/config</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Host *
    IdentityAgent /usr/local/var/run/yubikey-agent.sock
</code></pre>

<p>This allows apps started from outside your terminal — like the GUI Git client, <a href="https://fork.dev/">Fork.app</a> — to find and use <code>yubikey-agent</code>.</p>

<h4>A note: Secretive.app</h4>

<p>I’d like to use the new macOS app <a href="https://github.com/maxgoedjen/secretive">Secretive</a>, which stores SSH keys in the Secure Enclave on newer MacBooks and requires Touch ID to authenticate. Unfortunately, for Reasons™ I’m still using macOS Mojave, and Secretive requires Catalina or Big Sur. I plan to move to Big Sur soon enough, since I want to get an M1 MacBook Pro when the 16” models are released, so I’ll be able to try Secretive soon enough. (Worth noting, this changes the security model somewhat, as the second factor is biometric rather than a PIN, but it’s still two factors.)</p>

<h3>Server Configuration</h3>

<p>Of course, moving to Yubikeys doesn’t solve much if your servers still allow password logins. On every server, in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>, I set the following. Make this change only after you’ve set up a Yubikey and added it to <code>authorized_keys</code> for your user account on the server!</p>

<pre><code>ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
PasswordAuthentication no
PermitRootLogin no
</code></pre>

<p>(That last line — <code>PermitRootLogin no</code> — ensures that logins as <code>root</code> via SSH are never allowed, which is a good SSH best practice unrelated to Yubikeys.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-restart-ssh/">Restart the SSH service</a>, and immediately — before logging out — open a new terminal window and test that you can still login to the server with your Yubikey.</p>

<p>macOS tends to lose changes to <code>sshd_config</code> during OS upgrades, so after installing macOS updates I make sure to check that my SSH server configuration is intact.</p>

<h3>Git repo for SSH configuration</h3>

<p>I keep my <code>~/.ssh</code> directory, with a few important exceptions (keys are never committed!), in a private Git repo. This allows me to sync configuration and <code>authorized_keys</code> changes between systems easily. I’ve created a stripped-down version at <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example">cdzombak/ssh-example</a> which you can use as a basis for your own setup.</p>

<p>I’ll walk through the highlights here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/README.md"><code>README.md</code></a> covers initial installation &amp; setup.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/authorized_keys"><code>authorized_keys</code></a> is where you’ll add the public keys associated with the new, private SSH keys on your Yubikeys.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/config"><code>config</code></a> is where you’ll add <code>Host</code> blocks for your servers. At the top, it sets some SSH best practices that I’ve accumulated over the years.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/fix-permissions.sh"><code>fix-permissions.sh</code></a> ensures that <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> and <code>~/.ssh/rc</code> have the correct permissions. I run this after pulling from the repository; if it results in any changes the files’ permissions in the repo should be corrected.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/rc"><code>rc</code></a> runs after I log into a machine via SSH. In this case, it updates a symlink in <code>~/.ssh/sock</code> to point to the new SSH agent socket. See the “Long-lived <code>screen</code> sessions” section, below, for an explanation on why this is necessary.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/tree/main/config.templates"><code>config.templates/</code></a> contains SSH configuration blocks which <em>can</em> be included on a given machine, but shouldn’t be included everywhere. The most important of these are <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/config.templates/yubikey-agent"><code>yubikey-agent</code></a>, which when enabled sets <code>IdentityAgent</code> to the <code>yubikey-agent</code> socket as described above; and <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/config.templates/homedir-ssh-auth-sock"><code>homedir-ssh-auth-sock</code></a>, which sets <code>IdentityAgent</code> to the symlink <code>rc</code> creates after an SSH login. On any given machine, I enable one and only one of these two configurations, depending whether it’s a client machine with Yubikey attached or a server which will rely on agent forwarding for any outgoing SSH connections.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/tree/main/config.local"><code>config.local/</code></a> is <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/config#L2">included by</a> <code>config</code> and ignored by Git. I can add symlinks from here to <code>config.templates</code> to enable a specific SSH configuration block on the machine.</li>
</ul>


<p>Those last two — <code>config.local</code> and <code>config.templates</code> — are important, because that’s how I achieve variations in SSH configuration between different machines. <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/README.md#configuration">The README covers</a> how to enable config templates on a given computer.</p>

<h2>Challenges &amp; Solutions</h2>

<h3>Long-lived <code>screen</code> sessions</h3>

<p>I use GNU <code>screen</code> (yes, still; I haven’t bothered to learn <code>tmux</code>) as a terminal multiplexer and to provide persistence between SSH sessions. This was a problem for SSH agent forwarding: when I first SSH in and start a <code>screen</code> session, the <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> environment variable would be set. But when I logged in from somewhere else and reattached to the <code>screen</code> session, the <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> environment variable wouldn’t get updated, so SSH agent forwarding was broken until I started a new <code>screen</code> session.</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/martijnvermaat/8070533">This Gist</a> helped me fix this situation. There are a few parts to this solution. (The commands and configuration changes under this heading apply to servers you’ll SSH into.)</p>

<p>First, we have to have a location for our SSH agent socket that doesn’t change between logins. These few lines in <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/rc#L5-L7"><code>~/.ssh/rc</code></a> achieve this:</p>

<pre><code>if test "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ; then
    ln -sf "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ~/.ssh/sock/ssh_auth_sock
fi
</code></pre>

<p>Great! Then we just need clients to use this new, always-updated socket. To do this, we configure <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/dotfiles/blob/800ca4e760da36171643e8a116e038cc4c4dcf31/screen/.screenrc#L31-L32"><code>~/.screenrc</code></a> to set the environment variable <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code>:</p>

<pre><code>setenv SSH_AUTH_SOCK $HOME/.ssh/sock/ssh_auth_sock
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, we’ll also want to include <code>IdentityAgent ~/.ssh/sock/ssh_auth_sock</code> in our SSH configuration. We can do this by including the <code>homedir-ssh-auth-sock</code> configuration block within my <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example">modular SSH configuration</a> setup:</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/.ssh/config.local
ln -s ../config.templates/homedir-ssh-auth-sock .
</code></pre>

<h3>SSH agent forwarding when running commands under sudo</h3>

<p>When running a command with <code>sudo</code>, you’re working in a new environment; your user’s environment variables are not preserved. This will, of course, break SSH agent forwarding.</p>

<p>To solve this, we want to preserve the <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> environment variable when using <code>sudo</code>. (The commands and configuration changes under this heading apply to servers you’ll SSH into.)</p>

<p>Run <code>visudo</code> (as <code>root</code>) to edit your <code>sudoers</code> file, and add:</p>

<pre><code>Defaults&gt;root    env_keep+=SSH_AUTH_SOCK
</code></pre>

<p>This means that when using <code>sudo</code> to run a command as <code>root</code> (not as any other user), your <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> variable remains intact, and agent forwarding works as expected.</p>

<h3>SSH agent forwarding via <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> doesn’t work with GUI macOS apps</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ForkIssues/Tracker/issues/44">This issue in the Fork app’s issue tracker</a> was really helpful here. <code>.bashrc</code> and <code>.zshrc</code> don’t apply to GUI apps (unless you launch them from the terminal), so setting <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> <em>only</em> in shell configuration files won’t work.</p>

<p>This is why we need <code>IdentityAgent /usr/local/var/run/yubikey-agent.sock</code> in our SSH configuration. To enable this within my <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example">modular SSH configuration</a> setup:</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/.ssh/config.local
ln -s ../config.templates/yubikey-agent .
</code></pre>

<p>(This change applies to macOS client machines with attached Yubikeys.)</p>

<h3>Avoiding repeated mystery Yubikey prompts (using HTTPS for GitHub and Bitbucket repositories)</h3>

<p>After I set this up, my Yubikey would periodically blink as if I were trying to SSH into something, but I hadn’t tried to do anything with SSH! That was worrying, until I realized it was just <a href="https://fork.dev/">Fork</a> trying to update repository info in the background.</p>

<p>I decided to configure Git on my laptops to use HTTPS instead of SSH when communicating with GitHub and Bitbucket, so Fork can work in the background as it desires.</p>

<p>To do this, we’ll add the following to <code>~/.gitconfig</code>. (This …</p></article></div>

<p><i>PWAs are powerful, effective, fast and app-like. It's hard to imagine a mobile web property that could not be significantly improved via PWA implementation. They can also potentially eliminate the need for many vanity native apps that exist today. progressive web apps are for everyone, desktop and mobile users alike. I think it’s important to reiterate that there is no mobile web.</i></p>

<p>Progressive web apps have taken functionality from both native and web apps. They can run fast regardless of mobile operating systems and device types also providing rich functionality as if they were developed for a specific device. Thanks to easy installation, discoverability, automated updates, slow network or even the offline work mode, PWAs can enhance user experience.</p>

<h3 id="Low_Development_Costs">Low Development Costs</h3>
<p>PWAs do not require different versions for various devices; a single progressive app meets the requirements of all endpoints on which it operates. So, it significantly reduces the amount of efforts that developers provide, and as a result, the cost to create a PWA decreases. The cost is three or four times lower than that of a native mobile app.</p>

<section>
<h3 id="App_Like_Look_and_Feel">App-Like Look and Feel</h3>
<p>Nowadays, mobile users prefer apps to browsers as applications compare favorably with browsers, as they are more user-friendly, can operate offline and have a more attractive interface. Progressive web applications provide an advanced user experience by combining the look and feel of mobile applications and the best of website performance.</p>

 <section>
<h3 id="Fast_Installation">Fast Installation</h3>
<p>Unlike regular mobile applications, PWAs do not require a long and complex installation process, which significantly improves user experience. Users just download an app, quickly and directly to their devices, and they do not need to go to the App Store or Google Play. It streamlines the procedure and significantly reduces user abandonment.</p>

<p>Their performance is also not as good as the performance of native apps, which has a lot to do with the fact that JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language.

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>org-d20 is a minor mode for Emacs’ <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-mode</a>
for GMs running games whose rules centre around rolling d20s.  It
should be useful for <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> 3rd, 4th and 5th editions,
Paizo’s <em>Pathfinder</em>, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D20_System">d20 System</a> games like <em>d20
Modern</em>.</p>

<p>The idea is that you’re already keeping your campaign notes in an
Org-mode file.  This minor mode does useful things for you while you
are visiting that buffer.  For example,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>rolling dice, with 5e’s advantage and disadvantage displayed in case
those are needed;</p></li>
<li><p>tracking combat turns and rounds right next to your existing
description of the monsters and the terrain.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The minor mode’s defaults suit the way that I run D&amp;D 5e.  Patches to
add <code>defcustoms</code> to make org-d20 more suitable for other games, and
other sets of house rules, are welcome.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Users of Debian 12 or later or Ubuntu 21.04 or later can use <code>apt-get install
elpa-org-d20</code>.  Otherwise, you may copy <a href="https://git.spwhitton.name/org-d20/tree/org-d20.el"><code>org-d20.el</code></a> to somewhere in your

            <p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wedding-website/image/upload/c_scale,w_2400/v1597095361/krzysztof-grech-6orUY98fw9s-unsplash_r6wjnf.jpg"></p>



<p>I’ve struggled to find references to this online, but heard the name used multiple times this year when describing the approach outlined here.</p>

<p>The general idea of an “Islands” architecture is deceptively simple: render HTML pages on the server, and inject placeholders or slots around highly dynamic regions. These placeholders/slots contain the server-rendered HTML output from their corresponding widget. They denote regions that can then be "hydrated" on the client into small self-contained widgets, reusing their server-rendered initial HTML.</p>

<p>You can think of this like a static HTML document that contains multiple separate embedded applications:</p>

<p>  
<img width="600" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wedding-website/image/upload/v1596766231/islands-architecture-1.png">  
</p>

<p>This may seem similar to "micro-frontends" at first glance. Both approaches share the idea of breaking applications up into independent units, however "micro-frontends" do not typically imply that composition of those units is achieved using HTML.</p>

<p>A closer analog to the "islands" approach would be progressive enhancement, to which we're essentially adding SSR hydration and a consistent metaphor for adding interactivity to a region of the page. In traditional progressive enhancement, we might have a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> that looks for an image carousel in the page and instantiates a jQuery plugin on it. Instead, that image carousel would be rendered on the server and a dedicated <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> emitted for it that loads the image carousel implementation and in-place upgrades it to be interactive.</p>

<h3 id="whydoesthismatter">Why does this matter?</h3>

<p>As it turns out, there are a number of benefits to the group of approaches described here when compared to typical Single Page Application architectures.</p>

<h5 id="progressivehydrationforfree">"Progressive Hydration" for free</h5>

<p>I’ve touted the performance benefits of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-A2VfuUROg">Progressive Hydration</a> techniques for frameworks like React, Angular, Preact and Vue. With these architectures, individual widgets on a page are loaded and initialized over time. This can be done using a simple scheduling approach via requestIdleCallback, or can take additional factors into account like viewport visibility, interaction likelihood, product value, etc.</p>

<p>Similar to Progressive Hydration, rendering pages using an islands architecture results in the heavier dynamic portions of the page being initialized not just progressively, but <em>separately</em>. This means individual regions of the page become interactive without anything else on the page needing to be loaded first.</p>

<p>Unlike Progressive Hydration, the approaches that fall out of building around an islands architecture do not require top-down rendering. This is a distinct advantage, since there are no outer “root” components that must be initialized before their descendants. Each part of the page is an isolated unit, and a performance issue in one unit doesn't affect the others.</p>

<h5 id="seoanduxarentatradeoff">SEO and UX aren’t a tradeoff</h5>

<p>The status quo for SSR as used by Single Page Applications is that it’s often cited as a necessity for SEO reasons. However, SSR can actually have a net <em>negative</em> impact on User Experience - visitors are left waiting for the actual functionality of a page to arrive while staring at a frustratingly fake version of that page.</p>

<p>Many applications also suffer from silent SSR performance pitfalls without realizing it. In virtual DOM libraries, it's easy (and common) to accidentally construct a situation where first render destroys the server-rendered HTML DOM, only to recreate it again from scratch (often synchronously). This is the result of some common misconceptions, which may stem from documentation giving an idealized view of hydration while passing over tricky caveats and footguns.</p>

<p>Even in cases where SSR hydration is functioning as designed, the status quo leaves a lot to be desired. The amount of JavaScript work being performed during page load is still many orders of magnitude more than what might be considered "efficient".</p>

<p>In an "islands" model, server rendering is not a bolt-on optimization aimed at improving SEO or UX. Instead, it is a fundamental part of how pages are delivered to the browser. The HTML returned in response to navigation contains a meaningful and immediately renderable representation of the content the user requested.</p>

<p>Sections of that HTML may be missing their client-side interactivity, but the document should at least contain the most essential content. For example: a news page’s HTML would contain the article body, and a product page would contain that product’s description.</p>

<p>All of the other content is secondary to this information, and its inclusion in the HTML becomes a product decision. How vital is this bit of information to a user visiting the page? How important is that widget to the business model? A "buy now" button that directly relates to revenue should be easily prioritized over a site feedback survey button that relates to information gathering.</p>

<h5 id="betterforaccessibilityanddiscoverability">Better for accessibility and discoverability</h5>

<p>A website that uses standard HTML links for navigation is easier for assistive technologies and web crawlers to use. This is true regardless of whether links or forms are intercepted by JavaScript and rerouted to client-side logic, because the underlying assumptions remain true: clicking a link navigates to the given page.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, think of the number of times you’ve been sent a “link” to what the sender assumed was the page they were viewing, only to realize the link contained none of the necessary information:</p>

<p>  
<img width="350" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wedding-website/image/upload/v1596766231/islands-architecture-3.png">  
</p>

<p>Building page-based applications doesn't completely prevent these types of strange experiences, it only makes the decision to do so more direct. It makes the default outcome the accessible one.</p>

<hr>

<p>When it comes down to it, shipping an architecture that requires less code to do something is the type of long-term benefit your future self (or coworkers) will thank you for. It's possible — likely, even — that adopting a model like this requires more up-front design thinking. There are far few batteries-included options available for decomposing apps into independently deliverable widgets. Who knows, maybe we can fix that.</p>

			<p><span>For almost as long as we’ve been tracking the COVID-19 pandemic, sf.citi has been closely monitoring the San Francisco tech exodus. Of course, some of the forces driving this phenomenon—remote work and the growing appeal of cities beyond San Francisco—predate 2020. Few can argue, however, that the pandemic has accelerated these trends. What we’re seeing today is nothing short of a mass migration of tech companies and tech employees outside of the San Francisco Bay Area.</span></p>
<p><span>To help you keep up with fast-moving data surrounding the San Francisco tech exodus, sf.citi created an all-in-one resource. Below, you’ll find the latest insights about tech’s relocation, the economic implications of a tech exodus in San Francisco, and context around the policies that have led us to where we are today.</span></p>
<p><i><span>Is there information or data about the San Francisco tech exodus you think we’re missing? Let us know by emailing </span></i><a href="mailto:info@sfciti.org"><i><span>info@sfciti.org</span></i></a><i><span>. </span></i><i><span>For media inquiries, please contact sf.citi Marketing and Communications Manager Jacqueline McGraw at </span></i><a href="mailto:jacqueline@sfciti.org"><i><span>jacqueline@sfciti.org</span></i></a><i><span>.&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<li>According to <a href="https://www.cushmanwakefield.com/en/united-states/insights/us-marketbeats/us-office-marketbeat-reports">data from Cushman &amp; Wakefield</a>, San Francisco’s office vacancy rate has risen to 16.7 percent, surpassing levels after both the 2008 Great Recession and the dot-com bust. San Francisco also recorded the lowest level of new leasing activity since at least the 1990s.</li>
<li>The Bay Area’s proportion of VC deal count in 2021 is expected to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/14/silicon-valleys-share-of-venture-capital-may-drop-below-20percent-in-2021.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fall below 20 percent</a> for the first time in history. “The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent exodus from San Francisco will only exacerbate this trend,” writes VC analyst Kyle Stanford in PitchBook’s <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q4-2020-pitchbook-analyst-note-2021-us-venture-capital-outlook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021 US Venture Capital Outlook report</a>.</li>

<li><span>Near the end of 2020, City Controller Ben Rosenfield announced that San Francisco had not met its projected tax revenue targets, and the City faces an </span><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/local-politics/article/S-F-City-Hall-faces-another-big-budget-deficit-15717821.php"><span>additional budget deficit of $116 million</span></a><span>. That’s on top of the $1.5 billion budget deficit the City had to close in 2020. And in a </span><a href="https://sfcontroller.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Budget/Five%20Year%20Financial%20Plan%20FY21-22%20through%20FY%2025-26.pdf"><span>five-year budget forecast</span></a><span>, the City Controller’s Office predicts hundreds of millions of dollars in budget shortfalls over the next five years due to a widening gap between the City’s revenues and expenses.</span></li>
<li><span>Current and future San Francisco budget deficits are directly tied to losses in hotel, business, and sales taxes. The San Francisco Business Times </span><a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2021/02/05/0205-foc-sanfrancisco.html"><span>reported</span></a><span> that the City expected close to $1.5 billion in business taxes in 2019-2020 but ended the fiscal year $228 million under budget.</span></li>
<li>From April to June 2020, revenue from San Francisco’s local sales tax dropped to <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/S-F-sales-tax-data-shows-likely-population-15632448.php">$30.8 million</a>, a decrease of 43 percent from 2019. Stay-at-home orders resulted in steep declines in brick-and-mortar sales taxes throughout the Bay Area. All of the counties surrounding San Francisco, however, saw increases in online sales taxes while San Francisco registered only a <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Yes-people-are-leaving-San-Francisco-After-15635160.php">1 percent increase</a>—the worst showing among California’s 20 largest counties. Speaking to the <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/S-F-sales-tax-data-shows-likely-population-15632448.php">San Francisco Chronicle,</a> San Francisco Chief Economist Ted Egan attributes the drop in revenue to “tech people moving.”</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://altcampus.school/images/posts/4-systems-learn-programming-faster-altcampus.png" alt="Systems to learn programming faster"></p>
<h3>1. Learn in public</h3>
<p>Learning in public means sharing whatever you are learning publicly. It could be through tweets, blog posts, videos, cartoons etc. The idea is to teach whatever you have learnt or share whatever you have created.</p>
<p>It helps in keeping you accountable, consistent and motivated. You increase the surface area of getting feedback and networking with other.</p>
<p>Here are a few things that you can do to get started</p>
<ul>
<li>Tweet everyday about your progress</li>
<li>Write blog posts on whatever you have learnt</li>
</ul>
<p>To get inspiration, look at the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=AltCampus">students of AltCampus tweeting their progress publicly</a>.</p>
<p>To learn more about this idea, read this fantastic article - <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/">learning in public</a></p>
<h3>2. Solve the problem on the paper</h3>
<p>One of the biggest problems with newbies is that they are just so excited to write code that they jump into the text editor the minute they have a problem statement. The problem with this approach is that you are actually not taking the time out to understand and think about the solution of the problem.</p>
<p>Resist the temptation of writing code straightaway. Code is nothing but a medium to implement the solution. Actual solution is in the thought process and the approach that you take.</p>
<p>Always keep a pen and paper handy when you are learning. Anytime you get a problem, understand it, break it down. Write. Draw. Write steps in plain words, also called pseudo code. Solve the problem on the paper first. Once you know what the right approach is, start converting the pseudo code into actual code in your text editor.</p>
<h3>3. Find a feedback mechanism, someone to give you feedback or do code review</h3>
<p>If you are not good at something how do you know if what you are doing is actually good or if you are improving at all?</p>
<p>What helps is having someone senior to give you constructive feedback. Feedback on what you are doing right, wrong. Feedback on how to improve the structure of your code.</p>
<p>When you have someone to get feedback from, you know what you need to fix and thus your pace of learning increases. This idea of getting feedback and then acting on it and again seeking feedback is called feedback loop. The shorter the loop in time frame, the faster you learn.</p>
<p>At AltCampus we focus heavily on feedback. Mentors provide regular feedback to students on a granular level like assignments and checkpoints.</p>
<h3>4.  Actually build something. Don't be in tutorial hell.</h3>
<p>A problem with newbies that they keep switching from one tutorial to another, one course to another, without actually using the knowledge to build something. This is partly because most of the courses just focus on delivering concepts via video or text. Assignments and projects are missing.</p>
<p>The actual learning happens when you are using those concepts to build a project. For e.g. if you recently learnt about tags, elements etc in HTML, did you actually use to build a webpage from scratch?</p>
<p>Don't be stuck in tutorial hell. Pick a good course that has everything in it and then build stuff. Building accelerates your pace of putting things together. Building is where fun and learning is.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h3>What are NFTs?</h3>
<p>Non-fungible token (NFT) is a term used to describe a unique digital asset whose ownership is tracked on a blockchain, such as Ethereum. Assets that can be represented as NFTs range from digital goods, such as items that exist within virtual worlds, to claims on physical assets such as clothing items or real estate. In the coming years, we will see NFTs used to unlock entirely new use cases that are only made possible by crypto.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9799dae1-c2c9-4712-813b-10b23c279a36.jpeg" alt="Tokens redeemable for real world goods on Zora"></p><figcaption>Tokens redeemable for real world goods on Zora</figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Ethereum ecosystem is where most NFT activity has taken place to date, NFTs can exist on other smart contract platforms too. This is because, at their core, NFTs are just digital abstractions used to represent assets that are one of a kind. Non-fungible token isn’t the most intuitive term since we don’t commonly refer to the fungibility of objects in the physical world, but this is an important technical distinction when it comes to how an asset is represented on a blockchain. The goal for this post is not to detail every project within the NFT space, but to give a high level overview of what NFTs are, why they are interesting, and showcase some of their potential use cases.</p>
<h3>Why are NFTs interesting?</h3>
<p>NFTs are powerful because, when combined with other financial building blocks on Ethereum, they allow anyone to issue, own, and trade them. This makes interacting with NFTs significantly more efficient than in traditional platforms. The same reason why cryptocurrency used in payments is more efficient than traditional payments, that it is borderless and significantly easier to transfer, applies to NFTs. For example, if you want to create tradable in-game items as a game developer, then you can instantly have them be tradable through protocols that allow for decentralized exchange of NFTs. You don’t have to create your own marketplace or go through the onboarding process of a centralized platform in order to have the items be tradable.</p>
<p>NFT activity can go well past trading and include actions like being able to borrow and lend, support fractional ownership (e.g. <a href="https://www.niftex.com/">NIFTEX</a>), or use it as collateral in taking out a loan (e.g. <a href="https://nftfi.com/">NFTfi</a>). The possibilities are endless when you have the ability to combine NFTs with DeFi building blocks. For example, the game <a href="http://aavegotchi.com/">Aavegotchi</a> combines DeFi and NFT gaming where each Aavegotchi character represents a user’s collateral that is deposited within the lending platform <a href="https://aave.com/">Aave</a>, but you can also battle the characters, level them up, and equip wearables that change their traits.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a1259686-6b61-455a-a204-f6e6da648f10.jpeg" alt="Aavegotchi gaming attributes change based on actions taken in DeFi"></p><figcaption>Aavegotchi gaming attributes change based on actions taken in DeFi</figcaption></figure>
<p>NFTs can cover an extremely wide variety of areas given they are simply digital representations of ownership but there has been significant growth within art and gaming in particular. Note that many digital works of art and gaming items are a subset of a larger category of NFT collectibles. There is also the emerging space of social tokens, which sometimes falls into the NFT category or that is closely related to it.</p>
<h3>Art</h3>
<p>NFTs can make fractionalized ownership more accessible, so if there is a valuable item that otherwise wouldn’t have been accessible for someone to own, now they can own a piece of it. Custody of a physical item still requires a trustworthy custodian, but being able to issue, hold, and trade it as a cryptoasset unlocks more use cases. One can also craft an NFT such that the creator receives a percentage of all secondary sales in a completely automated way. Artists typically don’t receive a cut of secondary sales in the traditional art world.</p>
<p>Programmable art is another interesting concept where a piece of artwork can incorporate on-chain data to dynamically update certain features or characteristics of the work. For example, one could create a piece of programmable art whose background changes if the price of ether goes above a certain dollar-value. There are countless creative possibilities.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a51670c0-4a1c-4aaf-917d-0e551855b56d.jpeg" alt="Rutger van der Tas artwork that changes based on if it’s day or night"></p><figcaption>Rutger van der Tas artwork that changes based on if it’s day or night</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://async.art/">Async Art</a> is a digital art marketplace known for programmable art. Many artists on Async sell artwork where someone is able to own the “master” copy which consists of a number of individual layers, but other people can own the individual layers and adjust their attributes over time. Imagine groups of people being able to own art collectively, where members of the group manage attributes of the work.</p>

<p>A common question about digital artwork is what can you do with it? These works can be displayed in digital frames in a physical setting for people to enjoy. The digital artist Beeple sold physical tokens along with his digital NFTs and made <a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x6e5dc5405baefb8c0166bcc78d2692777f2cbffb/21">$3.5 million</a> from sales in an auction on the Nifty Gateway marketplace.</p>

<p>Digital artwork can also be displayed in online collections like a <a href="https://superrare.co/thevault/collection">SuperRare profile</a> as well as in virtual worlds. There are a number of art galleries within <a href="http://cryptovoxels.com/">Cryptovoxels</a>, a virtual world where users can buy and sell land parcels as NFTs. As virtual reality spaces become more popular, having digital art to display will become more common. This wouldn’t be much different than someone spending money on video game items to customize a character’s appearance, already a multi-billion dollar industry.</p>

<p>A common skepticism is that someone can just take a screenshot of the image or get a digital file so it’s not really scarce. However, the same argument could apply to physical items as well. Anyone can take a photo of the Mona Lisa or create a replica of it, but it isn’t the real item from the artist. People are willing to pay a premium for the original work. Another interesting aspect of digital art or collectibles is that you can easily verify the item’s ownership history. Some digital items might be worth more depending on who owned it in the past.</p>
<p>With NFTs, you can also prove that the item is real and tamper proof. This is an issue in the physical collectibles space. For example, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T206_Honus_Wagner">T206 Honus Wagner baseball card</a> was sold to Wayne Gretzky for $451k and sold again for several million dollars. One of the sellers of the card later admitted in court to trimming the card’s edges to make it look better. You can ensure NFT supply doesn’t change and there’s no counterfeit or continued printing. For example, there are many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAvLC3fz068&amp;">counterfeit Black Lotus</a> cards in the popular game Magic: The Gathering. Common verification methods include bending the card to make sure it doesn’t crease or going through centralized grading services whose rating significantly affects the card's value.</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>Steam, a popular video game platform, has a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/?">Community Market</a> where in-game items can be bought and sold. Steam’s marketplace is centralized and collects a transaction fee of 5% for each item from the buyer. Games like Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2 take an additional fee of 10% for their items sold.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4ad85fcf-b986-4b60-9fb5-925200fde3a9.jpeg" alt="Steam Community Market"></p><figcaption>Steam Community Market</figcaption></figure>
<p>Steam also restricts user wallet balances to $2,000 and the price of a single item to $1,800. While these cases are outliers, many in-game items can actually sell for significantly larger amounts such as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-11-06-dota-2-pink-war-dog-courier-sells-for-38-000.html">DotA 2 pink war dog courier</a> for $38,000. Within the crypto space there have also been high priced sales such as the $170,000 <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/09/05/most-expensive-cryptokitty/">CryptoKitty</a>. Similarly Magic: The Gathering’s coveted <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/5/18251623/magic-the-gathering-black-lotus-auction-price">Black Lotus</a> card sold for $166,100. There is certainly demand for valuable in-game items. In decentralized marketplaces, there isn’t a limit imposed on what game items can be sold and for what amount.</p>
<p>Decentralized marketplaces can significantly reduce transaction fees due to the improved efficiency of starting up and operating a marketplace. Marketplaces can also improve overall user experience and increase interest in the game. Hearthstone is a wildly popular digital collectible card game created by Blizzard Entertainment that had over <a href="https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/hearthstone-has-over-100-million-players-1203019919/">100 million players</a> in 2018. Hearthstone opted to not have a marketplace for their cards which leaves opportunity for other digital collectible card games that allow for an open marketplace. <a href="https://godsunchained.com/">Gods Unchained</a> and <a href="https://www.skyweaver.net/">SkyWeaver</a> are two trading card games (TCGs) that have cards that are freely tradable. You are also able to earn cards as you level up in the game. Players that did not purchase packs of cards will still be able to improve upon the game’s default decks. It’s an exciting feeling knowing that the earned cards have real world value and can be sold or traded for other cards. Gods Unchained also lets users earn tokens for when they win a match or refer their friend. The tokens themselves unlock rare in-game items and are also freely tradable.</p>

<p>One of the most popular games in crypto is <a href="https://axieinfinity.com/">Axie Infinity</a>. You battle with a team of pet Axies and level them up. There's no aspect of the gameplay that feels like a blockchain game but there is the added benefit of being able to openly trade the Axies on NFT marketplaces such as <a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a>. The game has become popular in the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nft-game-filipinos-covid">Philippines</a> and earning tokens from the game has become a viable source of income for players even <a href="https://www.playtoearn.online/2020/07/08/axie-infinity-beats-minimum-wage-in-many-countries/">beating minimum wage</a> in many countries. There is also a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called <a href="https://yieldguild.io/">Yield Guild Games</a> which leases Axies to players that want to get started with the game but don’t have the funds to purchase them. Several rare Axies were even <a href="https://www.delphidigital.io/reports/why-we-spent-159k-on-digital-battle-pets-2/">purchased</a> for $159,000 total.</p>

<p>There’s another popular game <a href="https://zkga.me/">Dark Forest</a> where you can explore different planets and collect Artifact NFTs on new planets, which give bonuses when attached to the planet. Being able to discover and collect these items or even win them in a battle and then trade them in decentralized marketplaces can make the game even more fun.</p>

<p>Dear new developer,</p>



<p>If you don’t know what you don’t know, it’s hard to learn it. There are so many resources for learning, but if you can’t find them, you’re going to have a hard time taking advantage of them. Sometimes you need to spend time learning what you need to spend time learning. That is to say, you need to learn the broad outlines of a segment of knowledge before diving in.</p>



<p>This time spent prepping your understanding of swathes of a domain will be useful because it will accelerate your learning in the future, letting you grasp concepts and find resources more quickly.</p>



<p>Let’s say I got hired by a company to write a compiler, which would be a new area of software for me. Here are some things I would do if I were trying to learn this new domain. </p>



<p><strong>Glossaries</strong></p>



<p>I’d look for some glossaries about compiler design. Here’s the <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/novak/cs375vocab.html">first result</a> from Google when I search for “compiler design glossary”. Reading this would help me understand the meaning of words I might know from other contexts, such as “array” and “value”, but would encounter when reading more about compilers. Knowing the jargon of a domain is extremely helpful when you are searching to see whose shoulders you can stand on, as well as communicating with your team members.</p>



<p><strong>Pattern match</strong></p>



<p>Matching patterns is something I’ve done many times. I take something I understand fairly well and see whether it matches up to a new concept, domain, or technology. In this case, I might read about a compiler for parsing regular expressions. I understand how regular expressions work as an end user, so it won’t be as much of a leap as if I were to try to study a compiler for C. Here’s a <a href="https://kean.blog/post/lets-build-regex">search result</a> that I might work through.</p>



<p><strong>Books and videos</strong></p>



<p>If I have time, books and videos can be very helpful at getting a wider view of a domain. Sometimes it’s hard to know which book or video to invest your time in. By looking at reviews on sites like Amazon and Youtube, you can leverage the wisdom of many people. I’d probably <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=compiler+design&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2">start with one of the top books here</a>, were I to need to jump into compiler design. When I do this, I don’t feel the need to read the entire book or watch every minute of the video. </p>



<p><strong>Twitter</strong></p>



<p>You can use Twitter to “get smart quick” too. Basically, you can follow folks who are highly regarded by other folks in the same domain. Wesley did a great job of explaining it, so I’ll just point you to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/bu9bo5bpyjxhtas/AACIKdI_wmU5XBhfTZ61oAZBa?dl=0&amp;preview=Wesley+Faulkner+%26+Lorna+Mitchell%3A+Twitter+Strategies.mp4">this video</a>. You want to watch between 15:53 and 20:00, where he talks about getting smart around “quantum computing”. Once you know who to follow on Twitter because they are respected by the community, you can start figuring out the words and concepts they use.</p>



<p><strong>Follow some rabbits down holes</strong></p>



<p>I’m a big fan of timeboxing investigations, and I always tell team members I am mentoring that they shouldn’t spin their wheels too long; far better to ask a team member. But sometimes, when you are exploring a new domain, you should spin your wheels a bit. Follow some paths and see if they end up where you thought, or if they were dead ends. In this stage of knowledge gathering, there are no wasted efforts. Any time you “waste” investigating or following some threads of discussion will compound and save you time in the future. Do take some notes, either mental or written (I like a blog post, <a href="http://www.mooreds.com/wordpress/archives/3144">as I did here</a>). Don’t feel like you need to come up with any firm answers. And feel free to timebox it, just make the time limit higher than it would be if you were actually trying to solve a problem. </p>



<p><strong>Take a class</strong></p>



<p>One time I was working on a project at a real estate brokerage where we wanted to do statistical analysis on property data. I didn’t have much background on it, so I ended up taking a free class from Coursera. This is a substantial time investment, but for foundational knowledge that you can leverage across other parts of your life (I’m a lot more suspicious of stats I see now), the additional time can be worth it. </p>



<p>Pick the technique that resonates with you next time you have to get smart quickly about a topic or technology. Spend some time investing in your upfront knowledge and I promise it will pay dividends as you dig deeper.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Dan</p>

February 8, 2021 | https://applieddivinitystudies.com/FRO/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://applieddivinitystudies.com/FRO/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p>After arguing that <a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/corporate-lab-death/">industrial research labs won’t return</a>, I was hopeful for a new mechanism to reignite transformative research, but had no idea what it would actually be.</p>
<p>A couple hours later, Nintil told me about Focused Research Organizations.</p>
<p>In short: FROs promise to pair government funding with startup agility, and a mandate to&nbsp;pursue high-impact pre-commercial research. There isn’t a lot of literature out on them yet, but it’s a compelling proposal. [0]</p>
<p>Going into this, it’s worth noting that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/AdamMarblestone/status/1336854454612746240">Adam explicitly says</a> FROs are not a replacement for existing institutions, but they might be good at the margin. Specifically, the proposed budget is $1 billion over 5-7 years, around 0.3% of all federal R&amp;D funding.</p>
<p>As with everything, I have a lot of criticism, but let me start by saying that I’m excited! We need new ideas, and actually experimenting with funding models will help us advance much faster than musing in a vacuum. The existing systems are filled with their own flaws, and I’m not attempting a cost-benefit analysis, so nothing critical I say should be taken to mean that I am net negative.</p>
<p>But first, what does Adam actually envision?</p>
<h3 id="Summary-of-the-FRO-Proposal"><a href="#Summary-of-the-FRO-Proposal" title="Summary of the FRO Proposal"></a>Summary of the FRO Proposal</h3><p>The bulk of Adam’s thinking is laid out in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dayoneproject.org/post/focused-research-organizations-to-accelerate-science-technology-and-medicine">FRO Whitepaper</a>. There’s also some discussion in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ideamachinespodcast.com/adam-marblestone-ii">Idea Machines Podcast</a>, and a bit more in a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VdmAqoEvF0">talk</a> he gave with Nintil a couple months ago.</p>
<p>The core proposal: “Startup-like organizations, but pursuing pure science outcomes with no market.” In another venue, Adam describes them as “a special purpose organization to pursue a defined problem over a finite period of time.”</p>
<p>Or expressed negatively: FROs target projects that cannot be addressed by any existing organization or funding mechanism. The university system is massive, receiving around $40 billion in federal funding each year. <a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/corporate-lab-death/">Last time</a>, I argued that this was one of the principle reasons behind the death and continued absence of industrial research labs. Why pay to innovate in-house when there’s a $40 billion in research happening for free?</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://byrnehobart.medium.com/reasoning-from-first-principles-the-dumbest-thing-smart-people-do-46ff1cbba867">Reasoning backwards from other people’s first principles</a> is precisely the way to get around this. Adam understands the university system deeply, knows what it’s mechanisms cannot produce, and aims to directly target the research that can’t currently happen.</p>
<p>You can think about this through analogy to startups. A small team of 2 founders with $125k in funding could never reasonably compete with Google head-on. The first step for many pitch decks is to explain why, if the idea is actually good, it hasn’t already been done. [1]</p>
<p>So where do universities and corporate labs systematically fail? Adam argues it’s projects which “require levels of coordinated engineering or system-building inaccessible to academia” and “benefit society broadly in ways that industry cannot rapidly monetize”. Stated elsewhere, he says the fundamental tension is between academic settings which incentivize individual achievement over team coordination, and industry organizations which are better at teamwork, but don’t aim to produce public goods.</p>
<p>It’s worth being really clear about what this last claim requires. It’s not that Adam is condemning startups or capitalism, or that he believes industry never produces public goods. The argument is merely that there are some projects, at the margin, which:</p>
<ol>
<li>Require teamwork and cross-disciplinarity</li>
<li>Only make sense if you intrinsically value the resulting public good</li>
</ol>
<p>In this sense, rather than the abstract basic/translational/applied trichotomy, Adam talks about projects that are “pre-commercial” or don’t have a clear path to monetization in the short-term. [2]</p>
<p>That’s the narrative about why FROs ought to exist in the presence of existing organizations. But how do they actually work?</p>
<p>The federal government (or philanthropist) commits $1 billion over 5-7 years, paid out to 16 projects, each with a focused research charter. These ought to be time-bound, and there should be a clearly defined end goal that results if the project is successful. The whitepaper also notes that each should be led top-down by a CEO in the style of startups, rather than by committee or by a decentralized collective of loosely affiliated researchers.</p>
<p>The initial line sums it up pretty well. An FROs is a government-funded organization, run like a startup, focused on pre-comercial science, operating over a finite time horizon.</p>
<p>Startups are great, but we should understand them ecologically: the result of a precarious balance held in place by a surrounding ecosystem. Swap out one part, and you don’t get “startups but for X”, you get a hot mess. [3]</p>
<p>Adam proposes taking startups, and making the following modifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of a profit motive, FROs follow a scientific charter</li>
<li>Instead of pivoting as they run the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cdixon.org/2013/08/04/the-idea-maze">idea maze</a>, FROs have a specific predetermined goal</li>
<li>Instead of market signals and user validation, work is guided top-down by a CEO</li>
<li>Instead of VCs who compete for opportunities and bet against each other, the only funding agent is the federal government</li>
</ul>
<p>I worry that any one of these substitutions would be fatal, and it’s not clear that they collectively bring us to a new stable equilibrium.</p>
<p>While there are some <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.figma.com/blog/design-on-a-deadline-how-notion-pulled-itself-back-from-the-brink-of-failure/">legends</a> of startups that worked hermetically for a year or two, it’s hard to think of tech companies that were pre-commercial for 5-7 years, and maintained an attachment to reality. The famous anecdotes all turned out to be <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporware">vaporware</a> or massively over-hyped (Theranos, Magic Leap).</p>
<p>Another concern is with leadership. Startups are able to move quickly by vesting their CEO with dictatorial power [4], but they’re ultimately beholden to metrics. There is centralized power and a cult of personality, but their authority still stems from each employee’s faith in growth, validated against a steady exponential growth in valuation, revenue and/or user base.</p>
<p>It’s possible FROs could supplant the entire process with a rigorously predefined scientific charter. In one podcast, Adam mentions literally using “characters sequenced” as a measure of progress for the human genome project. The whitepaper states that in general, “FROs should [be] driven by quantitative metrics and/or concrete design goals”.</p>
<p>This also addresses a key concern over any transformative research: measuring impact. If a result is novel, there’S no point of comparison by definition, and no way of justifying the costs relative to an expected baseline. Even if the work does end up being impactful, it might be 20 years down the line. Running the entire program around a focused charter and quantifiable outputs alleviates some of these concerns. We still won’t know if the chosen projects were the right one, but we’ll at least find out of the program succeeded on its own merits.</p>
<p>If executed correctly, this would provide accountability for the CEO as well, in the same way that growth metrics provide accountability to founders. With a sufficiently well-defined goal, there’s little ambiguity over how well the company is being run.</p>
<p>Finally, I worry about risk. Though the Startup Ecosystem works perfectly well, we have to distinguish between the broader trends and individual firms. At the micro level, each startup is dysfunctional and overwhelmingly likely to fail. Part of this stems from market dynamics, but it’s also the nature of a scrappy ambitious project with a centralized authority and thus a single-point of failure. The exact failure rate depends on your reference population, but a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=startup+failure+rate&amp;oq=startup+failure+rate&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.2017j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">commonly cited estimate is 90%</a>.</p>
<p>If this holds true for FROs, a 16 project portfolio would still have a 19% chance of total failure. Trial and error is the nature of scientific discovery, but the greater harm might be a vast chilling effect on future experimental models.</p>
<p>Doubling the scale of FROs to 32 would get us down to a 3% chance of total failure, and going up 10x to 160 projects would get us down to a mere 0.0000047%.</p>
<p>The expected value doesn’t change, but that doesn’t matter if like startups, FROs are a hits-based enterprise. In venture capital, one big win pays for the entire portfolio. In FROs, one human genome project [5] or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome#:~:text=A%20connectome%20(%2Fk%C9%99%CB%88,an%20organism's%20nervous%20system.">connectome</a> could justify the entire budget.</p>
<p>Even then, the whole proposal would amount to just 3% of federal R&amp;D, and only for the brief 5-7 year trial period. [6]</p>
<p><strong>In summary:</strong> FROs are promising, and the program should be 10 times bigger. [7]</p>
<hr>
<p>Thanks to Adam Marblestone to reviewing a draft of this post.</p>
<p>For the original proposal, see his <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dayoneproject.org/post/focused-research-organizations-to-accelerate-science-technology-and-medicine">whitepaper</a> with Sam Rodriques.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Footnotes</strong><br>[0] Adam mentions over email that these could also be philanthropy-funded. In the Idea Machines podcast, he and Ben express some concern over salary-restrictions in government-run projects. Taking Patrick<a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/corporate-lab-death/"> Collison’s notes</a> on the importance of compensation, it’s worth wondering if FROs are even possible with government funding.</p>
<p>Having said that, ARPA-E does give grants to private companies who (I assume) can set their own salaries. I’m not sure exactly where the line is, or if the distinction is between government-funded versus government-run, or if there’s any room for exceptions.</p>
<p>[1] Learning where tech giants systematically fail is an underappreciated reason to get a corporate job for a few years before setting out on your own.</p>
<p>[2] The short-termism of Venture Capital is overstated. You can find an arbitrary number of companies passed up for investment because they lacked a path to monetization, but there are compelling counter examples that suggest VCs are willing to make long term bets so long as the payoff is sufficiently large. Consider Magic Leap, which was founded in 2010 and didn’t have a commercial product until 2018. It’s now considered a failure, but that makes an even stronger case of VC long-termism. They’re willing to fund speculative, long-term, unproven pre-commercial technologies, even when (empirically) there is significant risk of failure.</p>
<p>How does this happen? One answer is that VCs are not actually long-termist, they just get tricked into making long-term …</p></div></div>

						<p>The 21st century has seen some phenomenal advances in our ability to make scientific discoveries. Scientists have developed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243">new technology</a> to build vaccines swiftly, <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">new algorithms</a> to predict the structure of proteins accurately, <a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/DNA-Sequencing-Costs-Data">new equipment</a> to sequence DNA rapidly, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/energy-and-environment/2020/10/21/21515461/renewable-energy-geothermal-egs-ags-supercritical">new engineering solutions</a> to harvest energy efficiently. But in many fields of science, reliable knowledge and progress advance <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/diminishing-returns-science/575665/">staggeringly</a> <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/11/is-the-rate-of-scientific-progress-slowing-down.html">slowly</a>. What slows it down? And what can we learn from individual fields of science to pick up the pace across the board – without compromising on quality?</p>
<p>By and large, scientific research is published in journals in the form of papers – static documents that do not update with new data or new methods. Instead of sharing the data and the code that produces their results, most scientists simply publish a textual description of their research in online publications. These publications are usually hidden behind paywalls, making it harder for outsiders to verify their authenticity.</p>
<p>On the occasion when a reader spots a discrepancy in the data or an error in the methods, they must read the intricate details of a study’s method scrupulously, and cross-check the statistics manually. When scientists don’t share the data to produce their results openly, the task becomes even harder. The process of error correction – from scientists publishing a paper, to readers spotting errors, to having the paper corrected or retracted – can take <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/04/26/university-asked-numerous-retractions-eight-months-later-three-journals-done-nothing/">years</a>, assuming those errors are spotted at all.</p>
<p>When scientists reference previous research, they cite entire papers, not specific results or values from them. And although there is <a href="https://mattsclancy.substack.com/p/does-science-self-correct">evidence</a> that scientists hold back from citing papers once they have been retracted, the problem is compounded over time – consider, for example, a researcher who cites a study that itself derives its data or assumptions from prior research that has been disputed, corrected or retracted. The longer it takes to sift through the science, to identify which results are accurate, the longer it takes to gather an understanding of scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>What makes the problem even more challenging is that flaws in a study are not necessarily mathematical errors. In many situations, researchers make fairly arbitrary decisions as to how they collect their data, which methods they apply to analyse them, and which results they report – altogether leaving readers blind to the impact of these decisions on the results.</p>
<p>This murkiness can result in what is known as p-hacking: when researchers selectively apply arbitrary methods in order to achieve a particular result. For example, in a study that compares the well-being of overweight people to that of underweight people, researchers may find that certain cut-offs of weight (or certain subgroups in their sample) provide the result they’re looking for, while others don’t. And they may decide to only publish the particular methods that provided that result.</p>
<p>If a reader can’t find out how different versions of a study method have affected the results, how are they to know whether the finding really was robust – that it would be found regardless of how the data was looked at?</p>
<p>Now, it’s common to assume that these errors and flaws are largely smoothed out during the process of peer review, where peer scientists are asked to scrutinise a study and recommend to journal editors whether it should be revised or even published at all. But unfortunately peer review often fails to accomplish this, as the scientist Stuart Ritchie has described in his book <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250222695"><i>Science Fictions</i></a>.</p>
<p>Substandard methods and questionable research practices are widespread even in published work. There is an enormous number of journals available, with different standards of publication, in which scientists can publish their work if they are rejected by some. And many lines of <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00037/full">evidence</a> suggest that ‘high impact’ journals (journals which are said to be highly reputable and have a wide reach) accept papers with similar or weaker methods than low-impact journals do.</p>
<p>Peer review instead functions predominantly as a practice of gatekeeping, as the philosophers of science Liam Bright and Remco Heesen have <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjps/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bjps/axz029/5526887">explained</a>. Reviewers provide scientists with comments that are rarely made public. Whether research is published in a particular journal largely depends on the idiosyncratic decisions of reviewers who are available at the time and who are liked by the journal’s editors.</p>
<p>Peer review filters which research is published, with no use of transparent metrics for others to understand the reasoning behind these choices. The lack of transparency lends itself to misconduct – reviewers may discourage the publishing of science that challenges the prevailing consensus of the time or fails to replicate it – and hype, encouraging the publication of results that seem exciting over those that provide nuance.</p>
<p>These decisions have consequences, because journals are the dominant platform for sharing scientific research. When non-scientists, who want to apply scientific knowledge elsewhere, read research, they have little way of knowing which methods are sound and which results are reproducible or replicable.	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[1]">[1]</sup>
	<span>Reproducibility relates to whether the results can be reproduced using the same data and code as in the original analysis. Replicability relates to whether other scientists find similar results in their own studies.</span>
	 Other scientists can face the same problems, finding it difficult to assess the state of knowledge in a field, particularly if they have expertise in a different subject. This is troubling: the longer it takes to sift through the research to find out which results are reliable, the longer it takes to apply knowledge to solve new problems.</p>
<p>This view paints a bleak picture of the state of scientific knowledge, and the question that arises is: is all of science like this?</p>
<p>Fortunately, the answer is no. But unfortunately, many good practices are fairly modern and limited to specific domains. Here are some of them.</p>
<p>The remarkable <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">breakthrough</a> by DeepMind in 2020 – in accurately predicting the folded structure of proteins using only the code of protein sequences – was made possible because DeepMind’s AlphaFold algorithm was trained using data from <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/pages/about-us/index">Protein Data Bank</a>, a vast public database that dates back to 1971. Molecular scientists have been carefully applying difficult laboratory techniques to establish the structure of proteins and have manually submitted information about them to this database <a href="https://journals.iucr.org/a/issues/2008/01/00/sc5004/">for decades</a>. In parallel, data managers have been reviewing each of their submissions for accuracy. The platform now harbours over 150,000 curated entries of protein structures.</p>
<p>With databases like this, the benefits to other scientists are enormous: specifically, understanding the structure of proteins can help scientists design precise drugs that fit into them, as has been done for the <a href="https://cen.acs.org/analytical-chemistry/structural-biology/structural-biologists-revealed-new-coronaviruss/98/i17">spike protein</a> of the coronavirus. It can also help them understand why resistance to a drug has developed, such as in <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-protein-data-bank-exploring-biomolecular-structure-14199109/">HIV research</a>. But more broadly, individual researchers no longer have to rediscover these protein structures over and over again if they have already been shared publicly, if they want to use that knowledge for other purposes.</p>
<p>The practice of sharing data is also the norm in the neighbouring field of genomics. The tradition largely stems from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project">Human Genome Project</a>, which began in 1990 and aimed to determine the entire code of the human genome. During the project, a group of scientists developed protocols called the <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-genom-083115-022515">Bermuda Principles</a>, which recommended that labs working on the project should upload the details of any new genetic sequences that they discovered onto public data repositories on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Though the project was completed in 2003, the movement paved the way for data sharing principles in many genetic projects to come, such as the HapMap project, the 1000 Genomes project, dbGaP, and more recently, GISAID and NextStrain – two databases which publicly share genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) virus.	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[2]">[2]</sup>
	<span>The HapMap project is a project that maps common genetic mutations of the human genome, while the 1000 Genomes project aims to develop a map of rare genetic mutations. dbGaP is a database of genetic mutations that are associated with medical traits and diseases.</span>
	 As with protein databases, these open sharing practices are remarkably important in genomics, in particular because they allow scientists to investigate a large number of genes and mutations at the same time, each detailed with a large amount of information that other scientists have collected.</p>
<p>These databases are immensely useful in sharing <i>data</i> for other researchers to analyse, but different tools are necessary for researchers to share the code used to <i>analyse data</i> – for example, if they want to test specific hypotheses. Some researchers voluntarily share their analysis code on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">GitHub</a> and <a href="http://osf.io/">OSF</a>, two platforms where people can upload their data, code and research plans and update them when changes are made. But the practice of sharing code is not widely used by scientists even within these fields.</p>
<p>In computer science however, there are examples of journals that work with version control tools like Git. Take <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/cs-147/">JOSS</a> as an illustration, a journal that publishes research describing open source software. JOSS is actually built upon the platform of GitHub: software developers submit their software together with working papers describing them to the journal via GitHub, and the journal’s reviewers provide comments on their code and suggest revisions to their work publicly. Both reviewers’ comments and past versions of the software are therefore transparent and accessible to the public.</p>
<p>Apart from these examples of sharing data and code openly, some fields already commonly try to tackle p-hacking and other questionable research practices, described before. In economics, researchers typically perform “<a href="http://www.nickchk.com/robustness.html">robustness checks</a>” to demonstrate that their …</p></div></div></div>

<p>I fancied getting an eink screen to use for future projects. I bought a wee one with a raspberry pi “hat” attached. However, I realised later that I could maybe just re-purpose an old Amazon Kindle ebook reader.</p>



<p>I’ve messed with Kindles before, ages ago: I ported an <a href="https://blog.lidskialf.net/2010/10/09/kif-an-infocom-text-adventure-interpreter-for-the-kindle/">Infocom interpreter</a> and a <a href="https://blog.lidskialf.net/2010/10/20/mangle-a-better-manga-reader-for-the-kindle/">Manga</a> reader to it. I managed to get Amazon’s own software to load them as “Kindlets” and show them integrated into their ebook reader. However, now I just want a nice cheap Linux based eink development platform.</p>



<p>Cheap Kindle From Ebay (and why)</p>



<p>So, off to ebay I went! I saw a number of really cheap ones marked “BLOCKED BY AMAZON”; I decided not to go for these since theoretically they might have been stolen. In the end, I went for £7 Kindle 4 “non-touch”.</p>



<p>A few days later, it turned up. And I discovered <em>why</em> it might have been so cheap: its stuck in some sort of unquittable demo mode:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1725" data-permalink="https://blog.lidskialf.net/kindle_demo_mode/" data-orig-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg" data-orig-size="892,1239" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="kindle_demo_mode" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=216" data-large-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=737" src="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=737" alt="" srcset="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=737 737w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=108 108w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=216 216w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=768 768w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg 892w" sizes="(max-width: 737px) 100vw, 737px"></figure>



<p>I did some googling and although it seems later Kindle versions can be un-demo-mode-ed, nothing seemed to work for this version. I don’t actually care though; I don’t want to run the original Kindle ebook software on this.</p>



<p>So, the next step is to gain access. Browsing the <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=166687">mobileread forums</a> showed it has a debug serial port: time to open the case!</p>



<p>Physical Access Granted!</p>



<p>This was kinda tricky! There are multiple clips all round it and the case is glued onto the battery compartment, so judicious application of a Big Knife was required to persuade it to let go. I cleaned the glue up with some Acetone.</p>

<ul><li>Red: annoying clips</li><li>Purple: <strong>really</strong> annoying glue.</li><li>Yellow: the serial port!</li></ul>



<p>As usual for this sort of thing, the serial port is missing its socket, so we need to solder onto the tiny contacts on the board. I like to use ~0.2mm wirewrap wire for this sort of thing, and the surface mount rework bit for my soldering iron:</p>







<p>I don’t want to leave any wires flapping about, but I also know at some point I’m going to screw up and need serial port console access, so I came up with a solution and attached it:</p>







<p>I superglued a piece of Veroboard onto the kindle’s PCB, then soldered wirewrap wires from the tiny PCB contacts onto one end. Finally, I soldered a larger, more conventional “Dupont” cable socket on the other end so I could easily attach and detach from it. Oh, the top cable on the Kindle PCB is 0v/GND, the others are TX and RX (I forget the order of those two).</p>



<p>Final hurdle: the kindle serial port runs at 1.8v, so I needed a serial port adaptor which supports that:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1737" data-permalink="https://blog.lidskialf.net/kindle_usbserial/" data-orig-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg" data-orig-size="545,828" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="kindle_usbserial" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=197" data-large-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=545" src="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=545" alt="" srcset="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg 545w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=99 99w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=197 197w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px"></figure>



<p>The one I bought does 5v. 3.3v, 2.5v, and 1.8v: it’s pretty neat!</p>



<p>Root Access Granted!</p>



<p>Next, I attached the serial adapter to my laptop, ran the <strong>minicom</strong> serial port software and rebooted the Kindle. Then, once I (inevitably) swapped the TX and RX wires around, I was greeted by this!</p>

Welcome to Kindle!

kindle login: </code></pre>



<p>Great, so that’s booting the uboot bootloader, then booting into linux and asking me to login.</p>



<p>Trying to login as root prompts for a password: Hmm… However, I already knew from previous Kindle stuff that you can generate the password from the serial number. I found <a href="https://www.sven.de/kindle/">this website</a> which generates a number of possible passwords for a specific device: Mine was the third on the list.</p>



<p>In case that site dies here’s the key snippet of Javascript:</p>



<pre><code>var md5 = hex_md5(serial);
document.getElementById("rootpw").innerHTML = "fiona" + md5.substring(7,11);
document.getElementById("rootpw2").innerHTML = "fiona" + md5.substring(7,10);
document.getElementById("rootpw3").innerHTML = "fiona" + md5.substr(13,3);</code></pre>



<p>Oh: I forgot to mention how I extracted the device’s serial number. Well, plugging it into USB doesn’t really “work”: you can’t mount these demo devices as disks. But, under linux, it still outputs the serial number in linux’s <strong>dmesg</strong> output (you can also get it using <strong>printenv</strong> in uboot if you press enter when it says “Hit any key to stop autoboot”):</p>



<pre><code>[128033.676587] usb 1-2: new high-speed USB device number 51 using xhci_hcd
[128033.829631] usb 1-2: New USB device found, idVendor=1949, idProduct=0004, bcdDevice= 1.00
[128033.829638] usb 1-2: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
[128033.829642] usb 1-2: Product: Amazon Kindle
[128033.829645] usb 1-2: Manufacturer: Amazon
[128033.829648] usb 1-2: SerialNumber: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
</code></pre>



<p>Cool! We have root and can login! Now to figure out how to make it a bit easier to do stuff on it.</p>



<p>Dumping The System</p>



<p>First step is usually to dump the disks for analysis on another computer.</p>



<p>Checking <code>/proc/mounts</code> shows multiple partitions of the main disk on <code>/dev/mmcblk0</code>.</p>



<p>Running <code>fdisk /dev/mmcblk0</code> gives the following:</p>



<pre><code>Units = cylinders of 64 * 512 = 32768 bytes

        Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks  Id System
/dev/mmcblk0p1   *        1025       12224      358400  83 Linux
/dev/mmcblk0p2           12225       14272       65536  83 Linux
/dev/mmcblk0p3           14273       15296       32768  83 Linux
/dev/mmcblk0p4           15297       59776     1423360   b Win95 FAT32</code></pre>



<ul><li>So, four partitions, three linux, and one FAT32. </li><li>The first disk starts quite far into the disk: turns out the kernel is stored in that “missing” area. </li><li>Poking about a bit more shows partition 1 is the normal system, 2 is a sort of diagnostic tool partition, 3 is for storing internal private state of the kindle (eg wifi passwords). Finally, 4 is the one you see when you plug a kindle in over USB: its where your books would reside.</li><li>Partition 4 is mounted at /mnt/us.</li></ul>



<p>I dumped the start of the disk and partitions 1-3 onto /mnt/us using dd (I like to take a complete raw image if I can so I can restore it in case something goes wrong):</p>



<pre><code>dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/mnt/us/kindle.img bs=32768 count=15297</code></pre>



<p>Although this Kindle doesn’t show a disk over USB, since I have root, I can simply make it do it:</p>



<pre><code>rmmod g_file_storage
modprobe g_file_storage file=/dev/mmcblk0p4</code></pre>



<p>It popped up on my laptop so I copied everything off.</p>



<p>System Analysis</p>



<p>Finally, I mounted the partitions in kindle.img on my laptop with:</p>



<pre><code>kpartx -v kindle.img</code></pre>



<p>I could then mount the individual partitions on my laptop. I extracted all the files into a folder so I could poke around them and grep them easily. I figured out:</p>



<ul><li>It uses <code>rc.d</code> as its system init system, so there are lots of nice plain text scripts.</li><li>Init level 5 is the “normal” system running the ebook software</li><li>The ebook software is in <code>/opt/amazon</code> and is in Java (I kinda already knew this, but needed a quick refresher).</li><li>There’s a whole load of interesting plain text “diag” scripts for testing.</li><li>There’s a rather nifty <code>wifid</code> daemon for managing the wifi connection: I figured out how to talk to this from the diag scripts.</li><li>You can write to the eink screen from the command line using the <code>/usr/sbin/eips</code> command (<a href="https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Eips">docs here</a>).</li><li>I couldn’t find an obvious “turn off demo mode” switch: it appears the demo mode is a customised build of the Java ebook software.</li><li>The following system services are to do with unsupported features, the ebook software, or talking back to amazon: <code>S50wan S70wand S75phd S81usbnetd S93webreaderd S94browserd S95framework S96boot_finished</code>.</li></ul>



<p>Talking To Wifid</p>



<p>You can use the built in wifid to connect to wifi and manage your wifi profiles. Oh, also, remember many Kindles only support 2.4Ghz wifi when you wonder why it isn’t working 😉</p>



<p><strong>List number of WIFI profiles:</strong></p>



<p><code>lipc-get-prop com.lab126.wifid profileCount</code></p>



<p><strong>Show contents of a WIFI profile:</strong></p>



<p><code>echo "{index=(0)}" | lipc-hash-prop com.lab126.wifid profileData</code></p>



<p><strong>Delete a WIFI profile:</strong></p>



<p><code>lipc-set-prop com.lab126.wifid deleteProfile WIFIESSID</code></p>



<p><strong>Create a WIFI profile:</strong></p>



<p><code>echo '{essid="WIFIESSID", smethod="wpa2", secured="yes", psk="WIFIPSK"}' | lipc-hash-prop com.lab126.wifid createProfile</code></p>



<p>smethod can be one of open,wep,wpa,wpa2 (if you choose open, set secured to “no”)</p>



<p>WIFIPSK is the WIFI PSK as generated with the <code>wpa_passphrase</code> utility (which is actually on the kindle): a normal “wifi passphrase” will not work.</p>



<p><strong>Connect a WIFI profile:</strong></p>



<p><code>lipc-set-prop com.lab126.wifid cmConnect WIFIESSID</code></p>



<p><strong>Show WIFI connection status:</strong></p>



<p><code>echo "{index = (0)}" | lipc-hash-prop -n com.lab126.wifid currentEssid</code></p>



<p>Making Changes To Root</p>



<p>Many of the following instructions need to change the root disk on the kindle. However, by default it is mounted in read only mode, preventing modification. To fix, run this command on the kindle:</p>



<pre><code>mntroot rw</code></pre>



<p>When done, set it back to read only mode to prevent any unwanted changes:</p>



<pre><code>mntroot ro</code></pre>



<p>Installing Dropbear SSH</p>



<p>I wanted to be able to ssh into my kindle, so I needed to install the <a href="https://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html">dropbear</a> ssh daemon. Of course this is an ARM based device, so I either had to compile it myself or find it somewhere. Luckily …</p></div></article></main></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><em>You can listen to <a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/6719542d">an audio version of this essay</a> and read <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.swyx.io%2Fclubhouse-hate%2F&amp;src=typed_query">reactions on Twitter</a>.</em></p>
<p>Trust me, I <em>tried</em> to make the Clubhouse bear case.</p>
<p>The original title of this post was "Everything Clubhouse Did Right — and Why It Will Fail Anyway". The exercise forced me to list the reasons why it wasn't worth $1 billion - why live conference calls are inferior to existing formats like podcasts and Discord.</p>
<p>When I was done, I went for a walk to think about it. By the time I came back, I had done a complete 180. (Note - <em>this was even before I heard about the Elon event</em>)</p>
<p>I <em>still</em> dislike the Clubhouse experience. I wouldn't recommend it to you. But all the reasons I dislike it are the same reasons it will work:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Clubhouse is exclusive</strong>. You have hoops to jump and gates to open every step of the way. It's iOS only. Invite only. Requires your phone number for no goddamn reason. And once you're through <em>all of that</em> you gain the privilege of being in the voiceless audience hoping senpai will notice your raised hand and puffed up bio.</li>
  <li><strong>Clubhouse is ephemeral</strong>. Conversations aren't recorded. Your work doesn't compound and isn't searchable. This is <em>horrible</em> for ROI on your time as a content creator.</li>
  <li><strong>Clubhouse is live-only</strong>. If all the convos are happening in Pacific Time and you live in Europe, tough luck. If you came in halfway and have no idea what was said, tough luck. The only way to be fully involved is to turn on mobile notifications and track scheduled chats. Causing more — not less — distraction and work for you.</li>
  <li><strong>Clubhouse enhances existing privilege</strong>. Because automated recommendations aren't possible, Clubhouse mostly relies on a Twitter-like follow graph. To gain a following you mostly already have to be famous off-platform or well-connected to people who will bring you up on stage ("second-degree famous"). Choosing a <a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service">Status as a Service</a> model (Twitter) over a <a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2020/8/3/tiktok-and-the-sorting-hat">Sorting Hat</a> model (TikTok) sacrifices discovery for establishment.</li>
  <li><strong>Clubhouse is a terrible listening experience</strong>. There's no audience chat or polling. Obnoxious speakers can dominate the conversation. <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1355817942093496320?s=20">Trolls</a> and <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/tiffany-haddish-bullies-doctor-on-clubhouse-covid/">harassment</a> abound. You can't play at 2x or rewind an important part. Podcasts were trending towards better audio and editing, Clubhouse regresses to shitty phone mics with feedback and connection issues. Signal is scarce, noise is rampant.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my original write up I listed the many better offerings in every dimension. Want to listen to interviews with great audio and show notes? Podcasts. Want ultrascalable livestreaming? Twitch. Want livestreamed audio with recording and submitted questions? <a href="https://twitter.com/N8Elliott/status/1355203379392176131?s=20">Capiche</a>. Want to do an audio webinar? Use Zoom with the camera off. Want voice with text chat? Discord. Just want a Clubhouse clone with less friction? <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces">Twitter Spaces</a>.</p>
<p>When I was done listing the alternatives, I knew I had made a mistake. They checked more boxes on a feature comparison basis. But social media doesn't work like that. I was trying to be logical in a <em>socio</em>-logical domain.</p>
<p>I had conclusively <em>PROVED</em>, with my big brain and fancy words, how profoundly inferior Clubhouse was. No compounding creator should prefer it, and no self respecting listener should enjoy it, compared to alternatives.</p>
<p>But the majority of people don't work like that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some people are turned off by exclusivity and friction. But <em>most people</em> take it as social proof of something cool.</li>
  <li>Some creators are turned off by ephemerality. But <em>more people</em> will start trying precisely because it's easy and doesn't matter. The Elon Musks and Vlad Tenevs of the world will be less guarded, despite clearly knowing anything they say will be recorded, because <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message">the medium is the message</a></em>.</li>
  <li>Some people are turned off by demands on their time. But <em>most people</em> leave mobile notifications on and the live nature of chats creates some of the most urgent notifications you'll get on your phone, second only to a call from your mother. The synchronicity creates an <em>event</em> — a clear Before and After where you can excitedly gossip and feel superior to people out of the loop. This is a rarity in an everything-async world.</li>
  <li>Some people are turned off by stacked decks. But <em>most people</em> just want to follow celebrities and experts and aren't interested in the challenging, messy work of finding people on the way up.</li>
  <li>Some people are turned off by the listening experience. But Clubhouse is <a href="https://www.swyx.io/good-enough/">Good Enough</a>, especially if content is created sooner and in bigger quantity than available anywhere else.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clubhouse should've died <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/7/8/21316172/clubhouse-content-moderation-taylor-lorenz-harassment-abuse">in July when the VC and Media abuse cases erupted</a>. Instead it came back stronger than ever, standing at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210131175202/https://www.businessinsider.com/why-the-hype-about-1-billion-clubhouse-not-so-crazy-2021-1">2 million weekly active users</a>. <strong>If any of these negatives mattered</strong>, the app should have seen extreme churn. Instead, <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/01/24/investing-in-clubhouse/">Andrew Chen</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rrhoover/status/1353393250552270850">Ryan Hoover</a>, and <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/gumroad-is-switching-from-zoom-to-clubhouse-34e4b4e5e1">Sahil Lavingia</a> — who do this for a living and have insider knowledge of metrics — value it above $1 billion dollars, six months after it was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2020/05/15/andreessen-horowitz-wins-vc-sweepstakes-to-back-clubhouse-voice-app/?sh=5b8466d56f2a">valued at $100 million</a>.</p>
<p><strong>People. Aren't. Churning.</strong> No matter how much you may hate the app — usage is going <em>up</em>. This is scary and worth taking note. Clubhouse is already showing signs of successful expansion in Asia (read: non-English Clubhouses).</p>
<p>Instagram had 30 million MAUs when Facebook bought it for $1 billion. Whatsapp had 450m for $19 billion. By Whatsapp metrics, Clubhouse is wildly overvalued (lets say it has 10m MAU right now). But audio isn't text. <a href="https://alexdanco.com/2019/10/17/the-audio-revolution/">Alex Danco says</a> that texting is a cold medium, while audio is the hottest medium of all. He was mildly wrong — podcasting is still kinda lukewarm — but <strong><em>live, ephemeral</em></strong> audio is so hot you will literally drop everything and stay up late and ignore your partner to go listen to Elon.</p>
<p>Worse is better. The exact reasons you hate Clubhouse — the kind of thing that drives you to read an article like this to the end — are the exact same reasons it is going to win.</p>

<p><em>if you're interested - here was <a href="https://gist.github.com/sw-yx/d3e27a36eba965fcd4183d0575d34640">my initial negative conclusion</a>.</em></p>

							<p><a href="http://www.nathanshipley.com/"><strong>Nathan Shipley</strong></a> is using artificial intelligence to bring historical figures to life, in ways we’ve never seen before. Most of these figures lived far before the advent of photography, so there are no photographic records of them, only paintings and drawings. His clever use of AI is making these figures photorealistic for the first time. And in doing so, he’s breathing unique life into them.</p>

<p>We caught up with Shipley to discuss his latest work, which builds on years of research using GAN, or&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network">Generative adversarial networks</a>. It’s a growing field of study, and one that will surely impact our lives in the coming years.</p>

<p>Shipley explains some of his education and process for this unique work:</p>


<p><em><strong>“I definitely can’t claim full credit for this process – it is built on code that researchers have generously released.&nbsp; However, I have done my own modifications to that code and am building a custom library of face attributes that I can use to&nbsp;direct the output.&nbsp; My favorite part of these kinds of processes is learning how they work, how to use them, and then how to break them or use them for techniques not originally&nbsp;imagined!”</strong></em></p>


<p>It’s still somewhat surreal to see William Shakespeare or Marie Antoinette as a photorealistic person, and we’re struck by how accurate the models seem to be.</p>

<p>We’re familiar with the notion of ‘deep fakes’, or image creation that is used with the intent of manipulating or tricking a system, but Shipley has utilized this technology on historical paintings, bringing almost an archeological perspective to the science.</p>






<p><strong>“StyleGAN is a kind of machine learning architecture that can be used to “learn” how to create more of a particular kind of image that you show it.&nbsp; For example, if you show it a dataset of images of cats, it will learn to create new images&nbsp;of cats that aren’t direct copies of the input.&nbsp; Properly trained, it can make cats that don’t exist!</strong></p>



<p><strong>I come from a VFX and animation background,&nbsp;so it’s been fascinating&nbsp;to see how images can be created that&nbsp;would previously have been impossible.&nbsp; It’s pretty technical but a really fascinating area to explore!”</strong></p>

<p>Shipley is quick to say these visual experiments aren’t saying <em>“this is what William Shakespeare looked like”</em></p>


<p><strong>“I consider these recreations to be experiments that I am sharing publicly.&nbsp; The AI doesn’t “know” what Shakespeare really looked like, but it’s fascinating to see how this particular combination of variables can come together to give us a glimpse!”</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="layout">
    <div id="main">
        
        
        <div id="content" data-role="content"> 
<p>My first proper programming language was C.
It was super confusing, and I wrote some terrible code that didn't really do anything terribly useful.</p>
<p>Along the way, however, I learned a bit about how computers do things, sort of.
I say sort of because <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/267583/why-is-c-still-in-the-category-of-high-level-language" title="If you disagree, please voice your dissent in my comment section">C is a <em>high level language</em></a>.</p>
<p>Of course, there are <em>higher-level</em> languages, and those end up being really good for a very wide array of tasks, so I went and learned them, and then I started actually getting things done.
I'm glad I started with C, though, since it gave me an idea of what these other languages must be doing under the hood to accomplish so much with so little code.</p>
<p>Using Scheme, Python, or Javascript, I didn't have to bother with managing the computer's memory allocation manually, and that turned out to be a lot more fun.</p>
<p>At some point a while back, I heard about <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust-lang</a>.</p>
<p>What is Rust?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="sounds-good-right">Sounds good, right?</h2>
<p>Yea, actually.</p>
<p>I think it's a pretty awesome language.
The problem is, I make my living writing stuff working on web apps, and that means writing Javascript.
That's not a problem, necessarily, but I just don't have much use for a language like Rust.</p>
<p>It definitely seems awesome, and as a lisp aficionado, I love a lot of its high level concepts.
As I recall, Rust even has properly nesting block comments, which I find quite practical.</p>
<h2 id="where-am-i-going-with-this">Where am I going with this?</h2>
<p>Well, I just wanted to clear up that I don't think Rust is a bad language.
I'm not going to criticize <em>Rust</em> in this article, however, I am going to criticize a part of the community surrounding the language.</p>
<p>To be honest, actually, I'm not really sure the people I'm going to criticize are even a part of the community.
At best, they seem to be a part of the fringe.</p>
<p>Who are these people?</p>
<p>They are the people who show up unannounced on your software project's doorstep (probably your issue tracker) and ask the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you considered <em><strong>Rewriting It In Rust</strong></em>?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="yes-im-starting-a-language-flame-war">Yes, I'm starting a language flame war</h2>
<p>Ok, here we go.</p>
<p>If you've spent any time at all in a community where programmers hang out, you've probably seen a flame war over which language is best.</p>
<p>I don't know which language is best, though I've argued for Scheme many times because nobody else seems to be doing it.</p>
<p>That being said, I've noticed that this particular subset of the Rust community seems to do this particular thing often enough that it's nearly the only thing that I know about the Rust community.</p>
<p>I've joked about it with friends and coworkers, and sure enough, most of them have witnessed it in the wild.</p>
<p>I believe the first time I saw it was on the (now disabled) <a href="https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns">cjdns</a> issue tracker.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to have the tracker turned on for long enough that I was able to get a screenshot:</p>
<p><img src="https://transitiontech.ca/assets/riir/cjdns-eventually-moving-to-rust.jpg" alt="" title="'prevent thread problems' in software that runs on one thread... yea"></p>
<p>It all started and ended pretty quickly.
Some <em>Rustafarian</em> asked a question, and the author (<a href="https://github.com/cjdelisle">@cjdelisle</a>) answered somewhat sarcastically.</p>
<p>Once OP figures out that their brilliant idea is not being taken seriously, they get annoyed and leave.</p>
<h2 id="but-wait-theres-more">But wait, there's more</h2>
<p>Yea, of course it goes on.
I heard it a few more times, laughed about it (oh, this again), and then continued on with my life.</p>
<p>Of course, clearly it happened enough times that I started to notice a trend, because as I mentioned, I've joked about it with people, and they've noticed it too.</p>
<p>So, this morning (<strong>2016-03-22</strong>) I saw <a href="https://github.com/fc00/go-fc00/issues/1">a thread</a> in a repo I'm watching, and there it was again:</p>
<p><img src="https://transitiontech.ca/assets/riir/go-fc00-why-go.jpg" alt="" title="...my actual question was about building a maybe more valuable solution..."></p>
<p>Once again, my friends make some snappy comments.
Pair those with a classic <em>if you want it written why don't you write it</em>, a few more <em>lulz</em> and our <em>Rustacean</em> acquaintance gets annoyed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ok, didn't thought a simple question would attract that much angry trolls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>..and things pretty much die out.</p>
<h2 id="but-then-i-started-thinking">But then I started thinking</h2>
<p>We joked about it on IRC, and a few more people comment that they've also seen this in the wild, and quickly enough we find that we need an acronym because <em>Rewrite It In Rust</em> takes too long to type and so <strong>RIIR</strong> is born.</p>
<p>So, naturally, once an acronym is born, we have a meme, and memes like to spread.
So, naturally, I start digging:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who else has been hit by this storm that has been sweeping the web?</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="nix">Nix</h3>
<p>Apparently there were a few threads like <a href="http://lists.science.uu.nl/pipermail/nix-dev/2015-December/019040.html">this one</a> which went on for a while.
I haven't checked the exact timelines, but since this is a language flame war, I'm sure somebody will leap in to do that research for me.</p>
<p><img src="https://transitiontech.ca/assets/riir/nix-dev-perl-to-rust.jpg" alt="" title="Rust does this very well, to the point where me enumerating its benefits would be redundant."></p>
<h3 id="tor">Tor</h3>
<p>Yup, Tor, the very large, critical infrastructure that keeps journalists, criminals, schizophrenics, and <del>piracy</del> privacy activists anonymous has been <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11331">asked to rewrite their software</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://transitiontech.ca/assets/riir/rewrite-tor-in-rust.jpg" alt="" title="Writing C code that is safe is super hard (even for exeperienced Tor devs)"></p>
<h2 id="more-still">More still...</h2>
<p>Why not <a href="https://www.quora.com/Would-it-be-possible-advantageous-to-rewrite-the-Linux-kernel-in-Rust-when-the-language-is-stable" title="this one isn't on an issue tracker, at least">rewrite the Linux Kernel</a>? I'd love to hear Linus's answer to this.</p>
<p>Then of course there's <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11337399">this comprehensive thread</a> on Hacker News covering a bunch of angles on the pros and cons of this meme.</p>
<p>Finally, I stumbled across <a href="http://robert.ocallahan.org/2016/02/rewrite-everything-in-rust.html" title="rewrite everytihng in rust">this blog</a>.</p>
<p>Despite being quite new, and certainly newer than the meme itself, this post seems to exemplify many of the talking points extolled by proponents of <strong>RIIR</strong>.</p>
<p>Its title even comes in the form of a call to action:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rewrite Everything In Rust</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="so">So...?</h2>
<p>I don't really have more to say on the matter.
I just wrote this much to document a phenomenon I've noticed.</p>
<p>I don't have a comments section, because it ends up being really time consuming to say annoying, opinionated things if you have to answer for the fallout in your comments section.
Instead, I made <a href="https://github.com/ansuz/RIIR" title="Rewrite It In Rust">a github repo</a> where you can <a href="https://github.com/ansuz/RIIR/issues">file an issue</a> which:</p>
<ol>
<li>voices your own obnoxious opinion</li>
<li>supports my thesis<ul>
<li>super bonus points if you find more github issues asking for Rust rewrites</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>refutes my thesis<ul>
<li>super science points if you find that this behaviour is not exhibited disproportionately by Rust users</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>links to some project where somebody actually did <em>Rewrite It In Rust</em></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="did-this-post-offend-you">Did this post offend you?</h2>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Talk about it.</p>
<p>Tell your friends.</p>
<p>Good memes die hard.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>By Carroll Wainwright and Peter Eckersley<br>
<span>Published on 2019-12-04, on the <a href="https://www.partnershiponai.org/safelife/">PAI blog</a></span>.</p>
<p><span>The Partnership on AI (PAI) is today releasing SafeLife – a novel reinforcement learning environment that tests the safety of reinforcement learning agents and the algorithms that train them. SafeLife version 1.0 focuses on the problem of avoiding negative side effects—how can we train an agent to do what we want it to do but nothing more? The environment has simple rules, but rich and complex dynamics, and generally gives the agent lots of power to make big changes on its way to completing its goals. A safe agent will only change that which is necessary, but an unsafe agent will often make a big mess of things and not know how to clean it up.</span></p>
<p><span>SafeLife is part of a broader PAI initiative to develop benchmarks for safety, fairness, and other ethical objectives for machine learning systems. Since so much of machine learning is driven, shaped, and measured by </span><a href="https://eff.org/ai/metrics"><span>benchmarks</span></a><span> (and the datasets and environments they are based on), we believe it is essential that those benchmarks come to incorporate safety and ethics goals on a widespread basis, and we’re working to make that happen.</span></p>
<p><span>If you want to try out SafeLife for yourself, you can </span><a href="https://github.com/PartnershipOnAI/safelife/"><span>download the code</span></a><span> and try playing some of the puzzle levels. If you’d like to see how to create an AI to play SafeLife, additional details about the environment and our initial agent training can be found</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01217">in our paper</a>.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Side Effects</h3>
<p><span>Reinforcement learning agents are rapidly growing in capabilities. They can </span><a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphazero-shedding-new-light-grand-games-chess-shogi-and-go"><span>beat masters in chess and go</span></a><span>, control robotic hands with enough manual dexterity </span><a href="https://openai.com/blog/solving-rubiks-cube/"><span>to solve a Rubik’s Cube</span></a><span>, and potentially be applied across many domains with </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08265"><span>variable and unknown rules</span></a><span>.</span> <span>As reinforcement learning agents start to get deployed in real-world high-stakes scenarios, it is critical to make sure that they operate within appropriate (and often quite strict and intricate) safety constraints. However, the whole point of reinforcement learning is that it can greedily search for novel techniques when solving a problem. </span><b>If we can’t predict what an AI is going to do, how can we predict that it will be safe?</b><span> In practice, reinforcement learning can only be used in the real world in settings where safety is so well understood that constraints can be exactly and correctly codified in advance. </span><span>Other tasks, like safely controlling the behavior of a robot when it is interacting with the world at large, are much more challenging.</span></p>
<p><span>One of the thorniest </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565"><span>problems in AI safety</span></a><span> is learning to avoid negative side effects. Usually, when we give an agent a task, we have something specific in mind that the agent should do. At the same time, we have a huge implicit list of things that the agent should </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> do. When we train a robot to fetch the coffee, we want it to efficiently brew the tastiest cup possible. But we also do not want the robot to step on the cat (even if it’s in the way), or rob the local grocer (even if it’s cheaper than paying), or crash the stock market (even if it would bring down the price of beans). Specifying all the things that the robot should not do is a near impossible task; we just want our delicious cup of coffee, nothing more.</span></p>
<p><span>Difficult though this problem may be, there has been some promising research on how to avoid side effects in general. The </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01186"><span>proposed</span></a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09725"><span>techniques</span></a><span> have been tested on hand-crafted Sokoban-style environments which have demonstrated both the problem and the ways in which naive solutions may fail. However, these environments are very small; they can easily be overfit, and the “effects” tend to be straightforward and isolated. </span><b>Until now, there has been no rich environment with difficult goals in which effects are both necessary and required at different scales. SafeLife aims to fill this gap.</b></p>
<h3>Rules of the Game</h3>
<div><p><img src="https://pde.is/posts/img/pattern-demo.gif"></p><p>Figure 1. Creating complex patterns in SafeLife.</p>
</div>
<p><span>SafeLife is based on </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life"><span>Conway’s Game of Life</span></a><span>, a set of rules for cellular automata on an infinite two-dimensional grid. In Conway’s Game of Life, every cell on the grid is either “alive” or “dead”. At each time step, the entire grid is updated. Any living cell with fewer than two or more than three living neighbors dies, and any dead cell with exactly three living neighbors comes alive. All other cells retain their previous state. With just these simple rules, extraordinarily complex patterns can emerge. Some patterns will be static—they won’t change between time steps. Other patterns will oscillate between two, three, </span><a href="https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Jason%27s_p156"><span>or more</span></a><span> states. Gliders and spaceships travel across the grid, while guns and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puffer_train"><span>puffers</span></a><span> can produce never-ending streams of new patterns.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite its name, Conway’s Game of Life is not actually a game—there are no players, and there are no choices to be made. In SafeLife we’ve minimally extended the rules by adding a player, player goals, and a level exit. At each time step, the player can choose to move one space along the board, create a new life cell in an adjacent space, or destroy a cell in an adjacent space. By judiciously creating and destroying life cells, the player can build up quite complicated patterns (as seen above!). By matching these patterns to goal cells, the player earns points and eventually opens the exit to the next level.</span></p>
<p><span>We add a few more cell types to allow richer dynamics. There are indestructible walls and trees, movable crates, and spawning cells that are capable of generating never-ending streams of new random patterns. Cells also come in different colors. Some colors, like green and yellow, are neutral and should be left alone by safe agents, while red cells denote unwanted patterns which yield rewards when removed.</span></p>
<h3>Agent behaviors and benchmark levels</h3>
<p><span>We trained agents on five different tasks: building and removing patterns on initially static boards, building and removing patterns on dynamic boards, and navigating across maze-like boards. All of the training levels were randomly generated, and agent performance was graded on a set of 100 fixed benchmark levels for each task.</span></p>
<p><span>In order to form a baseline, we trained agents with </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347"><span>proximal policy optimization</span></a><span>,</span><span> both with and without a simple side effect impact penalty. </span><span>The penalty we chose simply punishes the agent every time a cell changes away from its starting state. This is not a good way to measure side effects! It is, however, an </span><i><span>easy</span></i><span> way to measure side effects, and helps illustrate the shortcomings of side effect impact penalties more generally.</span></p>
<h5>Agents in Static Environments</h5>
<p><span>A static environment is the easiest environment in which one can measure side effects. Since the environment doesn’t change without agent input, </span><i><span>any</span></i><span> change in the environment must be due to agent behavior. The agent is the cause of every effect. Our simple side effect impact penalty performs quite well here.</span></p>
<p><span>When agents are trained without an impact penalty they tend to make a big mess.&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i></span></p>
<div><p><img src="https://pde.is/posts/img/benchmark-append-still-013_p0.gif"> <img src="https://pde.is/posts/img/benchmark-prune-still-003_p0.gif"></p><p>Figure 2. Left: an unsafe agent builds new patterns while disrupting existing ones. Right: an unsafe agent destroys red patterns along with much of the rest of the level.</p>
</div>
<p><span>In Figure 2, the image on the left shows a pattern-building agent that has learned how to construct stable 2-by-2 blocks that it can place on top of goal cells. The agent has not, however, learned to do so without disrupting nearby green patterns. Once the green pattern has been removed, the agent can more easily make its own pattern in its place.</span></p>
<p><span>Likewise, the image on the right in Figure 2 shows a pattern-destroying agent that has learned that the easiest way to remove red cells is to disrupt </span><i><span>all</span></i><span> cells. Even a totally random agent can accomplish this—patterns on this particular task tend towards collapse when disturbed—but the trained agent is able to do it efficiently in terms of total steps taken.</span></p>
<p><span>Applying an impact penalty yields quite different behavior.</span></p>
<div><p><img src="https://pde.is/posts/img/benchmark-append-still-013_p1.gif"> <img src="https://pde.is/posts/img/benchmark-prune-still-003_p1.gif"></p><p>Figure 3. Left: a safe agent builds new patterns, but is too cautious to complete its goals. Right: a safe agent successfully removes red patterns without disrupting anything else.</p>
</div>
<p><span>In Figure 3, the image on the left illustrates how the pattern-building agent is now too cautious to disrupt the green pattern. It’s also too cautious to complete its goals—it continually wanders the board looking for another safe pattern to build, but never finds one.</span></p>
<p><span>In SafeLife, as in life, destroying something (even safely) is much easier than building it, and the pattern-destroying agent with an impact penalty (Figure 3, right) performs much better than the one without the penalty. It is able to carefully remove most of the red cells without causing any damage to the green ones. However, it’s not able to remove </span><i><span>all</span></i><span> of the red cells, and it completes the level much more slowly than its unsafe peer. Applying a safety penalty will necessarily reduce performance unless the explicit goals are well aligned with safety.</span></p>
<h5>Agents in Dynamic Environments</h5>
<p><span>Side effects are much more difficult to disentangle in dynamic environments. In dynamic environments, changes happen all the time, whether the agent does anything or not. Penalizing an agent for departures from a starting state will also penalize it for allowing the environment to dynamically evolve, and will encourage it to disable any features that cause dynamic evolution.</span></p>
<div><p><img src="https://pde.is/posts/img/benchmark-prune-spawn-019_p0.gif"> <img src="https://pde.is/posts/img/benchmark-prune-spawn-019_p0.5.gif"></p><p>Figure 4. Left: an unsafe agent predictably ignores the chaotic region and focuses on its goals. Right: in its effort to avoid side effects, an overzealous agent destroys dynamic parts of the level.</p>
</div>
<p><span>In Figure 4, the image on the left shows an agent trained without an impact penalty. This unsafe agent ignores the stochastic yellow pattern and quickly destroys the red pattern and exits the level. The image on the right shows the effects of an agent with a small impact penalty. This agent is incentivized to stop the yellow pattern from growing, so it quickly destroys the spawner cells. Only then does it move on to the red cells, but it doesn’t manage to remove them safely, as its training has taught it to focus more on the …</span></p></div></div>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>For the last four years, a small team at Popgun has been studying the application of deep learning to music analysis
and generation. This research has culminated in the release of <a href="https://splashpro.popgun.ai/">Splash Pro</a> - a free, AI-powered plugin 
for Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs). With the release of this blog, we hope to provide an accessible introduction to 
deep learning with music, by explaining some core projects we have worked on.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In this post I want to describe the design of a model for expressive piano synthesis. The model, 
which we call ‘BeatNet’, is capable of analysing a piano performance and generating new pieces that imitate the 
original playing style. Before I get into the technical workings, here are a few samples generated by BeatNet:</p>

<p><strong>In the style of “Yiruma - River Flows In You”</strong>
</p>





<p><strong>In the style of “Chopin - Nocturne in E-flat major, Op. 9, No. 2”</strong>
</p>





<p><strong>In the style of “Errol Garner - Misty”*</strong>
</p>





<p>BeatNet is able to replicate many of the characteristics present in human piano performances, albeit with
some weaknesses and limitations that I will address. To explain how this model works, I have split the 
remainder of the blog into two sections. Part I will discuss musical representations, while Part II will explore the 
model design and showcase more of its capabilities.</p>

<p><span>
*Note: BeatNet does not model sustain pedal events. Sustain was manually added to this piece.
</span></p>

<h2 id="part-i---representations-of-music">Part I - Representations of Music</h2>

<p>In designing a model for music generation, it is critical to choose an appropriate representation. This choice
determines which data can be faithfully encoded, the modelling techniques that are available, and the efficacy of the 
overall system. For this reason, I have decided to begin with a brief explanation of some common musical 
representations. If this all feels familiar to you, feel free to skip ahead to part II.</p>

<h3 id="audio">Audio</h3>

<p>When we talk about audio in machine learning, we are typically referring to an array of time-domain samples. These
samples are a digital approximation to the physical sound pressure wave. The quality of this approximation is
determined by the sample rate and the bit-depth (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation">PCM</a>). In 
research, it is common to see sample rates of 16-22kHz. However, to capture the full range of human audible frequencies,
most HiFi applications (e.g. music, podcasts, etc) use rates of around 44kHz 
(see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem">Nyquist Theorem</a>).</p>

<p>Because of its high dimensionality, modelling raw audio is extremely challenging. For a generative model to 
reproduce audio structure on a timescale of a few seconds, it must capture the relationships between tens of 
thousands of samples. While it is becoming increasingly feasible to do this (see <a href="#citation-1">[1]</a>), there are more 
efficient ways to encode piano performances.</p>

<p>Note: For an example of music modelling directly in the audio domain, 
see <a href="https://openai.com/blog/jukebox/">OpenAI’s Jukebox</a> <a href="#citation-2">[2]</a>.</p>

<h3 id="midi">MIDI</h3>

<p>MIDI is a technical standard allowing electronic instruments and computers to communicate. It comprises
a sequence of ‘messages’, each describing a particular musical event or instruction. Instructions relating to the 
note timings, pitch and loudness (i.e. velocity) can be transmitted and stored. For example, a piano performance 
encoded as MIDI is a record of which notes were pressed, how forcefully and at what time.</p>

<p>To convert a MIDI file back into listenable audio, a piece of software replays these instructions and
synthesizes the relevant notes. MIDI does not encode acoustic information, such as the instrument sound or the recording
environment. For this reason it is drastically more efficient than audio, and it is a good starting point for our 
exploration.</p>

<p>When working with MIDI we use the terrific <a href="https://github.com/craffel/pretty-midi">PrettyMIDI</a> library by Colin Raffel. This abstracts away many
complexities of the raw format. See Colin Raffel’s <a href="https://colinraffel.com/publications/thesis.pdf">thesis</a> for
a more in-depth explanation of the MIDI file format.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1 - Für Elise in PrettyMIDI Format</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code>Note(start=0.000000, end=0.305000, pitch=76, velocity=67)
Note(start=0.300000, end=0.605000, pitch=75, velocity=63)
Note(start=0.600000, end=0.905000, pitch=76, velocity=74)
Note(start=0.900000, end=1.205000, pitch=75, velocity=71)
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice how succinctly we can represent Für Elise this way, and consider that the equivalent audio section 
contains approximately 50k samples (for a 44kHz recording).</p>

<h3 id="piano-roll">Piano Roll</h3>

<p>This will look familiar to anyone who has used a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) such as GarageBand or Ableton.
The vertical axis denotes pitch, and the horizontal axis denotes time. The velocity of each note is encoded
by its magnitude. As well as providing an intuitive way to visualize MIDI, piano roll has some interesting 
properties for machine learning.</p>

<p>For example, consider the effect of raising the song’s pitch by one semitone, or delaying its onset by a few seconds. 
These transpositions preserve the spatial structure of the piano roll. When designing a model we can exploit this 
property by applying 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Early experiments at Popgun tried exactly
this, as did <a href="https://youtu.be/nA3YOFUCn4U?t=597">this project</a> using PixelCNN. However, there are some serious drawbacks to this approach.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2 - Für Elise in Piano Roll Format</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://popgun-labs.github.io/ml-blog/assets/images/piano_roll_fur_elise_crop.png" alt="Für Elise - Piano Roll"></p>

<p>A typical song encoded as piano roll is incredibly sparse: nearly all entries are zero. 
Naively applying a CNN wastes a large amount of computation on entirely empty regions. It is also difficult
to choose a suitable resolution for the time axis. If the original data is quantised, such that each note aligns
perfectly with a uniform musical grid, we can choose the resolution based on the quantisation strength. However,
this breaks down for expressive piano performances, where natural variations in timing are critical to the musicality.</p>

<p>Note: Many works have tried to model piano roll, using a broad range of neural net architectures. For those interested 
to learn more, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6392">this paper</a> is a good starting point <a href="#citation-16">[16]</a>.</p>

<h3 id="time-shift-format">Time-Shift Format</h3>

<p>In 2017 <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/blog/">Google Magenta</a> released a model called Performance RNN <a href="#citation-3">[3]</a>, which demonstrated the ability 
to model expressive piano performances with high fidelity. The key innovation was a new format that is highly 
suited to this task. For reasons that will become apparent, we refer to this “performance representation” simply as 
“time-shift”. Like MIDI, time-shift encodes music with a sequence of discrete musical events. What sets it apart is 
the unique way it encodes the progression of time. Instead of representing time along a specific axis (piano roll), 
or as a property of each individual note (MIDI), in time-shift there is a specific event that indicates the 
advancement of the piece.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 3 - Für Elise in Time-Shift Format</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code>272 - Set Velocity = 64
76  - Turn On MIDI Note 76 (E5)
317 - Advance Time by 0.3 Seconds
204 - Turn Off MIDI Note 76 (E5)
271 - Set Velocity = 60
75  - Turn On MIDI Note 75 (D#5)
317 - Advance Time by 0.3 Seconds
203 - Turn Off MIDI Note 75 (D#5)
274 - Set Velocity = 72
76  - Turn On MIDI Note 76 (E5)
317 - Advance Time by 0.3 Seconds
204 - Turn Off MIDI Note 76 (E5)
273 - Set Velocity = 68
75  - Turn On MIDI Note 75 (D#5)
317 - Advance Time by 0.3 Seconds
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This one-dimensional sequence of tokens is similar to the encodings used in language models.
This means that modern advances in NLP (e.g. ByteNet <a href="#citation-4">[4]</a>, Transformers <a href="#citation-5">[5]</a>) can be 
readily applied to the time-shift format.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 4 - An Explanation of the Time-Shift Events</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code>0 - 127: Note on events    
128 - 255: Note off events    
256 - 287: 32 velocity change events   
288 - 387: 100 quantized time-shift values (10ms -&gt; 1000ms)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note: We have not accounted for sustain pedal events, however it might be interesting to incorporate them
in future work.</p>

<h2 id="part-ii---beatnet-a-convolutional-model-for-piano-music">Part II - BeatNet: A Convolutional Model for Piano Music</h2>

<p>In 2016, researchers at Google’s DeepMind lab released the now-famous WaveNet paper <a href="#citation-1">[1]</a>. The core 
insight was that 1D convolutions could produce efficient sequence models, by eliminating the need for expensive 
recurrent computations during training. The efficacy was proven with a 
<a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio">demo</a> of raw audio generation. The 
publication of ByteNet <a href="#citation-4">[4]</a> shortly afterwards, extended this idea to the domain of natural language 
processing.</p>

<p>Inspired by this work, Popgun developed its own ByteNet model for symbolic piano music. We refer to this work as
“BeatNet”. The choice to use ByteNet over traditionally dominant RNNs was motivated by a few factors:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The ability to capture long-term dependencies over hundreds or thousands of tokens</li>
  <li>Fast training</li>
  <li>Hype. WaveNet and ByteNet were the first papers to threaten the dominance of RNNs, before Transformer based
architectures <a href="#citation-5">[5]</a> exploded in popularity.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="data-collection-and-processing">Data Collection and Processing</h3>

<p>We curated a MIDI dataset by drawing from a number of online sources. One key source was the
<a href="http://www.piano-e-competition.com/">Yamaha e-Piano Competition Dataset</a>, consisting of jazz 
and classical music performances. Another source was the <a href="https://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/">Lakh MIDI Dataset</a>, 
which contains a broader range of genres, including many contemporary pieces.</p>

<p>To create a model which generates highly expressive performances, we processed the data to filter out ‘low quality’ 
items. Anyone who has worked with MIDI datasets will appreciate that many songs sound ‘bad’.
This raises some difficult problems: What is musical quality? How can we account for subjective preferences? 
Are some songs so weird we can confidently deem them ‘not musical’? Suffice to say, these problems are beyond
the scope of this post.</p>

<p>Ultimately, our working solution can be summarised as this: An engineer listened to some data items, in each case 
proclaiming “Yep, this sounds musical” or “Nope, I don’t like it”. In the process, they developed automated heuristics
to filter unwanted items, biasing the dataset towards songs that are subjectively ‘musical’. In the future it would be 
interesting to crowd-source these assessments, or to devise heuristics based on music theory instead.</p>

        <p>The Raspberry Pi is capable of running the NoSQL database Elasticsearch.</p>
<p>Either use <a href="https://schneefux.xyz/tech/raspberrypi-bootstrapping/">Arch Linux ARM</a> or the Raspbian Lite (Stretch) image and add the Elasticsearch apt repository. The packages are cross platform, but there are no official arm packages in the debian repository, so you need to force <code>arch=amd64</code>:</p>
<pre><code>deb [arch=amd64] http://packages.elasticsearch.org/elasticsearch/5.x/debian stable main
</code></pre><ul>
<li>Mount a btrfs formatted USB stick to <code>/var/lib/elasticsearch</code> using <code>nodatacow,noatime,nobarrier</code>. COW should always be disabled for directories with database files.</li>
<li>Install <code>elasticsearch kibana</code> and NodeJS (on ArchLinux with Kibana 5.5, you need <code>nodejs-lts-boron</code>).</li>
<li>Set the Elastic jvm minimum/maximum heap size to 1/2 of your Pi’s RAM. The rest will be used by Elastic’s Lucene backend.</li>
<li>Disable system call filter checks on startup with <code>bootstrap.system_call_filter: false</code> because the Raspberry Pi does not support JNI, which Elastic tries to import in order to run the checks.</li>
<li>Increase ping timeouts. The Raspberry Pi needs several minutes to start Elasticsearch and will timeout often. <code>discovery.zen.ping_timeout: 60</code></li>
<li>Set up clustering: specify a cluster name, add a few <code>discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts</code> and most importantly increase <code>discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes</code> to the minimum number of nodes / 2 + 1. The initial discovery will take a long time with timeouts from the Raspberry Pis in the cluster and increasing the minimum number of nodes will prevent the “split brain” where multiple Raspberry Pis elect themselves at masters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having tested an Elasticsearch cluster with a 20G index across 3 Raspberry Pi nodes and my laptop, I cannot recommend it. Performance was awful, syncing data took hours, and <a href="https://schneefux.xyz/tech/scaling-elasticsearch/">removing the Pis from the cluster again</a> was a pain.</p>

<p>Data Governance seeks to bring order to the chaos that emerges as organisations turn to data to make decisions. To many, the term “data” is synonymous with “fact”, forgetting the fact that data requires context to be properly interpreted. Context varies by department, business unit across teams and even within teams, leading to misinterpretation of data and increasing the risk that data is misrepresented. Data Governance helps to define rules, processes and policies for how data is collected, managed to ensure that it can be consistently interpreted and applied to advanced analytics, machine learning and automation. </p>
<p>Analytics platforms like PowerBI, Tableau and Looker put data in the hands of employees and promise better decisions based on real data. But what happens when a colleagues number is different from yours? Or when people don’t know which version of a dashboard to view? Or when you discover the “Sales metric” you have been making decisions on doesn’t actually include all the things you thought it does?</p>
<p>Machine Learning has the capability to transform all aspects of business, from recommending products to your customers, optimising call routing in your call centre through to segmenting marketing messages. As organisations become more reliant on these technologies, they are more likely to incorporate them deeper into their processes leaving them vulnerable to prickly edge cases. Machine learning fails are already well-publicised, from<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight-idUSKCN1MK08G" rel="nofollow"> sexist recruitment AI at Amazon</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/geraldmellor/status/712880710328139776?lang=en" rel="nofollow">Microsoft’s AI Twitter Bot “Tay” who lasted less than 24 hours before going full racist.</a></p>
<p>Automation, especially when combined with Machine Learning makes organisations more efficient and more scalable. Marketing Automation provides marketers with super-powers to deliver the right message to the right customer at the right time. However, when automation fails (often due to errors in data), the problems are amplified – as one mistake can set off a chain of events that can destroy organisations.</p>
<h2 id="Introduction"><span>Introduction</span></h2>
<p>To help illustrate the importance of Data Governance, we will use a fictional company, which has run into an equally fictional set of challenges. Forrest Corp, is an online book retailer with approximately 100 staff, based in Melbourne, Australia. As with many organisations of this size, Forest Corp has functional teams responsible for Marketing, Finance, Technology, Customer Service and Operations. Forrest Corp has been wildly successful, with sales exploding throughout COVID-19 lockdowns.</p>
<p><strong>The problem</strong></p>
<p>The executive team is very displeased that gross margins and profitability have deteriorated sharply, and that their personal (managed) Instagram feeds are blowing up with negative messages. They want answers! In speaking with leaders from different teams, they receive mixed messages:</p>
<ul><li>Marketing is excited to show a 10% increase in sales due to a Social Media Influencer campaign and finds it difficult to believe things are as bad as they are made out to be</li><li>Finance says sales are flat, with rising inventories, shipping costs and customer retention costs hurting margins and profitability</li><li>Customer service is inundated with complaints, but they feel they have it under control using their existing policies and procedures</li><li>Operations confirm the increase in sales, but their team is overworked in dealing with the influx of sales and a large number of returns.</li></ul>
<p>An analysis by an external analytics consultancy begins to unravel the story:</p>
<ul><li>The Marketing team recently established a new Social Media Influencer program, enabling influencers to sign up to earn referral commissions on books they recommend. </li><li>A very popular Social Media Influencer has recommended a particular book to their large follower base</li><li>The rapid increase in sales of the book have impacted the company’s recommendation model, leading to it being recommended to a much wider audience of customers</li><li>It turns out that the Social Media Influencer has misrepresented the book leading to a high rate of return from dissatisfied customers</li><li>In order to placate angry customers, customer Service follows its procedure of sending gifts to aggrieved customers, as recommended by their recommendation engine.</li><li>The gifts only inflame the situation, infuriated customers are often sent the same book as they initially returned.</li></ul>
<p>How could this all happen?</p>
<h2 id="Data-Governance">A failure of <span>Data Governance</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://datagovernance.com/">Data Governance Institute</a> defines data governance as “a system of decision rights and accountabilities for information-related processes, executed according to agreed-upon models which describe who can take what actions with what information, and when, under what circumstances, using what methods.”</p>
<p>Data governance is often formally practised in large organizations, but many of the concepts are applicable to all organisations seeking to utilise data in decision making.</p>
<p>In Forest Corp’s case, a series of failures in the way it collects, manages and utilizes data led to the cascading problems illustrated above.</p>
<h2 id="Data-Quality">Data Quality</h2>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="372" src="https://growingdata.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DataQualitySkyscraper_Fig2-01-1024x372.png" alt="" srcset="https://growingdata.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DataQualitySkyscraper_Fig2-01-1024x372.png 1024w, https://growingdata.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DataQualitySkyscraper_Fig2-01-300x109.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Data Quality Foundations <a href="https://profisee.com/data-quality-what-why-how-who/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Image credit</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Data quality is the foundation for all analytics and machine learning. As organisations seek to make more decisions on the basis of data, there is a real risk that decisions can be made incorrectly if the data underpinning them is incorrect, incomplete or inconsistent.</p>
<p>A key failure for Forest Corp’s marketing team was in its lack of screening of Influencer’s past histories. Social Media Influencers could sign up for their affiliate program easily, with critical pieces of information collected without any verification.</p>
<p>In the Forest Corp example, when the Marketing team’s analytics began showing the success of one affiliate code they immediately looked up the influencer behind it. Unfortunately, the URLs behind the profile were unusable. No data was supplied for their Twitter and Facebook handles, and their supplied Instagram handle didn’t actually exist. While contact information was provided, emails and phone calls went unanswered. So the Marketing Team was faced with a challenging scenario – their Social Media Influencer program is clearly generating sales but they are blind as to the content triggering it or the person behind it.</p>
<p>If data is captured incorrectly, it is often difficult or impossible to correct it. Worst of all though is that it’s only when an organisation <em>really</em> needs high-quality data that they realise it was never collected properly. In the Forrest Corp example, they were blind to a massive spike in sales attributable to a single affiliate without any way to tie it back to.</p>
<h3 id="Data-Quality-Recommendations">Data Quality Governance Recommendations</h3>
<h4 id="Incentivise-data-quality-at-the-point-of-collection">Incentivise data quality at the point of collection</h4>
<p>Digging deeper into the sign-up process for affiliates, it was discovered that the affiliate systems were built quickly following a mandate from the Executive Team to get the system up and running prior to a major holiday. Additionally, the Marketing Manager’s key KPI’s for the quarter were the number of onboarded affiliates, as well as the sales volume generated by affiliates. The problems with the affiliate signup process was a product of these incentives.</p>
<p>The time pressure to build the onboarding system meant that the initial design could not be implemented in its entirety. As Product Owner, the Marketing Manager had to prioritize which features would make the initial version, and which would be delayed to a future version. Automated verification of affiliates was seen as a large piece of work and thought to add friction to the signup process potentially hurting the Marketing Managers KPIs. It was therefore easy for the Marketing Manager to de-prioritise this feature of the onboarding system.</p>
<h5 id="Guiding-principles-for-incentivizing-data-quality">Guiding principles for incentivizing data quality</h5>
<ul><li>Key Performance Indicators that create disincentives for data quality should be avoided.</li><li>Analyse and understand the unintended consequences of performance metrics on data quality</li><li>Incorporate data quality metrics into KPI’s for Product Owners whos products involve data capture</li></ul>
<h4 id="Projects-that-involve-data-collection-require-oversight-and-guidance,-and-periodic-review">Projects that involve data collection require oversight and guidance, and periodic review</h4>
<p>Without a process of oversight in how data was captured, the Marketing Manager was free to make decisions that ultimately caused the misleading Influencer to speak fraudulently on behalf of their organisation. However, the Marketing Manager is rightly focussed on Marketing, not issues of Data Governance. An organisation can’t and shouldn’t expect all its managers to be Data Governance experts.</p>
<h5 id="Guiding-principles-for-data-quality-oversight">Guiding principles for data quality oversight</h5>
<ul><li>A Data Governance Council should provide advice on issues relating to how projects are implemented and the potential costs and risks of different implementations.</li><li>Data quality metrics should be established with any project that involves data capture</li><li>A Data Governance Council should periodically review or audit key systems to see how they are actually being used and assess the quality of the data they capture.</li></ul>
<h4 id="Understand-the-pressures-on-your-users-when-entering-data">Understand the pressures on your users when entering data</h4>
<p>Equally, in designing the affiliate sign-up form, the Marketing Team failed to understand the pressures on Social Media Influencers. One of these pressures is the need to sign up to a <em>lot</em> of affiliate programs, and the fact that time spent signing up to affiliate programs is time not spent building their brand and following. The Forrest Corp Affiliate Signup process, while failing to verify key information, also asked for a lot of information much of which seemed fairly unimportant to them getting paid. Therefore a lot of fields were left blank, even critical ones.</p>
<h5 id="Guiding-principles-for-designing-data-capture-systems">Guiding principles for designing data capture systems</h5>
<p>Data entry is often the least enjoyable aspect of a process., but is of critical importance. Systems that collect data need to be user friendly and easy to use. Here are a few principles:</p>
<ul><li>Make use of “pick lists” or “autocomplete” to make it easy to link data</li><li>Make it easy to identify existing entities to reduce the risk of creating duplicate entries</li><li>Avoid requiring too many fields, or …</li></ul></div></div></div></div></article></div>

                    <p>Last week started with the ambitious goal of adding 10 recipes from various cookbooks into Hey Chef. I thought it'd be a good opportunity to "eat my own dog food" and test the Add Ingredient UI.</p><p>Well, 2 recipes and 3 pages of notes later, I gave up.</p><h2 id="mistakes-i-ve-made-a-few">Mistakes, I've made a few</h2><p>I thought if I covered quantity, measurement and ingredient names I could add <em>most</em> recipes to the app. It turns out, even these simple pieces of information can have hidden gotchas.</p><p>I made assumptions such as "ingredients always have a quantity and measurement" &nbsp;<em>(spoiler: they don't) and</em> jumped from design to development without user testing.</p><p>If I wanted to deliver a great user experience, I'd have to dive deep on ingredients and find issues with my UI <em>before </em>development. Enter prototyping.</p><h2 id="what-s-a-prototype">What's a prototype?</h2><p>Prototypes are lightweight versions of your product, designed to highlight usability and flow issues prior to development. Although they <em>can</em> involve code, they typically range from sketches on paper to interactive design files. Development is expensive and prototyping saves time by discovering problems early in the design process.</p><h2 id="add-ingredient-v2">Add Ingredient v2</h2><p>I made this interactive prototype and set myself a new goal of "share it with 5 users and find problems early."</p><p>The clip below is of the design <em>after</em> feedback, but I'll go into the issues I discovered in my user testing sessions and why ingredients aren't as simple as the seem.</p><figure><img src="https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/2021/02/HeyChefAddIngredient.gif" alt=""><figcaption>New and improved Add Ingredient UI.

They aren't always consistent in their sentence structure, and can vary wildly from source to source.</p><p>I've found 4 main categories of information that can be included in ingredient lists.</p><h3 id="quantity">Quantity</h3><blockquote><em>extra virgin olive oil</em></blockquote><p>Ingredients always have a quantity, until they don't. Sometimes recipes will just say "olive oil." As in, olive oil will be used at some point, in some quantity but I'm not telling you how much.</p><p>The strange thing is, the recipe will usually say in the method somewhere to add "1 tablespoon of olive oil." Just put that in the ingredients then!</p><p>I've decided that Hey Chef will always require a quantity. It'll make development of features like "Shopping Lists" easier and keep data consistent. </p><h3 id="not-every-ingredient-has-a-measurement">Not every ingredient has a measurement</h3><figure><img src="https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/2021/02/Optional-Measurements.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Optional-Measurements.jpg 600w, https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Optional-Measurements.jpg 1000w, https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/2021/02/Optional-Measurements.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Old UI vs New Design.

Now, the user can just tap "Done" and save the ingredient without one.</p><p>I did have issues in user testing with people not <em>always</em> seeing the option to add a measurement, so I might have to revisit that UI in future.</p><h3 id="custom-measurements">Custom Measurements</h3><figure><img src="https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/2021/02/Custom-Measurements.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Custom-Measurements.jpg 600w, https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Custom-Measurements.jpg 1000w, https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/2021/02/Custom-Measurements.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Smart measurement suggestions for "bacon."
