Lambda Diagrams are a graphical notation for closed lambda terms,
in which abstractions (lambdas) are represented by horizontal lines,
variables by vertical lines emanating down from their binding lambda,
and applications by horizontal links connecting the leftmost variables.
In the alternative style, applications link the nearest deepest variables,
for a more stylistic, if less uniform, look.
<p>

The following table shows diagrams of identity, the booleans, some standard combinators,
some Church numerals, the predecessor function on Church numerals, and Omega.

<table>

</tbody></table>
Curiously, the alternative Omega diagram somewhat resembles an (upside-down) Omega.
</p><p>
And here, on a larger scale, is a prime number sieve (alternative style): </p><p>
<img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/primes.alt.gif">
</p><p>
which reduces to an infinite list of booleans that starts out as
</p><p>
<img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/primebits.gif">

</p><h2>Dimensions and complexity</h2>

In terms of pixels, a diagram's width is one less than 4 times the number of variables
(vertical lines),
and its height is one more than twice the maximum number of nested abstractions and applications
(one less for alternaitve diagrams with multiple variables).
<p>
The size of the binary encoding of a term is closely related to
the graphical complexity: it is exactly twice the number of lines
plus the number of (4-way) intersections.

</p><h2>Reduction</h2>

Beta-reduction on lambda diagrams can be shown in several steps, as demonstrated in this reduction
from Y=λf.(λx.x x)(λx.f(x x)) to λf.(λx.f(x x))(λx.f(x x))

<table>
<tbody><tr><td>initial term</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td>show application of abstraction</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y0.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td>show bound variables and argument</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y1.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td>expand function body</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y2.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td>to make room for substitution</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y3.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td>substitute argument for variables</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y4.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td>final term</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y5.gif"></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

In the third frame, we show only the part of bound variables below abstractions, e.g. when
applying <img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/applied.gif">, the function body x(λy.x) shows as <img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/bound.gif">.

<h2>Diagrams In Motion</h2>

Paul Brauner has produced some awesome <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi8_XqluS5xc7GL-bgVrxpA2Uww6nK0gV">videos</a> of beta reductions, produced with this <a href="https://github.com/polux/lambda-diagrams">software</a>.

<a href="http://dkeenan.com/">Dave Keenan</a> has a comprehensive online paper
<a href="http://dkeenan.com/Lambda/">To Dissect a Mockingbird:
A Graphical Notation for the Lambda Calculus with Animated Reduction</a>,
which partly inspired this page.
<p>
In his <a href="http://bntr.planet.ee/lambda/work/visual_lambda.pdf">Master thesis</a>, Viktor Massalõgin discusses 4 existing graphical notations before introducing his own "bubble" notation. Figure 3 on page 10 shows 4 depictions of the fixpoint combinator (which differs from Y above in one beta reduction), while the bubble form is in Figure 5 on page 13.

        <p>Published on: 2020-10-04</p>
        
<p>Dual licensing with GPL is the idea that if I own a certain piece of GPL code, I can also relicense it as a proprietary library. This is how Oracle licenses Java and how QT licenses QT.</p>
<h2>I - All rights for me but not for thee</h2>
<p>But my general feeling is that there is some stigma associated with this practice, to quote <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#ReleaseUnderGPLAndNF">gnu.org</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To release a nonfree program is always ethically tainted, but legally there is no obstacle to your doing this. If you are the copyright holder for the code, you can release it under various different non-exclusive licenses at various times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "ethically tainted" doesn't resonate with me, I think this licensing model should be encouraged.</p>
<p>I will admit I am kind of biased on this because I work on a for-profit GPL-license project. But it strikes me as silly that this business model is shunned by the open-source community in favor of licensing under MIT/BSD.</p>
<p>Dual licensing is a way in which the "owner" of the code ends up in an advantageous position compared to other users.</p>
<p>That is to say, a user must abide by the strict rules of the GPL license:</p>
<ul>
<li>Release all modifications.</li>
<li>Potentially (depending on the specifics of the GPL license) have to release other projects that are used "in relation" to the library.</li>
<li>Not ship the code under a different license.</li>
</ul>
<p>The "owner" of the code abides by none of these and can thus benefit in ways that the users can't.</p>
<p>In the open-source utopia, where resources are aplenty for everyone, everything is open source and nothing is for sale, so dual-licensing doesn't fit that particular utopia. But we live in the real world, where money makes things a bit more complicated, and in the long term, dual-licensing might be better than equal-rights open licenses.</p>
<p>Well, developers have to eat.</p>
<p>Even worst, good software is made by good developers, developers which can get six-figure salaries designing skinner boxes. On the contingency that those developers aren't ideal altruists, they have to get way-above-subsistence salaries to work on useful open source projects instead of skinner boxes.</p>
<p>So if dual-licensing provides a middle ground for that which is better than the current situation where a lot of good software is proprietary, what's the harm?</p>
<p>Some would say it's a middle ground that will hamper the development of truly free software. But who release said truly free software anyway?</p>
<h2>II - Who release fully-free projects</h2>
<p>When it comes to license like MIT and BSD, that impose no restrictions upon usage, where the "owner" doesn't exist, it's interesting to look at who release projects under those licenses:</p>
<p>a) Students or hobbyists, people creating software for fun, notoriety, and experience.</p>
<p>b) Very large companies (Facebook, Google, Amazon, Uber) or government &amp; donation founded organizations (Universities, Public Research centers, software foundations such as GNU, Apache, and LSF)</p>
<p>The first group is one I don't wish to dismiss, I think a lot of important programs stem from here. But their end goal is not to work for free for their whole life. Usually, they moonlight for their open-source projects and work a paid gig to earn money. A small minority can be funded by donations, but it's a small minority.</p>
<p>The project I use for allowing comments on this website (<a href="https://github.com/umputun/remark42">remark42</a>), has 2.3k stars on GitHub and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/remark42/posts">earns 9$/month from donations</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb">project I work on</a> has 2.9k stars on Github and an operating budget of <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/04/16/mindsdb-raises-3-million-for-open-source-automated-machine-learning/">a few million</a> dollars.</p>
<p>You can certainly get to a point where you are funded by donations, but the reality is that it's not a good enough incentive. Doubly so since the developers working on these projects are usually the "creme de la creme", releasing and maintaining truly useful software usually requires expertise only a small fraction of engineers have.</p>
<p>The second group, the corporation and government-funded teams can only exist because of the scale.</p>
<p>Why can Facebook develop PyTorch?</p>
<ul>
<li>Because Facebook hires so many ML engineers that in the cost-benefit analysis it's cheaper to have your internal framework be popular enough such that you can get already-trained people from day 1. The &lt; 100 people working full time on PyTorch save months of training for every single one of the thousands of ML people facebook hires, since it can hire people that already know PyTorch.</li>
<li>Because Facebook doesn't dominate by having better ML models, it dominates by having thousands of times more data than anyone else. It's in facebook's interest to keep research open since it's objective is not to get ahead, but just to stay even, or at least not fall significantly behind.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why can Nvidia assign engineers to dozens of open source ML and game-engine projects?</p>
<ul>
<li>Because Nvidia makes hundreds of billions each year selling GPUs. The little work they put into those libraries to make sure it works ideally with their GPUs is insignificant to the revenue they get from those markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why can Google develop TensorFlow?</p>
<ul>
<li>For about the same reasons as Facebook.</li>
<li>Because they can make a lot more money from selling/renting TensorFlow optimized hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's on the happier side of the spectrum. On the "shadier" end of the scale, one could argue projects like Flutter and Angular might be worth their investment because they make spyware-free browsers like Firefox send-class citizens in the war for the web, not to mention easier integration into internet-monopolizing schemas like AMP.</p>
<p>You've also got, I will admit, projects that seem to be open source purely for flexing. To my knowledge, Yandex might have well never released Clickhouse and the column-store database landscape would have been set back 10+ years for it. Why did they do it? Maybe just because few dozens of people working on it wanted to showcase how good they are.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, this is not a reliable model</p>
<h2>III - Profit motives</h2>
<p>So would it not be nice for open source if one can bring profit motives into the whole thing?</p>
<p>Even better, profit from the people that don't support or contribute to open source, but not from those that do.</p>
<p>It seems to me like double-licensing with GPL achieves just that. One can release a project and charge large companies for using it, at the risk of breaking the license if they don't pay. Even if a lot of them will use the software illegally, as is the case now, the threat of lawsuits will end up deterring some or most heavy-users from doing so.</p>
<p>On the other hand, people using the project in an open-source project of their own have nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>The only problem that remains here is the fact that you can't chain GPL projects. That is to say, one can't use GPL code in their own double-licensed GPL code, but there are workarounds for that (e.g. isolating the GPL dependency and open-sourcing the changes to that alone). Still, this seems like the kind of problem that could be fixed by an off-shoot of the GPL meant for just this use-case.</p>
<p>This model keeps all the advantages of GPL, in that it incentives your users to open-source their product. It doesn't force them to do so, like a purely-GPL licensed software might, but it's not like GPL is working as intended, outside of a few cases where enough money was at stake to sue (e.g. TiVo), violations of the GPL go unpunished.</p>
<p>Currently, a company that wants to include GPL into their project has two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the code in such a way that GPL won't force you to open source the rest of your code.</li>
<li>Use the code and break the license.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the wording of GPL is not that clear, it could often be argued that companies go for alternative nr 2. After all, who will ever know?</p>
<p>But what if the "pay the maintainer a small sum" option was available. Wouldn't the liability afraid giants look towards this much more favorably than either of the other 2 options? Wouldn't this, in the long run, give an edge to open source projects which don't have to worry about these fees ?</p>
<hr>
<p>Thus I think I come in squarely on the side of open-source companies dual-licensing GPL on their product[s]. A model that already exists and often enough has great success (see MariaDB and Aerospike).</p>
<p>It's a nice compromise for moving towards a more open world, without having to live in Stallman's utopia. It's an amazingly pragmatic solution and anyone who reads this blog knows I'm a fan of those.</p>

October 4, 2020 | https://www.phplift.net/is-the-life-of-a-programmer-lonely/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.phplift.net/is-the-life-of-a-programmer-lonely/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It is a fact that almost every job in the world has some stereotypes. Based on the lifestyles of a few, people start attaching specific attributes to a particular occupation and those associated with that specific job. For example, there is a myth that doctors are always rich and that pursuing a medical field is one’s road to financial stability. While doctors do make good money, it is not entirely true. But because we are presumptuous people, it is easier for us to assume things.</p>
<p>Just as there are certain stereotypes for doctors, there are certain qualities that are attached to programmers too. One of the most famous attributes that are believed to be in programmers is loneliness. It is usually said that a programmer does not have a life, and that’s why they are more likely to end up alone, isolated, and cut off from the world. But is it true? Let’s dig deep into it.</p>
<h2>The Association:</h2>
<p>The primary reason for the association of loneliness with the programmers is their dense life – where from waking up early in the morning to eventually going to sleep – coding is heavily influential. Tied up with loneliness, other attributes used to define a programmer’s life are no love life, anxiety, lack of genuine friends, and lack of socializing skills.</p>
<!-- phpgang custom -->
<p>When the question in the title was thrown at programmers on Quora, most responses provided the same reason for being lonely: introvertedness. Many said to have a good love life, and they also said to have pulled off a pretty good schedule where they could give time to coding yet be left with ample time to rejoice with their respective families. Not only that, but they also wrote to have spared enough time to read and study too.</p>
<p>However, many did agree that they did not lead happening lives. They can’t afford to have spontaneous plans or leave for an unplanned road trip that will have a severe impact on their job. As a programmer with a regular 9 to 5 job, you are supposed to work 8 hours a day, five days a week, all while ensuring a good moral character along with an aptitude for striving for bigger and better in terms of career and finance.</p>
<p>So, in juggling your career and finances as a programmer, sometimes introvertedness does become a choice.</p>
<h2>Does the Claim Stand True?</h2>
<p>While many programmers deny suffering from chronic loneliness due to their dense work schedule, many passionate programmers do not have ties with anyone other than their beloved family members. Undoubtedly, the nature of a programmer’s work-life demands undivided attention, but it is not entirely the kind of work they do. The field of programming is not saturated. The growing IT and AI industries are inspiring many to pursue their careers in the established and demanding fields of programming.</p>
<p>Being a mere programmer is not all it takes to build a sustainable future; a programmer has to stand out from the crowd of hundreds of thousands. Many passionate programmers give decades of their lives to refining their skills so that they are eventually able to build their empire, make a promising future for themselves and those associated with them.</p>
<p>In between the contractions and rarefactions of life and for the pursuit of a sustainable future, many programmers give up on the relations that they could have built, trips that they could have gone to, and, more importantly, the time that they could have spared for themselves.</p>
<h2>How to Deal with Programmers?</h2>
<p>Because of their quiet, grim, and gloomy demeanour, programmers are termed as weird. Such labelling is just the result of our rushed judgment. If you have a programmer friend, know that they do not necessarily have to be good at socializing and therefore, to get them out of their zombified stature, here are a few things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not expect holistic reactions from them.</li>
<li>Talk to them about their work-life</li>
<li>Discuss their goals and achievements</li>
<li>Share your interactions with programmers, if you have had any.</li>
<li>Make sure they don’t feel left out in a party or a gathering.</li>
<li>If they don’t want to attend a gathering, respect their decision.</li>
<li>Try persuading them to push their boundaries slowly and gradually.</li>
<li>Take them a place where they are least uncomfortable.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mentioned above are some of the ways you can deal with your programmer pals and buddies and help them enjoy things other than coding. Remember, a good programmer will do the coding by working hard, but a happy programmer will do the coding by heart.</p>

    <p>RSS: </p> <p><a href="https://reyammer.io/blog/index.xml"><img src="https://reyammer.io/rss.png" width="23px"></a></p>

  <p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/reyammer/status/1311338230139232258" target="_blank">news is out</a>: I left France, I'm no longer a professor at EURECOM, I joined the Malware Research Team at CISCO Talos, and I moved to beautiful Vienna. Big change :-)</p>
<p>I have been a professor for a bit more than three years, but I have had contrasting feelings about the "prof job" for a long time (even before finishing my PhD), it took me a couple of years to realize that I would eventually have needed to move on, and it took even more (mental) effort to actually make the call and leave. Despite being <em>very</em> excited for what's next, oh boy, this was tough :-) But independently of the concrete next step, it was time to move on. Even if Talos realizes the mistake and kicks me out next week, I'm still confident that moving on was the right call.</p>
<p>Especially when it comes to take big decisions, I tend to obsess about trying to stay rational, and I spent years collecting notes on the various pros/cons. Many of these thoughts often started surfacing as "feeling something is not right", without consciously understanding what was going on. But by keep thinking and writing notes down, patterns of thoughts started to emerge and I was eventually able to pinpoint some more defined thoughts on what kept me on the current job and what pushed me to change. Once these reasons were clear, it was much easier to take the decision.</p>
<p>This is a very long blog post, and I don't expect more than a very few people to actually read it. I wrote it mostly for selfish reasons: before changing to a new life, I wanted to wrap up all these notes in something more structured. I can't be certain I took a good decision, but systematizing these thoughts allowed me to move on with enough confidence to know I'm likely making a step forward.</p>
<p>With that being said, I know that someone may be actually interested in hearing these thoughts and my experience. When I was a PhD student and I needed to take the notorious academia vs. industry decision, I would have paid big bucks to read more thoughts on the various pros/cons. One of the stupidest things you can do is to take big decisions based on what other people do and think, but reading about other people's thought process has helped me a lot. It is time I do my part.</p>
<p>The target audience for this post is, other than myself, PhD students / postdocs that are about to decide what to do next and junior profs that somehow feel that "something is wrong". I also expect some senior academics and industry people to read this post, but I guess they will find themselves skipping directly to the academic rant part and mostly agree with much I have to say :-) Anyways, I tried to stay away from the "very known things" (e.g., 👀-level BS when writing proposals, generally "more limited" immediate impact of your work, different compensation level, etc.), and I tried to focus on thoughts I have not seen much discussed around (at least not in this depth).</p>
<p>So, if you feel clueless and you want to hear more from an equivalently clueless random dude on the Internet, here we are :-) If you think this is <em>the</em> blog post that will make everything clear, I have a bad news for you: it's all about tradeoffs and in my opinion there is no clear-cut winner. And, unfortunately, the problem with tradeoffs and balancing many aspects is that figuring out which one to weigh more is yet another very personal decision in its own way. So, you will not find any answer in this post and you will eventually need to figure this thing out on your own, but I hope this will help you forming your own opinion.</p>
<p>This post is organized in three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#part-1-the-good-mdash-what-pushed-me-to-keep-the-job">Part 1: The Good — What pushed me to keep the job</a></li>
<li><a href="#part-2-the-bad-mdash-what-pushed-me-to-leave-the-job">Part 2: The Bad — What pushed me to leave the job</a></li>
<li><a href="#part-3-the-bye-bye-mdash-the-decision-to-leave">Part 3: The Bye Bye — The decision to leave</a></li>

<h2 id="part-1-the-good-mdash-what-pushed-me-to-keep-the-job">Part 1: The Good — What pushed me to keep the job</h2>
<p>Before I discuss why I left, I want to touch on what pushed me to keep the job. I want to make sure it's a balanced post despite the upcoming mega rant, so that my overall opinion is more closely reflected. And I really don't want to discourage anyone to take this path, I still think it is a great one.</p>
<p>Note that some of my "reasons to stay" are good, but some are bad. Also note that many of these refer to my personal situation at EURECOM, working in the field of systems security, and not all these points can be generalized to all universities. As they say, your mileage may vary.</p>
<h3 id="its-a-very-good-job">It's a very good job</h3>
<p>The first pros is... 🥁: "it's a very good job". At first, I was shocked to find out that it's an actual job. When I joined this prof thingy I thought that this would be a "job" (note the double quotes). But, while it's true that you don't have a direct boss that tells you what to do, at the end of the day you need to deliver, and you actually work very hard: If your PhD students are in trouble or you teaching sucks, you will run into problems. This doesn't necessarily mean "they kick out", but if you value being a professional (and I do), failing at your core tasks will make you feel bad, even without additional pressure from your superior, and even if you have tenure.</p>
<p>And now that we got this "it's an actual job" out of the way, I can tell you: it's a very good one. There is <em>a lot</em> of freedom in what you do and how you structure your time. Research-wise I felt very free (but you eventually work on what your students like to work on — as it should be), and the department values the right things (I've heard some BS in other schools where, in the context of systems security research, they pressure you to "publish more journal papers..." 🤦‍♂️). I really like teaching and mentoring, and there were many opportunities to do so. They let me create and teach my own class on mobile security, <a href="https://mobisec.reyammer.io/" target="_blank">MOBISEC</a>, and the teaching load is overall very low (1 or 1.5 classes per year). I love playing CTFs and I was even <em>encouraged</em> to spend time and push for NOPS, the EURECOM CTF team (after winning <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/647" target="_blank">HXP CTF 2018</a> and after being referred to as "<a href="https://youtu.be/j0taw78tCYs?t=968" target="_blank">probably a top team</a>" we are mostly enjoying our eternal and well-deserved glory).</p>
<p>The environment is extremely relaxed, informal, and friendly. You are surrounded by top-skilled colleagues and humans, from MS students to profs. I felt in a family from day 1. Last very good point: since in France positions come with tenure, there were not even problems in terms of pre-tenure stress, a real luxury. And on this aspect, EURECOM delivered: I never felt any sort of pressure (but: I did work my ass off... so if you stop doing anything, bad things may happen :-)).</p>
<p>[BTW, EURECOM is frantically trying to replace me, you should apply :-)]</p>
<h3 id="you-are-surrounded-by-students">You are surrounded by students</h3>
<p>When I took my decision to remain in academia, my top reason was for teaching and mentorship. Probably the best perk of the job is that you are surrounded by people eager to learn, from MS to PhD students to postdocs. It is extremely fulfilling and rewarding. Working with my students has been the highlight of my time at EURECOM, from traditional teaching, to suffering through the various rejections, to celebrating defeats of Reviewer #2, to cluelessly getting CTF-close in many stego CTF challenges. I feel very lucky that during these years we found enough interesting ideas that we enjoyed working on together, and that my next job will allow me to keep advising them until they graduate. As a prof, I believe the net output of my work is to see students becoming independent researchers, not the actual papers — I can't wait to see the bright careers I'm sure they will have :-)</p>
<h3 id="i-have-deep-respect-for-the-role-of-profs-in-society-and-it-felt-great-to-be-one">I have deep respect for the role of "profs" in society, and it felt great to be one</h3>
<p>I somehow have a profound admiration for the role that professors have in society and that had in my life. For their hard work, knowledge, passion, patience, and ultimately their service to the community. I'm referring to all teachers and mentors (from elementary schools to universities), who spend their life helping others, while at the same time often being asked to do many useless things and being massively underpaid. I admire and deeply respect these efforts: my most sincere thank you to all past, present, and future profs!</p>
<p>And, to be frank, it felt great to be one. I have been in love with the idea of being a prof for many years. In part, I think it is because some of the people who impacted me the most are professors, and I wanted to do my part in helping others. And after all the uncertainties that one has during a PhD, I think I was even more in love with the idea of having finally found my place in society. [Narrator: LOL, this clueless dude did not find his place. [Answer to narrator: But I've surely found it <em>now</em>!!1!]]</p>
<p>Overcoming all these positive emotions and feelings attached to this job was likely the biggest challenge I faced in coming to terms with the several problems and cons I did have during these three years. As mentioned, I have no intention to give up on this teaching/mentoring thing (taking the time for this long blog post is part of this!), but it will surely not be the same thing. I'm very grateful I had a chance to try this job out. Thanks to all who made it possible, from family to advisors, colleagues, and students ❤️. I owe you big time.</p>
<p>[Of course, being a prof does not necessarily make you a smart or great person. Some profs I know are some of the dumbest people I have ever met (by far) and they would not survive one day in the real world. And some profs I know are the most asshole, selfish, egomaniac, and delusional humans I have ever heard of (Are you pushing your students to stay in the lab …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the little things I don’t like about Twitter, or social media in general, is how it demands you to constantly create new content to keep people’s attention.</p><p>I understand the value of creating new tweets or instagram posts, sharing ephemeral updates that entertain and engage for a short while and keep your presence fresh in the minds of your audience. That’s how discovery-based social media works.</p><p>But I’ll be the first to admit that I’m a fan of things that you can do once, but reap the benefits of again and again, preferably growing over time.</p><p>And hence I prefer intent-driven search, because if I can show up for a relevant search and satisfy the searcher’s query well enough with my content, I can reap the benefits of that content today, tomorrow, and into the future.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve read in theory about SEO for long enough, without ever having practiced it strategically in the long term. One of the growth pillars for DelightChat is based on SEO, so I might as well move on from theory and get started with real world learnings.</p><p>My personal blog <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/blog" target="_blank">Preetamnath.com</a> is the first such long-term experiment.&nbsp;</p><p>I started publishing regularly on June 4, exact 4 months ago. Back then, my blog was to get 50 impressions/day on search results. Today, the average is at 1000/day. That’s a solid 20x jump.</p><figure id="w-node-8f3ea7c3f7d8-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f79561d425f076bba77e965_search%20traffic%20on%20preetamnath%20console.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Clicks have gone up from 3/day to 30/day, which is a 10x jump. Looks like clicks didn’t grow as well as impressions, perhaps there’s a layer of optimisation that I could look into over there.<br></p><p>I first noticed that my blog was showing up for “micro saas”, “shopify app ideas” and related long term keywords. Back then I hadn’t thought too deeply about it. But I did end up making a page called <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/habit-tracker-app" target="_blank">Habit Tracker App</a> as an experiment, which I published on August 2 (little over 2 months ago).</p><p>Since then, my habit tracker landing page has garnered 4,700+ impressions and 239 clicks directly from Google Search. This is completely on autopilot, I’ve never updated the page since I first posted.</p><figure id="w-node-d230c6cb7bbb-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f79567f6493631e80a0a6e1_habit%20tracker%20search%20organic%20traffic.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>June 4-Oct 3 data.

It shouldn’t have taken me this long, but today I’m doubling down on that keyword by creating a dedicated page called Micro SaaS.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For my page, I did basic research around</p><ul role="list"><li>Which search terms related to “Micro SaaS” is my blog already ranking.</li><li>What are the suggested keywords and questions that I see when I type “Micro SaaS” on Google.</li><li>What are the related search phrase suggestions I see from Keywords Everywhere.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imposter syndrome is something that I have been battling with my entire life. Often times I get the feeling that whatever success &nbsp;I have acquired over the years might have just been luck or maybe things worked out because I partnered with the right people who did all the work while I reaped the fruits. </p><p>This feeling started all the way back in school when I scored the highest marks in an exam which everybody else struggled with. </p><p>At the time I was convinced that the only reason this happened was because I was lucky enough to have studied that one question in the syllabus which nobody thought would appear in the exam but ended up appearing. </p><p>But here’s the thing, because I felt like a fraud I ended up studying harder for the next exam with the fear of being exposed as someone who just got lucky in the last one. So is this feeling really a bad thing?</p><h3>‍<br>‍<strong>Why does imposter syndrome occur?</strong><br></h3><p>From my personal experience, I can say that imposter syndrome mainly occurs in people who have self taught themselves the skill that they are currently using to make a living. </p><p>In my case it is software development. I was not particularly good at it in college even though I was studying computer science. I was just an average student if not below average.</p><p>After I left college I started working in early stage startups where there is no structure or someone to teach you stuff. The only option is to do your own research and learn things yourself. Google and Stack overflow were my only true friends.</p><p>Because I never really went through a “standard program” I always have this self doubt and I never know if the way I am doing things is the right way or not and the fact that there is no defined right way of doing things in software does not make this any easier.<br></p><h3><strong>How do you use this as a strength</strong><br></h3><p>My co-founder and I built a business that <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/blog/grow-shopify-micro-saas-to-25k-mrr-in-14-months" target="_blank">we grew to $25k MRR</a>. Because of my imposter syndrome I have convinced myself that most of it was luck. We were in the right place at the right time. <br></p><p>The fact that we did 2 months of research on the market and product, spent a lot of time figuring out where we would get distribution from even before writing a single line of code seemed to have conveniently slipped my mind. The reason we even did all of this in the first place was our fear of not being good enough.<br></p><p>We have now started a <a href="https://www.delightchat.io/" target="_blank">new venture</a> and hired a team. Now because of the fact that we had a successful venture in the past, I am now under immense pressure to make this new one a success otherwise I might get exposed as a “fraud” or someone who “just got lucky”. <br></p><p>Because I have no other option but to make this a success I am going to work hard once again just like I did in my last venture. I would like to think that this imposter syndrome has turned into a strength. It is a feature and not a bug.<br></p><h3><strong>Closing notes</strong><br></h3><p>Some amount of self doubt is healthy and it keeps you on your toes. It also prevents you from letting your previous success go to your head and always be open for new learnings.<br></p><p>It enables you to be open to the suggestions given by your teammates which you might otherwise ignore just because they are less experienced than you if you had no self doubt at all. <br></p><p>Having said that, it is also not right to doubt yourself to an extent where it starts impacting you in a negative way. For instance, what if your teammates catch wind of your immense self doubt and they start losing faith in you? This is also not something you can afford.<br></p><p>One must have a healthy balance of self doubt and faith in yourself that you are moving in the right direction.</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<p>As the reading time estimate crept over 30 minutes, without any end in sight, I was starting to feel like a bit of a blowhard.</p>



<p>The draft I’d originally intended to inaugurate this blog is still sitting there. Maybe I will condense and finish it (eventually), but I think it makes more sense to write <s>briefly</s> less long-windedly about what I mean. Instead of trying to exhaust the subject matter, I’m going to offer a perspective, and present a more intuitive argument for it.</p>



<p>So, more briefly, I’d like to ask you to think, for a moment, about what makes humans <em>ethically</em> important. There are two parts to this question, hidden just under the surface. The first asks you to consider why humans are ethical <em>agents</em>. What makes it possible for them to do, want, or experience things that could fall under the umbrella of ethics? The second (no particular order) asks you to consider why humans are ethical <em>patients</em>. How is it that what happens to them, what is wanted of them, or what is experienced about them might also be part of an ethical problem? (This agent/patient distinction I inherit from Coeckelbergh, whose book, <em>Growing Moral Relations</em>, is worth your time.)</p>



<p>I will add before you start: ethics has been defined in a few different ways, over the millennia. I consider a few definitions interesting. </p>



<p>Charles Taylor, for instance, describes ethics as pertaining not just to moral choices and obligations between people, but questions like “what is the good life?” and “what is good?”. His more expansive account, following Aristotle, moves closer to the Greek root, which refers to one’s <em>character</em>, and can be read to have a slant towards something resembling <em>virtue ethics</em>. Using Taylor, we could ask questions like “what is it good to love?” and not just “what is the right way to act?” </p>



<p>Conversely, followers of Nietzsche contrast <em>ethics</em> with <em>morality</em>, arguing that morality is about passing judgment on what people (or living beings) are and do, whereas ethics can be about <em>affirming</em> life as intrinsically self-justifying. From a (post-) Nietzschean point of view, life’s capacity to want, struggle, and change, <em>is, from the very beginning, what is good</em> (maybe not in those words). Living well means trying to overcome the need to judge, and instead to explore and express what it is to be alive, for all its intensities and tragedies. Nietzsche is often read to be asking his readers to abandon compassion, or to think only of themselves and never of the common good, but I don’t think that is exactly the case. Nietzsche is asking us to live in pursuit of what is good, but not to define it as the enemy of the bad, rather, to live <em>for its own sake, come what may</em>, and to do what is good, <em>defined in itself</em>, rather than as a reaction.</p>



<p>I don’t know Coeckelbergh’s position on ethics broadly, but he considers morality to be embedded in social relationships themselves. Rather than what is right or wrong to do to a <em>patient</em> being about its properties (whether it has consciousness, for instance) and defined in absolute terms, morality is about what relationships exist between an agent and a patient, and what kinds of relationships are good to have, knowing what the agent and patient already are to each other. Do I already mostly act like it’s a person? I should probably treat it like one. Coeckelbergh is interesting in that he tries to legitimate ideas that have, until recently, not had much hearing in the community of western philosophers, although citing him as a source for them over others might, fairly, be challenged. For instance, he would consider our dependence on our ecology grounds to entertain an obligation towards it. I haven’t finished his book yet, so I’m not aware of the extent of the advice he gives for considering problems in these relationships, but it seems fair to say that he doesn’t believe there’s a system of absolute rules out there, or that we should try to find final answers to ethical problems. Relationships are particular, and they evolve. We shouldn’t seek to use the fact that we don’t get hard answers for our convenience; instead, we should consider relationships, for their lumpiness, their particularity, their uncertainty, and live them as best we can.</p>



<p>All of these viewpoints are very different from our ordinary patterns of ethical thought. We are used to thinking that <em>individuals</em>, or sometimes <em>social groups</em> (such as nations) have <em>rights</em> that must be guaranteed to them, but everything else goes. Sometimes, referencing Isaiah Berlin, we might say we believe that this obligation is <em>negative</em> (there are some things that people are fundamentally allowed to do, and our only obligation is to stop people who try to mess with that), or it is <em>positive</em> (there are some things that people should fundamentally be allowed to do, and we need to do our best to make that possible for them). Maybe, for whatever definition of the good, we are utilitarians, who think that we should do the most good for the most people, whatever means that could entail. Perhaps we take the <em>view from afar</em>, and ask “if I had the choice of all reasonably possible societies, which would I like to be born into, knowing that I might be anyone?” Perhaps we see ethics as different versions of the trolley problem, and find reasons, based on our moral intuitions, about what choices we should make when push comes to shove. Some of us, unfashionably, believe in immortal souls and divine law, against which we must not sin, or that her majesty inherits the right to judge from God, and that the highest good is obedience to an Earthly law. A scientist, being familiar with Hume, might read his argument that we cannot derive statements about what <em>ought to be</em> from statements about what <em>is</em>, and see cause to be an anti-realist. Maybe <em>ought</em> statements only express our personal preferences, derived from what we’ve been either (or both) biologically or socially conditioned to think is pleasing. Scientists might say this implies some sort of <em>relativism</em>, or that it’s best to follow whatever is the <em>conventional</em> way to think about ethics (although, if we’re not in the business of assuming the world is already a pretty just place to be in, that last one may not be safe). </p>



<p>So, knowing what you know about what humans are made of, and how they relate to one another, to society, or to other beings, what makes them ethical agents, and what does it mean that they are? What about patients? I think it’s probably a bad idea to try to find an answer too quickly. It might be better to think through what kinds of approaches are better, and what facts could be relevant to the question. For instance, maybe the way people want things matters, as it is defined in terms of elaborations on what’s generated by the default mode network. Maybe there can’t be exactly one right answer, or maybe there must be, or maybe it’s impossible to know. How would you argue that?</p>



<h2>Why it Matters </h2>



<p>I don’t fully agree with Taylor, but, in <em>Sources of the Self</em>, he makes a good case for why we shouldn’t be self-serving, and why we already care about ethics. He says ethics are about what we <em>want to be</em>, how we identify ourselves. This is always done in terms of social groups we identify <em>with</em>. “I am a professional, so I should…” Identity gives us community, people who share something about us (a way of life, perhaps), or maybe it contrasts us against a community (we can identify ourselves as rebels). We rarely, if ever, identify with just one thing, and it’s no use to try to come up with a completely original identity, if it’s possible to do it meaningfully at all, because it doesn’t tell us much about what we’re trying to be, given we’re the only one who would know or care that we’re being it. Identity is critically important to us in interpreting our place in the world, and what we are trying to do with it. So, says he, without identity, we would struggle to come to grips with life. It is a good thing, then, that you and I already have some ideas about <em>who we are</em>, or if we’re struggling to figure that out, generally already acknowledge that it <em>is</em> an important thing to get down. Taylor says that, since it’s all about coming to grips with life, we escape Hume’s is/ought problem, because we don’t have to set up an ethics from scratch. Ethics are already there from the beginning, and have some known properties, so we can argue about them by contrasting them. “Given these two frameworks, which one of them provides the richer set of tools for figuring out how to live a good life?” To Taylor, ethics are certainly <em>real</em>, but not in the sense that they’re an object embedded in a reality perfectly detached from us, rather, they come <em>from</em> the fact that we are social creatures, and relate <em>to</em> how we are trying to live in society. They aren’t just individual, or perfectly culturally relative (as there are no perfectly incommensurable cultures, which share none of the same moral ideas and cannot communicate with each other), but they aren’t exactly objective and final either.</p>



<p>I like Taylor, for how he grounds consciousness of <em>ethics</em> in <em>social consciousness</em>, and I like how good he is at striking down the (usually unanswerable) “why should I care about ethics?” question. I share Coeckelbergh’s complaint that he considers only one kind of relation (between the individual and the community), and I would also gripe that his ethics are unusually centred on the <em>self</em>, for a subject that tends to ask us to think beyond ourselves. But then, that is why the argument against selfishness works so well. It’s difficult to get through to somebody who only thinks of themself unless that’s the place you’re starting from. </p>



<p>Taylor’s other issues, which I will not go too in-depth on here, are first, that he frames the source of ethics as appearing in the fact that one is an <em>ind…</em></p></div></section></main></div></div>

  <p>The internet is pretty cool; right now I’m watching some Harvard lectures on advanced algorithms. This one’s about sorting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>- Me</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What’s an algorithm?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>- Mom and Dad</p>

<p>I’m hanging out with my parents for the week. Anytime I’m home I try to spend a little time giving my parents a better sense of what I do. Neither have much background in science or engineering, but they always indulge me and ask to hear about what I’m working on.</p>

<p>Clearly explaining complicated things to people who don’t have a background is an invaluable skill. Anytime there’s a chance to practice, take advantage of it.</p>

<p>We ended up on the topic of algorithms, so I decided to play a game. I asked Dad how to describe the steps needed to sort a list of randomly generated integers from smallest to largest. That didn’t get much of a response besides “Well, study the numbers, then put them in order.”</p>

<p>I decided we needed a visual aid. We cut up and numbered some paper square and manually went through the process of creating a random array and then sorting it.</p>

<figure>
	<a href="https://i.imgur.com/f3FobQr.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/f3FobQr.png"></a>
</figure>

<p>The first couple iterations of sorting the numbers didn’t make much progress towards describing any sort of algorithm. It sort of just <em>happened</em>. There were some vague mutterings about “this goes over here” and “then the 6 can move here…” and the like.</p>

<p>Eventually, I took over and said he had to tell me what to do instead. I would write down the instructions as we went along. That also didn’t go perfectly. After a couple of tries, a lot of clarifying questions, and a hint or two, however, I was able to write down the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find min.</li>
  <li>Find max.</li>
  <li>Decide bin size.</li>
  <li>Move min to far left.</li>
  <li>Look right (within bin) for num not in bin.</li>
  <li>Move num to correct bin.</li>
  <li>Within bin, find number just smaller than num, place num in from of smaller number.</li>
  <li>If any num shouldn’t be in bin, put it in the right bin. (Repeat previous 3 steps).</li>
  <li>If all nums in bin are in valid bin, quickly sort “nearby”.</li>
  <li>If nearby is sorted, record max value.</li>
  <li>Do comparison to the right, until you find unsorted num.</li>
  <li>Check for nums in wrong bin.</li>
  <li>Either go back to putting nums in right bin, or go back to quickly sorting “nearby”.</li>
  <li>Check if array is sorted.</li>
</ol>

<p>By this point, both parents were sufficiently through with the conversation. But I had to take it one step further and turn this algorithm into working code.</p>

<p>After a few quick sessions ChuckSort was born. You can check out the source code on GitHub for more details.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Jessime/ChuckSort">https://github.com/Jessime/ChuckSort</a></p>

<p>You’ll notice that the algorithm in <code>chuck_sort.py</code> isn’t exactly the same as what’s above. It morphed a bit over the 3-4 short sessions it took me to write it up. I’m fine with that. The essence of what happened with those little paper squares is still captured in this repo. The fun bit is that the code actually works. Here’s the algorithm sorting 1 through 100:</p>

<figure>
	<a href="https://i.imgur.com/jcf92Mo.gif"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jcf92Mo.gif"></a>
</figure>

<p>This exercise reminded me of two things.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Learning to think algorithmically is difficult and not something humans do intuitively. In some sense, this is great news for beginner programmers who often feel a lot of frustration about the difficulty of programming and their lack of progress. It’s normal! Becoming a good programmer is so much more than learning the syntax of a language. It’s about expression. It’s about taking hold of thoughts in your head and clarifying those thoughts until they can ultimately be expressed in binary. When you’re programming in the context of something like bioinformatics, it’s also about capturing real-world phenomena in some accurate way.</li>
  <li>Even if <em>you’re</em> used to thinking programmatically, it’s hard to capture what someone’s doing to process some task. Even when the process is as simple as sorting 20 numbers, I was never able to fully capture what Dad was doing to sort the numbers. I’m no psychologist, but it feels like this observation has interesting implications for assuming the intent or rationale of other humans. Given the political climate (there’s been a lot of politics this week), I find it entertaining how often we say things like, “He obviously did this because he wanted to…”, or “All of those people think that…”. It’s absurd. I can’t even tell you why my own father sorted 20 numbers the way he did. How are you going to assert the intentions of some random person you’ve never met on some complex political topic? I digress…</li>
</ol>

<p>tl;dr: Formalizing the world into code is <em>tricky</em>, but fun!</p>

<hr>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Transmitter localization is a both interesting and challenging task. Besides applying triangulation in combination with some type of direction finding receivers (using e.g. directional antennas, pseudo Doppler or the interferometer principle), the Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDOA) method is widely used. In TDOA three or more (non-directional) receivers at different locations capture the unknown transmitted signal. Then it evaluates the differences in arrival time of the signals to calculate the transmitter’s position (multilateration).</p>
<p>This article first provides a short introduction to localization with TDOA. Second, it presents a simple experimental localization system based on three receivers, each consisting of a RTL-SDR USB-Stick and a Raspberry PI. Although the receivers and the overall setup are very simple, localization of transmitters works remarkably well.</p>
<h2>Basics of Time-Difference-of-Arrival</h2>
<p>Assume a signal is emitted by an (unknown) transmitter and is received by several receivers at different locations. Usually the signal arrives at different times at the different receivers due to the varying distances between transmitter and receivers. This difference in arrival time is called “TDOA”. A TDOA value can be measured between a pair of receivers. It should be emphasized, that we work on the time <em>difference</em> of arrival, since any absolute arrival times in relation to transmission times are in general not available (as opposed to other localization techniques like time-of-arrival, TOA).</p>
<p>To understand the idea of TDOA localization, consider a simple example based on only two receivers and an unknown transmitter as depicted in the figure below. First, assume that the signal arrives at both receivers at the same point in time, i.e. TDOA = 0s. Then it is obvious, that the distance from the transmitter to receiver 1 is the same as to receiver 2. The transmitter must be located somewhere on a straight line in the middle between the two receivers. This is not yet a unique position, but narrows the possible positions to a line.</p>
<div id="attachment_745"><p><a href="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_basic_principle.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-745" loading="lazy" src="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_basic_principle.jpg" alt="" width="671" height="387" srcset="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_basic_principle.jpg 671w, http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_basic_principle-300x173.jpg 300w, http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_basic_principle-500x288.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 671px) 100vw, 671px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-745">TDOA system with 2 receivers in three cases: TDOA &gt; 0s, TDOA = 0s and TDOA &lt;0s. The possible TX positions form a hyperbola.</p></div>
<p>Now assume a second case, where the signal arrives earlier at receiver 1 and later at receiver 2. The TDOA value now becomes non-zero. This means, that the distance from transmitter to receiver 1 is smaller as to receiver 2 (Note, that a TDOA value can be converted to a distance by multiplication with propagation speed). In this case, the possible locations lie on a hyperbola with one of the receivers in its focal point.</p>
<p>To complete localization, more than two receivers are required – at least three for two dimensional localization in a plane. The above described method to create hyperbolas is applied pairwise to each receiver, such that for three receivers three hyperbolas can be generated (four receivers would yield ten hyperbolas). Ideally, all hyperbolas intersect at a single location on the map, that is the transmitter’s position.</p>
<div id="attachment_744"><p><a href="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_3_hyperbola_principle.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-744" loading="lazy" src="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_3_hyperbola_principle.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="331" srcset="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_3_hyperbola_principle.jpg 527w, http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_3_hyperbola_principle-300x199.jpg 300w, http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_3_hyperbola_principle-453x300.jpg 453w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-744">Exact TDOA localization with 3 receivers and thus 3 hyperbolas with mulitlateration</p></div>
<p>The achievable resolution and accuracy on a map does not only correspond to the resolution of the TDOA measurement. It is also largely dependent of the transmitter’s location relative to the receivers. The resolution figure below shows, that the accuracy is very good in the area roughly between the receivers and poor elsewhere. In general, TDOA systems perform well in the area that is surrounded by the receivers.</p>

Resolution is heavily dependent on the transmitter’s position relative to the receivers</p></div>
<p>Although the basic idea of TDOA localization is not too complicated, some further issues need to be addressed: First, it is required to synchronize the receivers with each other in time. Second, a means of precisely determining the time differences of arrivals must be used. Third, all receivers must be placed apart, though connected and able to exchange considerable amounts of raw sampled data. These challenges need to be solved to build a practical system and will be treated in the following.</p>
<h2>A Simple Localization System using RTL-SDRs</h2>
<p>A complete TDOA system consists of three synchronized receivers, that are connected to a central signal processing unit. In the following, a simple and cheap system for localizing signals in a city will be described.</p>
<p><strong><em>Receivers</em></strong></p>
<p>The installed receivers are minimalistic and consist each of a RTL-SDR USB-stick (~20 $) and a Raspberry PI (~40 $). The receivers use the simple whip antenna delivered with the RTL-SDR dongle. For practical reasons the antennas had to be placed indoor, which is suboptimal and leaves room for improvement. The RTL-SDR is capable of receiving 2 MHz of instantaneous bandwidth in a range from below 100 MHz to more than 1 GHz. This makes it a cheap and versatile general purpose SDR, capable of receiving various different types of signals.</p>
<p>For the experiments three receivers were deployed around in the city of Kaiserslautern, Germany. The figure below shows the receiver’s positions. For ideal placement and good accuracy the receivers should have been placed outside the city. However, in the surrounding, mostly forestal, areas no suitable internet connection could be established. Despite the suboptimal placement, good accuracy is expected in the area roughly between the receivers.</p>

<p>All receivers are connected to a master PC for signal processing via internet. The master triggers measurements at each receiver (simultaneously). Then the receivers send the received sampled data back to master for further signal processing and delay analysis. The amount of sampled data can quickly become very large, since the RTL-SDR outputs 8 bit IQ-data with 2 MHz. This creates a data rate of 2 x 8 bit x 2 MHz = 32 Mbit/s per receiver. With an available DSL upload of 1 Mbit/s, transferring only 1 s of sampled data already takes approximately half a minute. Reducing the sample rate of the RTL-SDR or employing compression may relax data rates.</p>
<p>It is important, that the three receivers are tuned to exactly the same frequency. For that purpose the RTL-SDR’s frequencies are calibrated with special frequency correction busts, emitted by GSM base stations. Calibration with GSM signals is easy using the <a href="https://github.com/steve-m/kalibrate-rtl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kalibrate-rtl</a> software.</p>
<p><em><strong>Synchronization</strong></em></p>
<p>As mentioned above, a prerequisite for TDOA localization is the synchronization of the receivers. One possibility is to use a GPS receiver, that disciplines the Raspberry PI’s internal clock. However, the system utilizes a different method using a transmitter with known location as a reference, that is received well by all three receivers. There is a DAB+ transmitter (217 MHz, 2 kW) in the city of Kaiserslautern, that covers a large area and is perfect for synchronization.</p>
<p>Synchronization with a reference receiver works as follows: When the master triggers a measurement, each receiver first receives some samples of the reference receiver and then seamlessly switches to the unknown transmitter’s signal of interest. For synchronization, the master aligns the three receptions from the different receivers to each other on the time axis. Alignment is done in such a way, that the delay in the reference signal portion corresponds to the known distances of the reference transmitter to the receivers. Once the complete received signal is synchronized (or aligned) the TDOA of the unknown signals is simply calculated as the delay. Precisely spoken, this technique does not synchronize the receivers themselves, but rather the received signals.</p>
<div id="attachment_742"><p><a href="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_with_reference_signal.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-742" loading="lazy" src="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_with_reference_signal.png" alt="" width="550" height="232" srcset="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_with_reference_signal.png 670w, http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_with_reference_signal-300x127.png 300w, http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_with_reference_signal-500x211.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-742">RTL-SDR signal for TDOA, first recording a reference transmitter (DAB+), then switching to the unkown transmitter’s signal.</p></div>
<p>The critical point for the synchronization is the requirement to switch between the frequencies <em>seamlessly</em>, such that not a single sample gets lost (otherwise, this will impair synchronization). Modifying the C library <a href="https://github.com/steve-m/librtlsdr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">librtlsdr</a> (commonly used for controlling the RTL-SDR) to perform seamless frequency switching using the “rtl_sdr” command made it crash during execution. The solution is to use a modified branch of the librtlsdr, called “<a href="https://github.com/mutability/librtlsdr/tree/async-rearrangements">async-rearrangements</a>” as a basis. Modifying this library for seamless frequency switching worked perfectly fine and showed that the RTL-SDR can do so.</p>
<p>The modified lib <a href="https://github.com/DC9ST/librtlsdr-2freq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">librtlsdr-2freq</a> for switching between two frequencies is available as open source software.</p>
<p><strong><em>Signal Processing</em></strong></p>
<p>Measuring the delay between two inputs precisely is the most important operation for TDOA. For that purpose the correlation function is suitable. It is defined as</p>
<p><span data-display="true"> Corr(\tau) = \sum_{t=0}^{N-1}s_1(t)s_2(t+\tau)</span></p><p>(s1, s2 are the real signals received by RX1 and 2) and outputs for every hypothetical delay <span data-display="false"> \tau</span> between the two signals a value indicating how good the two signals match. The delay value of <span data-display="false"> \tau</span>, at which the correlation function has a peak is the delay between the signals (see also my <a href="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/correlation-for-time-delay-analysis/">detailed description of correlation</a> and <a href="http://www.dspguide.com/ch7/3.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steven W.

<p>I still remember the first time I got an email from somebody asking me to link to their website.</p>
<p>They addressed me by name, described one of my blog posts in detail, and asked if I could include their link. It seemed so strange. Why on earth would somebody take the time to write me a personal email, just for a silly link—from a random blog that nobody was reading!</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve learned that these emails are common. Indeed, there are entire businesses built around finding ways to send these kinds of emails effectively and at scale. I didn’t know it, but a link is a powerful thing</p>
<p>There’s a lot of reasons for this. Your website won’t appear on search engines unless somebody links to it. Multiple links can improve your search engine ranking. Links can be a steady source of new visitors and they serve as an endorsement of your site. A single link can have a huge impact.</p>
<p>A link, on the open internet, is a vote. It’s your way of saying, “<em>this is great, and more people should know about it.</em>” We talk about how much power the search engines have, but if you think about it, the search engines listen to us. They see what we link to, what we click, and how long we stay.* At the end of the day, <em>we</em> are the curators of what gets surfaced on the internet.</p>
<p>This is one reason why it’s been so disappointing to see so many people leave their independent blogs in favor of social media platforms (like Medium) for creating content. When people post on these platforms, they lose their voice because the links aren’t the same! They’re often altered with <code>rel="nofollow"</code> attributes, which prevents search engines from crawling the links or counting them toward search rankings. There are reasons for this, but the result is that the links you post lose their power.</p>
<p>I continue to occasionally get emails from marketers asking me to link to their stuff. And while it’s annoying to receive spam, it’s also a reminder of the power I wield, just by having an independent website where I can link to whatever I want.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>
<small>* Of course there are downsides, including the legitimate privacy concerns around search engines watching us too closely. 👀</small>

<p>Responding to something I wrote long ago and can no longer find (this happens more and more), a reader asked me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does your head really tingle when you are learning something you find interesting?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It actually does. It really can get intense. Sadly, this pleasant phenomenon is getting rare as I age, although I do still get it from time to time. It's usually associated with learning that broadens in my horizons in some non-trivial way, a meaningful or especially interesting insight, that "light bulb going on" feeling. Sometimes it's just sheer density of information, if I'm actually getting it. I never get that feeling when I feel stumped or overloaded; only when I think I'm successfully taking it in.</p>
<p>I remember a really strong example of this phenomenon from university. My head got so buzzy it was like being high. It felt really, really good. Probably not a coincidence that the lady professor was super cute. It was the <i>learning</i> high, definitely, just … crush-enhanced. ☺</p>
<p>Does <em>your</em> head tingle when you learn?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>, or Wasm, is an open standard that allows developers to build apps that run inside a web browser using compiled programming languages. With WebAssembly, it’s possible to write components of web apps in languages such as C/C++, Rust, C#, and Go, among others, which run within the same sandbox as JavaScript. This allows things like porting existing libraries, leveraging capabilities not available in JavaScript, and running code faster because WebAssembly is compiled into a binary format.</p><p>Recently, I’ve been experimenting with WebAssembly to be able to run some Go code in the browser. Specifically, I’ve been trying to port certain parts of <a href="https://github.com/italypaleale/prvt">prvt</a>, an open source project for storing end-to-end encrypted documents, to run within a web browser directly. The reason for the WebAssembly experiment was two-fold: first, prvt makes extensive uses of cryptography and streams, both things which are not yet great in JavaScript; second, prvt itself is written in Go, so being able to re-use code in the browser would significantly simplify development.</p><blockquote><p>For an <strong>introduction to using WebAssembly with Go</strong>, I recommend <a href="https://golangbot.com/webassembly-using-go/">this article on Golang Bot</a>.<br>Additionally, more information can be found in the Go project’s <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WebAssembly">GitHub wiki</a> and in the documentation for the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/syscall/js/">syscall/js</a> package.<br>Note that as of writing, <strong>WebAssembly support in Go is still experimental</strong>. Because of that, the APIs might change too. This article was tested against Go 1.15.</p></blockquote><p>This article contains four different yet connected things that I’ve learnt while working on the WebAssembly port, and which I thought useful to share.</p><ol><li>Working with and creating JavaScript objects from Go code</li><li>Creating Promises in Go for passing async results</li><li>Making HTTP requests from Go code</li><li>Streaming from Go code</li></ol><h2 id="javascript-objects-in-webassembly-and-go">JavaScript objects in WebAssembly and Go</h2><p>The WebAssembly runtime for Go automatically converts the most common Go types to their JavaScript equivalent. The documentation for the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/syscall/js/#ValueOf">js.ValueOf</a> method contains a nice summary table of how Go and JavaScript types are matched:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="text">| Go                     | JavaScript             |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| js.Value               | [its value]            |
| js.Func                | function               |
| nil                    | null                   |
| bool                   | boolean                |
| integers and floats    | number                 |
| string                 | string                 |
| []interface{}          | new array              |
| map[string]interface{} | new object             |
</code></pre></div><p>From here, you can see that the most common types, such as numbers, booleans, and strings, are converted automatically. The last row is particularly interesting as it explains how to pass “Plain Old JavaScript Objects” (POJO’s), which are the simplest kinds of objects (also called dictionaries).</p><p>For example, the following Go code defines a function called <code>MyGoFunc</code> that can be called from JavaScript code, which returns a dictionary with a string and a number (as you can see, types can be heterogeneous).</p><blockquote><p>For instructions of how to compile Go code into WebAssembly, check out the <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WebAssembly#getting-started">Getting Started section</a> of the Wiki.</p></blockquote><p>After having compiled the code into WebAssembly and having imported it in the JavaScript code, you can call <code>MyGoFunc()</code> from JavaScript to see the result. For example:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>MyGoFunc</span><span>())</span>
<span>// Prints: {hello: "world", answer: 42}
</span></code></pre></div><p>However, what the documentation is less explicit about is that we can also <strong>use any JavaScript object</strong> inside the Go code, <strong>even built-ins</strong>! And this is where things can start getting more interesting.</p><p>For example, let’s try to pass a date as a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date"><code>Date</code></a> object. To do that, we first need to grab the <code>Date</code> constructor, loading its <code>js.Value</code> from the global scope of JS:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>dateConstructor</span> <span>:=</span> <span>js</span><span>.</span><span>Global</span><span>().</span><span>Get</span><span>(</span><span>"Date"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Then, we can create a new object off this constructor with the <code>dateConstructor.New</code> method, passing any argument to it as you’d pass to the <code>new Date()</code> constructor in JavaScript. The result of the invocation is a <code>js.Value</code> that can be returned to JavaScript:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>dateConstructor</span><span>.</span><span>New</span><span>(</span><span>"2020-10-01"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So, we can modify our <code>MyGoFunc</code> to return the current date as computed in Go:</p><p>Invoking <code>MyGoFunc()</code> in the JavaScript code will now return a <code>Date</code> object:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>let</span> <span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>MyGoFunc</span><span>()</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>typeof</span> <span>d</span><span>)</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>d</span> <span>instanceof</span> <span>Date</span><span>)</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span><span>())</span>

If you need a refresher on Promises, <a href="https://javascript.info/promise-basics">this is a good article</a>.</p><p>For example, consider this code, which creates a Promise that resolves with a message (<a href="https://www.mamalisa.com/?t=es&amp;p=5534">an Italian tongue-twister</a>) after 3 seconds:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>const</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span><span>((</span><span>resolve</span><span>,</span> <span>reject</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>},</span> <span>3000</span><span>)</span>
<span>})</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In an <code>async</code> function, you can then <code>await</code> on the Promise above, so after 3 seconds you receive the message:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>// This is an async function, which can contain "await" statements inside

</code></pre></div><p>Invoking <code>MyFunc()</code> will show <code>sopra la panca la capra campa, sotto la panca la capra crepa</code> in the console.</p><p>When working with Wasm in Go, Promises are particularly important.</p><p>In fact, as per the documentation, you cannot make blocking calls in Go inside a function that is invoked by JavaScript directly—if you do that, you’ll get an immediate deadlock and your app will crash. Instead, the documentation recommends that all blocking calls be inside a goroutine, which raises the problem of then returning the value to the JavaScript code. Quoting from the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/syscall/js/#FuncOf">docs</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Invoking the wrapped Go function from JavaScript will pause the event loop and spawn a new goroutine. Other wrapped functions which are triggered during a call from Go to JavaScript get executed on the same goroutine.<br>As a consequence, if one wrapped function blocks, JavaScript’s event loop is blocked until that function returns. Hence, calling any async JavaScript API, which requires the event loop, like fetch (http.Client), will cause an immediate deadlock. Therefore a blocking function should explicitly start a new goroutine.</p></blockquote><p>Using a Promise is perhaps the best way to solve this problem: avoiding deadlocks while allowing programming with idiomatic JavaScript.</p><p>We saw in the previous section that we can create custom JavaScript objects from Go, and this applies to Promises too! We just need to create the <code>Promise</code> object by passing a function to the constructor. Just like in the pure-JS code above, this function receives two arguments, which are functions themselves: <code>resolve</code> should be invoked with the final result when the Promise’s work is done, and <code>reject</code> can be called when there’s an error to make the Promise fail.</p><p>Here’s an updated <code>MyGoFunc</code> that resolves with a message (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/yoursay/tongue_twisters/italian/trotting_trentonians.shtml">another Italian tongue twister!</a>) after 3 seconds:</p><p>To invoke this from JavaScript:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>MyFunc</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

<p><span lang="FR">Radix Sort Revisited<o:p></o:p></span></p>





<p><span lang="EN-GB">Pierre <span>Terdiman</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Last revision: 04.01.2000<o:p></o:p></span></p>





<p><span lang="FR">In every decent
programmer’s toolbox lies a strange weapon called a Radix Sort. Where does it
come from&nbsp;? Who invented it&nbsp;? I don’t know. As far as I can remember
it was there, fast, easy, effective. <i>Really</i> effective. So unbelievably
useful I’ve never really understood why people would want to use something
else. The reasons&nbsp;? Most of the time, they tell me about floats, negative
values, and why their new quick-sort code rocks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Enough, I’m tired.
Although the standard Radix Sort doesn’t work very well with floating point
values, this is something actually very easy to fix. In this little article I
will review the standard Radix Sort algorithm, and enhance it so that&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><span lang="FR"><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="FR">it sorts
negative floats as well<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><span lang="FR"><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="FR">it has
reduced complexity for bytes and words<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><span lang="FR"><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="FR">it uses
temporal coherence<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><span lang="FR"><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="FR">it
supports sorting on multiple keys<o:p></o:p></span></p>











<p><span lang="FR">Is it worth writing
anything in 2000 about a sort routine&nbsp;? Doesn’t everyone already have
one&nbsp;? Aren’t those things already well known&nbsp;? Everyone knows how to
sort negative floats with a Radix, don’t you think&nbsp;?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Well, that’s what I
would’ve said some weeks ago. But I recently wandered on Ming C. Lin’s homepage
[2], and began to read her courses. Here’s what I found&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">«&nbsp;Counting sort
and radix sort are good for integers. For floating point numbers, try bucket
sort or other comparison-based methods&nbsp;» (21 sept. 1999) [3]<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">As you see this is
not very old…I read more of the courses, read some older papers about collision
detection, and it appeared my own way of dealing with a specific part of this
problem was (at least from a theoretical point of view) faster than the
official one. Hence, I think this article will be useful for beginners as well
as for experienced programmers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>











<p><span lang="FR">A Radix Sort is an
apparently bizarre sort routine which manages to sort values without actually
performing any comparisons on input data. That’s why this sort routine breaks
the theoretical lower bound of the O(N*logN) complexity, which only applies for
comparison-based sorts. Radix is O(k*N), with k = 4 most of the time, and
although this is not an in-place sort (i.e. it uses extra storage) it is so
much faster than any other sorting methods it has become a very popular way of sorting
data.<o:p></o:p></span></p>





<p><span lang="FR">The algorithm<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">What is a <i>radix</i>, anyway&nbsp;?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Roughly we can say a radix is a position in a number. In the decimal
system, a radix is just a digit in a decimal number. For example the number
«&nbsp;42&nbsp;» has two digits, or two radices, which are 4 and 2. In
hexadecimal the radix is 8 bits wide. For example the hexadecimal number 0xAB
has two radices, A and B. The Radix Sort gets its name from those radices,
because the method first sorts the input values according to their first radix,
then according to the second one, and so on. The Radix Sort is then a multipass
sort, and the number of passes equals the number of radices in the input
values. For example you’ll need 4 passes to sort standard 32 bits integers,
since in hexadecimal the radix is a byte. By the way that’s why the Radix Sort
is often called <i>Byte Sort</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">How does it work&nbsp;? Say you want to sort some bytes, for
example&nbsp;those ones:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">54,
18, 2, 128, 3<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">The idea behind the Radix Sort is to read input values and immediately
store them at the right place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Have a look at that sample code&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>unsigned char InputValues[] = { 54, 18, 2, 128, 3 };<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>int SortedBuffer[256];<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>memset(SortedBuffer, -1, 256*sizeof(int));<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// Fill with –1<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<pre><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>for(int i=0&nbsp;;i&lt;5&nbsp;;i++){<o:p></o:p></span></pre>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>unsigned char c = InputValues[i];<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<pre><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>SortedBuffer[c] = c;<o:p></o:p></span></pre>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>}<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// Now you can read SortedBuffer and get
values back in sorted order<o:p></o:p></span></p>





<p><span lang="FR">You may think this example is stupid – it <i>is</i>&nbsp;! – but it
nicely introduces the ideas we’ll have to deal with. What do we need to change
in that code, in order for it to become useful&nbsp;? First we need to get rid
of the empty destination locations, so that the destination buffer (called
SortedBuffer in our example) has the same size as the input buffer (i.e. enough
for 5 values, no more). We also need a way to handle collisions – collisions in
the hash-table sense of the word, i.e. we must be able to deal with two equal
input values and know how to store both of them in the final buffer. Luckily
enough, both problems are solved by the same solution&nbsp;: an <i>offset table</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">The offset table is a 256-entries table telling us, for each possible
input byte, where we should store the result. It is usually built in two
passes, one to compute the distribution of bytes in the input flow (i.e.
histograms, or <i>counters</i>), another one to create the offset table
according to this distribution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">This sample code&nbsp;creates the counters:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>int
Counters[256];<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>memset(Counters, 0, 256*sizeof(int));<span>&nbsp; </span>//
Set all counters to 0<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>for(
i =0&nbsp;; i &lt; NbItems&nbsp;; i++){<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>//
Loop over the input array<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>unsigned char c = InputValues[i];<span> </span>//
Get current byte…<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Counters[c]++;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>//
…and update counter<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>}<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">We can now create the offset table&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<pre><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>int OffsetTable[256];<o:p></o:p></span></pre><pre><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>OffsetTable[0] = 0;<o:p></o:p></span></pre>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>for(i=1;i&lt;256;i++){<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>OffsetTable[i] = OffsetTable[i-1] +
Counters[i-1];<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>}<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Now, for each input byte, we can
get the right offset back thanks to this table, put the input byte at the right
place in the destination buffer, increase the offset, and repeat the sequence
for the next byte.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">For example&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>unsigned char c =
InputValues[i];<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>DestinationBuffer[OffsetTable[c]++] = c;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">The destination buffer won’t have
any empty locations&nbsp;: we have enough room in it for the same number of
values as in the input buffer, no more. Thanks to the offsets we know exactly
where we must store them, and whenever an empty location would have existed in
our first example, here it doesn’t appear because no offset actually maps that
empty location.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Collisions are not a problem
either because offsets are increased each time we use one of them. If we have
two identical bytes in input, the first one will be put in
DestinationBuffer[Offset], Offset will be increased, and the next one will then
fall in DestinationBuffer[Offset+1]. Radix sort is <i>stable</i> by the way,
which means two same values in input will be in the same order in output.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">This last point is very important
to understand the next step&nbsp;: how can we extend the process in order to
sort not only bytes but also words, dwords, or event character strings&nbsp;?
This is actually very simple&nbsp;: we just have to sort again according to the
next radix. Recall a radix actually is a byte in the values to sort. The first
radix is the LSB (Least Significant Byte). The last one must be the MSB (Most
Significant Byte). Between those two, we perform all necessary passes. The
second pass doesn’t destroy what has been done in the first one because the
sorting method is stable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Example&nbsp;: say we want to sort
those hexadecimal values&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">0xBC, 0xAB, 0xBA, 0xAC, 0xBB, 0xAA<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">The first pass leads to&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xBA<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xAA<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xAB<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xBB<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xBC<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xAC<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Note that the list is sorted
according to the last column (ie the LSB which is the first radix). The second
pass will sort this list according to the first column (ie the MSB, our second
radix) and since the sorting method is stable, the 3 numbers 0xAA, 0xAB and
0xAC which share the same MSB will be found in output in the same order as in
input. And since the input order has been determined by the first sorting pass,
eh, it’s already sorted according to the LSB, and here we are with the final
sorted list&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">0xAA<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xAB<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xAC<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xBA<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xBB<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xBC<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Radix selection is
performed by shifting and ANDing the input value according to the pass
number&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">unsigned
char Radix = (InputValues[i]&gt;&gt;(Pass&lt;&lt;3)) &amp; 0xFF;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">…where pass begins
to 0 and gets increased for each new pass.<o:p></o:p></span></p>







<p><b><span lang="FR">Sorting floating point values<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Ok, that was the
standard Radix Sort, as most of us knew it on old 16 bits computers. What
happened then, was the following&nbsp;: one day, we all switched to 80486 (or
Pentium) and suddenly we had floats. At first sight, a Radix Sort can’t deal
with floats&nbsp;: the inner structure of a float isn’t obvious, you don’t
really see how to shift them or AND a value with them (the algorithm involves
such an operation, as seen just above), you don’t even know how to do it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">The first step is to
learn how a floating-point value is actually built. This is well known
nowadays&nbsp;: the first bit is the sign bit, the next 8 bits are the biased
exponent, and the 23 last ones are the mantissa. The exponent is always
positive thanks to the bias. Chris Hecker once wrote a good introduction paper
to the numerous floating-points tricks you can afford on Intel processors [1].
Let’s quote him&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">«&nbsp;Because the
exponent are always positive (and are in more significant bits than the
mantissa), large numbers compare greater than small numbers even when the
floating-point values are compared as normal integer bits. The sign bit throws
a monkey wrench in this, but it works great for single-signed values.&nbsp;»<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">I couldn’t have said
that better. And from this point, it is easy to see why it works with positive
floats. Let’s define a function IR(x) as the integer representation of any
floating-point value x. For example the floating-point value 42.0 has a binary
representation of 0x42280000. In other words&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">IR(42.0)
= 0x42280000<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">The Radix Sort works
with positive floats because for any floating-point values x and y,<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">x
&gt; y &gt;0 =&gt; IR(x) &gt; IR(y)<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Hence x and y will
be treated by the sorting code as IR(x) and IR(y), and the final order will be
correct. This is easy to check&nbsp;: just cast your float pointer into integer
pointer and ask your code to sort your array of positive floats&nbsp;! It
works. Well, it doesn’t work on DEC Alpha because the float format is
different, but that’s another story&nbsp;: it works provided you use IEEE
floats, which means it works on PC, on Dreamcast, and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

They might have multiple phone numbers (hence <code>repeated PhoneNumber</code>), e.g. for their home, their mobile and work.</p><div><p><span>example.proto</span></p><div><pre><p><span>message </span><span>Person</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  required string name </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  required int32 id </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  optional string email </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>enum</span><span> </span><span>PhoneType</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>MOBILE</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>HOME</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>WORK</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  message </span><span>PhoneNumber</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    required string number </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    optional </span><span>PhoneType</span><span> type </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>HOME</span><span>]</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  repeated </span><span>PhoneNumber</span><span> phones </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>4</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Note here within the schema for a <code>Person</code> message, we also <strong>number</strong> the fields (<code>=1</code>, <code>=2</code>, <code>=3</code>, <code>=4</code>). This allows us to add fields later without altering the existing ordering of fields (so you can continue to parse these fields without having to know about new fields).</p><p>Every time we want to add a new “type” of field, we define a schema (just like how you might define a class to add a new type of object). We can even define a schema within another schema, e.g. within the schema for a <code>Person</code>, we defined the schema for the <code>PhoneNumber</code> field.</p><p>We can also define the schema for an <strong>enum</strong> type <code>PhoneType</code>. This enum acted as a “tag” for our phone number.</p><p>Now, just as you might want a field to be one of many options (specified by the enum type), you might want the message to contain exactly one of many fields.</p><p>For example in our compiler we might want to encode an identifier as <em>one of two options</em>. Here we don’t want to store data in an index field if we’ve tagged it as a <code>Variable</code>.</p><div><p><span><a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt/blob/master/src/frontend/ir_gen/frontend_ir.mli"> <!-- -->frontend_ir.mli</a></span></p><div><pre><p><span>type</span><span> identifier </span><span>=</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>Variable</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> string</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>ObjField</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> string </span><span>*</span><span> index </span></p></pre></div></div><p>In our protobuf, we can add fields for each of these options, and use the keyword <code>oneof</code> to specify that only one of the fields in that group will be set at once.</p><p>Now, whilst this tells Protobuf that one of those values is set, we have no way of telling which one of them is set.

We:</p><ul><li>Add a tag field to specify the constructor the value has.</li><li>Define a message schema if a constructor has multiple arguments e.g for <code>ObjField</code>. If the constructor has only one argument (<code>Variable</code>) we don’t need to.</li><li>Specify a <code>oneof</code> block containing the fields for each of the constructors.</li></ul><p>We could manually write out all of the schema, but we’d have to rewrite these every time our language changed.
However we have a hidden weapon up our sleeve - a library that will do this for us!</p><h3 id="ppx-deriving-protobuf"><a href="#ppx-deriving-protobuf" aria-label="ppx deriving protobuf permalink"></a>PPX Deriving Protobuf</h3><p>OCaml allows libraries to extend its syntax using a <strong>ppx</strong> hook. The ppx libraries can preprocess the files using these hooks to extend the language functionality. So we can tag our files with other information, such as which types need to have a protobuf schema generated.</p><p>We can update our Dune build file to preprocess our <code>ir_gen</code> library with the ppx-deriving protobuf library:</p><div><p><span><a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt/blob/master/src/frontend/ir_gen/dune"> <!-- -->dune</a></span></p><div><pre><p><span>(</span><span>library</span></p><p><span> </span><span>(</span><span>name ir</span><span>_</span><span>gen</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span> </span><span>(</span><span>public</span><span>_</span><span>name ir</span><span>_</span><span>gen</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span> </span><span>(</span><span>libraries core fmt desugaring ast</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span> </span><span>(</span><span>flags</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>(</span><span>:</span><span>standard </span><span>-</span><span>w </span><span>-</span><span>39</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span> </span><span>(</span><span>preprocess</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>(</span><span>pps ppx</span><span>_</span><span>deriving</span><span>_</span><span>protobuf bisect</span><span>_</span><span>ppx </span><span>--</span><span>conditional</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Note the flags command suppresses warning 39 - “unused <code>rec</code> flag” - since the code the ppx_deriving_protobuf library generates raises a lot of those warnings. I would highly recommend that you also suppress these warnings!</p><p>An aside, <code>bisect_ppx</code> is the tool we use to calculate test coverage. It has a <code>--conditional</code> flag since we don’t want to preprocess the file with coverage info if we’re not computing the test coverage.</p><p>Telling PPX deriving protobuf that we want to serialise a type definition is easy - we just stick a <code>[@@deriving protobuf]</code> at the end of our type definition. For variant types, we have to specify a <code>[@key 1]</code>, <code>[@key 2]</code> for each of the variants.</p><p>For example, for our <code>identifier</code> type definition in our <code>.mli</code> file:</p><div><p><span><a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt/blob/master/src/frontend/ir_gen/frontend_ir.mli"> <!-- -->frontend_ir.mli</a></span></p><div><pre><p><span>type</span><span> identifier </span><span>=</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>Variable</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> string </span><span>[</span><span>@</span><span>key </span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>ObjField</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> string </span><span>*</span><span> int </span><span>[</span><span>@</span><span>key </span><span>2</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>[</span><span>@@</span><span>deriving protobuf</span><span>]</span></p></pre></div></div><p>We do the same thing in the <code>.ml</code> file, except we also specify the file to which we want to write the protobuf schema.</p><div><p><span><a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt/blob/master/src/frontend/ir_gen/frontend_ir.ml"> <!-- -->frontend_ir.ml</a></span></p><div><pre><p><span>type</span><span> identifier </span><span>=</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>Variable</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> string </span><span>[</span><span>@</span><span>key </span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>ObjField</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> string </span><span>*</span><span> int </span><span>[</span><span>@</span><span>key </span><span>2</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>[</span><span>@@</span><span>deriving protobuf </span><span>{</span><span>protoc</span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"../../frontend_ir.proto"</span><span>}</span><span>]</span></p></pre></div></div><p>This path is relative to the src file <code>frontend_ir.ml</code>. So since this <code>frontend_ir.ml</code> file is in the <code>src/frontend/ir_gen/</code> folder of the repo, the protobuf schema file will be written to <code>src/frontend_ir.proto</code>. If you don’t specify a file path to the <code>protoc</code> argument, then the <code>.proto</code> file will be written to the <code>_build</code> folder.</p><p>One extra tip, the ppx deriving protobuf library won’t serialise lists of lists. For example you can’t have:</p><div><div><pre><p><span>type</span><span> something </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Foo</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> foo list list </span><span>[</span><span>@</span><span>key </span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>@@</span><span>deriving protobuf</span><span>]</span><span>)</span></p></pre></div></div><p>This is because if we have a message schema for <code>foo</code>, then to get a field of type <code>foo list</code> is straightforward - we use <code>repeated foo</code> in our field schema. But we can’t say <code>repeated repeated foo</code> to get a list of a list of type foo. So to get around this, you’d have to define another type here:</p><div><div><pre><p><span>type</span><span> list</span><span>_</span><span>of</span><span>_</span><span>foo </span><span>=</span><span> foo list </span><span>[</span><span>@@</span><span>deriving protobuf</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>type</span><span> something </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Foo</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> list</span><span>_</span><span>of</span><span>_</span><span>foo list </span><span>[</span><span>@</span><span>key </span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>@@</span><span>deriving protobuf</span><span>]</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Finally, to serialise our Bolt IR using this schema, PPX deriving protobuf provides us with <code>&lt;type_name&gt;_to_protobuf</code> serialisation functions. We use this to get a binary protobuf message that we write to an output channel (<code>out_chan</code>) as a sequence of bytes.</p><div><p><span><a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt/blob/master/src/frontend/ir_gen/ir_gen_protobuf.ml"> <!-- -->ir_gen_protobuf.ml</a></span></p><div><pre><p><span>let</span><span> ir</span><span>_</span><span>gen</span><span>_</span><span>protobuf program out</span><span>_</span><span>chan </span><span>=</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> protobuf</span><span>_</span><span>message </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Protobuf</span><span>.</span><span>Encoder</span><span>.</span><span>encode</span><span>_</span><span>exn program</span><span>_</span><span>to</span><span>_</span><span>protobuf program </span><span>in</span><span></span></p><p><span>    output</span><span>_</span><span>bytes out</span><span>_</span><span>chan protobuf</span><span>_</span><span>message</span></p></pre></div></div><p>In our overall Bolt compiler pipeline, I write the output to a <code>.ir</code> file if provided, or to <code>stdout</code>:</p><div><p><span><a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt/blob/master/src/frontend/compile_program_ir.ml"> <!-- -->compile_program_ir.ml</a></span></p><div><pre><p><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span></span></p><p><span> </span><span>match</span><span> compile</span><span>_</span><span>out</span><span>_</span><span>file </span><span>with</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>Some</span><span> file</span><span>_</span><span>name </span><span>-&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>Out_channel</span><span>.</span><span>with</span><span>_</span><span>file file</span><span>_</span><span>name </span><span>~f</span><span>:</span><span>(</span><span>fun</span><span> file</span><span>_</span><span>oc </span><span>-&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>            ir</span><span>_</span><span>gen</span><span>_</span><span>protobuf program file</span><span>_</span><span>oc</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>None</span><span>           </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> ir</span><span>_</span><span>gen</span><span>_</span><span>protobuf program stdout </span><span>)</span></p></pre></div></div><h3 id="auto-generated-protobuf-schema"><a href="#auto-generated-protobuf-schema" aria-label="auto generated protobuf schema permalink"></a>Auto-generated Protobuf Schema</h3><p>The <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppx_deriving_protobuf">README</a> of the repository for the PPX Deriving Library has a thorough explanation of the mapping. We’ve already gone through an example of the autogenerated schema, so the schema shouldn’t be too unfamiliar. There was a slight modification I made though. For (<code>ObjField of string * int</code>) I said the generated output was:</p><div><div><pre><p><span>message _ObjField {</span></p><p><span>    required string objName = 1;</span></p><p><span>    required int64 fieldIndex = 2;</span></p><p><span>  }</span></p></pre></div></div><p>This is unfortunately not quite true. I put in the objName and fieldIndex for clarity, but the library doesn’t know what the semantic meaning of <code>string * int</code> is, so instead it looks like:</p><div><div><pre><p><span>message _ObjField {</span></p><p><span>    required string _0 = 1;</span></p><p><span>    required int64 _1 = 2;</span></p><p><span>  }</span></p></pre></div></div><p>That’s the downside of the autogenerated schema. You get the generic field names <code>_0</code>, <code>_1</code>, <code>_2</code> and so on instead of <code>objName</code> and <code>fieldIndex</code>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.scraperapi.com/?fp_ref=box-piper-app">Scraper API</a> provides a proxy service designed for web scraping. With over 20 million residential IPs across 12 countries, as well as software that can handle JavaScript rendering and solving CAPTCHAs, you can quickly complete large scraping jobs without ever having to worry about being blocked by any servers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scraperapi.com/?fp_ref=box-piper-app" target="_blank">
<img src="https://www.boxpiper.com/779cab4c054e767248e43be74fabf94c/scraperapi-1.gif">
</a></p><p>Implementation is extremely simple, and they offer unlimited bandwidth. Proxies are automatically rotated, but users can choose to maintain sessions if required. All you need to do is call the API with the URL that you want to scrape, and it will return the raw HTML. With Scraper API, you just focus on parsing the data, and they’ll handle the rest.</p>
<p>As per data, they have handled 5 billion API requests per month for over 1,500 businesses and developers around the world</p>
<figure>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
            Having built many web scrapers, we repeatedly went through the tiresome process of finding proxies, setting up headless browsers, and handling CAPTCHAs. That's why we decided to start Scraper API, it handles all of this for you so you can scrape any page with a simple API call!
        </p>
        
	</blockquote>
</figure>
<p>One of the most frustrating parts of automated web scraping is constantly dealing with IP blocks and CAPTCHAs. ScrapperAPI handles it beautifully.
You can customize request headers, request type, IP geo-location and more. They automatically prune slow proxies from our pools periodically, and guarantee unlimited bandwidth with speeds up to 100Mb/s, perfect for writing speedy web crawlers.</p>
<p>Features loaded:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 20 million residential IPs in the pool</li>
<li>Simple dashboard to manage usage and billing</li>
<li>Geo-targeting: target 12+ countries around the world</li>
<li>Free plan with 1000 requests &amp; all features</li>
<li>Seven-day, no questions asked refund policy</li>
<li>24/7 support and great customer service</li>
<li>Rotating and sticky IP sessions</li>
<li>Easy setup</li>
<li>Able to render JavaScript pages</li>
<li>Custom browser headers</li>
<li>Premium proxy pools</li>
<li>Auto-extraction of data from popular sites</li>
</ul>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>When you sign up for Scraper API you are given an access key. All you need to do is call the API with your key and the URL that you want to scrape, and you will receive the raw HTML of the page as a result. It’s as simple as:</p>
<div data-language="sh"><pre><code>curl "http: ; //api.scraperapi.com?api_key=XYZ&amp;url=http://httpbin.org/ip"</code></pre></div>
<p>On the back end, when Scraper API receives your request, their service accesses the URL via one of their proxy servers, gets the data, and then sends it back to you.</p>
<h2>Basic Usage</h2>
<p>Scraper API exposes a single API endpoint, simply send a GET request to <a href="http://api.scraperapi.com/">http://api.scraperapi.com</a> with two query string parameters, api_key which contains your API key, and url which contains the url you would like to scrape.</p>

		<p>
            In social psychology, the pratfall effect is the tendency for interpersonal appeal to increase or decrease after an individual makes a mistake, depending on the individual's perceived ability to perform well in a general sense. An individual perceived to be highly competent would be considered more likable after committing a blunder, while a perceived average individual would be considered less likable.

<p>When a person makes a mistake or acts in a clumsy way that might even make people laugh, they are found to be more likeable, including in comparison with people who are more intelligent and clever.</p>
<p>When you make a mistake, you appear more human, more like others and so more likeable. People who are perfect can seem threatening, but people who are imperfect are safe and hence easier to truly like.</p>

<p>We can observe the truth of the Pratfall Effect with the famous film actress Jennifer Lawrence. Widely touted for her talent and beauty, she is also known for her gaffes, such as falling down at red carpet events and speaking brashly in interviews. Yet Lawrence is commonly considered a “down-to-earth” celebrity and regularly celebrated for her likeability.</p>

<h2>Revelation</h2>
<p>The Pratfall Effect experiment revealed three major social truths:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It’s OK to be fallible.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a person is generally considered smart and capable, committing a small mistake will generally make them more socially attractive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If individuals are considered average or mediocre, they are more likely to be negatively impacted by their mistake.</li>
<li>
<p>The ultimate effects of pratfalls are contextual.</p>
<ul>
<li>Subsequent studies have discovered that pratfalls are perceived differently based on other factors, including gender.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ending Note</h2>
<p>If you want to be liked, make mistakes sometimes (or just admit to error), though do be careful to make it in an area which is unimportant and which will not make people think you are incapable in areas where they need your ability.</p>

<p>I was talking to my friend Josh a couple weeks ago about the speed at which teams move and how best managers can create a sense of urgency. We pretty quickly agreed that there are two types of urgency for a team: push-based and pull-based.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Is your urgency push-based or pull-based?</p><p>It's a thought-provoking management question.</p><p>Ex: Arbitrary deadline=push, Excitement=pull</p><p>Does this division make sense? What other kinds of urgency are there?</p></div>— Joshua Levy (@ojoshe) <a href="https://twitter.com/ojoshe/status/1309279621448310786?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>I felt like this is an important delineation, and wanted to summarize our conversation a little, just by giving some examples.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Team:</strong><ul><li><strong>Push-based: </strong>You hire people who will what is asked of them, and nothing more.</li><li><strong>Pull-based: </strong>You hire people who are conscientious and self-motivated, and if they aren’t being pushed, they will push themselves and everyone around them.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Goals:</strong><ul><li><strong>Push-based: </strong>The team has “soul-less” goals like “get X done by Y” or “increase metric Y by Z”.</li><li><strong>Pull-based: </strong>The team clearly understands the value of what they are building and are excited about making it real.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Road-blocks:</strong><ul><li><strong>Push-based:</strong> Team members constantly lose momentum because they run into obstacles that are beyond their control.</li><li><strong>Pull-based: </strong>The “path is paved”, so-to-speak. Team members might face obstacles, but they are either empowered to clear those obstacles or have access to executives that can clear the obstacles for them.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Deadlines:</strong><ul><li><strong>Push-based:</strong> Arbitrary deadlines like “our exec wants this done by Friday”.</li><li><strong>Pull-based:</strong> Self-imposed deadlines like “this should take 2 weeks, and we will hold ourselves accountable to that”.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>We actually discussed deadlines a little bit, and as Josh always does he broke out a few dimensions:</p>



<ul><li>Deadlines can be artificial or real. An artificial deadline is one in which there will be no repercussions if the deadline is missed, and a real one has repercussions.</li><li>Deadlines can be superimposed or self-imposed. A team can decide a deadline for itself, or someone (typically more senior) can decide a deadline for them.</li><li>Deadlines can be evident or arbitrary. An evident deadline might be “if we don’t build our product by November, we’ll miss out on the holiday season orders.”</li></ul>



<p>So a deadline that is real, superimposed, and arbitrary, could be something like “If you don’t accomplish this by end-of-month, you will be fired.”</p>



<p>Someone once told me that managers push and leaders pull. Plenty of people, companies, and teams have gotten results with very “push-based” urgencies, but if you ask someone which type of urgency they prefer on their team, they’ll likely say “pull-based”. Which is an interesting point to ponder.</p>

<p>Omnipedia went live on September 28th 2049, with Hsiung and Xu taking part in a press conference to celebrate its public launch. They described Omnipedia's mission statement as "offering an easily accessible primary source of balanced, responsible, and accurate information about anything and everything." Although it was initially hinted that some of Wikipedia's content would be carried over to Omnipedia for its initial launch, Hsiung stated that this turned out to be infeasible due to the copyright issues that had led to Wikipedia ceasing operations on April 13th 2048. As a result, Omnipedia will feature fully original content.<sup id="backreference-2"><a href="#reference-2">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>Following Omnipedia's announcement on June 18th 2049, some criticism was levelled at its purported status as a successor to Wikipedia.

                    <p><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaa238">A study which has just been published in the leading neurology journal Brain</a>,  indicates that Parkinson's disease is not one but two diseases, starting either in the brain or in the intestines.</p>

<p>These two groups of patients displayed strikingly different profiles on multimodal imaging battery.</p>

<p>These profiles support the existence of a brain-first and body-first subtype of Parkinson’s disease, and furthermore, that premotor rapid eye movement sleep (REM) sleep behaviour disorder is a highly predictive marker of the body-first subtype.
<img src="https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800/2019/wheredoespar.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Neuropathological autopsy studies of patients with Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or incidental Lewy body disease have shown discrepant results.</p>

<p>Heiko Braak’s staging system was derived from a cohort of patients, who were selected based on the presence of Lewy pathology in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and all these patients conformed to a brainstem predominant type.</p>

<p>Other studies reported that some post-mortem cases do not harbour Lewy pathology in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and a minority of patients do not follow the Braak staging scheme.</p>

<p>A pathological hallmark of Parkinson’s disease is the presence of intraneuronal a-synuclein inclusions termed Lewy pathology. However, it remains unknown from where the initial a-synuclein aggregates originate.</p>

<p>It has been hypothesized that a-synuclein inclusions initially form in nerve terminals of the enteric nervous system, and then subsequently spread via autonomic connections to the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and intermediolateral cell columns of the sympathetic system (Braak et al., 2003).</p>

<p>In addition, Lewy pathology has been detected in gastrointestinal nerve fibres years prior to Parkinson’s disease diagnosis.
There is also epidemiological evidence that complete but not partial vagotomy may protect against later Parkinson’s disease.</p>

<p>Autopsy studies have shown that a minority of cases with Lewy pathology do not have pathological inclusions in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and that a fraction of cases display a limbic-predominant distribution of a-synuclein inclusions with less pathology in the brainstem.</p>

<p>The scientists hypothesized that the appearance of isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder well before parkinsonism is a strong marker of the body-first subtype. The presence of REM sleep behaviour disorder in the premotor phase is a marker of the body-first type, probably a reflection of ascending a-synuclein pathology reaching the pons before the substantia nigra.

<p>To test this hypothesis, they recruited de novo patients with Parkinson’s disease and performed video-polysomnography to divide patients into de novo Parkinson’s disease without REM sleep behaviour disorder and de novo Parkinson’s disease with pre-motor REM sleep behaviour disorder. The study was conducted between August 2018 and January 2020.</p>

<p>The scientists have shown that prodromal and de novo patients with Parkinson’s disease can be categorized by means of multimodal imaging into distinct clusters, which are compatible with a brain-first and body-first Parkinson’s disease subtype.</p>

<p>Their conclusion is that the Parkinson’s disease comprises two subtypes: 
(i) a body-first (bottom-up) subtype, where the pathology originates in the enteric or peripheral autonomic nervous system, and then ascends via the vagus nerve and sympathetic connectome to the CNS;</p>

<p>(ii) a brain-first (top-down) subtype, in which the a-synuclein pathology initially arises in the brain itself or sometimes enters via the ol- factory bulb, and subsequently descends to the peripheral autonomic nervous system.</p>

<p><strong>Body-first (bottom-up) subtype:</strong>
The initial a-synuclein pathology appears in the enteric or peripheral autonomic nervous system. It then propagates via the sympathetic connectome to the heart, and via the vagus nerve to the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus.

<p>Ascending pathology affects pontine structures giving rise to REM sleep behaviour disorder before the substantia nigra shows substantial involvement.
When parkinsonism appears, signifying a loss of 450% of nigrostriatal dopamine terminals, all lower Braak stage structures show marked damage on relevant imaging markers.</p>

<p><strong>Brain-first (top-down) subtype:</strong>
 In the brain-first type, the initial a-synuclein pathology appears in the CNS.
The most likely site of origin seems to be the amygdala or connected structures, or the pathology may in some cases enter via the olfactory bulb.
Rarely, the pathology arises in the upper brainstem (substantia nigra or locus coeruleus).
The pathology spreads from the site of origin to the brainstem and cortex.
When parkinsonism appears, the brainstem shows a rostro-caudal gradient of pathology with marked involvement of the substantia nigra, moderate involvement of the neighbouring pons, but little involvement of the medulla and autonomic nervous system.</p>

        <p>Git is a free and open source distributed Version Control System (VCS). Git can
be hard, especially for people discovering it for the first time, but there are
a lot of things that make this an exceptional VCS worth learning. This post is
not meant to be a git tutorial, but rather a compilation of things and tips I
find interesting. I also wanted to give a perspective of git independent of
services like GitHub. Hopefully you can find something useful and “<em>git better
at it</em>” 🙃.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to learn how to use git, take a look at the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/">Pro Git
book</a>, it’s free and it is a great resource!</p>

<h2 id="git-is-not-github-">Git is not GitHub 😮</h2>

<p>Services like <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> made git particularly popular, but
the convenience of something like Github has its downsides for new users: it
causes confusion about the differences between <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> or
<a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>, and the actual version control system, <em>git</em>.
While the former are great to host git repositories and make them publicly
available (among other things), git is a piece of software designed to allow for
distributed version control and collaboration. This means that you can use it
offline, without GitHub, you can collaborate with people via chat, email, and
anything that allows you to send text to someone else. Yes, GitHub makes it
convenient to host your project and make it discoverable; it provides an
incentive for collaboration, but, at the end of the day, GitHub is not git, just
as Gmail is not e-mail.</p>

<h2 id="git-is-distributed-">Git is distributed 🖧</h2>

<p>For those used to GitHub, collaborating with git over e-mail might seem
anachronistic, but, consider the scale of projects and what git was designed to
do. Being able to send contributions as plain text allied with the threaded
nature of e-mail, means that you can have multiple discussions around certain
aspects of a contribution, which is a big plus. Linux kernel development, for
example, doesn’t happen on GitHub or GitLab. From the linux kernel GitHub Pull
requests (GitHub’s system for submitting contributions):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks for your contribution to the Linux kernel!</p>

  <p>Linux kernel development happens on mailing lists, rather than on GitHub -
this GitHub repository is a read-only mirror that isn’t used for accepting
contributions. So that your change can become part of Linux, please email it
to us as a patch.</p>

  <p>Sending patches isn’t quite as simple as sending a pull request, but
fortunately it is a well documented process.</p>

  <p>Here’s what to do:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Format your contribution according to kernel requirements</li>
    <li>Decide who to send your contribution to</li>
    <li>Set up your system to send your contribution as an email</li>
    <li>Send your contribution and wait for feedback</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The development happens on various mailing lists for multiple subsystems. It’s
distributed development to an unprecedented scale. This scale has a price,
discipline in your contributions, something that GitHub doesn’t really help
reinforce –which seems to be the whole
<a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/17#issuecomment-5654674">issue</a> that the
creator of git Linus Torvalds has with it.</p>

<h3 id="git-daemon-">Git daemon 🌐</h3>

<p>Focusing the development on a centralised service like GitHub can feel like
you’re using an improved version of Subversion client/server approach, but
remember, git is truly a decentralized system and we can do better. Suppose you
don’t want to use GitHub, but want to make your repository available for other
people to clone, pull from, etc. Git supports Peer-to-Peer setup out of the box
with <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Git-Daemon"><code>git
daemon</code></a>.
Collaboration then happens on each peer local copy of the source tree and some
form of communication channel (e.g. e-mail, chat, etc).</p>

<p>From your git folder you can execute the following command</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git daemon <span>--export-all</span> <span>--base-path</span><span>=</span><span>.</span> <span>--reuseaddr</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>--enable=upload-pack</code>: (enabled by default) allows for <code>git fetch</code>, <code>git pull</code>, and <code>git clone</code>.</li>
  <li><code>--export-all</code>: means that you don’t have to create a file named git-daemon-export-ok in each exported repository.</li>
  <li><code>--base-path</code>: allows people to clone projects without specifying the entire
path. Example: if you start the daemon with <code>--base-path=/srv/git</code> and try to
pull from <code>git://example.com/hello.git</code>, git daemon will interpret the path as
<code>/srv/git/hello.git</code>.</li>
  <li><code>--reuseaddr</code>: allows the server to restart without waiting for old connections to time out.</li>
</ul>

<p>Congratulations, your machine is now running a git server and anyone can do:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone git://192.168.1.42/  <span>#Your IP</span>
<span># or</span>
git remote add Foo git://192.168.1.42/
git fetch Foo
git checkout develop
git push Foo develop
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="git-patches-">Git patches 📝</h3>

<p>As we have discussed, git is a decentralized system, you can send contributions
to anyone without the need of a centralized git repository. This is not only the
default way of collaborating with git, it is particularly useful when a server
is down, or if you don’t have permissions to write to a remote repository
—but would still like to propose changes.</p>

<p>You can create a patch from your current changes without committing the code on
your source tree:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># changes in the working tree not yet staged for commit</span>
git diff <span>&gt;</span> big-improvements.patch
<span># or changes between the index and your last commit;</span>
<span># what you would be committing if you run "git commit"</span>
<span># without "-a" option.</span>
git diff <span>--cached</span> <span>&gt;</span> big-improvements.patch
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As an example suppose the change is the addition of a README file, the diff
would look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>diff --git a/README b/README
</span><span>new file mode 100644
</span><span>index 0000000..e69de29
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>More often, what we would like to do is to propose a change we have made in your
local source tree. To do this, we can use the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-format-patch"><code>git
format-patch</code></a> command:</p>



<p>if we have commits ahead of the master branch, a diff file will be generated. We can also reference other commits in the same branch.
Suppose we made changes in the current branch and want to reference the changes in relation to the last commit. We can do:</p>



<p>the patch file will contain something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>From daf1010eb425a67ca6b0ba60f7cbec15bcff31f1 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: John Doe &lt;heresjohnny@bestmail.com&gt;
Date: Tue, 09 Sep 2020 15:42:00 +0100
Subject: [PATCH] Update README
</span>
---
 README | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

diff --git a/README b/README
<span>index e69de29..d0fc019 100644
</span><span>--- a/README

</span><span>@@ -0,0 +1 @@</span>
<span>+This is a README file, that is all.
</span><span>--
</span><span>2.28.0
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>to apply the patch we do:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># patch as unstaged changes in your branch</span>
git apply 0001-Update-README.patch

<span># patch as commits</span>
git am 0001-Update-README.patch
</code></pre></div></div>

<!-- 
### git request-pull ✉️

Git comes with its own [pull request
module](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-request-pull).

This feature has nothing to do with [GitHubs pull
request](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request).
It's mean to facilitate the creation of summary messages to be sent through
e-mail for example. If you want to use GitHubs pull request feature without the
web interface, check out the [hub](https://hub.github.com/) command line interface tool.
{: .notice--danger}

Imagine that you built your work on your master branch on top of the v1.0
release, and want it to be integrated to the project. First you push that change
to your public repository for others to see. If this is a remote repository you might do it like this:

```bash
git push https://bestgitserver.com/project master
```

Then we run the following command:

```bash
git request-pull v1.0 https://bestgitserver.com/project master
```

This will produce a request message with information about:

 1. where to pull from (your downstream repository address)
 2. the upstream repository
 3. a summary of the changes between v1.0 release and your master.

You can then send this request by e-mail for instance, making the pull request
completely distributed and independent from GitHub proprietary system.
-->

<h2 id="git-tips-">Git tips 🔥</h2>

<p>We are all bound to get stuck sometimes when things go wrong. A good starting
point is this <a href="https://ohshitgit.com/">compilation</a>. These are solutions to
problems I often have to solve.</p>

<h3 id="premature-commit-">Premature commit 🔧</h3>

<p>You pulled the trigger too fast on that commit and wish you could include
additional changes? Make your changes, call <code>git commit --amend</code> and done. (Also
useful to change the commit message.)</p>

<h3 id="go-back-">Go back ⌛</h3>

<p>We messed up, go back to a previous commit.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># go back n commits n=1 in this case,</span>
<span># --soft: optionally don't discard changes</span>
<span># and put them on the staging area instead</span>
git reset HEAD~1 <span>--soft</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="put-changes-on-hold-">Put changes on hold 🚧</h3>

<p>So you want to get back to the state before you started making changes, but
don’t want to throw these changes away:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># stash the changes</span>
git stash
<span># get the changes back when needed</span>
git stash pop
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="where-it-went-wrong-">Where it went wrong 🔍</h3>

<p>You have a problem and don’t know which commit introduced it, enter <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect"><code>git bisect</code></a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git bisect start          <span># start a bisect section</span>
git bisect bad            <span># Current version is bad</span>
git bisect good v2.2.1    <span># v2.2.1 is known to be good</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>bisect will now choose commits in the middle of the history and you can mark
them as good or bad with the same commands. When no more revisions are available
you’ll have a description of the commit that caused the problem. You can then reset
the bisect state with <code>git bisect reset</code>.</p>

<h3 id="rebasing-commits-">Rebasing commits 💥</h3>

<p>Sometimes we make two commits when in reality, we could have included all the
changes in a single commit, and our history would be clearer. This is what is
known as <em>squashing</em>. We can use <code>git rebase</code> to meld commits with previous
commits. It can also be used instead of merging branches. Git’s rebase command
temporarily rewinds the commits on your current branch, pulls in the commits
from the other reference and reapplies the re-winded commits back on top.</p>

<p>Most people will advise you to always squash the commits and rebase them onto
the parent branch (like master or develop) before you submit a pull request or
send out a patch. Whether rebasing is preferred to merging really depends on the
context.</p>

<p>If you want to read more about <code>rebase</code> vs <code>merge</code>, check out <a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/mastering-git-why-rebase-is-amazing-a954485b128a">this
post</a></p>

<p>Whatever you do <strong>DO NOT</strong> rebase commits in a upstream repository people can
pull from. It will mess everyone’s history and lead to conflicts that all
downstream peers will need to fix.
Also, it’s <strong>never</strong> a good idea to <strong>rebase somebody else’s work</strong>, see <a href="https://yarchive.net/comp/linux/git_rebase.html">this
discussion</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># rebase last 2 commits</span>
git rebase <span>-i</span> HEAD~2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The interactive system will open an editor where you can choose each commit in a
list that are about to be changed. In this case, it will list 2 lines with the
last 2 commits. This list reflects exactly how your branch will look like after
the rebase:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>pick c8175df added line
pick dc58443 added final line

<span># Rebase 65e38e0..dc58443 onto 65e38e0 (2 commands)</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># Commands:</span>
<span># p, pick &lt;commit&gt; = use commit</span>
<span># r, reword &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but edit the commit message</span>
<span># r, reword &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but edit the commit message</span>
<span># s, squash &lt;commit&gt; = meld into previous commit</span>
<span># f, fixup &lt;commit&gt; = like "squash", but discard log message</span>
<span># ...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can pick, reorder or squash any commits you want to make for a more readable
history.</p>

<p>As we discussed, you can also rebase the current branch onto another</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git checkout feature
git rebase <span>-i</span> master
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For more information about rebase see the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase">documentation</a></p>

<h3 id="good-commit-messages-">Good commit messages 🧐</h3>

<p>Commit messages should be consistent across a project in terms of <strong>style</strong>,
<strong>content</strong>, and <strong>metadata</strong>. But some good rules are as follows:</p>

<ol>

October 3, 2020 | https://www.btao.org/2020/10/02/npm-trust.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.btao.org/2020/10/02/npm-trust.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In 1984 the co-inventor of Unix, Ken Thompson, delivered a seminal speech in which he highlighted that <em>you can’t trust code that you did not totally create yourself</em> <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. For a while, this lesson was largely ignored as open-source package registries like RubyGems, PyPI and npm grew rapidly. However, as we’re seeing <a href="https://blog.reversinglabs.com/blog/mining-for-malicious-ruby-gems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more</a> <a href="https://blog.npmjs.org/post/185397814280/plot-to-steal-cryptocurrency-foiled-by-the-npm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and</a> <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/a-post-mortem-of-the-malicious-event-stream-backdoor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more</a> supply-chain attacks through software dependencies, the risks of using unvetted dependencies are becoming clearer.</p>

<p>The risks are particularly great for JavaScript applications. Veracode found that the average JavaScript project relies on 377 dependencies – compared with just 16 for Python projects, or 43 in the Java ecosystem<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. Whenever a developer pulls in a new dependency, they are implicitly trusting the maintainers of that dependency. Often, this trust is awarded on the basis of popularity – we assume that a popular library will be more carefully vetted, or that since many others trust the maintainers, we can too. Other times, this trust relationship and the risks involved are not considered at all.</p>

<p><a href="https://sambleckley.com/writing/npm.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Some have argued</a> that the ill health of the npm registry is a social, rather than a technical problem, and suggest a human-compiled set of packages in order to separate the wheat of maintained, healthy packages from the chaff of abandoned toy projects with no documentation. <a href="https://medium.com/@dpc_96143/cargo-crev-and-rust-2019-fearless-code-reuse-b75d58398cb8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another suggestion from the Rust world</a> involves creating a manual web of trust from maintainers cryptographically signing each other’s projects. Either way, there are challenges: webs of trust have rarely taken off (outside of Debian), and compiling a vetted set of packages from scratch is a massive undertaking. I propose something in the middle: bootstrapping a web of trust using existing npm dependency relationships, and building from that foundation.</p>

<h2 id="existing-trust-relationships-in-npm">Existing trust relationships in npm</h2>

<p>Creating a web of trust from existing npm dependencies is, admittedly, somewhat problematic. As stated earlier, choosing to use a particular dependency is not always a well-considered decision based on researching its code and maintainers, and the trust relationship is merely implied. Similarly, there is no cryptographic verification of this weak trust, nor does npm currently have the infrastructure for such tools<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. What I am suggesting is an imperfect starting point to demonstrate the need for, and potential of, stronger trust measures in open source.</p>

<p>To construct this initial web, we can model npm’s maintainerships as a graph. If we let each node be a maintainer, then the edges between them are the trust relationship arising from using a dependency. In other words, if Alice maintains a package A, and A depends on package B maintained by Bob, then there is a directed edge from Alice to Bob. We can even weigh these edges by the number of Alice’s packages in which she implies trust of Bob.</p>

<h2 id="exploring-the-graph">Exploring the graph</h2>

<p>This simple model exhibits a power-law-like pattern in terms of trust: the vast majority of users are trusted by few or no others, and a very small number of users are highly trusted. This type of pattern is common in social networks: you see a similar thing emerge when plotting follower counts on Twitter. Such power laws often lead to a rich-get-richer feedback process in which the inequality (in terms of trust, in this case) gets more pronounced over time<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/efe1a929e64ebeeb021e79f341b35faa4baf1397/c0643/static/img/maintainer-wot-in-degrees.png" alt="Scatter plot of in-degree vs. number of users. Shows a roughly power-law relationship."></p>

<p>Who are these highly-trusted users? They’re who you’d expect: bots for large projects (e.g. <code>types</code>), corporate accounts (e.g. <code>fb</code>), and the maintainers of extremely popular open-source libraries (e.g. <code>sindresorhus</code>, who maintains e.g. <code>string-length</code>).</p>

<p>Perhaps more interestingly, this web of trust exhibits some useful structures. A number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strongly connected components</a> emerge – groups of users that, roughly speaking, all trust each other according to the web of trust principles (i.e. if I trust Alice, and Alice trusts Bob, then I trust Bob, too). All of these connected components are small, with the exception of a single one that’s home to over 11,000 users<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. This core component – we’ll call it the <strong>strong set</strong> – could provide a starting point for a measure of trust in the npm ecosystem.</p>



<p>We can quantify trust in a slightly more nuanced way than simply looking at the in-degree of each npm user. The PageRank algorithm provides such a measure that takes into account the trustworthiness of the people who trust me. For example, I may only be trusted by one user, but if that user is <code>isaacs</code> (the creator of npm) then that trust relationship counts for a lot! After running PageRank, the 10 “most-trusted” users are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>types</code></li>
  <li><code>sindresorhus</code></li>
  <li><code>angular</code></li>
  <li><code>m1tk4</code></li>
  <li><code>tjholowaychuk</code></li>
  <li><code>google-wombot</code></li>
  <li><code>fb</code></li>
  <li><code>isaacs</code></li>
  <li><code>gaearon</code></li>
  <li><code>yyx990803</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Many of these are unsurprising. However, <code>m1tk4</code> stands out: they only maintain two rarely-downloaded libraries. Because one of these libraries is used by the BBC, <code>m1tk4</code> is implicitly trusted by a large number of relatively trustworthy BBC employees who maintain other, more popular projects. This demonstrates how PageRank diffuses trust across the social network of npm maintainers. In fact, <code>m1tk4</code> is not a member of the strong set mentioned earlier – but many of the users who trust them <em>are</em>. <code>m1tk4</code> just doesn’t trust those users back!</p>

<p>While PageRank gives a fun measure of trust, it’s a very rough model for the reasons mentioned earlier: it’s based on a pretty weak indication of real trust. However, it might be useful in detecting suspicious behaviours in npm, which is something we – or registry maintainers – need to do proactively if we want to stop supply-chain attacks. For example, it might be a red flag if a highly-trusted user suddenly starts using a library by someone with a PageRank-based-trust of close to 0. And regardless, the strong set comes merely from observing which dependencies people choose to use without applying any complex calculations.</p>

<p>How might we want to use the strong set to create a stricter trust (or reputation) system? I think that formalizing such a system is unlikely if it requires large-scale buy-in from npm users. Instead, we might create a simple wrapper for npm that checks if you’re about to install something from a developer outside of the strong set, similar to Liran Tal’s excellent <a href="https://github.com/lirantal/npq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">npq</a>. Or perhaps security researchers could use the npm web of trust as an additional data point when deciding whether a suspicious package warrants further investigation. Either way, the state of trust within the npm ecosystem is not great. This model gives us a starting point.</p>

<p><em>Do you think I’ve got it all wrong? Or do you have further suggestions on how we can improve the state of trust in open source? <a href="https://www.btao.org/contact">Get in touch</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>A final note: this analysis is based on data from June 2020, which I collected for my Master’s thesis. I believe you’d reach similar numbers if you ran the analysis on data from today.</em></p>

		<h2 id="003">0:03</h2>

<div><p>Welcome to Signals and Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky. </p><p>Today I’m going to have a conversation with Brian Nigito, essentially, about the technological underpinnings of the financial markets, and some of the ways in which those underpinnings differ from what you might expect if you’re used to things like the open Internet and the way in which cloud infrastructures work. We’re going to talk about a lot of things, but there’s going to be a lot of focus on networking, and some of the technologies at that level, including things like IP multicast. </p><p>Brian Nigito is a great person to have this conversation with because he has a deep and long history with the financial markets. He’s worked in the markets for 20 years, some of the time he spent working at the exchange-level where he did a lot of the foundational work that led to the modern exchange architectures that we know today. He’s also worked on the side of various different trading firms. For the last eight years, Brian’s been working here at Jane Street and his work here has covered a lot of different areas, but today, he spends a lot of time thinking about high performance, low latency, and especially network level stuff. </p><p>So let’s dive in. I think one thing that I’m very sensitive to is a lot of the people who are listening, don’t know a ton about the financial markets and how they work. And so just to get started, Brian can give a fairly basic explanation of what an exchange is.</p></div>

<h2 id="122">1:22</h2>

<p>I think when you hear about an exchange, you can think of lots of different kinds of marketplaces. But when we talk about an exchange, we’re talking about a formal securities exchange. And these are the exchanges that the SEC regulates, and they meet all of the rules necessary to allow people to trade in securities. So when we use that loosely, yeah, it’s pretty different than your average flea market. Supposed to be anyway.</p>

<h2 id="146">1:46</h2>

<p>That’s obviously a function which, once upon a time was done with physical people in the same location, right? Those got moved into more formal, more organized exchanges with more electronic support. Then eventually there’s this kind of transformation that’s happened essentially over the last 20 years, where the human element has changed enormous amount. Now, humans are obviously deeply involved in what’s going on, but the humans are almost all outside of the exchange and the exchange itself has become essentially a kind of purely electronic medium.</p>

<h2 id="217">2:17</h2>

<p>Yeah, it’s a really interesting story because you have examples of communication technologies and electronic trading, going back to the late ’60s, but probably more mid-‘70s (I’m being a little loose with dates) but it was kind of always present. But the rule set was not designed to force people to operate at the kinds of timescales that electronic systems would cause you to operate at. It was rather forgiving. So you know, if somebody on the floor didn’t want to deal with then electronic exchange, the electronic exchange had to wait. Over the past 10 to 15 years, that’s kind of flipped and so generally, we favor, always accessible electronic quotations.</p>

<h2 id="305">3:05</h2>

<p>To step back a little bit. The exchanges are the places for people to meet and trade, as you said, to advertise their prices. And for people to transact with each other. Other than people who are buying and selling, what are the other people who interact at the exchange level, what are the other kind of entities that get hooked in there.</p>

<h2 id="319">3:19</h2>

<p>So you have, obviously the entities who either in their own capacity or on behalf of other people are transacting securities, but then you have financial institutions that are clearing and guaranteeing those trades, providing some of the capital or leverage to the participants who are trading, they obviously want to know what’s going on there. You have other exchanges, because the rule set requires the exchanges to respect each other’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_quote">quotations</a> – in this odd way, there’s a web where the the exchanges are customers of each other. And you may also have various kinds of market data providers. So those quotes that reflect the activity on the exchange are eventually making their way all the way down to what you might see scrolling on the bottom of the television or your brokerage screen or financial news website, etc. I guess they even make it all the way down to the printed page when the Wall Street Journal prints transaction prices.</p>

<h2 id="410">4:10</h2>

<p>So what does this look like at a more systems level? What are the messages the different participants are sending back and forth?</p>

<h2 id="416">4:16</h2>

<div><p>The most primitive sorts of things are you have orders or instructions, there are other platforms where we have quotes and we may use that loosely, but we’ll just say orders. An order would just say that I would like to buy or sell, let’s say, a specific stock, and I’d like to do so at no worse than this price, and for no more than this quantity, and that may mean I could get filled at a slightly better price than that. I could get filled for less [quantity] than that. I could get filled not at all. </p><p>That order could basically check the book immediately and then come right back to me if there’s nothing to be done. Or it can rest there for some nonzero amount of time where it could advertise and other people may see it and choose to interact with it. And then obviously, I can withdraw that interest or cancel it. So when we talked about orders or cancels, those go hand in hand. </p><p>Finally, there’s execution messages where if you and I intersect on our interest I want to buy you want to sell or vice versa, then the exchange is going to generate an execution to you. And to me, saying that that happened and the terms of that trade.</p></div>

<h2 id="522">5:22</h2>

<div><p>One of the key properties here is that you have a fairly simple core set of messages, this basic data structure at the heart of it called “the book,” which is the set of orders that have not been satisfied. And then people can send messages to add orders and remove orders. And then if two orders <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cross.asp">cross</a>, if there are two orders that are compatible, where a trade can go up, then an execution occurs and the information flows out. </p><p>There’s a fairly simple core machine at the heart of it but then lots of different players who want different subsets of information for different purposes. There are people who are themselves trading, who want to see of course, their own activity and all the detail about that. And they also want to see what we call “market data,” that kind of public anonymized version of the trading activity so you can see what are the prices there are out there that are advertised for you to go and transact against. </p><p>In the end, you need to build a machine that’s capable of running this core engine, doing it at sufficient speed, doing it reliably enough… Maybe a thing that’s not apparent if you haven’t thought about it is: there’s like a disturbing dizzying amount of money at stake. And oh my God, you do not want to lose track of the transactions, right? If you say like, “Oh, you guys did this trade,” and then you forget about it and don’t report it, or you report to one side and not the other, terrible things happen. So reliability is a key thing.</p></div>

<h2 id="635">6:35</h2>

<p>Yeah and I think to go back, there’s lots of different consumers, lots of different participants. And I think the key word there is there’s lots of <em>competing</em> participants. So one thing you didn’t mention in there is disseminating all that information fairly. So trying to get it to everybody at the same time is a real challenge and one that participants are studying very, very carefully and looking for any advantage they can technologically within the rule set, etc. So that extra layer of competition sort of makes the problem a little more complicated, and a little more challenging.</p>

<h2 id="710">7:10</h2>

<p>This fairness issue is one that you’ve seen from the inside working on early exchange infrastructure at Island and Instinet, which eventually became the technology that NASDAQ is built on. Early on, you guys built an infrastructure that I think didn’t have all the fairness guarantees that modern exchanges happen today. Can you say more about how that actually plays out in practice?</p>

<h2 id="729">7:29</h2>

<div><p>When working on the Island system, it was very close, originally, to sort of “fair” in that you had the same physical machines, you had an underlying delivery mechanism, which we’ll talk about, that was very fair at getting it to those individual machines. And then you were sending copies of orders or instructions after going through one application to everyone. So you were all passing through about the exact same amount of work and the about the exact same number of devices. But it was actually very inefficient, we were using thousands of machines that were mostly idle. </p><p>So once we started trying to handle multiple clients on a single machine, it exposed some obvious and silly problems. The naive implementation where people would connect, we would collect all of those connections. And then when we had a message, we would send them on the connections serially, often in the order in which people connected. Well, that immediately led to thousands of messages per second before the exchange open where somebody tried to be the very first connection in that line. </p><p>Then you start sort of round-robining, so you know, you start from one and then the next time around, you start from two etc, etc, to try to randomize this. And then you had people who were connecting to as many different ports as they could and taking the fastest of each one. And so these incentives are very, very strong, and we’d like to use machines to their fullest, but to literally provide each participant their own unique machine for each connection starts to get ridiculous as well.</p></div>

<h2 id="904">9:04</h2>

<p>Where did that lead you? How did you end up resolving that problem?</p>

<h2 id="907">9:07</h2>

<p>A lot of these were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a> protocols. In those days, we actually had a decent number …</p></div></div>

<p>This article introduces a generic and light-weight debugging aid / event
tracing mechanism that is both feasible for targets without proper debugger
connection, as well as visual, providing visibility into high-level and
low-level events.</p>
<p>“What would an ocean be without a monster lurking in the dark? It would be like
sleep without dreams.”
― Werner Herzog</p>
<p>“The harder you work… and visualize something, the luckier you get.”
― Seal</p>

<p>For the past few weeks, I’ve been busy banging my head against the wall with a
system that contains a complex SoC and the vendor SDK is also a .. mess (to put
it politely). In the specific subsystem that I’ve been working with, the SDK
code structure is such that it’s pretty impossible to know who does what, in
what order and when.</p>
<p>In a normal world, one could use a debugger and various hardware assisted code
tracing tools, but the debugger connection
to this system is somewhat unstable to begin with and CoreSight TRACE is not available.
Utilizing SRAM-buffered message streams (e.g. Segger RTT) is also too unstable
(since it relies on the debugger connection).</p>
<p>In similar situations I’ve gotten away by using multiple GPIOs and toggling them
from strategic places and then used a logic analyzer to see what’s what. The
technique has many good qualities and is quite general, but requires pins to
be available to be toggled by software. This sadly is not the case on the
system in question.</p>
<p>There is an UART that is used for text-based debugging messages, but using
<code>printf()</code> from within highly asynchronous code (and ISRs) is akin to digging out
dragons out of one’s nose. On the other hand, the UART is the only thing not
dedicated to core system functionality, so I ended up using it.</p>
<p>In the end, I instrumented the code with a lot of UART writes (single bytes from
different parts), indicating entry and return from functions (including ISRs) in
a race-free manner. While I’ve used this
technique with great success in the past, this time the complexity of the system
was such that manually “decoding” the events from the logic analyzer’s protocol
decoder was pretty slow and tedious and involved a lot of head scratching and
crying. I wanted a way to visualize the data so that I could have both the
long-term view as well as the short-term one.</p>
<p>As a side note, I actually managed to solve my acute problem without these tools
before I wrote them, but these are the tools that would’ve aided my adventures
quite a bit, and I plan to use them in the future.</p>


<p>Armed with my <a href="https://www.saleae.com/">trusty logic analyzer</a>, I thought that
since it already has a rather nice UART decoding support, I’ll just export the
stuff from it into a simple to parse file, and then do a small program to draw
pretty things from that.</p>
<p><img src="https://lowerstrata.net/img/serial-tracing/saleae-serial-800.png" alt="Saleae Logic UART decoder"></p>
<p>Except that the export options for Saleae Logic do not support exporting the
protocol analyzer results (<strong><em>It actually does, please read on</em></strong>). I still love
the analyzer and the software, but I’d have to leave it behind. At least I could
export the actual digital trace data out from the program.</p>
<p>I’ve been waiting for a good problem to try <a href="https://sigrok.org/">sigrok</a> with.
I’ve been reading about it for a while, but didn’t have a problem to solve yet.
sigrok has a capable UART decoder, and supports command line exporting and
whatnot. Should’ve been trivial to achieve what I wanted. So, downloaded the latest release of <code>sigrok-cli</code> and PulseView and victory! Except that I failed completely to
load either of the exported formats (CSV and VCD) into PulseView. After figuring out where the code lives,
seems that the CSV decoder is incapable of handing data that is change-based.
Sequential CSV format would’ve worked, but I like working at high capture rates,
so the file sizes would’ve been prohibitive. The VCD import didn’t work either,
with very wrong imported results. So, damn you sigrok, I wanted to like you! (I
might come back to it eventually)</p>
<p>So, I was left without any sane manner of getting actual decoded data unless I
used the graphical Logic program manually. In the past, I’ve implemented
various tools that did quite complex analyses based on the change based CSV
that Saleae Logic exports, so I knew that writing a custom UART decoder was
doable. This was how <code>decode-serial</code> was born. It reads the
change based CSV in, recognizes UART frames and emits another CSV with the
timestamped recognized frames (aka “bytes” or “octets” if using 8-data bits per
frame).</p>
<p>From this (<code>decode-serial-csv/testdata/input/2017-09-23-serial-3000000-at-500Msps.csv.gz</code>):</p>
<pre><code>Time[s], DTRACE/SPI_MOSI, RX, UARTX
0.000000000000000, 0, 0, 1
0.362525714000000, 0, 0, 0
0.362526030000000, 0, 0, 1
0.362526330000000, 0, 0, 0
0.362526684000000, 0, 0, 1
0.362527020000000, 0, 0, 0
...
</code></pre>
<p>To this:</p>
<pre><code>timestamp(s),byte,isFrameValid,subascii
0.362525714000000,69,1,E
0.370543750000000,87,1,W
0.370661094000000,119,1,w
0.370664710000000,101,1,e
0.370762978000000,66,1,B
...
</code></pre>
<p>Like this (you can use the tool without the pipeline as well, but I tend to keep
CSV files in compressed format):</p>
<pre><code>zcat testdata/input/2017-09-23-serial-3000000-at-500Msps.csv.gz | \
./decode-serial.py UARTX 3000000 | \
gzip -9 &gt; testdata/output/2017-09-23-serial-3000000-transitions.csv.gz
</code></pre>
<h2 id="what-didn-t-actually-fail">What didn’t actually fail</h2>
<p>While writing this article I decided to do some “Deep Machine Learning Analysis”
and google whether it was at least somehow possible to export the protocol
analyzer data from Logic, and for sure, it is. It’s actually quite easy. The
feature just wasn’t located in a place where I looked for it. Ugh.
Co-incidentally, now that I’ve tried the export, the output format is compatible
with <code>generate-call-sequence</code> (covered below) once the display radix is first
set to <code>Dec</code>. So, ROTFL. On the other hand, it’s been a while that I had a
chance to write python properly and I have some future plans for the decoder,
so it wasn’t a completely useless exercise.</p>
<p><img src="https://lowerstrata.net/img/serial-tracing/science-dog-800.jpg" alt="Leading Advanced Deep Machine Learning Expert"></p>

<p>Once we have the individual frames recognized, the next issue is using them to
reconstruct “what happened”. Due to the nature of the tracing mechanism, it’s
best to use a single frame output to indicate when a specific function is
entered or left (separate codes and emitting are necessary for both). Sticking
to such an arrangement allows for a fairly light-weight operation, and if the
hardware peripheral has any kind of built-in queue available, pushing data out
can be made to happen without blocking the operation of the rest of code.
Although in my case the underlying output mechanism was strongly synchronized,
so I might’ve as well emitted more than a single byte at a time.</p>
<p>So, the code would have instrumentation akin to this:</p>
<pre><code>function execute {
  emitTraceByte('E');
  ...
  write(..);
  ...
  emitTraceByte('e');
}

function write(..) {
  emitTraceByte('W');
  ...
  // we've reached an important point within write, mark it (see below). Unlike
  // the other instrumentation here, this code does not have an "ending" pair
  emitTraceByte('D');
  ...
  emitTraceByte('w');
}

ISR complete {
  emitTraceByte('B');
  ...
  execute();
  ...
  emitTraceByte('b');
}
</code></pre>
<p>Given a list of single byte codes and timestamps when they were emitted, we can
then reconstruct a call-graph of a sorts (or rather, a call sequence). Assuming
we instrument the code always in pairs (enter and leave), this will be
sufficient to reconstruct a call “stack”. If the output mechanism works safely
from within ISRs, additional context information can be implicitly formed.</p>
<p>Next, we tell the <code>generate-call-sequence</code> tool how to translate the codes into
events (by placing these rules into a specification file):</p>
<pre><code>execute: E, e
write: W, w
complete: B, b, ISR1
callback: F, f
powerdown: C, c
sync: D
</code></pre>
<p>Above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each line starts with a label (e.g. <code>execute</code>). This label will be emitted
into the visualization and should describe the function entered (e.g. the
function name might be a good choice here)</li>
<li>Each label is followed by 1 to 3 additional parameters.</li>
<li>The 2 parameter form describes that we have something with a start and an end.
Start and end codes can be given in ASCII if in <code>[a-zA-Z]</code> or hex
(<code>0x</code>-prefix) or unsigned decimal numbers. Internally the sequence generator uses
python <code>int</code>s, so the available code space is fairly large.</li>
<li>The 1 parameter form describes that we have an event “mark”. These are meant
to mark some important “thing” which does not represent a function call per
se. Marks will have a distinct visual representation in the event viewer.</li>
<li>The 3 parameter form is similar to the 2 parameter form, but also includes the
name of the context that will be “entered” when the start code is encountered.
It is currently assumed that the context will be left simultaneously to leaving
the function that created the context, so expressing that separately is not
required (nor supported).</li>
<li>The convention of using capital letters as start codes and lowercase letters
as end codes makes it slightly easier to read the instrumented code, but
this is not a technical requirement. Any codes are allowed as long as
they’re unique in the specification and the parser does not reject them.</li>
<li>Acceptable characters for both labels and contexts are from the set
<code>[a-zA-Z0-9_]</code>.</li>
<li>File format is ASCII, with support for comments (<code>#</code> starts a comment). For
file suffix, I’ve used <code>.gcs</code>, but you can use whatever you like.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t particularly like writing desktop GUI programs. I’ve yet to see a
toolkit / GUI-library that would fit my square hole I guess. So in general,
whenever user representation on desktop is required, I try to stick with either
CLI or HTML. However, some time back I ran across
<a href="https://github.com/nico/ninjatracing">ninjatracing</a>, which is a tool that
reads build logs generated by the quite awesome <a href="https://ninja-build.org/">ninja build tool</a> and emits “events” in JSON format. These events are in a
format that the Chrome’s built-in Trace Event profiling tool (aka <code>about:tracing</code>)
will read and lay out graphically. While the event viewer is geared towards Chrome
developers (and perhaps developers of highly-interactive …</p></section></article></div></div></div></div>

  <p>08 Sep 2020</p>

  <p>There’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rrAbLNePxU">a scene in Moneyball</a> in which Brad Pitt’s character, the
manager of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics">Oakland A’s</a>, is watching a recording of one of his
players trying so hard to run fast that he stumbles and falls. Lying on the
ground he’s angry at himself, because he doesn’t realize that right before he
started his run he hit a home run and scored the game-winning points. Watching
the scene, Pitt leans back, smiles a Brad Pitt smile and says: “how can you not
be romantic about baseball?”</p>

<p>There are moments in which I ask myself the same thing about programming.</p>

<p>We’re programming computers. We spend large parts of our days writing down
instructions for machines. Other parts of the day are spent making sure that we
chose the right instructions. Then we talk about those instructions: why and how
we picked the ones we picked, which ones we will consider in the future, what
those should do and why and how long it will probably take to write those down.</p>

<p>It can sound very serious and dry; a bureaucracy of computer instructions. And
yet.</p>

<p>And yet we, the ostensible bureaucrats, talk about magic as something that
exists —&nbsp;the good <em>and</em> the bad kind. There are <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/547625">wizards</a>. Instructions
are <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-9.html">“like a sorcerer’s spells”</a>.</p>

<p>We don’t call them instructions, though, not when talking about what we produce
each day anyway. It’s code we write. Emotions are involved. Code, we say, can
be: neat, nice, clean, crafted, baroque, minimal, solid, defensive, hacky, <em>a
hack</em>, art, a piece of shit, the stupidest thing I’ve ever read, beautiful, like
a poem.</p>

<p>Some lines of code are a riddle to anyone but their author and the name code
serves as a warning. Other times, strangely, it’s a badge of honor.</p>

<p>Fantastic amounts of code have been written, from beginning to end, by a single
person, typing away night after night after night, for years, until one day the
code is fed to a machine and, <em>abracadabra</em>, a brightly coloured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_(video_game)#Development">amusement
park</a> appears on screen. Other code has been written, re-written, torn
apart and stitched back together across time zones, country borders and decades,
not by a single person, but by hundreds or even thousands of different people.</p>

<p>This world of programming is held together by code. Millions and millions of
lines of code. Nobody knows how much there is. Some of it is more than 30 years
old, some less than a week, and chances are you used parts of both yesterday.
There are lines of code floating around on our computers that haven’t been
executed by a machine in years and probably won’t be for another lifetime.
Others are the golden threads of this world, holding it together at the seams
without no more than a dozen people knowing about it. Remove one of these and it
all comes crashing down.</p>

<p>If you haven’t been here long enough and try to guess how much there is and how
many generations are layered on top of each other — you won’t even come close.
But stay around. After a while, more and more, you’ll find yourself in moments
of awe, stunned by the size and fragility of it all; the mountains of work and
talent and creativity and foresight and intelligence and luck that went into it.
And you’ll reach for the word “magic” because you won’t know how else to
describe it and then you lean back and smile, wondering how someone could not.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Software as a Service (SaaS) has become the dominant model for delivering business software. With SaaS, applications are hosted by a vendor and made accessible to end customers over the Internet on a subscription basis. The popularity of SaaS is making a substantial impact on the daily activities of IT workers. When software is hosted on internally managed PCs or servers, the IT department is responsible for maintaining the infrastructure that supports these systems. IT professionals need to procure, configure, test, and physically set up the hardware. Additionally, it is necessary to provide on-going support for the infrastructure in areas like security management, capacity planning, service continuity, and incident response. After shifting to the SaaS model, many of these activities are outsourced to the provider. <a href="https://www.bettercloud.com/wp-content/reports/451-research-bettercloud.pdf">IT workers spend far less time on tasks like managing data storage, upgrades, maintenance, and purchasing</a>.</p><h2 id="it-admins">IT Admins</h2><p>This threatens certain conventional roles in the IT Department. An engineer whose primary skillset is the physical installation of hardware cannot offer much value when the infrastructure has been outsourced to SaaS. However, the SaaS shift often frees up these IT professionals to focus on tasks that create more value for the business. IT workers become less technically focused and more connected to the business. The transition to cloud applications provides many benefits to IT admins including spending less time on daily maintenance, the increased ability to work remotely, increased participation in business strategy, improved relationships with business colleagues, and reduced boredom and frustration at work [38]. Therefore, although certain conventional IT roles are being eliminated, SaaS often enables these workers to move into more rewarding careers. System administrators that previously specialized in configuring on-site hardware are now responsible for designing and supporting cloud-based infrastructure. Database administrators that were previously focused on keeping a business’s databases healthy and running, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/database/changing-role-of-the-dba-4369434.pdf">are often being transitioned into data architects who understand how to cultivate and leverage data to achieve business objectives</a>.</p><h2 id="software-engineers">Software Engineers</h2><p>Software engineers are highly affected as well. As the SaaS market matures, every conceivable niche of the business problem is now addressed by one or more SaaS products. This is reducing the number of new custom software projects enterprises need to initiate. However, many organizations still invest in developing software that supports the broader business strategy. For example, an internally developed customer-facing web portal may provide competitive differentiation in the market. Even though the back-office processes may be running on a standard SaaS product, there are often bolt-on custom software applications that could be developed to improve the customer experience or help the operation run more efficiently.</p><p>As organizations become more focused on leveraging data to create business value, software engineering roles are often shifting to a data engineering focus. When an organization’s portfolio of SaaS products exposes data through open APIs, many opportunities arise for engineering teams to use data. Often data from multiple applications can be combined and correlated to provide valuable business insights. For example, customer communications from the CRM could be run through a sentiment analysis tool to analyze the current level of customer satisfaction, and then overlaid with the customer’s payment patterns in the accounts receivable system. The finance team could be alerted to an increased likelihood of past due payment or bad debt. When SaaS is the predominant software model, engineers will spend more time on data and process automation projects as opposed to building new business applications from scratch.</p><p>These trends will require software engineers to develop different skill sets. Although it is popular for those in software engineering careers to view programming as a craft or a calling, the real need for these workers in a corporate setting is to create automation that increases revenue or decreases costs. Organizations hire software engineers to create a competitive advantage in the market, satisfy customer requirements, and optimize processes to reduce labor costs. Software engineers that are well aligned with business strategy are better positioned for career success than those overly focused on the technical minutiae of their chosen programming language. Software engineering jobs now typically require writing skills, problem-solving skills, research skills, and competencies in teamwork and collaboration.</p><h2 id="what-s-your-saas-career-strategy">What’s Your SaaS Career Strategy?</h2><p>Whether you work in IT or not, the proliferation of SaaS will impact your career significantly. Your ability to adapt and learn will help you turn cloud technology into a competitive advantage in the job market. In future posts I will be offering some ideas on how you can leverage these trends to supercharge your career and thrive in the cloud economy.

<![CDATA[Why Charge, How Much to Charge, and Pricing]]>

October 3, 2020 | https://boneandfeathers.com/2020/10/03/pricing-and-charging/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://boneandfeathers.com/2020/10/03/pricing-and-charging/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I remember the first time I wrote a checkout system that took money from customers. It was for a paid real-time analytics product that I’d built – a few years before Google made it free with Analytics. I was using the Authorize.net API and was terrified. “What if I screw up the arithmetic and charge a customer too much? What if we get hacked?” but most importantly I struggled with the belief that anyone would actually pay us for software that I had built. It seemed unfathomable.</p>
<p>Like most things, as you mature as a software developer or product creator, you have a much better sense of how little you still know, which manifests as humility, making it hard to charge for your products.</p>
<p>You’ve written your own software or created your own product, and you know all about the various bugs, problems, inefficiencies, glitches and the various warts your baby has. So it is hard to look at it from a customer perspective and see the value, because you see all the things that need fixing or could be improved. You feel like your customer will see those things too and won’t pay until you fix every single one of them, at which point more perceived problems will have emerged, creating a never ending cycle.</p>
<p>You need to overcome these psychological barriers and realize that, as long as your software solves a real customer problem, and as long as solving that problem is worth more to your customer than the money you charge, you will make sales. Customers will buy. And those customers won’t return furious at you for not fixing every single bug, but will actually be happy that your product worked well enough. As Jim Collins once said, “Don’t let Great be the enemy of Good.”</p>

<p>It’s important that you overcome the psychological barrier to charging for your product or service early on. There are two core reasons for this:</p>
<p>Firstly, it ensures that you are building a business that can generate cash flow. If you make something free and have tremendous growth, it is as meaningless as standing on a street corner handing out $20 dollar bills. You are not validating your business model.</p>
<p>Secondly, everyone loves free stuff, and that love of free will poison your product decisions. You are getting feedback from people who incur no cost to use your product and thus the bar for product success is artificially low. You need feedback from people who incur a cost, so that they can inform your product decisions from a base of having incurred real cost. If your product decisions do not deliver enough value to justify what the product costs, you need to reevaluate and do better.</p>

<p>Pricing is weird. The more you charge, the more perceived value your product has, even before a customer learns about the product and tries it. Slap on an eye-wateringly high price and you will make a handful of sales, even on a brand new product targeting a new market. I’ve seen it happen. Your price won’t be optimal, but the psychology behind perceived value based on price is real and a useful input in your decision making.</p>
<p>The less you charge, the more you will find your customer service load per customer increases. Customers that pay less are more demanding. I’ve seen this pattern remain constant. It doesn’t apply to slight drops in pricing, but to products where prices are extremely low – in the $1 to $7 a month range. We’ve sold SaaS products at various prices with monthly or yearly subscription over the past 15 years and have found this to remain true.</p>
<p>There is a market for every price point. As our business budget has increased into the millions, I’ve discovered that it makes perfect sense for us to pay 6 figures and higher for certain things when the price is far lower than either: the cost of the problem, the revenue that we’ll earn by using the product, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>As a one or two person team, you’ll be sitting in a room, living off your savings and you’re going to have a very hard time believing that an enterprise customer will happily pay thousands or tens of thousands of dollars for your product per year. That is going to make it hard for you to make rational pricing decisions and very difficult for you to talk to customers and rationalize the cost of your product. This is an early stage problem that goes away quickly after your first few sales.</p>
<p>Start out low, but not too low, and increase your pricing. If you’re charging for a subscription product, it is easy to let your existing customers know that you’re increasing the price. Cut them a break e.g. give them their existing pricing for another year, or just grandfather them in at the old pricing on their existing licenses, which is what we did.</p>
<p>Starting higher and lowering prices later on is not a great look unless you provide a very clear and positive rationale. It risks your early adopters feeling like suckers and questioning their buying decision. It creates negative perceived value, as the product may not appear to be “worth” what it was when the price was higher.</p>
<p>At Wordfence, we started out at $17.95 per year, then raised the price to $35 per year, then to $49 per year, then to $99 per year. That shift happened between 2012 when we launched and around 2017. Those price increases seemed insanely high to me. I was sure our customers would revolt, that we’d receive social media pushback and outright incredulity from existing customers. None of those came to pass. In fact these increases created a positive outcome for our existing customers because we were able to grow the product and team, providing significantly more value.</p>

<p>Our hacked site cleaning business is interesting because we use a demand based pricing model. When our team gets busy, the price for site cleaning rises to help throttle demand. When they don’t have enough to do, the price automatically drops.</p>
<p>We recently conducted a financial study where we ‘bucketed’ buyers who paid $100 to $200 in one bucket, $200 to $300 in another bucket, all the way up to $2000. We plotted a bar chart showing how many buyers we had for a given pricing bucket for a given time period and separated the time periods into months with high demand and months with low demand.</p>
<p>In other words, we were able to examine our customer resistance to price increases as the pricing changed. Our average price is around $220 for a hacked site clean. When you examine this data, there appears to be no resistance to price increases, but then you have to consider that the price is increasing due to increased demand. So you’re really looking at how customers behaving in the face of increased price, but also increased demand. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Price elasticity of demand</a> says that as demand increases people will pay more. Ideally you’d want to see buyers still buying as you increase price and demand stays static.</p>

<p>I would be remiss without mentioning price discrimination. There is a rather unfortunate reality that some customers just want to spend money, some customers think through every purchase in a logical and systematic way, and others just want whatever the cheapest option is. I describe this reality as unfortunate because, if you create three versions of the same product and simply have a perceived differentiation between each product, but with a low, medium and high priced version, you will make more money.</p>
<p>You’ll make more money because customers that simply “want the best” will buy the higher priced version, some customers will just default to the middle tier, and others will make a rational choice to buy the lowest priced option or will default to that. If you had a single middle tier price, you’d exclude the “I want the best” customers and you may not make a sale to the deal shoppers.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, it is unethical to exploit price discrimination without actually having differentiated products that provide more or less value, and where that value has some relationship to the costs to produce or maintain those products. So be a good person, make good choices, but know that price discrimination is a very real phenomenon and potentially a low friction way to increase cash flow.</p>

<p>We’ve chatted about overcoming your psychological resistance to charging for your creations, that you should charge early to validate and help shape your product and business, the perceived value of higher prices and the customer service load associated with lower prices.</p>
<p>We also covered how it will be challenging for you, living on Ramen and tepid tap water, to charge a lot for a product that you created, and that you need to separate your circumstances from the reality of the market available for your product and what they’ll pay.</p>
<p>We talked about how it is easier to increase prices than decrease them, and I used Wordfence as an example of how radically pricing can change over the years, provided you continue to increase the value that your customers receive. Finally we discussed how taking a data driven approach can help, but may not provide all the answers, and about price discrimination and how it can increase pricing efficiency.</p>

Unfortunately, Skype has no capacity for recording single person calls, at least as yet. This is not the place for an extended debate on the pros and cons of Skype, or Google Meet (only records corporate accounts), or the rest. Instead, lets sum up all these issue with the simple understanding that, if <strong>one person</strong> wants to record a webcam connected to their local computer, along with the screen, it is insane to imagine that the only way to get this is by:</p><ul><li>Making an account somewhere (Zoom, Meet, Skype, anything)</li><li>Giving a cloud service permission to record our screens</li></ul><p>At the same time, a lot of standard tools for screen recording do not play nice with webcam recorders (like <a href="https://www.maartenbaert.be/simplescreenrecorder/">Simple Screen Recorder</a> and <a href="https://help.gnome.org/users/cheese/stable/">Cheese</a>).</p><h2 id="open-broadcaster-software">Open Broadcaster Software</h2><p>The <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=obs+studio&amp;ia=web">OBS studio project</a> is a godsend.

With secret staking derivatives, users can pool SCRT in a secret contract that chooses how to stake pooled SCRT across validators in the network while issuing a synthetic staking derivative Secret Token (e.g., dxSCRT). In this sense, SCRT serves as collateral; dxSCRT is a liquid token, so it can be used or traded immediately.

It can be slower since you have to search the text, and doesn’t work in all circumstances. But when it works, it does save quite a few clicks, especially because you can select the button with ⌃ (Ctrl) + index, similar to Vimium’s indexing of links.

I would list Karabiner as my first tool, but the process to set up and break in is a tad more involved. Karabiner works by mapping mouse actions (mouse up, down, left, right, click, etc) onto the keyboard. In my personal setup that lets me use either hand/side of the keyboard, I’ve mapped <em>⌃ (Ctrl) + wasd OR ijkl</em> to my mouse movements. I’ve also mapped actions such as scroll, click, and right click, and have a precise and fast mouse navigation setting.</p><p>There are some details to getting it set up, and tweaking it to your preferences, which will be explained in detail in a follow up blog post very shortly.</p><h2 id="b-mouse-keys-nativehttpssupportapplecomguidemac-helpcontrol-the-pointer-using-mouse-keys-mh27469mac-macoshttpssupportapplecomguidemac-helpcontrol-the-pointer-using-mouse-keys-mh27469mac"><a name="mk"></a><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/control-the-pointer-using-mouse-keys-mh27469/mac" target="_blank" rel="noopener">b.

But the real power comes from the custom workflows you can build or get from open-source: any action you could want to automate now at your fingertips you can use in Alfred.

Some of these tools work well in isolation, and others work better together in combination with each other and with native app shortcuts or OS shortcuts. For example, in Chrome, I limit my tabs to 9 with a chrome extension so I can navigate with command + tab number 1-9 (native chrome shortcut), use Vimium for clicking and indexing links, Karabiner for scrolling, and Alfred to quickly google or wikipedia in a new tab.</p><p>For that reason, I’d highly recommend spending even ten minutes getting intimate with all the shortcuts of your OS and the applications you use frequently. For me, knowing OneNote and Sublime Text shortcuts is essential.</p><p>In my opinion, shortcutting is much better than moving a cursor, even if controlled by a keyboard.</p><a name="mac"><h2 id="6-general-mac-shortcuts">6.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

      <div>
        <p>This is a list of tools I use to increase my privacy on the Internet. I'm not a security expert. My goal is to have a good enough protection. Feel free to suggest any additions and improvements.</p>
<h2 id="firefox">Firefox</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343120-ed616080-e00d-11ea-9451-f2c69ada5246.jpg" alt="firefox"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/exp/firefox/">Firefox</a> probably doesn't need an introduction. It is an open-source project. It's run by Mozilla - a non-profit organization. Anyone can go to the <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">Firefox repository</a> to take a look at the code and see how it works.</p>
<p>Firefox doesn't gather your personal data to serve you ads as Chrome. While Google seems careful and to an extend trustworthy with handling people's personal data, you don't seem to have much control how your profile is built and used.</p>
<p>The browser is constantly being improved. It seems slightly heavier than Chrome or Safari on my computer, but that's a minor issue compared to all the advantages. I use the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/">Developer Edition</a>.</p>
<h2 id="little-snitch">Little Snitch</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343121-edf9f700-e00d-11ea-91d7-a2a876111ca1.jpg" alt="Little Snitch"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/">Little Snitch</a> is a MacOS application that  monitors connections and lets you control inbound and outbound traffic from your computer. It visualizes these connections and shows where applications connect. This way you have information about both familiar and unfamiliar network actions that applications are trying to perform.</p>
<h2 id="pihole-adguard">PiHole &amp; AdGuard</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343124-ef2b2400-e00d-11ea-8f26-f4dcbdf189d6.jpg" alt="Pi Hole">
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343113-e9cdd980-e00d-11ea-8d17-642c01565237.jpg" alt="AdGuard"></p>
<p><a href="https://pi-hole.net/">PiHole</a> &amp; <a href="https://adguard.com/">AdGuard</a> are ad blockers. PiHole is open-source while AdGuard is a paid offering. I use one at home and the other one at the office. AdGuard is slightly easier to setup and use. Both work network-wide, but AdGuard also provides standalone applications and browser plugins to protect from ads when being outside of private networks.</p>
<h2 id="nibspace">Nibspace</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343122-ee928d80-e00d-11ea-950f-3514adfca5fa.jpg" alt="Nibspace"></p>
<p><a href="https://nibspace.com/">Nibspace</a> is an alternative to Google Analytics. It provides basic information about the visitors of my websites. It doesn't use cookies and it has a small footprint (~ 1kb) while being affordable ($1/mo per domain). It's not open-source. There are few other, notable competitors such as <a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a>, <a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/">Simple Analytics</a> and <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a>.</p>
<h2 id="bitwarden">Bitwarden</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343117-ec303380-e00d-11ea-828d-c0bf960154a2.png" alt="Bitwarden"></p>
<p><a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a> is an open-source password manager. I used to use 1Password, but I wanted something more affordable yet with similar features and Bitwarden fits the bill perfectly.</p>
<h2 id="nordvpn">NordVPN</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343123-ef2b2400-e00d-11ea-8026-de472ec96bc6.jpg" alt="Nord VPN"></p>
<p><a href="https://nordvpn.com/">NordVPN</a> is a personal virtual private network service provider. Their marketing seems aggressive, so I was a bit skeptical at the beginning, but then I decided to give it a try. Overall, NordVPN is one of the most polished and reliable VPNs I've used so far.</p>
<p>I also like that they show some innovation efforts, namely their NordLynx technology that is built around WireGuard - this relatively new VPN tunneling protocol</p>
<p>Last year <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21312609">NordVPN was hacked</a>, but they handled the whole situation pretty well in my view.</p>
<h2 id="fastmail">Fastmail</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343118-ecc8ca00-e00d-11ea-938b-7e9f884e8a6d.jpg" alt="Fastmail"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a> is a paid e-mail service that focuses on privacy and doesn't display ads. It is a simple service to manage e-mails, calendars and contacts. It costs $5/mo. It is also fast. This is partly related to their work on a more reliable, faster IMAP alternative, called <a href="https://jmap.io/">JMAP</a> - so it goes beyond just a snappy UI.</p>

                <div>
                    <p><em>This article is the third in a three part series that explores gold and Bitcoin in detail as products, including who the customers are for gold and Bitcoin, what jobs gold and Bitcoin do for them, and a perspective on the future markets for gold and Bitcoin.</em></p><h3 id="what-everybody-ought-to-know-about-gold-and-bitcoin"><strong>What everybody ought to know about gold and Bitcoin</strong></h3><ul><li><a href="https://andyjagoe.com/what-everybody-ought-to-know-about-gold-and-bitcoin-part-1-of-3-gold-as-a-product/">Part 1: Gold as a product</a></li><li><a href="https://andyjagoe.com/what-everybody-ought-to-know-about-gold-and-bitcoin-part-2-of-3-bitcoin-as-a-product/">Part 2: Bitcoin as a product</a></li><li>Part 3: The future for gold and Bitcoin <em>(this post)</em></li></ul><hr><p>On July 1, 1979, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkman">SONY released the Walkman</a>. Initial sales were disappointing, and the industry laughed at it because the sound quality was so poor compared to high-end speaker systems. But Walkman went on to be one of Sony's most successful brands of all time, selling almost 400 million portable music players. Walkman was never intended for the small number of people buying high-end speakers. Walkman enabled a much larger number of people to listen to music in places they never could have previously. In other words, Walkman's competition was never high-end speakers, it was non-consumption.</p><p>On January 9, 2007, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone">Steve Jobs announced the iPhone</a>. There was no app store at the time, and people forget how many <a href="https://bgr.com/2016/07/01/iphone-reviews-original-negative-ballmer-dvorak/">negative reviews it received</a>. Because it was such a poor actual phone, many early adopters actually carried an iPhone in addition to their regular cell phone. Steve Ballmer said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eywi0h_Y5_U">"There’s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share</a>." So how did iPhone become Apple's most successful product ever, selling 2.2 billion units as of November 1, 2018, and extracting much of the profit from the wireless value chain that previously went to carriers? When iPhone launched, there were no smartphones that had web browsing and media consumption that people could actually use. The real competition for iPhone was non-consumption.</p><p>Uber was founded in 2009. When they were first raising money, many investors passed because they didn't think that the taxi market was big enough. But that was the wrong way to think about it. Uber's primary competition was not taxis, but non-consumption. And Uber ended up massively expanding the total market for rides.</p><p>What does all this have to do with gold and Bitcoin?</p><p>Similar to the products above, there have been no shortage of Bitcoin detractors since its launch on January 3, 2009. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. It does not have alternative uses like jewelry or industrial applications. And gold has had thousands of years to entrench its position in the world. How could Bitcoin ever replace gold?</p><p>But what if this Bitcoin versus gold debate is a false dichotomy? </p><p>What if the "Bitcoin is digital gold" narrative is incomplete or misleading? What if thinking about Bitcoin in the context of gold is like thinking about Uber in the context of taxis?</p><p>Bitcoin enables a larger group of people than ever before to protect their savings and purchasing power. It does not do everything gold does. It doesn't need to.</p><p>Bitcoin's main competition is not gold. It is non-consumption. </p><p>Walkman, iPhone and Uber all seemed like toys when they were first launched. And though they may have been "inferior" products, that didn't matter because they were being sold to different customers. Over time, each product got better and better, and people began to trade down because the product was good enough and saved them money. In time, the new "inferior" products actually became better than the incumbents. And the incumbents shrank or disappeared.</p><p>But does this apply to Bitcoin? Is Bitcoin getting better? Isn't it the same now as when it launched in 2009?</p><p>Looking at the Bitcoin software project on Github we can see that it receives thousands of additions and deletions each week, and has received a steadily increasing number of contributions to master from 2010 to 2020.</p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-1.png 600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-1.png 1000w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/image-1.png 1600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/09/image-1.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Steady increase in Bitcoin commits to master (2010-2020)</figcaption></figure><p>Why is Bitcoin constantly being worked on and improved, even though it has no parent organization like Sony, Apple or Uber to push it forward?</p><p>Bitcoin works because it is a special kind of product. It's a multi-sided network.</p><p>Interaction between participants in the network creates incentives that drive the project forward. These network effects are why we see contributions to the Bitcoin project on Github growing at an increasing rate. </p><p>Let's map out the network flywheel¹ for Bitcoin and drop in the jobs to be done we identified in <a href="https://andyjagoe.com/what-everybody-ought-to-know-about-gold-and-bitcoin-part-2-of-3-bitcoin-as-a-product/">Part 2</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/Bitcoin-Network-Flywheel-Map-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Bitcoin-Network-Flywheel-Map-2.png 600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/Bitcoin-Network-Flywheel-Map-2.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Bitcoin Multi-Sided Network Flywheel</figcaption></figure><p>The multi-sided network for Bitcoin begins with Satoshi Nakamoto's vision for sound digital money and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bitcoin">early contributors</a> to the open source project and network. Once the network began to grow, specialized investors emerged to provide the financial capital necessary to develop the network. These investors typically hail from Silicon Valley or Wall Street, often co-invest on deals, and typically focus exclusively on cryptocurrency. Bitcoin mining operations developed, and these companies started building their own custom ASICs for mining, earning billions of dollars per year. Third party developers emerged to provide user-facing on-ramps and off-ramps to the Bitcoin network, as well as a wide range of infrastructure, analysis, trading and custodian services. Each layer of improvement to the network brought more users. Including more users, which itself brought more users.</p><p>The Bitcoin network exhibits increasing returns, which means that the more people who participate in the network, the more valuable the network is to every participant. This generates a natural monopoly and starts an exponential growth curve. </p><p>Gold is also a multi-sided network, but has weaker network effects.</p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/Gold-Network-Flywheel-Map-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Gold-Network-Flywheel-Map-1.png 600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/Gold-Network-Flywheel-Map-1.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Gold Multi-Sided Network Flywheel</figcaption></figure><p>The multi-sided network of gold begins with the metal itself and the memes behind why gold has been obsessed over for thousands of years. We discussed this in detail in <a href="https://andyjagoe.com/what-everybody-ought-to-know-about-gold-and-bitcoin-part-1-of-3-gold-as-a-product/">Part 1</a> of the series.</p><p>From here we move to investors, who have been putting financial capital to work developing new technologies and applications for gold for millennia. Today, the gold value chain is very mature, and even the promise of AI in the exploration process seems likely only to yield incremental results. </p><p>Incentivized by the value of gold, miners perform the costly and time consuming process of locating gold deposits and producing doré, a metallic alloy containing between 60-90% gold. The steps in this process are <a href="https://www.gold.org/about-gold/gold-supply/how-gold-is-mined/exploration">exploration</a> (1-10 years), <a href="https://www.gold.org/about-gold/gold-supply/how-gold-is-mined/development">development</a> (1-5 years), <a href="https://www.gold.org/about-gold/gold-supply/how-gold-is-mined/operation">operation</a> (10-30 years), <a href="https://www.gold.org/about-gold/gold-supply/how-gold-is-mined/decommissioning">decommissioning</a> (1-5 years) and <a href="https://www.gold.org/about-gold/gold-supply/how-gold-is-mined/mine-reclamation">reclamation</a>. </p><p>The doré that gold miners produce is then the basis for a complex ecosystem of third parties that add value and create useful applications from gold. Refiners like Valcambi, PAMP, and Heraeus convert doré into semi-fabricated metals and alloys for use in the industrial and jewelry sectors and investment grade bullion and coins. Gold bullion is then accredited by the LBMA for <a href="http://www.lbma.org.uk/good-delivery-explained">good delivery</a> and then stored in vaults like the New York Federal Reserve and the Bank of England before being traded over the counter in London and Zurich or on exchanges like the London Mercantile Exchange. Gold futures are most often traded on COMEX in New York, and companies like State Street Global Advisors and Blackrock have built financial products like gold ETFs that have claims on gold bullion.</p><p>The products produced by this third party ecosystem are bought by consumers as jewelry, investors as bars/coins or financial products with claims to bars/coins, central banks and industrial users. For consumers, investors and central banks, gold is valuable because other people find it valuable. And the more people who find it valuable and will accept it in exchange for goods and services, the more valuable it is to all. This is the primary network effect in the gold network.</p><p>Bitcoin has a similar network effect. It too is valuable because other people find it to be valuable. And the more people who find it valuable and will accept it in exchange for goods and services, the more valuable it is to all. </p><p>But Bitcoin's network effect is different, because gold is physical and Bitcoin is digital. The software eats the world hypothesis says that any product or service in any field that can become software, will become software. We see these dynamics play out in industry after industry, and the field of hard money and wealth preservation is no exception. </p><p>Why is digital different? Digital products can take advantage of zero marginal costs and universality of compute, attributes that a non-digital substitute cannot compete with. Bitcoin is ten times better than gold on a few very important factors that dramatically improve its usability and accessibility compared gold for the average person. Bitcoin can be instantly transmitted anywhere in the world, it is easily and instantly divisible in a way that gold is not, it is trivial to carry (no matter the quantity), and it is hard to seize. </p><p>These benefits effectively expand the market for Bitcoin to a much larger number of network participants compared to gold. And Metcalfe's law projects that the value of a network is proportional to the square of its number of nodes.</p><p>And unlike gold, this is not where Bitcoin's network effects end. Because Bitcoin is software, it is steadily getting better, whereas gold remains unchanged. We have already shown above the increasing rate at which contributions are being made by Bitcoin network participants to Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin has the advantage of Moore's law with respect to compute and storage cost, and because trust is built into the network itself, third party developers typically open source all their code so there is a same-side network effect among third party developers who borrow each other's code and best practices. This adds an incredible accelerant to the Bitcoin network and stands in contrast to gold's well developed but opaque and closed third party ecosystem.</p><p>That said, Bitcoin still has a long way to go relative to other …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

  <div><p>Right so yes I've spent over 25 years writing software for people in a professional capacity. As time has gone by, and I've learnt more about the process, I've slowly realised that actually writing code is actually quite a small part of the process. When I was a junior developer I probably spent 90% of my working day sat in front of an editor writing code. And I thought that was the job. Turns out it really isn't!Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I think people both inside and outside of the industry fixate on coding for a number of reasons, and it's quite interesting to ruminate on those, but building software is so much more than writing code. Talking to users, agreeing on features, designing the interface, setting up the infrastructure, testing the platform for bugs, testing it for performance, providing support for it. These are all messy, imprecise things that have very human factors.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>If you are a software engineer you can often seek solace in the code itself. Code is truth. You can't really argue with it. You can't argue with your compiler. It's really easy to fall into the trap of avoiding all work other than coding for these very reasons. But I would suggest that this makes you a really bad engineer! Engineering means getting your hands dirty, either literally in the case of Brunel, or from a human interaction point of view where software is concerned.</p></div>

  <div><p>So you are sort of saying that an engineer solves problems, and problems are experienced (mostly) by people, so to solve problems effectively you a) have to deal with people and b) have to really know how to solve the problem (e.g. dealing with infrastructure, performance, etc.) instead of only the parts you are comfortable with. Is that correct?</p></div><div><p>How much of this comes down to the attitude of the engineer? And how much of this comes down to actively studying?Â&nbsp;</p></div>

  <div><p>In my experience, almost 100% of that learning comes from hard won experience.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>When I studied at university, I was really surprised to discover that the "Computing" courses that I was interested in were labelled as "Software Engineering". I thought it was odd at the time; I never really had thought it about it before, and I was even a bit worried that I might have been signing up for the wrong course!Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I don't think many universities at the time offered "Computer Science" as an undergrad course; it's a very different discipline.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>It took me a LONG time to get my head around the fact that one of the words in the job was "engineering". And really the only way I realised that was after years of working building software. At some point the penny dropped that I was an engineer, and that writing code was only 1 aspect of that job.Â&nbsp;</p></div>

  <div><p>There are a number of things that people starting off in a career of Software Engineering should try and keep in mind.</p></div><div><div><ol>
<li>Never stop learning. Software development is still a very immature discipline. I like to think about it like building jet aeroplanes. After the jet engine was invented, flying on a jet passenger plane was pretty dangerous! Google "the de Havilland Comet". There was so much new engineering that needed to be learnt to get to the point where now it is pretty much the safest mode of transport in the world. The software industry is still building de Havilland Comets to a certain degree. So much is being learnt in terms of best practices, what works and what doesn't. If you don't constantly learn new things, you will be left behind.</li>
<li>You know less than you think. You can wield great power writing software and it can go to your head! Good engineers are humble and never think they either know it all or know better than others.</li>
<li>Stretch yourself. If you know an OOP language, learn a functional one like Elixir or Haskell. If you have spent a lot of time with a very high level language like Python, try Rust. Think of it like a gym. The machine you cant stand the site of is probably the one doing you the most good.</li>
<li>It is an art as well as a science. There is room for beauty and elegance in software.</li>

  <div><p>I sort of feel swamped by things that I don't know, almost to the point of paralysis.</p></div><div><p>I'm new to Ruby on Rails and know that there is a huge ocean of knowledge that I could keep swimming in, but then again I'm competent enough to build this reasonably functioning Taaalk website. I look at React, which might help me get a job, and unlike with Rails, I know none of that currently. And then there are tangential things, for example improving my git skills.</p></div><div><p>It feels confusing, especially without a job where problems to solve aren't put in your plate. And it feels confusing because I can doÂ&nbsp;<em>enough to create</em>. I could probably build most things in my mind with Rails and a standard html.erb + scss front end... but while I would learn something, I wouldn't be learning in leaps and bounds in the same way I was when I was learning Ruby/Rails for the first time. I guess what I'm saying is that, in some ways, my ability to create is separated from my need to make drastic educational strides - so it is confusing to know what to focus on.</p></div><div><p>If you were in my shoes what would you be optimising for?

            <div><div>
  <div><p>A good rule of thumb for things like personal projects. If you want to learn something new, build the project with new tools, languages and frameworks. If you want to actually build a project, use what you know. So it depends what the point of the project is. I guess if you want to do both you have to just accept that it will take longer using whatever new shiny stuff youâ€™re using.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Tech and software engineering has always been obsessed with the new thing. People just canâ€™t help themselves! Itâ€™s fine if youâ€™re just working by yourself and playing around with a new language or framework, but if you are making those decisions on behalf of an employer with a large team, you can easily burn millions of pounds by making the wrong choice. The hard part of all this is making consistently right choices given varying contexts and requirements.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>This goes back to what I was saying about engineering. It is not just coding. Itâ€™s the ability to understand a new technology, digest what is good and bad about it, consider it subjectively and then make a decision based on all that information. Good engineers will be good at that, and will be opinionanted about it as well. Being careful and conservative when they need to be, and working on the cutting edge when it makes sense.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I would recommend not trying to do 4 new things at once. So if you want to learn Flutter or React Native, donâ€™t then something totally foreign for the backend API. Just take it one step at a time. That way you will strike a balance between the fear and excitement of learning something new, and without the admitted drudgery of knocking out features that have no interesting aspects.Â&nbsp;</p></div>

October 3, 2020 | https://jix.one/the-assembly-language-of-satisfiability/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jix.one/the-assembly-language-of-satisfiability/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently there has been a some discussion about how much practical use is seen by certain methods coming out of academia, especially those methods for which a wide practical applicability is often claimed.
Among these are techniques are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem">SAT</a> solvers, which I quite like and with which <a href="https://jix.one/project/varisat">I am also somewhat familiar</a>.
This lead to questions about how to make SAT solvers easier to use.
In this post I will give my personal perspective on that question.</p>
<p>The discussion started with <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremyjkun/status/1303057920419004416">Jeremy Kun’s post on Twitter</a>, where he asked for concrete examples where SAT solvers are used in practice.
He wrote about the responses in <a href="https://buttondown.email/j2kun/archive/whats-in-production/">his newsletter</a> and while he concedes that SAT solvers are more widely used than he initially thought, for some of the examples people responded with, he remains skeptical towards whether they really are as widely used as claimed.</p>
<p>While I don’t want to go into how widely used SAT solvers are on an absolute scale, I personally think that SAT solvers, or rather methods based on SAT solvers, have the potential to be used much more widely than they currently are.
This raises the question: what is stopping the industry from making more use of SAT solvers wherever applicable?</p>
<h2 id="are-we-bad-at-sat-solvers">Are We Bad at SAT Solvers?</h2>
<p>In his latest <a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/">newsletter</a> titled “We’re Bad at SAT Solvers”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, Hillel Wayne argues that this is a problem of usability.
SAT solvers require the input problem to be a propositional logic formula in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_normal_form">conjunctive normal form (CNF)</a>.
Apart from a few rare exception, this is not a natural way to express most problems which we want to solve using a SAT solver.
Even worse, as Hillel notes, translating problems into equivalent CNF formulas is not a straightforward process.
For a single given problem, there are often many different ways to do this.
Selecting a good approach often requires a lot of experience, some knowledge of SAT solver internals and running careful experiments.
Additionally, experience in encoding one problem domain into CNF might not translate to the problems of a different domain.</p>
<p>Even for seemingly simple constraints which are part of many problems, like counting the number of set Boolean variables, there is a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=cardinality+constraints+CNF">vast amount of literature, including recent publications,</a> detailing different trade-offs that can be made.
These trade-offs are also not just an academic concern, but can make the difference between solving a problems in seconds or giving up after running the solver for days.
Many practical problems will contain different kinds of constraints and expecting users to be familiar with the corresponding literature for each of them is certainly a barrier for wide scale adoption.</p>
<h2 id="making-sat-solvers-easier-to-use">Making SAT Solvers Easier to Use</h2>
<p>In his newsletter Hillel then wonders what it would take to make them more useful to the industry.
He does mention that the related <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories">SMT solvers</a> seem to be doing much better in this regard, and consequently have a lot more users than SAT solvers.
SMT solvers are similar to SAT solvers, but allow much more freedom in the way the input problem can be expressed.
You are not limited to Boolean variables, but also have integers, fixed-width integers, arrays and other datatypes (depending on which SMT solver you use), you have many common operations on those types and you don’t have to get your problem into a specific normal form.
All that often comes with an API that allows you to manipulate the input formula as an abstract syntax tree, which you can inspect at any time.</p>
<p>I think the observation that SMT solvers are much easier to use than SAT solvers is an important observation.
At the same time, I think it also answers his question on how an easier to use SAT solver would look like: you would get an SMT solver.</p>
<p>So why are SAT solver authors not trying to lift some of the input restrictions like requiring CNF?
Or if SMT solvers work just as well as SAT solvers, why are people still working on those hard to use SAT solvers?</p>
<p>To answer these questions we need to have a very high-level look at how SMT solvers work.
This will also allow us to understand why people working on SAT solvers tend to implicitly count all applications of SMT solvers when talking about applications of SAT.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-smt-solvers-work">How do SMT Solvers Work?</h2>
<p>For SMT solvers there are two general approaches which dominate the landscape: bit-blasting and CDCL(T). Often solvers combine these or add additional techniques on top of this, but those two techniques form the backbone of any SMT solver I’m aware of.</p>
<h3 id="bit-blasting">Bit-Blasting</h3>
<p>Bit-blasting describes the process of taking the input formula and directly encoding it into an equivalent Boolean formula in CNF, which can then be solved by a SAT solver.
This process is limited to formulas where every data type has a finite set of values, as otherwise there is no direct way to encode each variable using a finite set of Boolean variables.
Luckily, a lot of software makes use of fixed-width integers, so bit-blasting is often very effective for problems that come from all kinds of software analysis.</p>
<p>I’m aware of two SMT solvers that use bit-blasting as their main strategy, <a href="https://github.com/Boolector/boolector">Boolector</a> and <a href="https://stp.github.io/">STP</a>, both having won several awards at solver competitions.
Both of them also use stand-alone SAT solvers to solve the encoded CNF formula. Boolector offers the choice between <a href="http://fmv.jku.at/cadical/">CaDiCaL</a>, <a href="https://github.com/msoos/cryptominisat">CryptoMiniSat</a>, <a href="http://fmv.jku.at/lingeling/">Lingeling</a>, <a href="https://github.com/niklasso/minisat">Minisat</a> and <a href="http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/">Picosat</a>, of which CryptoMiniSat and Minisat are also offered by STP.</p>
<p>For bit-blasting this makes clear that we need a SAT solver as backend and that any improvement to SAT solving also translates into a corresponding improvement to SMT solvers based on this approach. They can be accurately described as additional tooling around a SAT solver, that makes it easier to use and easier to apply to a wider area of problems. This way only the authors of the SMT solver need to be aware of all the techniques for encoding problems into CNF, lifting that burden from the users.</p>
<h3 id="cdclt">CDCL(T)</h3>
<p>The other approach, CDCL(T), is slightly more complicated, but also more flexible, as it can handle input problems with variables that have an infinite domain.
In common with bit-blasting though, is that it is again based around a SAT solver.
The CDCL stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-driven_clause_learning">conflict driven clause learning</a>, which is the algorithm employed by most modern SAT solvers<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, and the T stands for the extension with certain so-called theories. A theory here is just a collection of supported non-Boolean datatypes and operations which are also allowed in the input formula.</p>
<p>To work around this in CDCL(T) we construct a Boolean formula which is a sound over-approximation of the input formula.
I’m going to gloss over a lot of details, but essentially we can do this by replacing any subterm of the formula that we cannot encode by an unconstrained variable.
This formula can then be solved by a SAT solver.
If the solver declares the formula unsatisfiable, we know that our input problem is also unsatisfiable because our approximation can only make it easier to satisfy.
If the SAT solver produces a Boolean solution to our approximated problem, we then need to check whether we can extend it to a solution to the input problem.
This is done using so-called theory solvers, which handle the non-Boolean datatypes and operations.
If they are able to extend the solution to satisfy the input problem, we are done, otherwise the theory solvers produce some data which allows us to refine our Boolean over-approximation in such a way that it better approximates the input formula.
Then the process is repeated until either the SAT solver decides the problem to be unsatisfiable or until the theory solvers produce a solution.</p>
<p>As far as I’m aware<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, most CDCL(T) solvers come with their own SAT solver, which is tightly integrated to make the interaction between theory solvers and the SAT solver as efficient as possible.
Still those integrated SAT solvers use the same techniques, the same data structures and the same algorithms as stand-alone SAT solvers.
Any improvement made to stand-alone SAT solvers will find its way into integrated SAT solvers and vice versa.</p>
<p>There are too many solvers based on this approach to list them all here, but examples are <a href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3">Z3</a>, which seems to be the most popular, or <a href="https://cvc4.github.io/">CVC4</a> which has won many awards at solver competitions.</p>
<h2 id="cnf-as-assembly-language">CNF as Assembly Language</h2>
<p>This high-level description might leave you with the impression that SMT solvers are mostly thin wrappers around a SAT solver.
This would be far from the truth.
In my description I simply focused on the part where SAT solvers are used.
Overall I think a SAT solver is a significant part of a state-of-the-art SMT solver, but the majority of necessary complexity lies elsewhere, especially for CDCL(T) based solvers.</p>
<p>I think a good analogy of the relationship between the interface offered by SAT solvers and SMT solvers is that of assembly language and high level languages.
Here Boolean CNF formulas correspond to a universal assembly language that is supported by different SAT solver implementations, much like you can get CPUs that run the same instruction set from different vendors.
Keeping this layer as simple and minimal as possible, even if that complicates manual use, helps a lot with making different implementations compatible.
This in turn leads to increased competition between solvers, which I think played an important part in the improvements we’ve seen over the years.</p>
<p>SMT solvers then allow you to effectively use a SAT solver without having to be an expert in CNF encoding.
They give you a much easier to use input language and at the same time free you from making a lot of low-level decisions that would require expert knowledge about SAT solvers.
This is very much like compilers allow you to use high level languages while freeing you from having to worry about details like e.g. instruction scheduling or register allocation.
Also these days no one would call a modern compiler a thin wrapper that produces assembly code (I hope!).</p>
<p>The analogy even extends a bit further: Sometimes for specific problems that could be solved with an SMT solver, an …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>👋 Hi, My name is Mohd Danish from INDIA &amp; I started my Indiehacker journey in January 2019. </p><p>You can find me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/mddanishyusuf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/mddanishyusuf</a> &amp; watch me how I failed &amp; success with my projects.</p><p>I really love to read good stories &amp; write true stories based on true life events. So, today I’m sharing my life experience about how I made good money with my product in less than 48 hours.</p><p>I solved 10 problems I faced with MVP &amp; launch on ProductHunt.</p><p>After all those, I build my first SAAS product that related to API called NoCodeAPI.com</p><p>NoCodeAPI - The easiest way to connect your Google Sheet, Airtable, Google Analytics, Twitter, Telegram, Open Graph API, MailChimp, 50+ application APIs without any backend.</p><p><img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2020-10-03 at 6 37 53 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9165019/94992426-9ad10900-05a7-11eb-91d9-5fff09b4f1a6.png"></p><p>I Build NoCodeAPI MVP in 20 days. Finally, launch on ProductHunt on 12th January 2020 &amp; tweeted also. Everyone was loving it &amp; this was #1 product of the day. <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/nocodeapi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.producthunt.com/posts/nocodeapi</a></p><p>My tweet got 100k+ impression &amp; 17k media views.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mddanishyusuf/status/1215947112187228161" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/mddanishyusuf/status/1215947112187228161</a></p><p>On the launch day, I got my first 3 paid customers &amp; more than 1200 signups. The launch was really successful but I learn one thing after 6 months that it’s easy to keep running a business &amp; get money from the customer pocket.</p><p>I made $2960 profit until 31-July-2020 but the growth was not good that I was expecting. But, One thing I realized that people need this product and I have to work more on market the product than develop new features.</p><p>One of my mentors told me that if you can get validate the idea &amp; people are paying for your service. Don’t give up just keep working on it and keep iterate according to what the user needs. So, I also get more confidence that Yes, this will be going to good.</p><p>Couple of things I did after that in Marketing:</p><ol start="1"><li>Made YouTube channels &amp; record videos for all the APIs. -&gt; Got Good traffic</li><li>Weekly email newsletter about new updates, integration, &amp; pricing update in the bottom -&gt; Got good conversion to paid users</li><li>Auto-mated email when free users cross API usage by 50%, 75%, &amp; 100% to upgrade plan.</li><li>Write content about the use-cases for the APIs.</li><li>Video call with the free &amp; paid customers if they need any help.</li><li>Improve the documentation part more easy &amp; simple for users.</li><li>I also keep adding one integration every week.</li></ol><p>After all these things I was able to get $850 MRR until and this was pretty great.</p><p>I see people were launching Lifetime deals and made more than 10k in 2 days.</p><p>I was working on NoCodeAPI 2.0 with a new dashboard &amp; I decide to launch a new version with 100 Lifetime deals launch offer. I was calculating that if I made this then I could be a millionaire in my country in 2 days and if I got failed then this will be a great lesson for my journey.</p><p>You guys can’t believe that I was getting mad and my heart was pumping. I was getting stripe notion on every 10 minutes. Someone bought Business Plan Lifetime subscription for $249. I was getting so excited &amp; feeling a high responsibility for the users.</p><p>And finally, the experiment was really successful &amp; I made $20,228 in less than 48 hours. I become the first solo millionaire in my country within 2 days.</p><p>It’s not about I never made that much money in my life, I sold the first product I build in Jan’2019 for $23k. The point is this money from my first SAAS product. </p><p>This all my experience with this experiment &amp; I’m seeing a huge potential with the product. I’m still working hard to make the product more mature &amp; profitable.</p><p>That's all.</p><p>I'll keep writing about my real-life experience. You can follow on twitter for the next story. <a href="https://twitter.com/mddanishyusuf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/mddanishyusuf</a></p><p>Peace.</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

		<span></span>
		<span><p>The Sound Blaster 1.0 was not the first PC sound card, but it was the first to support digital sound, two different types of sound synthesis, MIDI, and a joystick all in one card. Let’s lift the hood and examine how the card does its magic.<br>
You can follow along by <a href="https://github.com/schlae/snark-barker/blob/master/SnarkBarker.pdf">looking at the schematic here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Sound Playback</strong><br>
There are three methods a Sound Blaster card uses to play back digital audio.</p>
<p><strong>Direct DAC</strong><br>
The first is called Direct DAC and it means that the PC software has to feed the sound card each sample at just the right time. It works a lot like the parallel-port DACs that people used to build in the 80s and 90s, or like the Disney Sound Source. When you send a data byte to the sound card, it immediately changes the analog signal going into the speaker amplifier.</p>
<p>Software using this method typically sets up a periodic timer interrupt. In the interrupt handler, the new sample is calculated and then fed to the sound card for playback.</p>
<p>Although it’s a simple method, it produces extra noisy playback to due the timing jitter of the interrupt handler. Because PC interrupts are non-deterministic, the samples don’t occur at precisely the sampling rate. This timing difference means that the waveform being reproduced doesn’t match the source material, and the difference in voltage sounds like noise or hiss.</p>
<p><strong>DMA DAC</strong><br>
The other method uses the DMA (Direct Memory Access) controller on the PC motherboard to automatically send samples to the sound card. It does require a little bit more work to set up the operation.</p>
<ol>
<li>The software configures the PC’s DMA controller (historically an Intel 8237) with the source address and length. The DMA controller is set to perform a single transfer per DMA request (DREQ).</li>
<li>The Sound Blaster is configured for a particular sampling rate. It programs an internal timer to generate a DREQ signal at the sampling rate.</li>
<li>The software sends the playback command to the Sound Blaster.</li>
</ol>
<p>The next operations happen in a loop until all the samples have been played back. Notice that the software is not involved at all—just the DMA controller, the Sound Blaster, and main memory.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Sound Blaster asserts DREQ.</li>
<li>The DMA controller responds by asserting DACK (DMA Acknowledge) at the same time it places the memory address and memory chip select onto the bus. The data byte gets transferred directly from main memory into the Sound Blaster input register!</li>
<li>The Sound Blaster takes this data and sends it to the audio DAC.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, the Sound Blaster ends playback then triggers an interrupt to let the software know that it is done with playback.</p>
<p><strong>Auto-Initialize DMA DAC</strong><br>
The final method, introduced with the Sound Blaster 2.0, is very similar to the previous method, except the ending. The Sound Blaster triggers an interrupt as before, but then it reloads the sample counter to the original value and continues requesting samples from the DMA controller!</p>
<p>The usual way software uses this feature is to create a seamless digital audio stream using a double buffer. The DMA controller gets a buffer that is twice as big as the number of samples that the Sound Blaster is programmed to play back. Because of that, the interrupt gets triggered halfway through buffer playback. In the interrupt handler, the software then loads a new set of samples into the buffer half that has already been played. When playback hits the end of the DMA buffer, the interrupt triggers again, only this time the software refills the last half of the DMA buffer. The DMA controller then wraps around to the beginning of the buffer and playback continues unbroken.</p>
<p>One of the side effects of this approach is that if the software crashes, the DMA controller and sound card continue to play back the sample buffer in a loop. You may have heard this when playing old DOS games back in the day.</p>
<p><strong>Sound Recording</strong><br>
This works in very much the same way as playback including the Direct mode, DMA mode, and Auto-Init DMA modes, except data gets transferred in the opposite direction, from the sound card into main memory.</p>
<p>One interesting wrinkle is that the Sound Blaster doesn’t actually have a proper ADC (analog-to-digital converter)! Instead it uses a clever circuit and an algorithm to accomplish the same thing:</p>
<ol>
<li>An input filter processes the incoming sound to smooth out any high frequency transients. This is common practice, even with an ADC, to help prevent sampling-induced aliasing, but it it’s helpful for making the trick work.</li>
<li>A comparator looks at the difference between the audio DAC and the incoming signal. The output of the comparator is only one bit; it can only tell if the incoming signal is greater than or less than the setting of the audio DAC.</li>
<li>The DSP starts the audio DAC at the halfway point, then looks at the comparator output. The comparator output gets recorded as the most significant bit of the audio sample.</li>
<li>Depending on the bit, the DSP sets the audio DAC up or down half again—either 25% or 75%.</li>
<li>The DSP repeats steps 3 and 4, going halfway again and again until it’s obtained the 8 bits of a complete sample.</li>
</ol>
<p>This technique is known as successive approximation, and it’s a technique used in many ADC chips. The code looks something like this:<br>
<code><br>
mov	p1,#80h		; Start DAC at the halfway point, 1000 0000<br>
mov	c,t1			; 1 Put comparator output into carry bit<br>
mov	p1.7,c			; 2 If greater, then leave MSB as is. If less, clear MSB<br>
setb	p1.6			; 1 Set DAC to upper or lower halfway point<br>
mov	c,t1			; 1 Check comparator output again<br>
mov	p1.6,c			; 2 Rinse and repeat<br>
setb	p1.5<br>
mov	c,t1<br>
mov	p1.5,c<br>
setb	p1.4<br>
mov	c,t1<br>
mov	p1.4,c<br>
setb	p1.3<br>
mov	c,t1<br>
mov	p1.3,c<br>
setb	p1.2<br>
mov	c,t1<br>
mov	p1.2,c<br>
setb	p1.1<br>
mov	c,t1<br>
mov	p1.1,c<br>
setb	p1.0<br>
mov	c,t1<br>
mov	p1.0,c<br>
mov	a,p1			; We are done, copy DAC code into accumulator.</code></p>
<p><strong>The Hardware, Section By Section</strong></p>
<p><strong>Address Decoder</strong><br>
The address decoder takes the I/O port address off the ISA bus and looks for accesses at 210h, 220h, 230h, 240h, 250h, or 260h depending on the jumper setting. It also looks for 388h and 389h so that it can make the Yamaha OPL2 chip appear there for Adlib compatibility. It also decodes 0x200-207h as the joystick port (each address is actually the same).</p>
<p><a href="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/address-decoder.png"><img src="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/address-decoder.png" alt="" width="490" height="177"></a></p>
<p>A jumper, JP1, can be pulled to shut off the PC joystick port. The MIDI function still works, however. Many combo-IO boards came with a built-in joystick port so the one on the Sound Blaster may not always be needed.</p>
<p><strong>Reset Circuit</strong><br>
It’s important to make sure the card powers up in a good state without generating spurious noises, so the SB uses the ISA RESET signal to clear the OPL2, the CMS chips, the joystick one-shot, and basically all of the other internal state latches.</p>
<p><a href="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/reset.png"><img src="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/reset.png" alt="" width="496" height="159"></a></p>
<p>There is also an IO port that, if you write a 1 to it, resets the DSP and its associated bus interface. (You also have to write a 0 to it afterwards to allow the DSP to start operating.) Later versions of the DSP require this to exit high speed auto-init DMA mode, since in this mode, the DSP devotes 100% CPU to servicing DMA requests.</p>
<p><strong>DSP</strong><br>
The core of the digital sound capabilities of the Sound Blaster is the Digital Sound Processor, or DSP for short. It’s not actually a Digital Signal Processor in the traditional sense—it’s just an 8051 microcontroller with custom firmware.</p>
<p>The DSP also handles MIDI transmit and receive using the 8051’s built-in UART.</p>
<p><strong>DSP Bus Interface</strong><br>
The bus interface allows the host PC to talk to the DSP. It uses two unidirectional 8-bit registers as a “mailbox,” temporary holding areas for a single data byte. One is for PC-to-DSP communications, and the other is for DSP-to-PC communications. There are also two data flip flops that are used to signal when data is available in one of the registers.</p>
<p><a href="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mailbox.png"><img src="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mailbox.png" alt="" width="349" height="362"></a></p>
<p>When the PC sends data to the DSP (I/O port 2XCh), the data gets stored in an 8-bit register and the flip-flop is automatically set high (DAV_DSP).</p>
<p>When the DSP reads the register, the flip-flop gets cleared automatically.</p>
<p>When the DSP sends data to the PC, the data goes into the other 8-bit register and the other flip-flop automatically gets set (DAV_PC). The PC can check this bit by reading from I/O port 2XEh. When it reads from I/O port 2XAh, it receives the byte of data and the flip-flop automatically gets cleared. The DSP can see that the PC has read the byte by checking the DAV_PC input. The DSP often checks this pin to make sure the PC has read a data byte before writing a new data byte to the register, otherwise the byte in the register will be lost before the PC has a chance to read it.</p>
<p><a href="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/data-flags.png"><img src="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/data-flags.png" alt="" width="441" height="355"></a></p>
<p><strong>Interrupts</strong><br>
When the DSP is done with a particular (often lengthy) task, it can signal the host PC by asserting the interrupt line. It does this by pulsing IREQUEST which triggers a flip-flop that asserts the IRQ line on the PC bus. On the host PC, the interrupt handler is supposed to clear the interrupt by reading from I/O port 2XEh. This simply clears the flip-flop which then deasserts the IRQ line.</p>
<p><a href="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/interrupt-flag.png"><img src="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/interrupt-flag.png" alt="" width="426" height="281"></a></p>
<p><strong>DMA</strong><br>
When the DSP needs a new sample from the PC (or needs to transfer a new sample to the PC during record mode), it pulses the DREQUEST line. Note that the DSP also needs to enable DMA by asserting its DMA_EN# line. When DREQUEST pulses, it causes the DMA request flip-flop to output a 1 on the DRQ1 line. The PC’s DMA controller responds by asserting DACK1#, which clears the flip-flop. DACK1# also bypasses the address decode logic of the Sound Blaster and forces it to either accept data from or place data on the ISA bus lines. This data transfer happens between the ISA bus and the mailbox registers.</p>
<p><a href="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dma-flag.png"><img src="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dma-flag.png" alt="" width="527" height="170"></a></p>
<p><strong>Digital Audio Output</strong><br>
An 8-bit DAC connected to the 8051 generates an analog current corresponding with the digital code on its inputs. A current-to-voltage converter (U5C) changes the current into a voltage that is used by the rest of the circuit. This voltage goes through an antialiasing filter which removes distinctive- and ugly-sounding artifacts from the audio signal. U5A implements this filter using a Sallen-Key design. The filter cutoff frequency is about 4KHz, …</p></span></p></div></div>

                    <p>With today's zero or negative real interest rates, deciding what to do with your cash and short term savings has never been harder.</p><p>Savings accounts at major banks have paid close to 0% for nearly a decade, but now even online banks, credit unions and cash accounts from fintech startups pay 0.6% at best. CDs, "high yield" checking, and money market accounts are no better and come with even more restrictions. Treasuries? 1 month and 1 year T-Bills <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=billrates">also pay near zero</a>. Bond funds? Expense ratios, changing prices, default risk and minimums make these too complicated for the typical saver. What about peer-to-peer lending sites like Lending Club? These generate what seem like good returns, but it's hard to overstate the risk. You're making loans to people or businesses that didn't qualify for a loan from a traditional lender.</p><p>After exhausting all these options, you might just give up and decide to play the lottery with your savings. Since 1956, the UK government has offered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premium_Bond">Premium Bonds</a>, where interest for bond holders is determined by lottery. This gamified experience is one of the top savings vehicles in the UK, where about <a href="https://nsandi-corporate.com/media-resources/premium-bonds-factsheet">one third of citizens hold bonds valued in total at over $100 billion</a>. A startup named <a href="https://www.withyotta.com/">Yotta</a> just graduated from <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies?batch=S20">Y Combinator's Summer 2020</a> batch to launch a similar business in the US, and <a href="https://www.pooltogether.com/">PoolTogether</a> raised a <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pooltogether/company_financials">seed round</a> led by <a href="https://www.ideocolab.com/ventures/">IDEO Colab Ventures</a> early this year for a blockchain-based version. Of course, these models are based on lotteries. They're gambling. Most people receive nothing, and any expected value calculation would tell you this game is not worth playing.</p><p>Are savings options so bad that people would rather gamble for the remote chance of winning some interest than even be bothered with a traditional savings vehicle?</p><p>Why have rates been so low for so long? Is there any end in sight?</p><h2 id="age-of-abundance">Age of Abundance</h2><p>Technology and digitization are driving incredible improvements in global quality of life, moving the world from an era of scarcity into an era of abundance. </p><p>Thirty years ago, finding an answer meant going to the library to read some books or asking people you knew. As of 2016, Google had indexed <a href="https://searchengineland.com/googles-search-indexes-hits-130-trillion-pages-documents-263378">130 trillion web pages</a>, providing instant answers to anything for everybody. Information is no longer scarce, and what's now scarce is matching the best answer to a question. Alex Danco calls this <a href="https://alexdanco.com/2019/09/07/positional-scarcity/">positional scarcity</a>.</p><p>Similar technology-driven processes of commoditizing supply and aggregating demand are playing out in industry after industry, giving rise to natural super-monopolies. Amazon has done this first in books, then in all retail. Netflix has done this in entertainment, Airbnb in accommodation, iTunes and Spotify in music, Facebook in your personal life, and Linkedin in your business life. The list goes on and on, and this software eats world process is still in the early innings.</p><p>The dark side to all this abundance is that technology is generating a Moore's law fueled deflationary cycle. Technology gives you more for less. This, by definition, is deflation. The faster technology spreads throughout the economy, the more deflationary pressure there is. In 2009, Microsoft was the only technology company in the top ten S&amp;P 500 companies by market cap. In 2019, the top five companies in the S&amp;P 500 by market cap were all technology companies. Humans, by nature, find it extremely difficult to see and understand exponential growth even when it is happening right in front of them.</p><p>If you want to test if you have a good feel for exponential growth, <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBooth">Jeff Booth</a> in his book the <a href="https://amzn.to/3460StR">Price of Tomorrow</a>, asks a simple question. He says "Imagine if I fold a piece of paper on itself fifty times. (I can only fold it seven times before it resists too much, but let’s assume for the moment that I can keep folding it up to fifty times.) How thick would the piece of paper be on fold fifty?"</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I've never met anyone with a gut feel for exponential growth. You always have to calculate it. But everyone in the startup world at least knows never to turn their back on it.</p>— Paul Graham (@paulg) <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1235250332936081408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 4, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Most people give an answer of a few inches, and on rare occasions Jeff says he hears "to the ceiling" unless someone has heard the question before. The correct answer is that on fold fifty the paper would reach all the way to the sun (93 million miles).</p><p>But getting more for less seems great, right? What's the problem?</p><p>Consumer spending accounts for 70% of the US economy, and therefore growing the economy is heavily dependent on increasing consumer spending. But a steadily increasing deflationary force pushes consumers to spend less. And to get consumers to spend more, central banks lower interest rates to make borrowing cheap. This is why global debt has doubled over the last ten years.</p><p>In past situations, lower interest rates led to increased consumer spending which led to inflation, steadily decreasing consumer debt burdens. This is why the Fed has an inflation target of 2%. The US economy is built on credit and assumes a steady low level of inflation to work properly. But with strong <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/fiscal-and-monetary-policy/">deflationary pressure</a>, inflation has proven elusive. </p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-4.png 600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/image-4.png 829w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>What happens in an economy experiencing deflation? The cost of debt in real terms increases and there is downward pressure on wages. This means your mortgage or rent payment gets steadily more expensive in real terms at the same time that layoffs and unemployment increase because employees also get steadily more expensive (and don't respond well wages cut). The higher the debt level, the worse this situation is. And global debt levels have never been higher.</p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/image-6.png" alt=""></figure><p>Left unchecked, this results in large-scale social unrest, populism, or worse. This explains why interest rates have been steadily decreasing for years and why the Fed has signaled <a href="https://twitter.com/BloombergTV/status/1306332101680287744">they will keep interest rates at zero until at least 2023</a>. And because zero interest rates are no longer sufficient to encourage enough new borrowing and spending, it's why Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in March that there is <a href="https://twitter.com/todayshow/status/1243133507859292160?lang=en">no limit to the amount of money the Fed is willing to put into the economy to keep it afloat</a>. The Fed continues to massively expand the supply of US dollars.</p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-5.png 600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-5.png 1000w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/image-5.png 1600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/image-5.png 2332w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Understanding the fight between the exponential force of technology driven deflation and the inflationary forces of low interest rates and massive expansion of the money supply is important to understanding what is likely to happen to the future for interest rates and the yield on savings vehicles. With every doubling in the exponential spread of technology, deflation is harder and harder for governments and central banks to counter-act. This is a massive problem, but we'll leave that for another day. For our purposes related to savings, what's clear is that zero yield is probably here to stay.</p><p>Is there nothing we can do to save savings? It seems unreasonable to receive no compensation for letting someone borrow your savings. And even worse to have to pay for the privilege.</p><p>Savings accounts seem rather boring, like a long forgotten banking backwater. But what if we were to reimagine the savings account for the software century? Could we redesign them from first principles for the age of abundance? Could we unbundle them from the bank, strip out their costs, give them full transparency, and generally make them 10x better?</p><p>Let's try.</p><h2 id="can-software-save-savings">Can software save savings?</h2><p>Before we start, let's make sure we understand the problem we're solving.

<li>From bank run or default (e.g. FDIC insurance)</li>

<li>Provide compensation for the use of your money</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>As you look at these jobs to be done, can you identify a customer-first focus in how banks have prioritized them or what they have optimized for other than enriching themselves? I can't. Banks might pat themselves on the back for adding mobile account access or mobile check deposit, but the truth is that savings products have scarcely changed in decades, have evolved by incrementalism, and have never had a bottoms-up re-assessment. It reminds me of the wireless industry before the iPhone.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>If we took a customer-first focus to re-imagining the savings vehicle, what jobs would we optimize for?

<li><strong>Reasonable preservation of principal.</strong> Most savers need their money over the next year.</li>
<li><strong>Safety from theft, loss or default.</strong> Savers need to have confidence that their savings won't be stolen, lost or defaulted on by an insolvent institution.</li>
<li><strong>Electronic withdrawals.</strong> Let's assume customers have a checking account elsewhere so we can focus solely on ACH and internal transfers.</li>
<li><strong>Electronic deposits.</strong> …</li></ol></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>The French language</strong> offers two ways of speaking about freedom: <em>libre arbitre</em> means â€˜free will;â€™ <em>volontÃ©</em> means â€˜the willâ€™ or, better, â€˜volitionâ€™. Each carries with it distinct conceptual baggage. On the one hand, we exercise free will when making a choice. For volition, on the other hand, our freedom amounts to an exertion of effort. One is intellectual; the other laborious. Although you could get away with using either in everyday conversation, the choice of one term rather than the other is consequential. Indeed, the history of this semantic rift spills beyond the French language. It reveals a fissure at the core of what it means to author oneâ€™s own life story.</p>
<p>Two hundred years ago, disputes over the nature of freedom were all-consuming in France. Thatâ€™s not only because political upheavals rocked the 19th century. In the wake of the 1789 French Revolution, men and women experienced radical democracies, military dictatorships, resurgent monarchies and constitutional republics â€“ a living exercise in political science during which questions of <em>libertÃ©</em> (another term for â€˜freedomâ€™) preoccupied national debates.</p>
<p>A scientific revolution also ignited beyond the Palace of Versailles, setting the fates of free will and volition on a collision course. The rise of psychology and neurology threw into disarray the terms with which people made sense of their selfhood. By the beginning of the 20th century, the young sciences showed how freedom involves our entire bodies; indeed, it penetrates far deeper into our being than mere choice.</p>
<p>The philosopher and psychologist Maine de Biran (1766-1824) led the vanguard. During a long political career, from the court of Louis XVI to the lower house of parliament â€“ an institution created after the brothers of the executed king took over the throne in 1815 â€“ Biran used his influence to gather the foremost French scientists. They studied the mind as part of the body. At a time when the nervous systemâ€™s workings were only beginning to be understood, the gatherings were, for some, an occasion to dispel freedom as an illusion. Emblematic was the physiologist Pierre-Jean-George Cabanis (1757-1808) who claimed that â€˜The brain secretes thought like the liver secretes bile.â€™ Material enquiry, and not the abstract notion of free will, was to explain our agency.</p>
<p>Biran saw the fledgling brain sciences otherwise. In his work <em>The Influence of Habit on the Faculty of Thinking</em> (1802), Biran showed how our freedom hinges on volition, which canâ€™t be easily confined to the space between our ears. Materialist scientists tilted at windmills, so Biran charged. The idea of free will is a fiction because our freedom needs friction.</p>
<p>Biranâ€™s insight was that our nervous system is not a cause of volition but its constraint. In putting our body to use, we exert effort and encounter resistance. The play between the two â€“ their modulation over time â€“ gives rise to habits. According to Biran, habit follows a double law: â€˜the less we feel, the more we perceiveâ€™. Before I studied the French language, the silent consonants and serous liaisons struck my ears like an indistinguishable mÃ©lange. By focusing on individual words, contorting my tongue and taking risks to speak, I eventually came to inhabit the language. Thanks to my sustained volition, a cacophony of foreign sounds eventually gave way to meaningful speech. For Biran, the paradigmatic habit is self-education.</p>
<p>His book overthrew the longstanding view that habit is blind repetition. RenÃ© Descartes and Immanuel Kant had condemned habits as mechanical routines. They cloud clear judgment. For Biran, however, the discrete decisions of our free will matter less than the direction of our volition over time. And as habits take over, new resistance mounts. My patterns of thought and verbal crutches take the place of intentional speech. When I find myself lost in conversation at a cocktail party, <em>voilÃ&nbsp;</em> rolls off my tongue instinctively whenever I feel itâ€™s time to wrap up. Habits open an opportunity to renew our efforts and overcome the resistance that takes over within us.</p>
<p><strong>In the 19th century</strong>, psychology and politics revolved in the same orbit. Uprisings sought to replace old monarchical habits with new democratic ones. Biran, however, was no democrat. He applauded NapolÃ©onâ€™s brief return from exile in 1815. The French deserved an emperor who would strengthen peopleâ€™s volition, which had been weakened by the unruly sentiments of popular sovereignty. Biranâ€™s vision of selfhood was as consistent as his politics was lamentable, tethered as it was to an enduring aristocratic disposition.</p>
<p>Bergson adapted Biranâ€™s insight for a modern world ruled by numbers: choices touch only the shallows of our selfhood</p>
<p>In the eyes of European liberals, the new social orderâ€™s success hinged on a different form of freedom â€“ free will. Universal male suffrage and market economies, both established with yet another French revolution in 1848, introduced novel decision-making capacities. The prolific polymath Charles Renouvier (1815-1903) argued that citizensâ€™ <em>libre arbitre</em> usurped the reign of God and monarch. We occupy the role of judge (following the Latin, <em>arbitrium</em>) who renders a decision, as it were, in the court of the mind. To act with a free will, we â€˜place the government of our innermost spirit in the hands of a single ideaâ€™. Renouvier spent the decade of 1854-64 writing his <em>Essays of General Critique</em>, a project to translate the individual will into the driving force of national regeneration. Government would thereby find its legitimacy in the voluntary consent of citizens.</p>
<p>National regeneration was the chief <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/w/wsfh/0642292.0042.015/--brain-in-the-third-republic-science-pedagogy-and-national?rgn=main;view=fulltext" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">goal</a> of the Third Republic, which reinvigorated disputes between free will and volition. It was the longest democratic regime in the countryâ€™s history, lasting from 1870 to the Nazi occupation in 1940. Following its inception, investment in science was a national priority. Fidelity to the <em>patrie</em> was to be not only free but also rational.</p>
<p>When the first experimental psychology laboratories broke ground in the 1880s, their focus was psychometrics. Reaction time experiments allowed researchers to track the time of thinking, feeling and willing. They ranged between .1 and .3 seconds (the time from the reception of stimuli in the brain to the movement of a limb). The mathematical revolution in the study of mind also set in motion projects to scale intellectual aptitude â€“ Alfred Binet (1857-1911) released the first IQ measure in 1905 â€“ and to rationalise colonial conquests of â€˜uncivilisedâ€™ people in West Africa and Indochina. A trenchant materialism characterised the <em>fin de siÃ¨cle</em>, a period during which faith in numbers drove projects to hierarchise human freedom.</p>
<p>Critics returned to Biranâ€™s ideas. For Alfred FouillÃ©e (1838-1912), quantitative psychology demonstrated that thoughts constitute powerful motor actions â€“ what he called <em>idea-forces.</em> Their duration fluctuates with the obstacles we confront. In documenting the time taken to make decisions, experimental research didnâ€™t make freedom predictable so much as it laid to rest the idea of unencumbered free will. Such was the case in liberal politics as well: our choices (left or right, buy or sell) reflect the surface of our freedom. Deeper, FouillÃ©e believed, was a fleshly understanding of volition entangled with the bodyâ€™s sensory-motor coordination.</p>
<p>The philosopher Henri Bergson (1859-1941) went a step further. In an <em>oeuvre</em> that was awarded the 1927 Nobel Prize in Literature, Bergson showed how we experience the world as a <em>lived duration</em>. As he saw it, psychometrics recorded the trace left by our volition, much like a marathonâ€™s final standings indicate when runners pass the finish line. Within the flow of time, however, our freedom fluctuates between exertions of energy and effortless passivity. When I reflect inward on the life I live, I notice discrete decisions: the choice of college majors, career paths and romantic partners. When I probe deeper, the volition shaping my self comes into view â€“ that is, the kind of person I continuously strive to become â€“ and with it the constraints that have lent traction to my creativity. Bergson adapted Biranâ€™s insight for a modern world ruled by numbers: choices touch only the shallows of our selfhood.</p>
<p>Today, choice-making is central to economic forecasting, political analysis and psychological testing. Market data and survey metrics aggregate our collective decisions. Although our world is distant from that of France a century ago, the countryâ€™s thinkers offer an enduring reminder that our aspirations for freedom do not amount to one thing. Do we seek more choices? Or do we strive to resist the sediments of time â€“ that is, to make our selfhood anew?</p></div></div></div>]]>

        <p>Reviewing papers is a central source of diversion, confusion, joy, and
other feelings for many academics. Much has already been written about
how to structure a review, how to phrase criticism kindly, etc. But in
this brief post I want to point out that the <em>mindset</em> behind a review
is absolutely crucial for writing a useful and constructive review. My
core philosophy can be summarised as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When reviewing a paper, you are primarily a <em>midwife</em> for the paper,
not a <em>gatekeeper</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me expand on this: it seems that many people consider their review
duties to be akin to that of the Night’s Watch. But this is altogether
the wrong approach for me. As reviewers, we are <em>not</em> the last line of
defence that protects our community from ‘improper’ research—may
it sound ever so romantic. I fully understand where this feeling comes
from: certainly, there <em>are</em> researchers that act in bad faith and try
to publish something they <em>know</em> is wrong. However, my issue with this
perspective is that it aligns itself along a low-prevalence event. The
common researcher does not have malicious intentions. If they <em>had</em> it
would be almost impossible to have any sort of scientific progress! So
rather than seeing ourselves as ‘protectors of the realm’, each one of
us should see themselves as the <em>midwife</em> of a paper: our <strong>ultimate</strong>
goal—not necessarily our <em>immediate</em> one—should be to help
the research get published eventually. Of course, the paper may not be
up to the standards of a certain conference. That’s fair. That happens
to all of us. But we should make sure that we are willing to cooperate
with the authors<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> to ensure that the research sees the light of day
at some point in time.</p>
<p>If we write reviews with <em>this</em> mindset, our statements will be imbued
with the proper spirit, making it possible to criticise constructively
in all situations.</p>
<p>To some extent, this mindset can also be used in other contexts. Code,
for example, should also be reviewed with a midwife mindset—even
though there may be more reasons to reject pull requests.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> However,
even in these contexts, try to be a supporter, instead of a preventer.</p>
<p>In short: <em>do not be a gatekeeper, be a midwife.</em></p>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Of course, cooperation goes both ways, and we cannot protect ourselves against ‘bad faith’ authors. I would argue that these cases are rare. If they are <em>not</em> rare, it might be a sign of a dysfunctional community or system, but handling these cases is beyond the scope of this post. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>For example, <em>feature creep</em> is an issue of code bases that does not necessarily have an equivalent in the scientific community. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<!--
SYNOPSIS:		Background Information on Downloading and Installing Software from Sourcecode on Open-source Operating Systems
PREREQUISITES:		None
-->



<p>This document is intended for users of open-source operating systems who wish to install software direct from the original authors, rather than relying solely on the software (and versions) provided by their operating system. It is written for those who are not familiar with the concept of downloading software in source-code form, providing background information about relevant commands and the process in general.</p>



<ul>
  <li>Development and distribution: independent software developers, multi-os support, releases (archives), version-control</li>
  <li>Distributions: binary packages and package-managers</li>
  <li>Downloading: http, ftp, wget, checksums and signatures</li>
  <li>Archive files: tar, zip, gzip</li>
  <li>Common files: README and INSTALL; required dependencies</li>
  <li>Patching with sed/awk/patch</li>
  <li>Building and Installing: configure, make, cmake, perl and python</li>
  <li>Building and Installing Documentation</li>
  <li>Compiler settings and stripping; handing errors</li>
  <li>Post-installation</li>
</ul>



<p>A typical operating system consists of hundreds of different applications. In a proprietary operating system, the producer/seller of that operating system typically owns and manages the development of all that software. However open-source systems are usually created by obtaining and integrating applications invented and maintained by many independent groups - or even single independent developers. In addition, an open-source software project is often used in a variety of different operating systems - eg Linux-based, BSD-based, Hurd, and sometimes even integrated into proprietary operating systems such as Solaris, Mac, even Windows (if the licence allows).</p>

<p>The original software developers are sometimes referred to by distribution maintainers and end-users as the <em>upstream source</em> or simply <em>upstream</em>. Similarly, the developers often refer to the distributions that use their code, or the end-users as <em>downstream</em>.</p>

<p>Most open-source projects store their source code in a version-control system which is accessible over the internet (read-only for anonymous users). For such projects it is possible to download the very latest “in-progress” files, or to download the set of files “tagged” with some release-id (version number). However it is often not very efficient to do this; projects usually make regular <em>releases</em> by creating an <em>archive file</em> containing all the relevant files and make it available for download. For projects that do not have a public version-control system, such periodically released <em>archive files</em> are the only way to obtain the sourcecode directly.</p>



<p>There are many <em>operating system distributions</em> which do the work of finding, downloading and tweaking all the most-commonly used software packages. Several also compile it, and make the binary-form results available. There are many benefits, including quicker installation, one location to <em>find</em> relevant software, and particularly a supply of relevant <em>security patches</em>: the distribution maintainers watch for security updates and make it easy for end users to notice and install them.</p>

<p>However such distributions often don’t include the very latest version of software; if you need a newer version than the one provided by your distribution then it may be necessary to build it yourself.  Software is also often very customisable at install-time, particularly with the ability to omit features that are not needed. Because a distribution needs to keep a wide range of users happy, they tend to include <em>every</em> feature in the compiled applications they distribute; you as the end-user may be able to tune an application better by compiling it yourself.</p>

<p>Distributions generally include a <em>package manager</em> that keeps a database of which software is installed. It isn’t a good idea to go changing the software on a machine “behind the back” of the package manager; all sorts of odd behaviour could occur later. If your distribution has a package manager, then please read this document for background information - but then consult the documentation for your distribution to find out how to install software without confusing your package manager. Usually this involves writing a <em>package specification</em> that describes the software and then using the local package manager to compile and install the software. This applies to all distributions with package-managers, regardless of whether applications are distributed in binary (pre-compiled) or source-code form.</p>



<p>The usual way to download an archive file is by using a web-browser and clicking on a “download” button, clicking a link, or right-clicking a link and selecting “save as”. This downloads the file using the “http” protocol. Some sites instead make files available via the older “ftp” protocol. Many web-browsers support this too, ie clicking a link can also work here. Alternately, there are ftp client applications.</p>

<p>The “wget” or “curl” command-line application can also be used under unix-like operating systems to fetch a file via http or ftp when the correct URL is known.</p>

<p>Sites which publish software that is very frequently downloaded often have “mirror” sites set up, ie helpful people keep <em>copies</em> of the files in various places around the world. The original site usually has a list of the available <em>mirrors</em>, and you should choose one that is near to you. This helps reduce the cost of network bandwidth on the original publisher, and usually also lets you download faster.</p>

<p>Both the “http” and “ftp” network protocols can be intercepted by criminals or other undesirable parties who can then modify data as it downloads. Data can also potentially be corrupted by accident while underway (though this is not common). And when using a mirror-site, it is possible that someone has modified the files there (ie that the files on the mirror are not the same as those from the original publisher).  It is therefore a good idea to <em>verify</em> that what you downloaded is what the original publisher intended.</p>

<p>Many sites provide an <em>md5sum</em> file for each archive file, which holds a <em>checksum</em> of the contents of the file; sometimes a single <em>md5sums</em> file holds checksums for a number of other files. You should always obtain an md5sums file from the <em>original site</em>, never a mirror. And you should download it via the secure <em>https</em> protocol if possible. The unix <code>md5sum</code> commandline tool can then be used to compute the checksum of the big archive file, and compare it to the expected values to ensure the contents are as expected.</p>

<p>To compute the sum of a single file:</p>

<pre><code>   md5sum file-to-check
</code></pre>

<p>and “by hand” verify the output of this application against the expected value. If the value is in a webpage, you can open the “find” dialog on that page and copy-and-paste the value output by the md5sum program. The “find” will match only if the values are the same.</p>

<p>If the software provider provides an md5sums file which has a list of (filename, checksum) pairs, then you can run:</p>

<pre><code>   md5sum -c md5sums-file
</code></pre>

<p>which will look in your local system for every file listed in the md5sums-file, compute its checksum, and report an error if it is not the expected value.</p>

<p>Some software providers <em>sign</em> archive files instead of (or as well as) providing an md5 checksum. In this case you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>download the provider’s <em>public key</em> from their website (using https where possible)</li>
  <li>download the “signature file” for the archive-file; this will be a small file which has the same base name as the downloaded file, with suffix “.sig” or “.asc”</li>
  <li>perform the following steps</li>
</ul>

<pre><code># needed only once for each key, ie each "publisher"
gpg --import {public-key}

gpg --verify {signature-file-name}
</code></pre>

<p>The verify step decrypts the signature-file, revealing a checksum; it then runs a checksum algorithm over the real file and checks that they are the same. Obviously, the “gpg” application needs to be installed locally.</p>



<p>An <em>archive</em> is a single file that contains within it a number of other files. There are several different tools for creating such files but in all cases the process is effectively to append all the individual files together, and then add an “index” which contains the offset, length, name and other properties of the original files so that they can be extracted again.</p>

<p>Note: the word “archive” in English can imply something “old”, no longer used, or a “backup” copy. While archive files can be used to store backups or rarely used data, they are also convenient for passing data around a network.</p>

<p>The  “tar” application packs multiple files into a single “tar-format” archive file, which is the most commonly-used format in open-source. Tar originally meant “tape archive”, but the format works well on disks too. Tar archives remember not only the original names of files, but also their original Unix “owner id” and file-permissions. The ownerid is seldom useful (unless the tar archive was created on the same machine it is being unpacked on), but the file-permissions are. By convention, tar-format files are usually given names ending in “.tar”. Tar-format files containing sourcecode are sometimes referred to as “tarballs”.</p>

<p>The tar application doesn’t compress the file contents. However source-code files do compress very well and network bandwidth is always too slow and too expensive, so tar files are usually <em>compressed</em> after creation, using a generic compression application. The most commonly used compression type is “gzip”, and the resulting file is usually given the suffix “.tar.gz” or “.tgz”. Compression with bzip2 is also common, and such files are usually given the suffix “.tar.bz2”. Occasionally “xz” compression will be used; files are usually given the suffix “.tar.xz”.</p>

<p>The original version of the tar application was created a long time ago, and it has been reimplemented a number of times. Sadly this means that the commandline options available vary considerably depending on which version of the application you are using. The functionality also varies depending on version; in particular some versions can auto-detect when compression has been used, and decompress automatically …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="blog-page"><div><div><div><article><div><div><h2>Vets Who Code: What, Where, And How to Help</h2></div><p>When I started this journey&nbsp;<span>SIX</span>&nbsp;years ago, I just wanted to create an affordable solution for veterans to transition into the workforce as fast as they can without the hurdles of civilian life of trying to find a code school that accepts the GI Bill. I didn’t want my fellow troops in transition to fall through the cracks, like I did.</p><p>That’s why I went into the nonprofit sector in the first place. I wanted to help my brothers and sisters. What I found was a system designed, not to help them, but, to get as much money out of donors, sponsors and government agencies as possible by telling the story of how the nation fails our servicemen and women; all the while creating extremely high requirements, yet, having extremely low benchmarks for success. Did you know that unless you are actually sleeping on the streets in some states you aren’t considered homeless? Meaning, if you are living out of your car, living out of a hotel room, or couch-surfing, you don’t qualify for certain support services.</p><p>I should know — I’ve had the great displeasure of doing all three. Despite the adversity, perseverance enabled me to climb out of the darkness, with a deep desire to keep other veterans from falling into the abyss. Thinking back, that was the hardest six months of my life! It was development and design that helped me get through those tough times, not the current nonprofit sector filled with relics that have cozy relationships all the while doing the minimum.</p><p>I spent every waking moment learning skills that other people were either too stubborn or just too fearful to learn, and it added value to me — value the civilian sector could understand. Then, when a fallen soldier’s family needed help, my newly minted value empowered me to answer the call to bury a brother. Afterwards, I was like “what do I do next?” — leading to the stupid idea of turning something old (a freaking castle!) into something new, repurposing it to retrain veterans in real and digital skillsets. Unfortunately that didn’t work. But, out of it came true inspiration, something revamped, brilliant, and functional — something I hope would even make David Heinemeier Hansson (my hero) proud.</p><p><span>What is Vets Who Code?</span></p><p>Vets Who Code is a veteran founded, lead and operated 501(c)(3) distributed charitable non-profit, dedicated to filling the wide chasm between technical expertise needed and available with transitioning veterans and active duty military spouses through software development training and education. We utilize our distributed model for the capability to train veterans anywhere, but we are so much more. We are a team of people with hybrid tech skills and a lean mentality, focused on helping veterans not only learn how to program, but get jobs in the field and to do it without the unnecessary bloat that other nonprofits take on. From UX and DevOPs engineers to little old me, who got thrown into this because I simply wanted to help my fellow veterans, which is the most important part of this nonprofit. Currently 80% of the team is veterans, and we provide what you need to surpass our successes and learn from our mistakes. ’Cause if we are to celebrate this thing called life, we need to be there together.</p><p><span>Why Code?</span></p><p>Great question. Right now our country has a problem: we have programming jobs, but not enough programmers. Not only that, we don’t have enough GOOD programmers. On top of that, while it’s definitely better, veterans are still the highest unemployed demographic in America. So we had this crazy idea. What if we created a vetted curriculum designed around modern technologies? Not just any veterans, those who this skill could really impact. Not only that, let’s work tirelessly to mentor them in professional standards of code, business, and design. Can you imagine how much better you get at design thinking when the guy speaking has been thinking about it every day for the last 15 years? We then thought, what if we added tools to continue learning after you’ve dealt with us for 15 weeks? Our partners like Frontend Masters and Google Cloud give us amazing tools to gift the veterans so that they can learn and prep for up to a year. Not only that — we make introductions, and train them in the interview process to help them get jobs in the industry. You know what? It works. Our troops have been getting highly paid positions, and we couldn’t be happier. Here we empower amazing people to have the lifestyle they have earned, and we do it all online; a feat that wasn’t even possible 10 years ago.</p><p><span>How Can You Help?</span></p><p>That’s actually a question we get quite often. Our veterans spend 15 weeks with our team focusing on the language JavaScript and and all it encompasses, and understanding software architecture and computer science fundamentals. We focus on having workflows, interview questions, computer science, and UX research.</p><p>The most important thing you can do to support our mission is&nbsp;<a href="https://donorbox.org/vetswhocode-donation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>donate</span></a>. As a 501(c)(3) we are tax-deductible, and as a distributed non-profit, we don't have any wasteful operating cost. All proceeds go directly to resources and cool things for the troops.</p><p>If you’re a software engineer with at least two years experience working with ES6 and Javascript, sign up as a mentor. If you are a designer who can code, we are always looking for someone to help us with our user experience. If you are in HR, drop us a line in our contact form, so that we can get our troops into your pipeline for javascript jobs.</p></div></article></div></div></div></section></div>]]>

October 3, 2020 | https://wiki.alopex.li/RustStarterKit2020 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wiki.alopex.li/RustStarterKit2020">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikipage">

<p>People were arguing about Rust’s std lib recently, so I went through the <code>Cargo.toml</code> of all the Rust projects I’ve written since 2015 and picked out the choice tools that get used over and over again. Up to date as of October 2020.</p>
<p>Also see <a href="https://wiki.alopex.li/RustCrates" title="Go to wiki page">RustCrates</a>, though that’s old. There’s also <a href="https://christine.website/blog/rust-crates-go-stdlib-2020-09-27">this</a>, which is narrower but deeper, and <a href="https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust">awesome-rust</a>, which is shallower and broader, and the various <a href="https://www.arewewebyet.org/">more</a> <a href="https://arewegameyet.rs/">specific</a> <a href="https://areweasyncyet.rs/">websites</a> <a href="https://www.areweguiyet.com/">for various</a> <a href="https://areweideyet.com/">topics</a>.</p>

<p>I need to set up a new Rust dev environment, what do I install?</p>
<h2 id="linting-clippy">Linting – <code>clippy</code></h2>
<p>The one, the only, the great Rust style and correctness linter. Want to learn how to write “idiomatic” Rust, or just learn more about handy little corners of the language and library? Run <code>clippy</code> regularly. It’s distributed with the compiler via <code>rustup</code> now, so you have no excuse not to.</p>
<h2 id="build-cache-sccache">Build cache – <code>sccache</code></h2>
<p>Or, “how to make a full rebuild 70% faster”. <code>sccache</code> is a build artifact cache similar to <code>icecream</code> or <code>ccache</code>, except it’s actually trivial to just use. <code>cargo install sccache</code>, add a single line in a home dir config file, and you’re ready to go. Pretty much handles most crate and compiler versioning issues for you, so it Just Works if you update crates or install a new version of <code>rustc</code> or something. I think I’ve had to force-clear the cache due to some build weirdness a grand total of once. Looks like it has enough features to use in a professional context as well, at least on a small-to-medium scale.</p>
<h2 id="dependency-viewer-cargo-tree">Dependency viewer – <code>cargo-tree</code></h2>
<p>The best way to view what dependencies you are using, and what dependencies they are using, and so on. Best way to start cracking down on flabby dependencies.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarking-criterion">Benchmarking – <code>criterion</code></h2>
<p>Basically the best benchmark system out there. Incredibly simple to use, informative, and statistically sound. Doesn’t really do profiling, but it’s a good start for understanding your program’s performance, and better for proving that your implementation of X is faster than someone else’s.</p>
<h2 id="other-things">Other things</h2>
<p>Stuff that is less general purpose but occasionally very useful for the meta-programming process of choosing libraries, evaluating them, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cargo-geiger</code> – Measures how much unsafe code is in a codebase, and its dependencies</li>
<li><code>cargo-crev</code> – A <a href="https://wiki.alopex.li/ActuallyUsingCrev">very neat tool</a> for authoring and verifying distributed code reviews.</li>
<li>Various tools maintained by <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-ecosystem">Embark Studios</a>, useful for production/company purposes like checking licenses, pinning specific versions of crates, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The cool stuff Real Computer Scientists write about.</p>
<h2 id="hashing">Hashing</h2>
<p>No specific crates here. There’s no single crate that provides All The Hash Algorithms, just lots of little ones that generally provide a single algorithm each. Just type the name of the algorithm you want into <code>crates.io</code> and you’ll get at least a couple options, choose the one with 8 million downloads or whatever. <code>sha2</code>, <code>md5</code>, <code>crc</code>, etc. Lots of them are written by the Rust core team.</p>
<h2 id="compression">Compression</h2>
<p>Same as the hashing category. Type <code>zip</code> or <code>bzip2</code> or whatever into crates.io and you’ll get what you need. <code>flate2</code> might be the one crate that’s not quite trivial to find. Again, many of them are written by the Rust core team.</p>
<h2 id="encryption">Encryption</h2>
<p>I have little actual experience or authority on this topic, so I’m going to punt on this one.</p>
<h2 id="pseudorandom-number-generator">Pseudorandom number generator</h2>
<p>Use <code>oorandom</code>. (Disclaimer, I wrote <code>oorandom</code>, but people besides me seem to like it.) More usually you’ll see the <code>rand</code> crate in use. If you’re doing Real Science and need to generate <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/routines.random.html">fancy probabilities</a>, then <code>rand</code> is the right tool, but most people aren’t doing that. Otherwise <code>rand</code> is complicated and has lots of features, while <code>oorandom</code> is very simple and has about two features, and I expect 80% of code to use at least one of them. <code>rand</code> has had several major breaking changes in its history that the rest of the ecosystem still hasn’t caught up with, while I intend <code>oorandom</code>’s API to change maybe twice in my lifetime. (Its version number, while obeying semver, is mostly a joke.)</p>
<p>There’s other lightweight PRNG crates that are just fine; see <code>oorandom</code>’s readme for a list of some others and choose one you like. Whatever you choose, use the <code>getrandom</code> crate to produce Real Random Seeds for it.</p>

<p>“I just need to solve this ooooooone common problem, but it needs to be solved WELL…”</p>
<h2 id="logging-log">Logging – <code>log</code></h2>
<p>Need to output log messages in your code? Why, use the <code>log</code> crate. Where do the log messages go? <code>log</code> provides only an interface, and that interface compiles to nothing if it isn’t used. You can write your own system for it to actually output the logs to, which is pretty easy, or use one of the small plethora of crates for it. My preferred one is <code>pretty_env_logger</code>, but <code>fern</code>, <code>slog</code> and others are all good too.</p>
<h2 id="parallel-data-crunching-rayon">Parallel data crunching – <code>rayon</code></h2>
<p>Ever have some computation where you have a big list of STUFF and want to process it in parallel, farming out jobs to as many threads as you have CPU’s? That’s what <code>rayon</code> does, and it does it really, really well. You still <a href="https://aspenuwu.me/posts/rust-optimization.html">have to know what you’re doing</a>, but changing a single <code>.iter()</code> into <code>.par_iter()</code> and watching your CPU-bound data-crunching run 8x faster is pretty magical. Now your CPU can help keep you warm this winter!</p>
<p>Please never use it in a library. It’s rude to spawn threads in library code, unless that’s specifically what the library is for.</p>
<h2 id="regexes-regex">Regexes – <code>regex</code></h2>
<p>To quote the inestimable <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/">jwz</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://xkcd.com/208/">somebody’s gotta save the day</a>. So, use the <code>regex</code> crate. Also use <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ripgrep">anything else</a> <a href="https://crates.io/crates/xsv">written by BurntSushi</a>. BurntSushi is a paragon of Rust program design, and also just a great <del>human being</del> charred cuisine in general.</p>
<h2 id="threadsafe-globals-lazy_static">Threadsafe globals – <code>lazy_static</code></h2>
<p>“I know globals are evil,” you say, “but I just need one. I’ll only use it for good, I promise.” <code>lazy_static</code> has your back.</p>
<p>May eventually be superseded by <code>once_cell</code>, which looks like its <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2788">headed for inclusion into <code>std</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="serializationdeserialization-serde">Serialization/deserialization – <code>serde</code></h2>
<p>Ever have a struct and just wanted to turn it into JSON, CBOR, XML, or some other engine of woe and devastation designed to be written to an I/O stream? Or had a blob of random JSON and wanted to just stuff it into a struct matching it? Sure you have. <code>serde</code> lets you do this with a single <code>#[derive]</code>. <code>serde</code> is without a doubt one of Rust’s killer libraries. It is better than any other serialization system I have ever used.</p>
<p>What data formats does it support? Anything; the actual reading and writing is done via plugin library. There’s a <a href="https://serde.rs/#data-formats">wide selection of them</a>, of varying quality, and writing your own is a little tedious but not terribly difficult.</p>
<h2 id="error-handling">Error handling</h2>
<p>This spot deliberately left blank.</p>
<p>Rust’s <code>Result&lt;T,E&gt;</code> type is one of the best setups for lightweight, transparent error handling I’ve seen, but it doesn’t do everything. How do you easily write your own error type without a bunch of boilerplate? What if you have multiple different error types from different libraries you want to coalesce together? How do you collect a backtrace of every function an <code>Err</code> is returned through, so you can find the root cause of where it came from? Can we do all this without allocating anything unnecessarily? And so on.</p>
<p>There have been various crates to try to solve these problems. First in 2015 there was <code>error_chain</code>, which was complicated and not very convenient. Then in 2017 there was <code>failure</code>, which was simpler but not very flexible, and which took an irritatingly long time to compile. Then in 2019 there was <code>anyhow</code>, which was about the time I stopped paying attention. Now apparently the new kid on the block is <code>eyre</code>, and I’m sure that in another year or two there will be something else.</p>
<p>So, I just write the boilerplate and make my errors descriptive enough I don’t need a backtrace. When I want to get fancy I implement the built-in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html"><code>Error</code></a> trait, which used to be kinda useless but is now more helpful. And in another five years it’ll still work just fine.</p>
<h2 id="byte-mucking-bytemuck">Byte mucking – <code>bytemuck</code></h2>
<p>For the rare occasions you need to turn a structure into arbitrary <code>&amp;[u8]</code> or back. Doing this using unsafe pointers is quite easy, and also makes it very easy to screw up horribly with Undefined Behavior galore. (Did you know that changing the value of padding bytes in a struct in UB? You do now.) <code>bytemuck</code> lets you muck around with bytes a little more responsibly.</p>
<h2 id="human-dates-and-times-chrono">Human dates and times – <code>chrono</code></h2>
<p>Rust’s <code>std::time</code> doesn’t really handle calendar or wall-clock times, just arbitrary, monotonic <code>Instant</code>’s and measurable <code>Duration</code>’s between them. Nice, pure, computationally-robust time measurement. For all the nasty human calendar and timezone stuff, you use <code>chrono</code>. (And maybe <code>humantime</code>, but I personally reach for <code>chrono</code> first, just out of habit.)</p>
<h2 id="bit-flags-bitflags">Bit flags – <code>bitflags</code></h2>
<p>Defining type-safe bit-masks in a reasonably convenient way. Not always worth the trouble, but sometimes pretty convenient.</p>

<p>“I have to create or read a…”</p>
<h2 id="pngjpeggifetc-image">PNG/JPEG/GIF/etc – <code>image</code></h2>
<p>General-purpose loading and saving and images, which can handle a lot of formats. Can do some amount of image manipulation as well, such as cropping, smoothing, etc. but that will hopefully be pulled out into its own library at some point soon.</p>
<h2 id="small-data-things-uuid-base64-csv-semver">Small data THINGS – <code>uuid</code>, <code>base64</code>, <code>csv</code>, <code>semver</code>…</h2>
<p>Exactly what it says on the tin.</p>

<p>Not aware of any great encoders, but there’s plenty of <em>decoders</em> for common audio formats. <code>lewton</code> for Ogg Vorbis, <code>hound</code> for .wav, <code>minimp3</code> for MP3, <code>claxon</code> for FLAC. Video, I haven’t used enough to have an opinion on.</p>
<h2 id="config-files-toml">Config files – <code>toml</code></h2>
<p>For all your config file format needs. Works with <code>serde</code>, naturally.</p>
<h2 id="markdown-pulldown-cmark">Markdown – <code>pulldown-cmark</code></h2>
<p>There’s several good Markdown readers and writers, <code>pulldown-cmark</code> is my favorite. It supports CommonMark, it’s simple to use, and it’s pure Rust.</p>
<h2 id="templating-askama">Templating – <code>askama</code></h2>
<p>There’s several quite good text templating engines, but <code>askama</code> IMO rises above them all by compiling your templates into Rust code and type-checking your templates at compile time. Sometimes this isn’t what you want, but it is a great feature surprisingly often. This also makes it super fast, for when you really need to …</p></div></div>

        <p><span>I</span>n the mid-2020â€™s, NASA will launch a helicopter-like lander the size of a small car toward Titan, Saturnâ€™s largest moon. Nearly a decade later, after crossing about a billion miles of empty darkness, this spacecraft, dubbed Dragonfly, will gently settle onto Titanâ€™s sand dunes.&nbsp;There&nbsp;the sun will merely appear as a very bright star in the heavens and the Earth will barely be visible, like a floating mote of dust. The frigid temperatures will be colder than anywhere on Earth. But scientists believe this enigmatic world might harbor alien life.<br></p>

<p>Of all the planets, moons and asteroids in our solar system, Titan is a rarity. Along with Enceladus, another of Saturnâ€™s moons, and Europa, which orbits Jupiter, it is an ocean world, possessing flowing water and other liquids, organic materials, and an energy source that could provide just the right conditions for microbes to arise. Mars might be synonymous with pop-culture conceptions of aliens, but the Red Planet likely lacks those features and has been bone-dry and mostly atmosphere-less for some three billion years. These ocean worlds could be inhabited right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The discovery of any kind of alien microbes on any of these worlds would be transformative, changing our prevailing views of life, its origins, and ultimately, ourselves. But if searches for life continue to turn up nothing, it may turn out that Earthlings have to explore much, much further to find fellow organisms in our galaxy.</p>
<p>â€œThese three moons in particular can help us test the hypothesis of whether life can naturally evolve in a place if you have all the ingredients it needs to survive,â€� says Morgan Cable, an astrochemist at Jet Propulsion Laboratory and part of a cadre of astronomers who want to send robotic explorers to these moons. â€œOr is life super unique and weâ€™re horribly alone?â€�</p>
<p>Along with Dragonfly, NASA is also building the Europa Clipper, a lander slated to sail toward Jupiter's moon in the near future. And though a return to Enceladus is not high on the agencyâ€™s priorities, a collaboration with the Breakthrough Starshot Foundation could eventually get a mission off the ground. Titan will come first, though, making it the first ocean world—other than Earth, of course—to be explored.</p>
<blockquote>Titan will be the first ocean world<strong>—</strong>other than Earth<strong>—</strong>to be explored.</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes visible to the naked eye with its faint yellowish hue, Saturn has fascinated Persian, Hindu, Chinese, Greek and other stargazers for millennia. But it was Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens who discovered Titan orbiting the sixth planet in 1655 using a telescope he built himself. Soon afterward, he discerned Saturnâ€™s rings and also spotted a clutch of its smaller moons, of which there are now known to be more than fifty. Huygens referred to the largest moon as Luna Saturni, and English astronomer John Herschel later gave it and other known moons names from Greek mythology. Those monikers stuck.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, data collected by the first Voyager probe during its brief, 37,000 mile-per-hour flyby revealed how surprisingly thick and opaque Titanâ€™s atmosphere is. Later came NASAâ€™s Cassini spacecraft, laden with sensitive instrumentation, which surveyed the ocean worlds and other moons until spectacularly ending its mission in 2017 by diving into Saturnâ€™s gaseous body. Before Cassini burned up, the data it sent back to Earth finally penetrated Titanâ€™s haze to map out its undulating plains, dunes, lakes, and craters.</p>
<p>Larger than our moon and even Mercury, which is roughly two-fifths the size of Earth, Titan hosts plenty of intriguingly unique environments. Nascent lifeforms might benefit from its bubbling ice volcanoes, with the heat and pressure from below thrusting up liquified, briny ice like flowing, molten rock on Earth. And Titan is occasionally bombarded by asteroids whose impacts could melt the ice frozen on its surface. But after a time the water they produce—and anything possibly living there—would inevitably freeze again.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_32ad92099390210393fe7b2b51e82e8a.jpg" alt="Titan surface - artist rendering"><figcaption><span>Artistâ€™s visualization of hydrocarbon pools on Titan's rocky surface. </span><br><span>Steven Hobbs</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Titanâ€™s dense, calm, orange-tinted atmosphere stands out, too, as an uncommon feature of worlds in our solar system. â€œThe reason weâ€™re interested in life on Titan is because of its atmosphere,â€� says Catherine Neish, a planetary scientist at the University of Western Ontario. Nitrogen and other molecules undergo reactions with ultraviolet light from the sun and cosmic rays, which turns them into more complex molecules. â€œAt the end of the day,â€� says Neish, â€œyou have these hugely complicated organic molecules that slowly trickle down to the surface, meaning that the Titan surface is covered in them.â€�<br></p>
<p>The chemical conditions on the surface could pose an obstacle to possible fledgling microbes—provided theyâ€™re like anything scientists know on Earth. But scientists have also speculated about life as we <em>donâ€™t</em> know it. Clouds of methane and ethane drift over Titan; they rain onto its surface, forming rivers and streams that ooze into polar seas comparable in size to the Great Lakes on Earth. Itâ€™s the only world in the solar system other than Earth known to have vast quantities of liquid on its surface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Liquids are a superb medium for bringing molecules together, forming new ones, and sweeping away waste. Eventually, somewhere, molecules can become more complex and make new copies of themselves, crossing the blurry boundary that some scientists and philosophers would call â€œlife.â€� The methane lakes of Titan would offer very different building blocks than do Earthâ€™s pools; microbes would have to eat acetylene and breathe hydrogen rather than oxygen, and exhale methane instead of carbon dioxide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These alien life forms would also need to cope with temperatures down to âˆ’180 degrees Celsius—roughly twice as cold as the coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth—and with methane being a poor medium for carbon-based organic molecules to dissolve in. That would limit the chemical possibilities, making it harder to break most chemical bonds, and crucially, it would result in slower chemical reactions. If microbes defied the odds and arose on the surface, then, their life cycle and ecological interactions would move very slowly compared to the processes thought to be involved in the beginnings of life on Earth.</p>
<p>Scientists are keeping an open mind about lifeâ€™s myriad forms, including a chemistry alien to us, so they equip their probes with a variety of instruments and make their explorations as thorough as possible. But it's hard to look for something you've never seen before. â€œIt may be that life in a lake like that is very, very different and potentially unrecognizable compared to life as we know,â€� says Cable. â€œWe donâ€™t want to miss it by accident because weâ€™re biased by Earth life.â€�</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_13df004fcabca482b041f97e46687a81.jpg" alt="High-Temperature-Beebe-Vents-Black-Smokers"><figcaption><span>A hydrothermal vent in the Cayman Trough, three miles below sea level, may be similar to vents on Enceladus. </span><br><span>Chris German/WHOI/NSF</span></figcaption></figure>

<p><span>M</span>ethane lakes are not the only potential cradle for Titanian life. Titan, as well as Europa and Enceladus, have relatively warm oceans underground. Titanâ€™s salty waters are hidden beneath an icy crust 100 kilometers thick, blocking already-feeble light from the distant sun, so photosynthesis would be impossible. But it is possible that on some of the ocean worlds, alien microbes could instead glean energy from hydrothermal—hot water—vents found near volcanoes rising from the bottom of these vast oceans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Earth, the movement of tectonic plates cracks the planetâ€™s rocky crust and creates such fissures. On the ocean worlds, the necessary force is provided by the constant gravitational pull of close orbits around the colossi of Saturn and Jupiter. Water percolating into cracking rock can then release energy.</p>
<p>â€œThe great thing about hydrothermal vents is that they provide a lot of energy sources for microbial life that doesnâ€™t include sunlight,â€� says Julie Huber, a marine chemist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Organisms living at hydrothermal vents on Earthâ€™s seafloors, she explains, â€œcan use chemical energy, so that means things like sulphur, iron, hydrogen and methane and they create a base of the food chain.â€�</p>
<p>In the mid-1970s, oceanographers towing cameras on miles-long cables through the GalÃ¡pagos Rift in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, near the islands of the same name, collected the first clear evidence of hydrothermal vents. Theyâ€™ve subsequently been found scattered in seafloor volcanic areas near the edges of tectonic plates throughout the worldâ€™s ocean, spewing superheated, mineral-rich fluids that generate chemical reactions as they burble into the cold seawater.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might seem challenging for anything to subsist in these harsh, bleak places. In fact, such environments typically offer wide ranges of temperature, pressure, acidity and energy, meaning that a diversity of microbial life is actually possible. Itâ€™s been theorized that life on Earth actually originated around hydrothermal vents rather than in primordial soup at the planet's surface, and some hardy organisms thrive there: mainly specially adapted bacteria and single-celled creatures known as archaea. Even in the ostensibly deadest spot on Earth, the nutrient-starved South Pacific Gyre east of Australia, scientists recently found microbes that apparently survived for millions of years in a form of stasis while embedded in the seafloor.</p>
<p>Vent fields off Costa Rica and in the Caribbeanâ€™s deep Cayman Trough are thought to be similar an undersea spot on Enceladus, and the connection between hydrothermal vents on Earth and potentially similar spots on ocean worlds has spurred collaborations between astrobiologists and oceanographers like Huber. The nascent deep-sea mining industry is interested, too, though for different reasons: the mineral-rich sulfide deposits include some valuable metals in dwindling supply on land, like manganese, copper, nickel and …</p></article></div>

<p>As part of Cybersecurity Awareness Month every Saturday I’ll be sharing links to videos, presentations, etc. that show interesting, surprising and entertaining content. </p>
<p>Today’s theme is aviation security. At the recent DEF CON Safe Mode conference there was an ‘<a href="https://aerospacevillage.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aerospace Village</a>‘ where hackers explored and exploited a range of aviation technology. Unless you’re in the business it’s not likely any of us would get to poke around in the avionics bay of a 747. Well, the folks from Pentest Partners did exactly that, and they presented the results at DEF CON 28…</p>

Our company was in free fall, and I had to do something about it.</p><p>But I couldn’t.</p><p>I spent weeks trying to figure it all out in my head. Every day, we would sit for hours in the office. Trying to understand what we really want to work on. Brainstorming ideas. Nothing worked.</p><p>I had the idea to take some time off for a while. But I never really explored it. I’ve always believed the only way to solve a problem is to start working on it. A mere thought of lying on a beach all day long and doing nothing caused physical pain in my head.</p><p>After a few weeks of struggle, I accepted that we’re not moving anywhere.</p><p><strong><strong>I needed a change.</strong></strong></p><p>I used to do martial arts as a kid. I remember when I first read about Shaolin. I was amazed. It seemed like something sacred, unreal to me. Very distant, but also very close in some way.</p><p>I remember begging parents to allow me to go there and train with monks.</p><p><em>“You’re out of your damn mind!”</em></p><p>I’m not blaming them; I’d probably tell my kids the same.</p><p>But now I had no excuse.</p><p>I decided to fly to China and study Kung Fu at The Shaolin Temple.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Q3pS6-bIyhrxVRndWfaux_yN_-PJBPebn2jwQJHImjIMygREWwyR3Wc8w0kILJgijhjt0r-d4BIdoeT3qsZO7VEfvQpbh5pVHakdASf1Q03R6s4clJWAUA0EjgxqNDkCdRKFH1ek" alt=""></figure><p>The Shaolin Monastery is like Mecca for Buddhists.</p><p>It’s a mysterious place where monks live, train, and meditate.</p><p><em>Some of them never leave the temple.</em></p><p>And while you can visit the temple as a tourist, there’s no way for a stranger to get into the private part of the monastery, where real monks train. There’s no website where you can apply. No email address.</p><p>But I had a plan.</p><p>I decided to find a martial arts school in Dengfeng, which is a small town 12 km from the temple. My idea was to get to Dengfeng, and then try to meet some younger monks from the temple and beg them to death to let me in.</p><p>After a few days of research, I found a school that seemed reasonable and applied.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/YDuca6U-Xj9WUbeyshjgYpN2oWYZXvEXofbvILQW7t-j-FljoSA9TjA_S3LTvOHsMWiiltMTuraj13qtDORfzWvbY_nxeqM6fI6xt_5bRC4wVUUuIYjFu-gBo6lLeZZFXbXzfbRz" alt=""><figcaption>Shifu and students.

There are hundreds of fake “Shaolin Kung Fu” schools in Dengfeng. They’re making money off the Shaolin brand, but there’s no real, authentic, hard training involved.</p><p>Getting another good one to accept me over night seemed impossible. But I kept looking.</p><p>I was looking for something original and challenging. And all Kung Fu schools I’d seen before were like holiday camps.</p><p>A few hours later, serendipity kicked into play.</p><p>I found a YouTube video from a former Xing Long student. I loved it. I went on their website and smiled.</p><p>The website said:</p><p><strong><strong>“Our school is not a holiday retreat.”</strong></strong></p><p>On a warm night of June 14th, I landed in Beijing.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ku0IQGnR2GgIWEcrPMlgo-wFYzrsanZT3agAhjOq95QJNZmS9Axi2I1MxXmN6KBHi_bmHD50q7RsO96dWnjovN83jDGHhEIxKdsCf1X3sgntgTe16-EmsHXw3DmGMWNzPWdNWwrn" alt=""><figcaption>4:30 a.m. Meeting the dawn at a Beijing Railway Station.</figcaption></figure><p>When I arrived in Beijing, I still hadn’t heard from Xing Long.</p><p>But I had no choice.

So I bought a train ticket and embarked on 600 km journey to northern China.</p><p>After six hours of slumber in the high-speed train, I was in Siping.</p><p>At the exit of the train station, three students of Xing Long waited for me with a welcoming sign, “Vasili Shynkarenka.” They drove me to school.</p><p>That’s when I met the Master for the first time.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TDkN2V3FfpErJtZ5GeLWTX__0T2KMX_dKy1xq40UENQN6OiQUEgQ3JW4jE-mfU5ECQwI4TDTflt5wuf2lz6IlbswXzhZ2bdmKpH09BsWQYqPA8nGsR9vPe6v70TcWczFbhI4DO-M" alt=""></figure><p>Shifu is 5”2, fast as a jaguar, has a bone-crushing handshake and dark brown eyes that look right into your soul.</p><p>He once tore off someone’s shoulder with bare hands.</p><p>At 12, he already trained in Shaolin.</p><p>Shifu turned pro after seven years.

Why don’t you just walk the rest of the run?”</em></p><p><em>And then it hit me:</em></p><p><em>“Because that’s who I am.”</em></p><p><em>I kept running.</em></p><hr><p><strong><strong>Every day we had six to eight hours of Shaolin training.</strong></strong></p><p>We woke up at 5:30.

<div>
<p>Much has been said about the importance of applying ferrite clamps, rings and beads to radios and other domestic products to fight QRM.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Articles on the correct placement of ferrite noise suppressors are common, but little has been written about the different options and where to buy them. &nbsp;In Australia, there are only a limited number of suppliers that carry stock.&nbsp; Ferrite size, shape and cost varies significantly.&nbsp; The information provided can be minimal or non-existent.&nbsp; Part numbers for ferrites listed in international catalogues are not generally available in Australia and buying these can entail long lead times and high freight costs.</p>
<p>Often we don’t really know what we’re getting and how effective they will work for us when they finally arrive.&nbsp; From this perspective, buying and using ferrite filters seems to have more in common with black magic than the application of radio science.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do I know if the ferrites I purchased are good, bad or totally ineffective?</li>
<li>Do I get what I pay for? &nbsp;Are expensive ferrites much better than cheap ones?</li>
<li>How can I tell if one ferrite is enough?&nbsp; Are 2 or 3 together really worthwhile?</li>
<li>What are the advantages of clamps over beads and rings?</li>
<li>Are big and heavy ferrites better than lightweight and small ones?</li>
<li>How far up the radio spectrum are these things going to work for me?</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-3.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="218" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-3.jpg 832w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-3-300x270.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-3-768x690.jpg 768w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-3-60x54.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-3-150x135.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px">Ferrites are a type of ceramic made from iron and other oxides and come moulded into different shapes.&nbsp; The material combination &nbsp;is called a ‘mix’.</p>
<p>The characteristics of these mixes determine where and how they should be used.&nbsp;&nbsp; When a wire passes through or near ferrite materials, it effectively adds resistance to that wire at radio frequencies, but this resistance effect varies with the frequency applied to the wire.</p>
<p>Every ferrite has its own characteristic impedance curve allowing it to absorb unwanted RF currents before reaching your receiver or appliance.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can’t tell what that working curve is going to be just by looking at it.</p>
<p>For this experiment, we purchased sample ferrites from the Australian retailers Jaycar and Altronics.&nbsp; We compared these with samples of similar size from the QRM Guru ferrite kits, then further compared all of these with some cheap ‘no-name’ ferrites purchased from eBay.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-4.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="460" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-4.jpg 800w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-4-300x173.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-4-768x442.jpg 768w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-4-60x35.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-4-150x86.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<p>Testing methodology is important.&nbsp; We used a spectrum analyser with a tracking generator.&nbsp; The spectrum analyser shows gain or loss of radio frequencies between any two points on the radio spectrum.&nbsp; Our unit has capability to scan the radio spectrum from 10KHz to 1.5 GHz, but in this trial, we profiled these ferrite devices between 100KHz and 450MHz.</p>
<p>The tracking generator creates a small signal that regularly sweeps between two frequencies we are monitoring at a very controlled level.&nbsp; We are then able to couple from the tracking generator to the spectrum analyser via a small brass rod, which will become our test wire.&nbsp; First we&nbsp; ‘<strong>normalise’</strong> to compensate for any stray capacitance and inductance around our test area.&nbsp; A flat yellow line represents zero dB.&nbsp; This line becomes our reference point before filtering is added.&nbsp; When any unknown ferrite is added to the test conductor, we measure a clear plot showing the unique characteristics of that item.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-5.jpg" alt="" width="985" height="509" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-5.jpg 985w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-5-300x155.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-5-768x397.jpg 768w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-5-60x31.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-5-150x78.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 985px) 100vw, 985px"></p>
<p>With this arrangement we examined a graphic plot of each sample, then recorded five unique values which identify its effectiveness.&nbsp; We looked at :</p>
<ul>
<li>(<strong>A</strong>) The <strong>lowest</strong> frequency where the item drops below the -3dB (half-signal) point.</li>
<li>(<strong>B</strong>) The <strong>highest</strong> frequency where the curve crosses the -3dB point</li>
<li>(<strong>C</strong>) The frequency (<strong>MHz</strong>) where the greatest attenuation takes place</li>
<li>(<strong>D</strong>) The maximum degree of <strong>attenuation</strong> (peak –dB) that takes place.</li>
<li>(<strong>E</strong>)&nbsp; The <strong>weight</strong> of each ferrite item.&nbsp; (in grams)</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-7.jpg" alt="" width="932" height="360" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-7.jpg 932w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-7-300x116.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-7-768x297.jpg 768w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-7-60x23.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-7-150x58.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 932px) 100vw, 932px"></p>
<p><strong>Not all characteristics are being tested here</strong></p>
<p>It should be noted that this article is focused on using ferrites for noise reduction only.&nbsp; In this role the energy being absorbed is not great.&nbsp; Where ferrites are used in high-current environments, such as in a transmitter balun, there will be an RF power threshold where they can no longer effectively absorb energy and their characteristics will begin to distort.</p>
<p>The overheating and saturation effects of high current applications are not a part of this study.</p>
<h2><strong>Study Results</strong></h2>
<p>The table below contains the raw results of our assessment, grouped in order of supplier, then size. &nbsp;The figures can be difficult to digest in this form, but we can take away some very important findings from this test data.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-8.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="459" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-8.jpg 900w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-8-300x153.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-8-768x392.jpg 768w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-8-60x31.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-8-150x77.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></p>
<h2><strong>Branding vs Price</strong></h2>
<p>The first significant observation is that they all worked.&nbsp; Regardless of the source, none of the samples tested were fake or defective.&nbsp; They were all capable of suppressing radio frequencies to a greater or lesser degree. &nbsp;This is reassuring, as you can never prove authenticity just by looking at a ferrite.</p>
<p>From these samples, we can surmise that regardless of their source, all of these clamp-on ferrites will provide at least some degree of effectiveness in the shack.</p>
<h2><strong>Ferrite Mixture Type</strong></h2>
<p>The next observation (with the exception of the Altronics Iron Core ring) is that all of these materials are composed from a similar mix of ferrite material.&nbsp; The absorption curves were all a reasonable match to <strong>Mix 43</strong>.&nbsp; This indicates that their application is appropriate for HF and low VHF frequencies.&nbsp;&nbsp; (The Altronics ring L4534A was purchased with the rest of the ferrites, but it does not qualify as a ferrite device.&nbsp; It is a powdered iron object with different characteristics.&nbsp; We left it in the test for contrast and will provide separate comment on these devices.)</p>
<h2><strong>Size vs weight correlation of ferrite clamps</strong></h2>
<p>Clamp-on ferrite devices come in a variety of different physical sizes and shapes.&nbsp; It is reasonable to think that bigger ferrites work better than smaller ones, but is this actually the case?&nbsp; We sorted our samples by weight and plotted this chart to see how closely the degree of absorption of RF energy followed the physical weight of each sample.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-9.jpg" alt="" width="874" height="242" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-9.jpg 874w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-9-300x83.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-9-768x213.jpg 768w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-9-60x17.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-9-150x42.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-10.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="267" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-10.jpg 481w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-10-300x246.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-10-60x49.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-10-150x123.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 326px) 100vw, 326px">The answer appears to be”partially yes”.&nbsp; Generally, heavier ferrites will out-perform lighter versions, but there were a couple of exceptions that did very well.</p>
<p>The <strong>Altronics</strong> solid ring <strong>L4534A (A3) </strong>outperformed clamps of similar weight, as did the <strong>Jaycar</strong> <strong>LF1294 (J2)</strong>.&nbsp; Both are circled in red in the chart above.</p>
<p>There is a correlation between ferrite effectiveness and wall thickness.&nbsp; Both circled examples had a relatively small internal wire opening, which made for a thicker clamp wall.&nbsp; This equates to a higher density of ferrite material around the single conductor, giving superior performance.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-11.jpg" alt="" width="321" height="203" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-11.jpg 425w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-11-300x190.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-11-60x38.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-11-150x95.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 321px) 100vw, 321px">Conversely, sample <strong>E1</strong> from eBay was a physically large clamp, but it catered for a thick 12mm cable.&nbsp; This thinner wall thickness reduced effectiveness, as seen by the data point circled in yellow on the chart above.</p>
<p>This effect is not as bad as it first seems, so don’t necessarily shop only for thick-walled clamps.&nbsp; Examine some of the following sections in this article which explore the most effective ways to use ferrite clamps.</p>
<p>The final comment on the size of clamps was the observation that the very small clamp-on ferrites don’t have sufficient mass for good performance.&nbsp; The smallest of the eBay clamps (<strong>E5</strong>) didn’t even reach -3dB.&nbsp; Unless a friend gives you a lot of them for nothing, there is a lot to be said for aiming straight for medium and large clamps, or the results could be disappointing.</p>
<h2><strong>Are solid ferrite rings better than split rings?</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-12.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="209" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-12.jpg 552w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-12-300x188.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-12-60x38.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-12-150x94.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px">This turned out to be an easy question to answer.&nbsp; Two rings of similar weight, hole-size and ferrite mix were compared.&nbsp; One was solid and the other was split.</p>
<p>The results were almost identical when tested.&nbsp; This tells us that shopping for solid cores have no real advantage over split cores.&nbsp; However, the split ferrites can be applied to cables without having to remove connector plugs and this makes them a more practical purchase.</p>
<h2><strong>What’s the best way to use ferrites?</strong></h2>
<p>An important question to answer is “<em>what is the optimum configuration for the application of ferrite clamps</em>“.&nbsp; It’s easy to imagine that two clamps are better than one, but how much better?</p>
<p>For this exercise we focused our attention on the QRM Guru clamps (<strong>Q2</strong>) designed for 8mm wire.</p>
<p>Compare the following screen captures and images of one and two clamps:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-13.jpg" alt="" width="1173" height="435" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-13.jpg 1173w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-13-300x111.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-13-1024x380.jpg 1024w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-13-768x285.jpg 768w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-13-60x22.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-13-150x56.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1173px) 100vw, 1173px"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-14.jpg" alt="" width="1164" height="429" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-14.jpg 1164w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-14-300x111.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-14-1024x377.jpg 1024w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-14-768x283.jpg 768w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-14-60x22.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-14-150x55.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1164px) 100vw, 1164px"></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, doubling up on the clamps gives an additional 3dB of RF absorption.&nbsp; At <strong>55 MHz</strong> the peak absorption jumped from <strong>-4.40 dB</strong> to <strong>-7.54 dB</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This tells us that if one clamp on its own does not quite do the job, then add another for improved performance.&nbsp; Be aware that to achieve a further 3dB, you must double again from two to four units.</p>
<p>Next, we explore the effectiveness of looping a wire through a clamp more than once.&nbsp; This can only work where there is sufficient slack in the cable, and where the hole in the core is large enough to accept additional turns.</p>
<p>Here is what happens:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-15.jpg" alt="" width="1151" height="458" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-15.jpg 1151w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-15-300x119.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-15-1024x407.jpg 1024w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-15-768x306.jpg 768w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-15-60x24.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-15-150x60.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1151px) 100vw, 1151px"></p>
<p>This is a very interesting result showing that the single extra turn through the core increases absorption from -4.4dB to a huge -12.41 dB.&nbsp;&nbsp; This 8 dB increase makes a single clamp provide the same effectiveness of around six such clamps on the same wire.</p>
<p>Want to see some case studies covering off the use of ferrites?&nbsp; Click on the links below</p>
<h2><strong>Why adding turns makes ferrites much more effective</strong></h2>
<p>This effect is not really a mystery when we break down what’s happening.&nbsp; When we add ferrite to a wire, we are effectively adding series resistance to that wire, but this resistance effect varies with frequency.&nbsp; At steady DC, the ferrites have no effect, but as an AC signal is applied a resistance is developed within the wire surrounded by the ferrite material.&nbsp; The higher the frequency, the greater the increased resistance.&nbsp; This resistance is also affected by the type of ferrite material, its volume, and its distance from the wire concerned.</p>

<p><em>Guest blog post by <a href="https://lanebc.com/about/">Jay Michlin</a>, circa 1987 (used with permission). A recounting of a presentation by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Atkinson">Bill Atkinson</a> at the <a href="https://www.pa-smug.org/">Stanford Macintosh User Group (SMUG)</a> </em></p>



<p>HyperCard. Bill Atkinson. The auditorium was packed and everyone stayed until the end.<br>What more need be said?</p>



<p>I considered stopping this month’s report right here, because the first paragraph already<br>tells volumes. But I never learned to quit while ahead, so here’s more. Specifically, I’m going to try to explain what HyperCard is, both as Bill described it and as I see it. As you’ll see, my perspective is somewhat different.</p>



<p>Bill said that HyperCard tries to make more of the power of a personal computer available to nonprogrammers. There’s plenty of goodness in using a computer for word processing, spreadsheets and other applications. But to unlock the real power, you have to program, and that’s very hard. HyperCard delivers a lot of the power of programming, but with minimal burden.</p>



<p>Or, you can look at the matter another way. Before HyperCard, the Mac had documents and applications. Documents contain information, but by themselves offer no opportunity for interaction with you. Applications offer interaction, but do not contain information. HyperCard stacks are in between, with a combination of both information and interaction inherent in them.</p>



<p>Or, you can think of HyperCard as a software erector set. It comes with a kit of tools, a set of instructions and lots of parts. Like an erector set, it has one more thing — examples. When you first get the set, you build copies of the ex amples. Then you change a few small details. Eventually you become comfortable with the tools and the parts and start using it fluidly to express your own, original ideas. In the same way, HyperCard comes with dozens of sample stacks. They’re not an afterthought. They’re an integral part of the product, intended to help you use it immediately and learn it quickly.</p>



<p>Here’s what I think. HyperCard is the latest in a long list of “languages” that seek to make<br>computers easy to program. The need is not new, the idea is not new and the solution is not new. What’s special about HyperCard is that it’s brilliantly executed. Biil obviously spent a lot of time thinking and learning about his task before, during and after sitting down to code.</p>



<p>Let me explain. For the early computers there were no such things as “canned” applications like word processors and spreadsheets. Everyone was a programmer. There was no choice. Then, in the 1960’s, timesharing was invented. The primary external feature that made timesharing different was that it supported users interacting with the computer at terminals.</p>



<p>But the users still had to program if they were to get the machine to do anything, As terminal access to timesharing became more widespread, especially on college campuses, everyone understood that programming was a barrier. So they invented BASIC.</p>



<p>Perhaps you thought that BASIC always was as it is today on personal computers. It wasn’t. It was expressly designed to help college students get over the programming barrier on early timesharing systems. It did that in a number of ways:</p>



<ul><li>It was interpretive. Users could type a command and get instant results printed on the terminal. It’s an elementary fact of life that we learn better if we have quick, useful feedback. </li><li>It made simple things simple. To print something on the terminal, you said, “PRINT.” There was no need to tell the computer how to find the terminal or what the printing format was to be. </li><li>It was small in that it had very few statements and options defined. Of course, that was partly because the computers and translators of the time would have struggled to give quick response on a complicated language. But even when more features were added, they remained in the background, invisible to novice users who don’t need them. </li><li>It came with clear, obvious examples, either as part of a college course or in a manual. You learned to write BASIC by trying the examples. BASIC worked. It helped a generation of college students learn to use computers. Later, it was the primary offering on commercial timesharing systems from Tymshare and General Electric. And most recently, it helped launch the personal computer revolution. It wasn’t so long ago that to use a personal computer at all, you had to program.</li></ul>



<p>Personal computers and their application software have grown sophisticated so fast that we easily forget that computers and programming go together. It’s tempting to say that to- day, in the modern era, programming is no longer needed. We all just go to Computer Ware and buy whatever package we need to make our machines do anything.</p>



<p>For many, perhaps that is true. But Bill Atkinson, and Apple are saying that you still need the opportunity to program to tap the underlying power of your computer. HyperCard will be the BASIC of the modern era, with possibly as profound an effect on the future as BASIC has had up to now.</p>



<p>Those are my words, not Bill’s. But I wouldn’t be surprised if he agreed.</p>



<p> * * * *</p>



<p>In case you missed the meeting, here are some details. Bill wasn’t there alone. Dan Winkler, who created HyperTalk, HyperCard’s internal scripting language, was also present. So was Danny Goodman, who wrote the book. Also Kristee Kreitman, who did the artwork (of which there is lots), Robin Shank, who helped do the testing, and Mike Holm, the Product Manager.</p>



<p>As an aside, this is an interesting illustration of the difference between a modern business enterprise and one from the last generation. A modern corporation values the natural benefits to all concerned when employees from all parts of the organization go out and meet customers. A more traditional corporation sends out only carefully prepared marketing teams.</p>



<p>Anyway, Bill demonstrated HyperCard and talked about the philosophy behind it. Then Dan told us about HyperTalk. He showed it to be a powerful, yet well-behaved language. Despite the fact that it underlies much of what goes on in HyperCerd, HyperTalk remains invisible be- hind the scenes if you don’t need or want to know about it.</p>



<p>Then Danny told us about two stacks he designed and is now selling commercially. The first, Business Class, presents a map of the world. Click anywhere and you can learn about language, currency, time zones, air travel and other important conditions. The second, Focal Point, is a very generalized and very interactive desk calendar and diary. Both are implemented as HyperCard stacks.</p>



<p>Incidentally, when you buy a HyperCard stack, you can copy and modify it the same way you can manipulate the example stacks that come with HyperCard itself. Apple’s whole approach is to make HyperCard a common tool, and stacks a common medium that people exchange and build on.</p>



<p>Finally, here are a few miscellancous points our guests made in response to questions.</p>



<p>HyperCard is roughly 360K of code, nearly ten times the sum of Bill’s original MacPaint and QuickDraw combined. HyperCard requires at least 1 MB or memory and the 128K ROMs. The team tried for 512K, but couldn’t make it.</p>



<p>The program contains some pioneering work Bill has done to compress bit maps. The com- pression feature brings two advantages. First, it minimizes disk space to store stacks. And second, it speeds response because the program has fewer bytes to move to and from disk. The feature typically achieves 10-to-1 compressions, with up to 30-to-1 not unusual.</p>



<p>Bill claims to be about two-thirds done with HyperCard. The product is now at a point “where you can build stacks and count on them still working five years from now…” The next features to be added are international features beginning in a month or two (Kanji will take longer) and CD-ROM support a bit later. Color is on the to-do list, but not at high priority.</p>



<p>The product’s current limits are 16 million cards and 500 MB total storage for a stack. And according to Bill, “If you run into those limits, we can change them together.”</p>



<p>Exit, to thunderous applause.</p>

        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Design is easily one of the most misunderstood lines of work there is. If you’ve ever heard people comment on a piece of art saying <em>“I could do that”</em>, or bicker about a designer’s work being “overpriced”, you probably know what I mean.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Just a few months ago, The Sunday Times even published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/manpower/8-in-10-singaporeans-willing-to-pay-more-for-essential-services">poll</a>&nbsp;stating that 71% of Singaporean locals think Artist is the most 'non-essential' job during a pandemic. This sprouted heated responses all over the world about the importance of the arts, which includes design work.</p>
<p>To those who have never set foot in the field, design looks like it’s easy and requires no smarts. It is in everything we see — our digital devices, our homes, the chair that you’re sitting on, and even the webpage you’re reading from right now — yet, it is so taken for granted. Why?</p>
<p>We gave our designers a penny for their thoughts, and learned a few things.</p>
<h3><strong>“I could do that.”</strong></h3>
<p>People often assume…</p>
<p>“It's easy.” — <strong>Leni</strong></p>
<p>“That design is easy and fast, and that everyone is capable of designing since there are many free softwares out there on the internet. The reason why everyone wants quick work from us is because they tend to underestimate the time and effort we invest in each design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating a design is rarely the problem. Creating a great design that is set apart from others is challenging and takes time.” — <strong>Kelsey</strong></p>
<p>“That designing is easy, and that what we do can't bring value.” — <strong>Jye Miin</strong></p>
<h3><strong>“So, you like drawing?”</strong></h3>
<p>People think…</p>
<p>“That design is solely ‘art’. Though there is art in design, design is often also about problem solving. It’s often rooted in basic principles of decision making.” — <strong>Mei Kwan</strong></p>
<p><span>"That designers just do arts or&nbsp;create beautiful things. We actually often use design concepts to solve problems. That includes little things like the style and position of a button, colors, margins, etc. </span></p>
<p><span>These all serve to solve problems that users face, or rather help users achieve their goals when they interact with the apps/systems that we build. Design makes everyone's lives easier." — <strong>Adri</strong></span></p>
<h3><span>"You must be talented!"</span></h3>
<p><span>And people misunderstand that...</span></p>
<p><span>"Design is all about the talent. It’s a common misconception that design comes naturally to us.</span></p>
<p><span>Design requires more than an eye for aesthetics — it's often about user experience, purpose, creating solutions, and empathy. While we constantly learn, practice, and adapt in developing an eye for good design, we should also build on these fundamental principles. Talent, skill, and experience all play a part in making a great designer."&nbsp;— <strong>Han</strong></span></p>
<p>In what other ways do people misunderstand design work?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span>On Monday, a group of researchers sponsored by Breakthrough Listen, the world’s largest SETI program, </span><a href="http://seti.berkeley.edu/lunarseti/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">submitted a paper</a><span> to National Academy of Sciences’ Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey that makes the case for establishing a SETI radio observatory on the farside of the moon. The decadal survey establishes scientific priorities for the next ten years and the new paper addresses one of the biggest problems facing the search for extraterrestrial intelligence today: The overwhelming amount of radio interference.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>Our planet has become so “loud” in the part of the radio spectrum observed by SETI that it threatens to drown out any signal sent from an intelligent civilization. Not only would a lunar radio telescope not have to deal with terrestrial radio interference, it could also significantly increase our chances of hearing from ET by opening up parts of the radio spectrum that are blocked by Earth's atmosphere. While the idea of using the moon for radio astronomy is decades old, the researchers make the case that technological advancements have finally made a lunar SETI observatory truly feasible.</span></p></div><div><div><p><span>
says Eric Michaud, an intern at the SETI Berkeley Research Center and the first author of the paper. “Maybe not today, but I think it’s going to get more and more feasible as time goes on.”&nbsp;</span></p></div></div><div><p><span>Radio interference has been a problem for SETI from the very beginning. In the spring of 1960, the planetary scientist Frank Drake trained the massive radio telescope at Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia on Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani, two stars a mere 12 light years from Earth. That summer, Drake spent his days studying the signals picked up by Green Bank’s giant mechanical ear in the hopes of receiving a message broadcast by an alien civilization orbiting those stars. Known as Project Ozma, Drake’s experiment marked the beginning of SETI, the scientific search for extraterrestrial intelligence.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>Shortly after Drake started his observations, he was surprised to find what appeared to be a signal of intelligent origin. After days of watching a needle drift lazily over a spool of paper recording the random undulations of cosmic static, Drake and his colleagues were jolted awake when the machine started recording the frantic pulses of a strong radio signal picked up by the telescope. The timing and magnitude of the pulses clearly marked them as artificial; there was nothing in the natural world that could produce such a frenetic radio profile. It would have been an astounding stroke of luck to pick up an alien message after only a few hours of observation, but it was hard to argue with the data.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>“None of us had ever seen anything like it,” Drake recalled in </span><em>Is Anyone Out There?</em><span>, his autobiographical book about the early days of SETI. “We looked at each other wide-eyed. Could discovery be this easy?”</span></p></div><div><div><p><span>

It was a letdown, but the false detection turned out to be a portent for the future of SETI. In the 60 years since Drake’s pioneering experiment, researchers have conducted dozens of SETI searches across thousands of stars and turned up empty-handed. At the same time, the sources of radio interference on Earth—military radars, TV towers, cell phones, and satellites—have exponentially increased, which greatly increases the chances that an extraterrestrial signal will be lost among the noise.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div><div><p><span>Earth was never a particularly great place to do any kind of radio astronomy due to our thick atmosphere blocking a large portion of the radio spectrum. The proliferation of radio communication technologies has only made things harder. The moon, by comparison, has no atmosphere and its nights last for weeks on end, which limits radio noise from the sun. And as&nbsp;NASA discovered through a spate of lunar orbiter missions in the late 1960s, the moon also acts as a natural shield that blocks radio signals emanating from Earth. As the planetary astronomer Phillipe Zarka has put it, “the farside of the moon during the lunar night is the most radio-quiet place in our local universe.” It’s exactly the sort of peace and quiet you want if you’re searching for faint radio signals from solar systems that might be hundreds of light years away.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>The new Breakthrough Listen paper proposed two main approaches to a lunar SETI observatory: an orbiter and a telescope on the surface. The basic idea behind a SETI lunar orbiter would be to scan for signals as it passed over the lunar farside and relay data back to Earth as it passed over the near side. One of the main advantages of an orbiter is cost. The proliferation of small satellites that are capable of accurate tracking combined with low-cost small launch providers like Rocket Lab means that a SETI orbiter could conceivably be sent to the moon </span><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-awards-contract-to-launch-cubesat-to-moon-from-virginia/#:~:text=The%20firm%2Dfixed%2Dprice%20launch,Tyvak%20Nano%2DSatellite%20Systems%20Inc." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">for less than $20 million</a><span>. This would be a valuable pathfinder mission that could pave the way for a more ambitious observatory on the surface, but without the risk and cost.&nbsp; As the </span><a href="https://www.supercluster.com/editorial/the-supercluster-podcast-water-bears-might-now-occupy-the-moon" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ill-fated Israeli Beresheet lander mission</a><span> reminded us, landing on the moon is extremely challenging even when the mission is backed by $100 million.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>But a SETI lunar orbiter would also come with a lot of compromises. It would only be able to conduct observations during the brief stretches when it was on the lunar farside, which would make a sustained observation campaign more challenging. The upshot is that an orbiter would have access to the full sky, whereas a telescope on the surface would be constrained by the moon’s rotation. The biggest downside of an orbiter is that it might lose a lot of the shielding benefits of the moon and be more vulnerable to radio interference from Earth since it would be orbiting high above the lunar surface.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>“The first SETI observations that are done from the lunar farside will be done from orbit, there’s no question about that,” says Andrew Siemion, the director of the Berkeley SETI Research Center and the second author on the paper. “I think eventually we absolutely want to do something on the surface because we want to build a very large aperture telescope, but even when we’re at that point I don’t think that would negate the utility of doing things from orbit as well.”&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>So what would a SETI observatory on the moon look like? One idea is to use the naturally parabolic lunar crater as a radio dish, much like the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico and </span><a href="https://www.supercluster.com/editorial/chinas-massive-telescope-is-the-next-great-seti-hope" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the FAST telescope in China</a><span>, which are built into natural depressions in the land. This idea was </span><a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/RS012i005p00845" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first considered</a><span> back in the late 1970s by a group of scientists at the radio physics lab at the Stanford Research Institute. Their idea was to recreate Arecibo on the moon by suspending an antenna from the lip of a crater and using the basin as a reflector. The reduced gravity on the moon would allow for a radio telescope far larger than any on Earth, which could significantly enhance the sensitivity of SETI searches. Ultimately the researchers concluded that a lunar radio observatory was too expensive compared to SETI telescopes that could be built on Earth.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>But 40 years later, Michaud says that building a radio dish in a lunar crater may finally be cheap enough to pull off. One of the main drivers of this cost reduction is the advent of commercial launch providers like SpaceX and Rocket Lab, which have </span><a href="https://www.supercluster.com/editorial/cheaper-rockets-growing-the-human-family-in-space" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dramatically lowered the cost of space access</a><span>. Another driver is NASA’s push to establish a permanent human presence on the moon, which has subsidized the development of a fleet of commercial lunar exploration vehicles. “There’s so much interest in going back to the moon,” says Michaud, who cited Blue Origin’s lunar lander and Rocket Lab’s Photon Lunar satellite as examples of technologies enabled by </span><a href="https://www.supercluster.com/editorial/nasas-first-puerto-rican-born-director-aims-for-a-moonshot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NASA’s Artemis program</a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>A crux of the original vision for lunar SETI observatories was that it would require a human settlement on the moon to build and operate the radio dish. But robotic systems have improved enough that it may be possible to take humans out of the equation. This was clearly demonstrated in 2019 when China’s Chang’e 4 rover landed autonomously on the farside of the moon.

Both NASA studies are focused on radio astronomy rather than SETI, but Siemion sees the two disciplines as natural allies in the quest to establish an observatory on the lunar farside.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>If you have been working as a network administrator for quite some time, you probably already know about <strong>switches</strong>.</p>



<p>Switches are essential blocks of any network environment. </p>



<p>When they associated with computers, they are responsible for <strong>receiving</strong> and <strong>transmitting</strong> traffic over a network.</p>



<p>However, do you really know <strong>how computers communicate?</strong></p>



<p>What tools do they use when you are dealing with a private local network?</p>



<p>Is it different when you are communicating over a larger network, or Internet?</p>



<p>In this tutorial, you are going to discover everything that there is to know about <strong>computer communication</strong>. </p>



<p>By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to clearly identify <strong>how computers are communicating</strong> and which tools they are using in order to achieve it.</p>



<h2>Switches and OSI Model</h2>



<p>Before jumping into the explanation, there is an important concept that you need to grasp : <strong>the OSI model</strong>.</p>



<p>The OSI model is made of seven layers :</p>



<ul><li><strong>Physical layer</strong> : essentially your cables and every physical part that links a computer to another</li><li><strong>Data-link layer</strong> : that defines the protocol used in order for devices to communicate over a local network (Ethernet most of the time)</li><li><strong>Network layer</strong> : defines the way computers are meant to communicate over a larger network or between a group of networks.</li><li><strong>Transport layer</strong> : that describes how data will be transmitted from one point to another (is it TCP or is it UDP?)</li><li><strong>Session layer</strong> : which states if we are talking about a full-duplex, half-duplex or simplex communications</li><li><strong>Presentation + application layer</strong> : your users are quite familiar with this layer because it represents the application they are using to communicate (Firefox or Chrome for example).</li></ul>



<p>In this list, we are going to focus on the second point because it is the one that relates to MAC addresses.</p>



<p>In most cases, communication is done via <strong>Ethernet.</strong></p>



<p>Ethernet, in simple words, is a protocol that defines a way for devices to communicate with each other.</p>



<p>It defines the way frames are formatted, how large they should be, where data should be stored and so on, the destination as well as the source of the message.</p>



<p>The destination and source are represented by the destination MAC address and the source MAC address of both devices.</p>



<p><em>But, what is a MAC address?</em></p>



<h3>MAC Address Definition</h3>



<p><strong>A MAC Address is an unique identifier given to your network adapter when it was built by a given NIC vendor.</strong></p>



<p>MAC addresses are represented by 12 hexadecimal characters, six groups of two, separated by colons or dashes (<a href="https://ouilookup.com/mac/98-E7-43">98-E7-43</a>-78-65-74 or <a href="https://ouilookup.com/mac/9C-7B-EF">9C-7B-EF</a>-45-F5-45 for example).</p>



<p>If your device is communicating over Internet, you can be pretty sure that it has a network interface card equipped with a MAC address (computers, gaming consoles, mobile phones..)</p>



<p>However, a MAC address on its own is not enough for your computer to send a message over a network.</p>



<p><em>Remember the OSI model we saw in the previous chapter?</em></p>



<p>When sending a message over the network, your message will be <strong>encapsulated</strong> with information from the presentation layer to the data-link layer.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/osi-model-layers-1024x282.png" alt="osi model and layers explained" width="1024" height="282" srcset="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/osi-model-layers-1024x282.png 1024w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/osi-model-layers-300x82.png 300w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/osi-model-layers-768x211.png 768w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/osi-model-layers.png 1204w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>In other words, it will be assigned TCP (or UDP) headers, IP headers as well as Ethernet headers before going onto the wire.</p>



<p>If you just plugged your computer to the network, there is a chance that your computer does not know anything about other computers on the network.</p>



<p>It is important to say that if your computer already communicated over the network, it has a cache that it is going to use to format packets correctly.</p>



<p>Instead of having to connect every single computer to each other on a network, we use a device that binds the computers together : <strong>the switch.</strong></p>



<p>For now, let’s assume that we don’t have any router, as we simply want to send messages over a simple local subnet.</p>



<p>Use the following schema as a starting point : you have three computers on the network linked via a simple switch.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/simple-network-example.png" alt="simple network example" srcset="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/simple-network-example.png 828w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/simple-network-example-300x174.png 300w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/simple-network-example-768x445.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px"></figure></div>



<p>Computer A wants to send a message to computer B, h<strong>ow can it achieve that?</strong></p>



<h3>Understanding ARP on a local subnet</h3>



<p>In order to understand how computer A can send a message to computer B, you need to understand the <strong>ARP protocol</strong>.</p>



<p>ARP is a protocol used by computers in order <strong>to discover MAC addresses associated with IP addresses over a network.</strong></p>



<p>In short, when computer A decides to send a message to computer B, it does it using the IP address of computer B (192.178.1.3/24 in our case).</p>



<p>But if you remember the OSI model we saw just before, you realized that the message needs to have Ethernet headers.</p>



<p>That is to say that the message needs to have a source MAC address and a destination MAC address.</p>



<p>However, computer A has no idea of the MAC address of computer B.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/message-for-computer-b-1024x333.png" alt="" width="1024" height="333" srcset="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/message-for-computer-b-1024x333.png 1024w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/message-for-computer-b-300x98.png 300w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/message-for-computer-b-768x250.png 768w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/message-for-computer-b.png 1269w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>In order to learn about it, it is going to use the <strong>ARP protocol</strong>.</p>



<p>Computer A will send an ARP discover frame to the switch stating that it needs to learn about the MAC address of computer B.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/arp-discover-schema-1024x346.png" alt="ARP discover example" width="1024" height="346" srcset="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/arp-discover-schema-1024x346.png 1024w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/arp-discover-schema-300x101.png 300w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/arp-discover-schema-768x260.png 768w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/arp-discover-schema.png 1419w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>From there, your switch will broadcast the frame to all computers connected to the switch. As a consequence, every computer on the local network will receive the ARP discover frame.</p>



<figure><img src="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/broadcast-arp-discover-switch-1024x346.png" alt="" width="1024" height="346" srcset="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/broadcast-arp-discover-switch-1024x346.png 1024w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/broadcast-arp-discover-switch-300x101.png 300w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/broadcast-arp-discover-switch-768x260.png 768w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/broadcast-arp-discover-switch.png 1419w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>When receiving the message, if the IP address matches, the corresponding computer will send a message back stating that it is matching.</p>



<p>If it doesn’t match, the NIC of the corresponding computer will drop the message.</p>



<p>From there, the switch also learns about the MAC address and forwards the message back to the initiating computer.</p>



<p>Awesome, your computer now knows that the computer 192.178.1.3/24 has the <a href="https://ouilookup.com/mac/00-60-70">00-60-70</a>-14-45-10.</p>



<figure><img src="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/complete-ethernet-message-network-1024x350.png" alt="" width="1024" height="350" srcset="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/complete-ethernet-message-network-1024x350.png 1024w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/complete-ethernet-message-network-300x103.png 300w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/complete-ethernet-message-network-768x263.png 768w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/complete-ethernet-message-network.png 1290w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Now, your computer is able to properly format the message, the missing Ethernet header can now be completed!</p>



<p>As a consequence, the message is sent over the network and both computers can now happily communicate without any trouble.</p>



<p><strong>Quite nice!</strong></p>



<p>Now, you may be wondering : if I want to communicate with another computer located in another network, very far away from me, do I need to know about every single MAC address on Earth?</p>



<h2>Network communication over Internet</h2>



<p>In the previous chapter, we saw that communication can easily be achieved on a local subnet using the <strong>ARP protocol</strong>.</p>



<p>However, in most cases, you want to be able to communicate over Internet.</p>



<p>To answer the previous question, you don’t have to have every single MAC address stored on your computer, ARP is a protocol for local Ethernet resolution.</p>



<p>To complexify things a little bit, let’s add a router to our previous network and state that computer A now wants to communicate with computer D.</p>



<p>To understand communication over Internet, you need to understand the decision made by your computer to send a computer over the network.</p>



<p>When sending a message, your computer goes into the following decision making process :</p>



<ul><li><strong>Is the destination IP located on the subnet I am currently linked to? </strong></li></ul>



<p>If this is the case, we use the algorithm seen in the previous chapter (using ARP).</p>



<p>If this is not the case, the message is simply <strong>forwarded to your local router</strong> in order to be routed over Internet.</p>



<p>Note that your computer needs to know about the <strong>MAC address of your router</strong> in any case, using the ARP protocol described in the previous section.</p>



<p>The key here is to understand that <strong>the destination IP will be the one of the computer D but the MAC address is the one of the local gateway.</strong></p>



<p>In our example, the destination IP is not on the same subnet, so the message will be forwarded to the default gateway (aka our local router).</p>



<p>From there, the message is routed through hundreds of different routers to your destination and the response (if any) is sent back to you by the destination computer.</p>



<p>Awesome, you now know how message are sent over a network and how they can reach a local or a distant destination!</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>In this tutorial, you learnt <strong>how computers can easily communicate over a network.</strong></p>



<p>If you are dealing with a local subnet, you now know that the ARP protocol is used and that your message is broadcasted to everyone in order to learn the destination MAC address.</p>



<p>If you want to send your message over Internet, you often send your message to your local gateway (using the destination IP but the MAC of your router!).</p>



<p>From there, <strong>complex routing algorithms</strong> are used in order to reach the destination computer.</p>

<h4 id="intro">0. Introduction </h4><p>During a recent trip to North Korea, I noticed the recent and ubiquitous presence of <em>Information Technology Exchange Rooms</em> (정보기술교류실), physical stores where one can purchase a variety of electronic devices – from laptops and tablets to USB sticks and chargers – as well as software and video games for PC, mobile and tablets (for an in-depth look at what goes on inside those stores as well as what the app selection looks like, <a href="https://www.nknews.org/2019/02/what-to-buy-inside-a-north-korean-app-store/">this article</a> by Alek Sigley provides a an excellent description. There are also a few <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ujblnigJmM">videos</a> on YouTube). After looking through the catalogue of available games at different stores, I eventually decided to try and buy a Sim City-like game called <em>City Management</em> (도시경경).</p>
<figure id="attachment_426"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chongbo.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chongbo.png" alt="" width="845" height="760"></a><figcaption>Billboards for various app stores in Pyongyang</figcaption></figure><p>The game only cost 5000 wons (less than 1 USD) which I paid to have the app installed on the phone I had, a Samsung Galaxy A5 running Android 8. The vendor connected the phone to his PC, transferred the APK and tried to install it, but to no avail. After multiple attempts, he eventually informed me that North Korean apps most likely could not run on phones from other countries. </p>
<figure id="attachment_428"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/marrichakyongchu.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/marrichakyongchu.png" alt="" width="551" height="827"></a><figcaption>Advertisement for a car racing game inside a North Korean app store</figcaption></figure><p>Fortunately, I was later able to purchase one of the different tablets sold in North Korea. I got the <em>Morning</em> (아침) brand, which is geared towards students and quite affordable. The tablet ran Android 4 (Kit Kat) on an ARM cpu and came loaded with a few educational apps: language learning courses, dictionaries and several e-book libraries containing the complete works of Kim Il Sung, school textbooks and a collection of literary works. No games, but that could now be fixed quite easily.</p>
<figure id="attachment_431"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/achimtablet.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/achimtablet.png" alt="" width="800" height="490"></a><figcaption>A North Korean Ach’im (Morning) tablet</figcaption></figure><p>I retrieved the <em>City Management</em> APK from my phone and installed it on the tablet, where it ran perfectly. Unfortunately, after the game’s initial splash screen, I landed on this:</p>
<figure id="attachment_434"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/buyserial.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/buyserial.png" alt="" width="1024" height="600"></a><figcaption>Licence key needed</figcaption></figure><p>The screen tells us that there is no “key file” (열쇠화일) and that we should purchase one at a store. There is a “request number” (요청번호) likely used to generate the licence key and make sure it can’t be shared with other devices. Unfortunately, since the APK never installed, the vendor did not put a licence file on my phone when I bought the app. My stay in North Korea was coming to an end too and I did not have time to go back to an app store to buy a new key. So I figured I would take a look inside the app and see if I could get it running nonetheless. </p>
<hr id="licence">
<h4>1. Licensing system </h4><p>To start looking into the APK’s code, I’ll use the standard suite of tools to decompress, decompile and rebuild android apps: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/dex2jar/">dex2jar</a>, <a href="http://java-decompiler.github.io/">jd-gui</a>, <a href="https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/install/">apktool</a> and <a href="https://github.com/appium/sign">apksign</a>. I’ll also use <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio</a> to run and debug the app. The fact that I couldn’t run the app on my phone may have just come from an Android version compatibility issue: I had no problem running it on an emulated Android 4.4 device with Android Studio. The decompilation of the <code>classes.dex</code> file gives us some interesting information right away:</p>
<figure id="attachment_438"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dex2jar1.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dex2jar1.png" alt="" width="211" height="326"></a><figcaption>Packages and classes from the decompiled <code>classes.dex</code> file</figcaption></figure><p>The name of the <code>com.bz.cityisland2</code> package actually refers to the original game that <em>City Management</em> is based on: <a href="https://www.sparklingsociety.net/sparkling-games/city-building-games/city-island-2/">City Island 2</a> by the Dutch game studio Sparkling Society. The name of the package <code>com.smartions.appprotected</code> refers to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/smartions-ag#section-overview">Smartions</a>, a company that offers solutions to “monetize your mobile game or app in China” and are apparently also City Island’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkling_Society">distributor in China</a>. There are no mentions of those companies in the game itself however. The game’s loading splash screen only tells us that the game was made by the Ryusong (meteor) Technology Exchange Center (류성기술교류소) and that it is protected by the law for the protection of software (<a href="https://www.kisdi.re.kr/kisdi/common/premium?file=1%7C10360">콤퓨터쏘프트웨어보호법</a>). The law has been in place since 2003 to regulate the sales and distribution of software in the country and guarantees software developers the private ownership of their creation.</p>
<figure id="attachment_502"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/kyongyong-1.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/kyongyong-1.png" alt="" width="1000" height="640"></a><figcaption>Loading screen for the game</figcaption></figure><p>It’s hard to tell whether the North Korean version is based on the source code of the original game or if it’s entirely reverse engineered. In any case, the North Korean version does not use Smartions’s monetization system nor Sparkling Society’s but relies on a different system, which is the main difference from the original game. Save for the translation and some minor renames, the game is otherwise similar to the original (from a cursory examination) in its design, gameplay, features… to the original. </p>

The Unity code is stored in various library with the developer’s C# code being compiled to <code>Assembly-CSharp.dll</code>. C# compiled code is easily decompilable using tools such as <a href="https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy">dnSpy</a>. Once the dll is decompiled, we can look for the message we got earlier “열쇠화일이 존재하지 않습니다” (“The key file does not exist”) to find the bits of code we are interested in. The string search takes us to the <code>CIGLoadingScreen</code> class where we find the string among other variables:</p>

<![CDATA[Applying “Make Invalid States Unrepresentable”]]>

October 3, 2020 | https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/articles/applying-misu/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/articles/applying-misu/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting" id="applying-make-invalid-states-unrepresentable">
  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><time itemprop="datePublished">02 October 2020</time></p>

<p>Here are some real life cases of applying one of my
<a href="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/articles/my-principles-for-building-software/">favourite principles</a>.</p>

<p>I’ll try to update this as I come across good examples.</p>

<h2 id="case-1-contiguous-time-periods">Case 1: Contiguous Time Periods</h2>

<p>A straightforward way to represent a period of time is by its start
and end dates (<code>(Date, Date)</code>):</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/c1.png"></p>

<p>If we need to represent a timeline split in to contiguous periods, it
may be tempting to represent this as a sequence of periods (e.g. <code>List
(Date, Date)</code>):</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/c2.png"></p>

<p>However, with this representation there can be both gaps in the
timeline and overlapping periods:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/c3.png"></p>

<h3 id="improved-representation">Improved Representation</h3>

<p>We can improve this representation so that the contiguous and
non-overlapping constraints always hold, and we can do this in a way
that may remind you of database normalisation - by removing
redundancy.</p>

<p>In a well formed contiguous timeline, the joint start/end
of the adjacent periods are redundant. Contiguous, non-overlapping
splits can simply be represented by a set of dates (<code>Set Date</code>):</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/c4.png"></p>

<p>You can begin to see how this representation simplifies the system
when you consider how to make a further split in the timeline. In the
list representation, splitting a period requires carefully modifying
the data-structure and ensuring constraints aren’t violated. In the
‘set of dates’ representation you simply add a date to the set.</p>

<p>It is sometimes still useful to represent the periods as a sequence of
start and end dates. It is trivial to project the set of dates in to
this form. As long as the canonical representation is the set, the
constraints will still hold.</p>

<h2 id="case-2-default-contracts">Case 2: Default Contracts</h2>

<p>In this system, a customer pays us a recurring rent based upon a contract.
Contracts last for a fixed amount of time, and when they expire we fall back to
a ‘default contract’. The customer can have many fixed contracts, and can
sign new contracts at any time.</p>

<p>This was represented as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A ‘customers’ table storing
    <ul>
      <li>The customer start date.</li>
      <li>An optional end date, should the customer leave.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A ‘contracts’ table storing
    <ul>
      <li>The contract start date.</li>
      <li>An optional end date, for default contracts that don’t end.</li>
      <li>If it was a ‘fixed’ or ‘default’ contract.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/f1.png"></p>
<p>Customer and contract timelines</p>

<p>This representation allows for some undesirable states that are trivial to prevent:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The customer may have gaps in their contracts.</li>
  <li>A fixed contract may not have an end date.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/f2.png"></p>
<p>Contract gaps</p>

<p>To make matters worse, the API for these contracts allowed you to
modify each individual contract, fixed or default, without guarding against
these states. This shows how a poor choice of
representation propagates itself through the design of a system.</p>

<p>This poor choice was not just a theoretical problem -
gaps in contracts were found on more than one occasion, requiring
hours of engineering effort to hunt down and fix.</p>

<h3 id="improved-representation-1">Improved Representation</h3>

<p>This is easily improved by removing the ‘default’ contracts from the
contract table. If the customer doesn’t have a fixed contract, it is
assumed they are on a default contract:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/f3.png"></p>
<p>Inferred default contracts</p>

<p>Now there can no longer be any gaps, and 
the end date of a contract no longer needs to be optional as it only represents fixed contracts.</p>

<p>It’s worth reiterating that this representation can be projected in to the previous
representation using a database view if that form is more convenient. What is
important is that the underlying representation enforces these constraints, it
is not important how you view the data.</p>

<p>As with the first case, a better representation makes the manipulation
of the data structure simpler. In this case, adding a new fixed contract is
greatly simplified. There is no need to create or modify default contracts, or ensure
that the contracts are contiguous.</p>

<h3 id="the-influence-of-object-oriented-thinking">The Influence of Object-Oriented Thinking</h3>

<p>If this improvement seems obvious to you, you may wonder how the
original design happened in the first place.</p>

<p>I think this happens because of atomistic, object-oriented thinking.</p>

<p>In this mindset, the fixed contracts are <em>objects</em>, the default contracts are
<em>objects</em>, and each of these concepts must be reified as a row in a table and
never inferred.
There is a distrust of using any features the database
offers beyond storing or retrieving <em>objects</em>.</p>

<p>This approach is antithetical to quality relational design and
the principle of making invalid states unrepresentable.</p>

<p>It may feel “simpler” on some level, as you don’t really need
to think about your design.
However, as we see here, this lack of forethought inevitably
leads to complexity.</p>

In Germany, however, it is much higher, instead of only about 7%, the share of Firefox in Germany is almost 21%.</li><li>The use of Safari (iOS and desktop) in the USA is significantly higher than the world average and in Germany.</li><li>However, Chrome (mobile) and Samsung Internet have higher shares in Germany than in the USA. But Chrome (mobile) in Germany still has less than worldwide.</li></ul><p>The higher share of Safari in the USA can probably be explained relatively by the higher market share of Apple in the USA. While many people in Germany tend to rely more on Android smartphones (and Windows PCs), the iPhone (and Mac) share is significantly higher in the USA.

  <h2><a href="https://blog.steve.fi/writing_an_assembler_.html">Writing an assembler.</a></h2>
  <p>3 October 2020 13:00</p>
  <div><p>Recently I've been writing a couple of simple compilers, which take input in a particular format and generate assembly language output.  This output can then be piped through <code>gcc</code> to generate a native executable.</p>

<p>Public examples include this trivial <a href="https://github.com/skx/math-compiler" rel="nofollow">math compiler</a> and my <a href="https://github.com/skx/bfcc" rel="nofollow">brainfuck compiler</a>.</p>

<p>Of course there's always the nagging thought that relying upon <code>gcc</code> (or <code>nasm</code>) is a bit of a cheat.  So I wondered how hard is it to write an assembler?  Something that would take assembly-language program and generate a native (ELF) binary?</p>

<p>And the answer is "It isn't hard, it is just tedious".</p>

<p>I found <a href="https://github.com/vishen/go-x64-executable/" rel="nofollow">some code</a> to generate an ELF binary, and after that assembling simple instructions was pretty simple.  I remember from my assembly-language days that the encoding of instructions can be pretty much handled by tables, but I've not yet gone into that.</p>

<p>(Specifically there are instructions like "<code>add rax, rcx</code>", and the encoding specifies the source/destination registers - with different forms for various sized immediates.)</p>

<p>Anyway I hacked up a simple assembler, it can compile <code>a.out</code> from this input:</p>

<pre><code>.hello   DB "Hello, world\n"
.goodbye DB "Goodbye, world\n"

        mov rdx, 13        ;; write this many characters
        mov rcx, hello     ;; starting at the string
        mov rbx, 1         ;; output is STDOUT
        mov rax, 4         ;; sys_write
        int 0x80           ;; syscall

        mov rdx, 15        ;; write this many characters
        mov rcx, goodbye   ;; starting at the string
        mov rax, 4         ;; sys_write
        mov rbx, 1         ;; output is STDOUT
        int 0x80           ;; syscall


        xor rbx, rbx       ;; exit-code is 0
        xor rax, rax       ;; syscall will be 1 - so set to xero, then increase
        inc rax            ;;
        int 0x80           ;; syscall
</code></pre>

<p>The obvious omission is support for "JMP", "JMP_NZ", etc.  That's painful because jumps are encoded with relative offsets.  For the moment if you want to jump:</p>

<pre><code>        push foo     ; "jmp foo" - indirectly.
        ret

:bar
        nop          ; Nothing happens
        mov rbx,33   ; first syscall argument: exit code
        mov rax,1    ; system call number (sys_exit)
        int 0x80     ; call kernel

:foo
        push bar     ; "jmp bar" - indirectly.
        ret
</code></pre>

<p>I'll update to add some more instructions, and see if I can use it to handle the output I generate from a couple of other tools.  If so that's a win, if not then it was a fun learning experience:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/skx/assembler/" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/skx/assembler/</a></li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header></header><section><p>Sofware dysfunction is more often motivated by anxiety, fear, worry and embarassment than it is by a lack of technical skill. Engineers avoid work that needs doing because they’re afraid of becoming entangled with a nightmarish task, or because they’re afraid of looking stupid, or harming their career by spending time on grungy work. The task itself is rarely that difficult; it just seems so, which is enough of a barrier to discourage anyone from picking it up. One of the highest-leverage things you can do as an engineer is to recognize this emotional reaction in yourself and work to counter it. If you’re working on a single task, doing this can make your implementation significantly cleaner. If you’re a senior engineer with responsibility for a whole system, this can help you address high-impact architectural or operational issues.</p>
<p>You can see this in the common advice to sleep on a problem and come back to it in the morning. A bug that seems impossible when you’re tired and frustrated is far more approachable when you’re well-rested and caffeinated. Tedious investigative tasks (like scanning the logs for a bug or tracing all the possible code paths in a function) are still tedious in the morning, but infinitely more doable. You can knock it out in half an hour while drinking your morning coffee, rather than spending hours the night before avoiding the tedious work and hoping for a flash of inspiration.</p>
<p>Necessary work avoided becomes a haunted forest in the codebase. One engineer’s avoidant emotions turn into dangerous team habits as engineers teach each other to avoid touching certain files, or to pass odd-looking production bugs to the operations team. “This network behaviour is dark magic, let them handle it!” What began as a single engineer’s worry is now a team’s dysfunction, and can eventually metastasize into actively blocking engineers from working on the original technical problems: if you’re avoiding working on a worrying problem, it can feel threatening when someone else comes along and tries to solve it. What if they succeed, or worse still succeed easily? That would reveal that you weren’t good enough to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Just because you’re touching a scary part of the system doesn’t mean you’re facing scary work calmly and rationally. Engineers often approach thorny work like they’re going through a haunted house: either trudging through with eyes half-closed, or rushing through at full speed trying to get out as quickly as possible. Both tactics aim to take in as little of the frightening environment as possible, and neither tactic is a good way of solving real problems in technical systems. If you’ve ever just tweaked setings or frantically moved code around until it worked, you’ve done this.</p>
<p>From the inside, this doesn’t feel like emotionally-driven avoidance. It feels like working on legacy code, sharing friendly complaints about it with other engineers on your team. This is in part because a fear of hard technical problems can be a rational fear. Untangling messy parts of the codebase, identifying and removing dead code, cleaning up build, deploy and monitoring systems - these tasks often feel overwhelming because they can overwhelm you, sucking up days for no real gain. It can harm your career to spend time on this work in an org that mainly values shipping features. (I haven’t seen the other common worry - looking stupid - really be an issue in practice myself.) The trouble comes when you don’t recognise that part of your response is emotional, and therefore overrate the actual difficulty or risk.</p>
<p>How can you distinguish a rational response to a too-difficult task from a learned emotional reaction to a task that is merely worrying? This is a hard problem. I think it is the hardest problem that almost all engineers will regularly face. One approach is to avoid trying to tell the difference at all, and allot a certain amount of time to looking at randomly-chosen neglected parts of the system. Things that reduce stress in general are also good ways to reduce stress and worry about work. Good sleep, eating well, exercise, therapy, and working in an emotionally safe team all have a significant positive effect on the quality of engineering work. Once you start doing this, the difference is usually obvious in hindsight: if the task that worried you for six months took an hour or two of work when you finally mustered up the effort to look at it, you know your worry was unfounded. Dealing with worry is a virtuous cycle. Each difficult task you do makes you less scared of the next one.</p>
<p>Tackling a series of worrying tasks is one of the quickest ways I know to have massive impact in your engineering org. This is because once you understand a thorny piece of code, or a neglected system, you will usually see how to make obvious improvements. In any other part of the system these improvements would have been made already, but since you are the first person to really wrap your head around it in a long time, you get to make them here! Occasionally, you will see the opportunity to completely remove the worrying part of the system, which for me is one of the most satisfying things you can do as a software engineer. Removing things that cause your team stress has compounding benefits to your team, to the systems you work on, and to your engineering org in general.</p></section><hr></article></div>]]>

<![CDATA[An Honest Review of Gatsby]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>We decided to adopt Gatsby for <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/">Sentry’s customer-facing documentation</a> - well, I should say that <em>I</em> decided. We were already using it successfully for a variety of static marketing content, and I knew it had a lot of hype, so after a brief proof-of-concept it seemed like a safe choice.</p>
<p>To help contextualize everything I’m about to say, it’s important to understand the scope of our usage. Sentry’s documentation is not as straightforward as you might think - in fact, there are over 3,000 pages as of writing. We have a large amount of templated content designed to render language-specific examples, as well as a variety of different types of documentation (user guides, help desk-y articles, code-rich technical docs). Originally we had extended Jekyll to support a lot of this, but Ruby isn’t widely used at Sentry (approximately 0% of the engineering team knows Ruby), and it had become a big mess of spaghetti code with slow build times.</p>
<p>I also want to note that while this blog post is primarily focusing on the flaws of Gatsby as a framework, I’m not here to tell you that it’s not good for your use case. That said, I was not able to discover many of these short comings easily when evaluating Gatsby, and many things you read on the internet don’t stem out of real-world usage. My hope here is that Gatsby continues to improve over time, and that, as a user, you can be more informed about if it’s the right choice for you.</p>
<h2>Adopting Gatsby</h2>
<p>So, enter Gatsby. It seemed fast, was built on React (we’re experts on that here, with our gigabyte-sized Sentry frontend app), and had a huge adoption (assumed future existence and stability). While we didn’t have the desire to use MDX, it also seemed like a positive outcome given we could more easily deal with some of the rich aspects of our docs site, without having to resort to 2010-era JavaScript. We assumed a bunch of the other features of Gatsby had value-add, but we didn’t have an immediate need. These were things like dynamic source data - thus the need for a GraphQL engine at all - as well as the large plug-in ecosystem.</p>
<p>We started by iteratively converting sections of the Jekyll site into Gatsby - running them side by side for a time. At one point we eventually bulk converted pages, and ripped off the band aid. At this point though it was becoming clear build times were a problem. You’d spend at least 5 minutes on image optimization alone, with no way to even disable that. Slowly but surely we were depleting the ozone later on re-optimizing images which had already been pre-optimized. Oh yeah, and we were crippling our iteration speed as well, since the build cache would invalidate under a variety of situations in early development.</p>
<p>Making this worse was how we deployed Gatsby. We started off leveraging what we had already done: deploying Jekyll with Docker onto our own infrastructure - effectively just proxied via a CDN. We continued that for a period of time, but deploy times were far too long - upwards of 30-40 minutes for everything to build. Eventually we moved over to <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> which dropped it down closer to 10 minutes, but ultimately it can’t fix what it doesn’t control.</p>
<p>The build and deploy times were the first of many woes, and they represent what would become a continued frustration: a problem without a clear solution.</p>
<h2>Enter MDX</h2>
<p>Rewind time a little bit - this actually wasn’t our first project converting documentation to Gatsby. The proof-of-concept I mentioned earlier was actually our <a href="https://develop.sentry.dev/">developer documentation</a>, which I had migrated out of Notion to make public. While doing that we had gotten our hands dirty with some initial MDX usability and extensions - like our code samples which support toggling between different languages. This was one of the many things we needed to solve for, but MDX made it look like it’d be seemingly easy. No more jQuery DOM manipulation, just clean, encapsulated React components. Or so we thought.</p>
<p>Almost immediately we hit rough spots with MDX. We were coming from Jekyll - which was Liquid-rendered (a template engine) markdown - to MDX - a strange offspring of Markdown and JSX, attempting all of the benefits of both, but missing by a fairly large margin. Let’s illustrate the crux of the issue with what has got to be one of the most common needs in a documentation system: an alert (or callout) component:</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Alert</span> <span>level</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>info<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>You should know something important about this!<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>Alert</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>At face value this looks great. <code>Alert</code> is just a React component, and JSX is close enough to HTML that non-technical folks are able to pick it up fairly easily. Now the problem comes into play when you actually want to do something in the real world. Here’s an example from our API docs:</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Alert</span> <span>level</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>warning<span>"</span></span> <span>title</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Note<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span>**</span><span>PUT/DELETE</span><span>**</span></span> methods only apply to updating/deleting issues.
Events in sentry are immutable and can only be deleted by deleting the whole issue.
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>Alert</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>How would you expect this to render? Both as an engineer and a non-engineer, I would expect - given this is markdown - that the “PUT/DELETE” text would be bold. It’s not. Because the MDX interpreter decides that once you enter a component block, it’s no longer markdown. So instead, we’re forced with this monstrosity <em>everywhere</em> in our documentation:</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Alert</span> <span>level</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>warning<span>"</span></span> <span>title</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Note<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>markdown</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<span><span>**</span><span>PUT/DELETE</span><span>**</span></span> methods only apply to updating/deleting issues.
Events in sentry are immutable and can only be deleted by deleting the whole issue.

<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>markdown</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>Alert</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>There’s two things you should note here: 1) we have to use this <code>&lt;markdown&gt;</code> tag, 2) we have to put empty new-lines to ensure paragraph tags render.</p>
<p>“But David”, you might say, “why don’t you just tell the <code>Alert</code> component to render the text as markdown?“. If only you could, or at least, if only I could have possibly found a way to achieve that as a user with minimal Gatsby or MDX internals knowledge.</p>
<p>To Gatsby, or at least to the MDX team’s credit, they recognize some of these problems and <a href="https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/issues/1041">there is work underway</a> on a 2.0 of the MDX dialect. While I’m confident they will improve things, I’m not confident MDX can ultimately succeed. It’s likely going to tradeoff one problem for another due to what it’s trying to achieve in the first place. It may get to a good place, but frankly, we need to step back and look at what we’re trying to solve, instead of creating a solution to a problem we don’t have. I don’t need JSX syntax in my markdown, I need a way to include JSX components. That might sound similar, but its quite a different thing.</p>
<p>As an example, there’s no reason I couldn’t simply use markdown syntax, and provide a way to achieve something akin to:</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>a-valid-html-tag-because-markdown-allows-that</span> <span>a-valid-property</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>a-value<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This wouldn’t force us to work around quirks in a new language (or interpreter even), and could be solved in a much more sustainable way. There are other alternatives as well. A generic way to render extensions in markdown could simply call into a React component, and avoid even trying to hijack HTML in the first place. While I don’t know what this might look like in Markdown, in <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html">Sphinx’s use of reStructuredText</a> this was solved early on with Directives:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>.. my-directive:: some data
   :property-name: property-value</code></pre></div>
<p>I will hold out for MDX 2.0 and hope that finds a nice minimal-compromise place, but if not, we’ll be looking for a way to extend native markdown.</p>
<h2>A Broken DOM</h2>
<p>While we were able to work around the kinks of MDX, there’s been some things not yet solved. One of those is the layer which Gatsby uses to apply diffs to the DOM. I’m going to caveat this section with <em>I don’t know what the technical implementation is</em>, but I can make some assumptions given what I know of the domain. The system itself is intended to apply deltas to the DOM. This is naively also how React works, and I imagine under the hood it’s relying on React at least for part of it. We’ve had issues with this identified in two places already:</p>
<ul>
<li>progressive image loading</li>
<li>dynamic JSX components</li>
</ul>
<p>While they might not be linked to the same issue, they smell like they are, so we’re going to roll with it. The problem exhibits itself when you have a bunch of DOM that to a naive robot might look the same:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>&lt;div&gt;foo&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;bar&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;baz&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;foobizbar&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>In React it uses the graph to identify which node is which - effectively creating a unique entity ID based on its location. In cases where that’s difficult, React will warn you to explicitly bind a <code>key</code> attribute on each element to ensure it can more accurately deal with updates. While I would assume Gatsby is at least partially using React’s DOM engine, what we see in production effectively takes the above example, and replaces some of the content with other subsets of content - meaning it’s unable to accurately identify which nodes need updated.</p>
<p>We’ve seen this where a progressive image is replaced with an entirely different image that’s present near it on the page. We’ve also seen this happen for a dynamically loaded section of content (our language-selector include tags). While we’ve yet to identify a fix for the image tags, our other issue was resolved by literally changing a <code>div</code> tag to a different tag, one which is less commonly used (in our case, <code>section</code>).</p>
<p>All of the cases happen after Gatsby’s initial static render and exist only when applying some form of delta.</p>
<h2>Let’s Talk GraphQL</h2>
<p>It’s a static website generator. It literally does not need GraphQL all over the place. While there are few instances in the real world where that is valuable, it shouldn’t require a GraphQL API to read objects that are already in memory.</p>
<p>I don’t want to spend the energy to hammer this in, but take a look at Jared Palmer’s <a href="https://jaredpalmer.com/gatsby-vs-nextjs">Gatsby vs. Next.js</a> as it echoes my thoughts.</p>
<p>So, let’s actually not talk about GraphQL, but all its done is create complexity for us.</p>
<h2>Minor Gripes</h2>
<p>There’s a number of other things we’ve found fairly frustrating at this point, but this post is already getting long, so I’m choosing to summarize them.</p></section></div>

    <section>
      <p>When the engineering managers I coach struggle to find ambitious goals, I sometimes leverage their ambitions to help them identify areas where they can improve. But, to my surprise, not so many EMs have ambitions beyond their current role.</p><p>When I had a “real job”, I was always driven by the next thing. I didn’t care about the title, but I always wanted more impact and responsibilities (in six years and two companies, I had seven different positions 😅). While I don’t recommend being as “opportunistic” as I was (but hey, I ended up being an entrepreneur), I do believe that thinking about the next position gives you <strong>perspective and makes you more in control of your career</strong>. But the difference between thinking about your next promotion and getting it is enormous. </p><p>Many engineers believe that if you do great work at your job, people will recognise that work and automatically give you an adequate promotion or raise. It is unfortunately far from reality, as <strong>those who get promoted, are not the best employees, but the more visible</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/10/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image.png 600w, https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/10/image.png 900w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Dilbert.com</figcaption></figure><h3 id="visibility-matters"><strong>Visibility matters</strong></h3><p>Think about your CTO’s typical day (or the VP Engineering, the one who will eventually decide on your promotion). They might have eight to ten meetings to attend, tens of emails (or Slack messages) to answer and they always have to switch their mind to a different project or a new problem that needs to be solved. So, unless you’re involved in the problem du jour, the number of seconds the CTO is thinking about you in a day is about zero. Pretty normal right? The CTO is a busy gal and can’t think about every single team member. But if you’re serious about this promotion, <strong>she should hear about you often</strong>. </p><p>In an <a href="https://staffeng.com/stories/katie-sylor-miller">interview with StaffEng</a>, Katie Sylor-Miller, a Frontend Architect at Etsy, says that “<em>a big part of being promoted [...] is making sure that your work is visible, that people know your name and you have a good reputation.</em>” I’m sure you’re thinking right now about OKRs, performance reviews, one-on-one(s) with your boss and all the other mechanisms in place at your company to make your work visible. Unfortunately, as rightly pointed out by <a href="https://defmacro.substack.com/p/how-to-get-promoted">Slava Akhmechet</a>, a product manager at Stripe, they’re too often <strong>“social fiction”</strong>:</p><blockquote><em>Following the overt mechanisms of advancement is neither sufficient nor necessary. It may even be actively harmful - almost everyone who does great work and takes performance reviews seriously toils in relative obscurity. Look at the people who occupy positions of considerable authority in your organisation. Did any of them get there by following some middle manager's feedback?</em></blockquote><p>Instead of social fiction, I think the word “game” is more appropriate for the advancement system in most companies (and any human interactions by the way). Since I’m pretty sure you’ve spent countless hours like me playing video games (or still do 🎮), how do you win at video games? <strong>You game the system</strong>.</p><h3 id="understand-the-promotion-process-at-your-company"><strong>Understand the promotion process at your company</strong></h3><p>If you’re currently an engineering manager, any promotion from now on will make you part of your company’s leadership team. And, as pointed out by <a href="https://lethain.com/being-visible/">Will Larson</a>, “<em>existing members of that team want to be comfortable that they’re expanding their ranks with folks they believe in, and they can’t believe in you if they don’t know you.</em>”</p><figure><img src="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/10/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-1.png 600w, https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/10/image-1.png 1240w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>FangXianUo/iStock</figcaption></figure><p>As an engineering manager, you’re not contributing anymore to the codebase. You’re<strong> contributing to the company’s success</strong>. Managing your team is the means to get there, not the goal. More specifically, an engineering manager contributes to the company’s success by:</p><p><strong>1/ Attracting and retaining the very best engineers</strong>: like <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/">Joel Spolsky</a>, I firmly believe that an organisation “<em>where the best software developers in the world would want to work [leads] to profits as naturally as chocolate leads to chubbiness.</em>” So even if there is a process in place to attract engineers, everyone in the company will thank you if you managed to score a high-profile recruit (while saving thousands in headhunter’s fees). Some tips for doing so:</p><ul><li><strong>Be recognised externally as an expert</strong> and someone great engineers would want to work with (blogging, speaking…)</li><li><strong>Continuously look for talent</strong>, especially visible ones (the ones who blog, speak, live code, contribute to open source…) and invite them for informal interviews</li><li><strong>Mentor external engineers</strong> pro-bono, even if they don’t end working for you, they sometimes have friends who might</li></ul><p><strong>2/ Shipping revenue-generating projects</strong>: for any company out there, technology is just the means to make more money. So which projects in your company right now have the highest revenue-generating potential? There are usually three or four such projects per year, so you need to make sure your team is involved in these projects, even if it means <strong>being proactive about it and not waiting for your manager to assign it to you</strong>. When I was an employee, I used to regularly crash meetings (or discussions at the coffee counter) and see if I could be useful to a project.</p><p><strong>3/ Proactively solving problems:</strong> I’m sure you’re the kind of person who always presents problems with a solution. What’s even better is for you to <strong>start solving the problem before your boss is even aware of it</strong>. CTOs have to make countless decisions every day, and they need to know they can count on leaders in their team to be proactive and make the right decisions for them. Obviously, this action shouldn't say hidden and you would have sent a message to the leadership with information about the problem, what your team is doing to solve it and a deadline.</p><h3 id="building-your-promotion-playbook">Building your promotion playbook</h3><p>When I was advising startups on fundraising, most of the work we were doing was building up a great story that would unroll during the roadshow (3 to 6 months). Getting promoted is not the same as fundraising, but the mechanism is similar:</p><p><strong>1/ Make your intentions known</strong>: promotion is a two-way street, and your management should be aware of your objectives, as well as you should be aware of what they’re expecting from someone who does your targeted job. Ideally, they should state clearly what you should be demonstrating to get the job so that you can show you’ve done it when the time is right.</p><p><strong>2/ Keep a log of your achievements and impact:</strong> start a <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/">brag document</a> or a <a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/promo-packets">promotion packet</a> that will be the base for any communication about your team’s accomplishments (especially the ones on high-impact projects).</p><p><strong>3/ Make it impossible for them to say no</strong>: when it’s promotion or review time, build a short presentation that shows factually how you achieved what the management expected of you and your team’s successes.</p><p>Keep in mind that <strong>the higher you go on the management ladder, the fewer positions are available</strong>. Sometimes you might want to make a lateral move at a smaller company to build up more responsibilities (like becoming CTO or VPE at a startup) before going back to a more mature company.</p><p>Last but not least, it’s essential to understand that while thinking about your next promotion should not be your main focus, <strong>it is part of your job</strong>. There are still way too many opportunistic leaders in technology organisations and not enough people like you. So please do me a favour, keep doing a great job AND get that promotion instead of all the opportunistic contenders 😉</p><hr><h3 id="news"><strong>News</strong></h3><p><em>This section is only available to email subscribers. <a href="https://www.tlt21.com/signup/">Sign up</a>, it's free!</em></p><hr><h3 id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h3><ul><li>Thinking about getting promoted gives you perspective and makes you more in control of your career</li><li>Those who get promoted are not the best employees, but the more visible</li><li>To be more visible: attract high-level engineers, ship revenue-generating projects, proactively solve problems</li><li>Getting promoted is a 6-month process that resembles a fundraising roadshow</li></ul><h3 id="reading-list"><strong>Reading List</strong></h3><p>[RESOURCE] <a href="https://progression.monzo.com/techops"><strong>Progression at Monzo</strong></a> - Monzo</p><p>[ESSAY] <strong><a href="https://defmacro.substack.com/p/how-to-get-promoted">How to get promoted</a> </strong>- Slava Akhmechet</p><p>[ESSAY] <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-promotions/"><strong>Software Developer Promotions: Advice to Get to That Next Level</strong></a> - Gergely Orosz</p><p>[ESSAY] <a href="https://lethain.com/being-visible/"><strong>Being visible</strong></a> - Will Larson</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikipage">

<p>People were arguing about Rust’s std lib recently, so I went through the <code>Cargo.toml</code> of all the Rust projects I’ve written since 2015 and picked out the choice tools that get used over and over again. Up to date as of October 2020.</p>
<p>Also see <a href="https://wiki.alopex.li/RustCrates" title="Go to wiki page">RustCrates</a>, though that’s old. There’s also <a href="https://christine.website/blog/rust-crates-go-stdlib-2020-09-27">this</a>, which is narrower but deeper, and <a href="https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust">awesome-rust</a>, which is shallower and broader, and the various <a href="https://www.arewewebyet.org/">more</a> <a href="https://arewegameyet.rs/">specific</a> <a href="https://areweasyncyet.rs/">websites</a> <a href="https://www.areweguiyet.com/">for various</a> <a href="https://areweideyet.com/">topics</a>.</p>

<p>I need to set up a new Rust dev environment, what do I install?</p>
<h2 id="linting-clippy">Linting – <code>clippy</code></h2>
<p>The one, the only, the great Rust style and correctness linter. Want to learn how to write “idiomatic” Rust, or just learn more about handy little corners of the language and library? Run <code>clippy</code> regularly. It’s distributed with the compiler via <code>rustup</code> now, so you have no excuse not to.</p>
<h2 id="build-cache-sccache">Build cache – <code>sccache</code></h2>
<p>Or, “how to make a full rebuild 70% faster”. <code>sccache</code> is a build artifact cache similar to <code>icecream</code> or <code>ccache</code>, except it’s actually trivial to just use. <code>cargo install sccache</code>, add a single line in a home dir config file, and you’re ready to go. Pretty much handles most crate and compiler versioning issues for you, so it Just Works if you update crates or install a new version of <code>rustc</code> or something. I think I’ve had to force-clear the cache due to some build weirdness a grand total of once. Looks like it has enough features to use in a professional context as well, at least on a small-to-medium scale.</p>
<h2 id="dependency-viewer-cargo-tree">Dependency viewer – <code>cargo-tree</code></h2>
<p>The best way to view what dependencies you are using, and what dependencies they are using, and so on. Best way to start cracking down on flabby dependencies.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarking-criterion">Benchmarking – <code>criterion</code></h2>
<p>Basically the best benchmark system out there. Incredibly simple to use, informative, and statistically sound. Doesn’t really do profiling, but it’s a good start for understanding your program’s performance, and better for proving that your implementation of X is faster than someone else’s.</p>
<h2 id="other-things">Other things</h2>
<p>Stuff that is less general purpose but occasionally very useful for the meta-programming process of choosing libraries, evaluating them, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cargo-geiger</code> – Measures how much unsafe code is in a codebase, and its dependencies</li>
<li><code>cargo-crev</code> – A <a href="https://wiki.alopex.li/ActuallyUsingCrev">very neat tool</a> for authoring and verifying distributed code reviews.</li>
<li>Various tools maintained by <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-ecosystem">Embark Studios</a>, useful for production/company purposes like checking licenses, pinning specific versions of crates, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The cool stuff Real Computer Scientists write about.</p>
<h2 id="hashing">Hashing</h2>
<p>No specific crates here. There’s no single crate that provides All The Hash Algorithms, just lots of little ones that generally provide a single algorithm each. Just type the name of the algorithm you want into <code>crates.io</code> and you’ll get at least a couple options, choose the one with 8 million downloads or whatever. <code>sha2</code>, <code>md5</code>, <code>crc</code>, etc. Lots of them are written by the Rust core team.</p>
<h2 id="compression">Compression</h2>
<p>Same as the hashing category. Type <code>zip</code> or <code>bzip2</code> or whatever into crates.io and you’ll get what you need. <code>flate2</code> might be the one crate that’s not quite trivial to find. Again, many of them are written by the Rust core team.</p>
<h2 id="encryption">Encryption</h2>
<p>I have little actual experience or authority on this topic, so I’m going to punt on this one.</p>
<h2 id="pseudorandom-number-generator">Pseudorandom number generator</h2>
<p>Use <code>oorandom</code>. (Disclaimer, I wrote <code>oorandom</code>, but people besides me seem to like it.) More usually you’ll see the <code>rand</code> crate in use. If you’re doing Real Science and need to generate <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/routines.random.html">fancy probabilities</a>, then <code>rand</code> is the right tool, but most people aren’t doing that. Otherwise <code>rand</code> is complicated and has lots of features, while <code>oorandom</code> is very simple and has about two features, and I expect 80% of code to use at least one of them. <code>rand</code> has had several major breaking changes in its history that the rest of the ecosystem still hasn’t caught up with, while I intend <code>oorandom</code>’s API to change maybe twice in my lifetime. (Its version number, while obeying semver, is mostly a joke.)</p>
<p>There’s other lightweight PRNG crates that are just fine; see <code>oorandom</code>’s readme for a list of some others and choose one you like. Whatever you choose, use the <code>getrandom</code> crate to produce Real Random Seeds for it.</p>

<p>“I just need to solve this ooooooone common problem, but it needs to be solved WELL…”</p>
<h2 id="logging-log">Logging – <code>log</code></h2>
<p>Need to output log messages in your code? Why, use the <code>log</code> crate. Where do the log messages go? <code>log</code> provides only an interface, and that interface compiles to nothing if it isn’t used. You can write your own system for it to actually output the logs to, which is pretty easy, or use one of the small plethora of crates for it. My preferred one is <code>pretty_env_logger</code>, but <code>fern</code>, <code>slog</code> and others are all good too.</p>
<h2 id="parallel-data-crunching-rayon">Parallel data crunching – <code>rayon</code></h2>
<p>Ever have some computation where you have a big list of STUFF and want to process it in parallel, farming out jobs to as many threads as you have CPU’s? That’s what <code>rayon</code> does, and it does it really, really well. You still <a href="https://aspenuwu.me/posts/rust-optimization.html">have to know what you’re doing</a>, but changing a single <code>.iter()</code> into <code>.par_iter()</code> and watching your CPU-bound data-crunching run 8x faster is pretty magical. Now your CPU can help keep you warm this winter!</p>
<p>Please never use it in a library. It’s rude to spawn threads in library code, unless that’s specifically what the library is for.</p>
<h2 id="regexes-regex">Regexes – <code>regex</code></h2>
<p>To quote the inestimable <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/">jwz</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://xkcd.com/208/">somebody’s gotta save the day</a>. So, use the <code>regex</code> crate. Also use <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ripgrep">anything else</a> <a href="https://crates.io/crates/xsv">written by BurntSushi</a>. BurntSushi is a paragon of Rust program design, and also just a great <del>human being</del> charred cuisine in general.</p>
<h2 id="threadsafe-globals-lazy_static">Threadsafe globals – <code>lazy_static</code></h2>
<p>“I know globals are evil,” you say, “but I just need one. I’ll only use it for good, I promise.” <code>lazy_static</code> has your back.</p>
<p>May eventually be superseded by <code>once_cell</code>, which looks like its <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2788">headed for inclusion into <code>std</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="serializationdeserialization-serde">Serialization/deserialization – <code>serde</code></h2>
<p>Ever have a struct and just wanted to turn it into JSON, CBOR, XML, or some other engine of woe and devastation designed to be written to an I/O stream? Or had a blob of random JSON and wanted to just stuff it into a struct matching it? Sure you have. <code>serde</code> lets you do this with a single <code>#[derive]</code>. <code>serde</code> is without a doubt one of Rust’s killer libraries. It is better than any other serialization system I have ever used.</p>
<p>What data formats does it support? Anything; the actual reading and writing is done via plugin library. There’s a <a href="https://serde.rs/#data-formats">wide selection of them</a>, of varying quality, and writing your own is a little tedious but not terribly difficult.</p>
<h2 id="error-handling">Error handling</h2>
<p>This spot deliberately left blank.</p>
<p>Rust’s <code>Result&lt;T,E&gt;</code> type is one of the best setups for lightweight, transparent error handling I’ve seen, but it doesn’t do everything. How do you easily write your own error type without a bunch of boilerplate? What if you have multiple different error types from different libraries you want to coalesce together? How do you collect a backtrace of every function an <code>Err</code> is returned through, so you can find the root cause of where it came from? Can we do all this without allocating anything unnecessarily? And so on.</p>
<p>There have been various crates to try to solve these problems. First in 2015 there was <code>error_chain</code>, which was complicated and not very convenient. Then in 2017 there was <code>failure</code>, which was simpler but not very flexible, and which took an irritatingly long time to compile. Then in 2019 there was <code>anyhow</code>, which was about the time I stopped paying attention. Now apparently the new kid on the block is <code>eyre</code>, and I’m sure that in another year or two there will be something else.</p>
<p>So, I just write the boilerplate and make my errors descriptive enough I don’t need a backtrace. When I want to get fancy I implement the built-in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html"><code>Error</code></a> trait, which used to be kinda useless but is now more helpful. And in another five years it’ll still work just fine.</p>
<h2 id="byte-mucking-bytemuck">Byte mucking – <code>bytemuck</code></h2>
<p>For the rare occasions you need to turn a structure into arbitrary <code>&amp;[u8]</code> or back. Doing this using unsafe pointers is quite easy, and also makes it very easy to screw up horribly with Undefined Behavior galore. (Did you know that changing the value of padding bytes in a struct in UB? You do now.) <code>bytemuck</code> lets you muck around with bytes a little more responsibly.</p>
<h2 id="human-dates-and-times-chrono">Human dates and times – <code>chrono</code></h2>
<p>Rust’s <code>std::time</code> doesn’t really handle calendar or wall-clock times, just arbitrary, monotonic <code>Instant</code>’s and measurable <code>Duration</code>’s between them. Nice, pure, computationally-robust time measurement. For all the nasty human calendar and timezone stuff, you use <code>chrono</code>. (And maybe <code>humantime</code>, but I personally reach for <code>chrono</code> first, just out of habit.)</p>
<h2 id="bit-flags-bitflags">Bit flags – <code>bitflags</code></h2>
<p>Defining type-safe bit-masks in a reasonably convenient way. Not always worth the trouble, but sometimes pretty convenient.</p>

<p>“I have to create or read a…”</p>
<h2 id="pngjpeggifetc-image">PNG/JPEG/GIF/etc – <code>image</code></h2>
<p>General-purpose loading and saving and images, which can handle a lot of formats. Can do some amount of image manipulation as well, such as cropping, smoothing, etc. but that will hopefully be pulled out into its own library at some point soon.</p>
<h2 id="small-data-things-uuid-base64-csv-semver">Small data THINGS – <code>uuid</code>, <code>base64</code>, <code>csv</code>, <code>semver</code>…</h2>
<p>Exactly what it says on the tin.</p>

<p>Not aware of any great encoders, but there’s plenty of <em>decoders</em> for common audio formats. <code>lewton</code> for Ogg Vorbis, <code>hound</code> for .wav, <code>minimp3</code> for MP3, <code>claxon</code> for FLAC. Video, I haven’t used enough to have an opinion on.</p>
<h2 id="config-files-toml">Config files – <code>toml</code></h2>
<p>For all your config file format needs. Works with <code>serde</code>, naturally.</p>
<h2 id="markdown-pulldown-cmark">Markdown – <code>pulldown-cmark</code></h2>
<p>There’s several good Markdown readers and writers, <code>pulldown-cmark</code> is my favorite. It supports CommonMark, it’s simple to use, and it’s pure Rust.</p>
<h2 id="templating-askama">Templating – <code>askama</code></h2>
<p>There’s several quite good text templating engines, but <code>askama</code> IMO rises above them all by compiling your templates into Rust code and type-checking your templates at compile time. Sometimes this isn’t what you want, but it is a great feature surprisingly often. This also makes it super fast, for when you really need to …</p></div></div>

        <article>
    

    <p>I’ve always been fascinated by CPython and C language companionship.
On the one hand, we’ve got a comprehensive and straightforward tool, and on the other — 
performant and low-level one. I’d even say that this synergy is one of the main 
pillars that have led to Python’s widespread success nowadays.</p>

<p>However, as an infrequent user of C, I never fully realized how this combination works.
The more I used it, the more questions popped out:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How CPython calls binary executables and what is an ABI?</li>
  <li>Why ctypes and other FFI tools are slower than using C extensions?</li>
  <li>Why it’s not possible to call C++ library?</li>
</ul>

<p>I had no other choice but to take it all apart and look inside.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most of the examples in this article are written in C.
That said, even despite I thoroughly explain all the topics,
<strong>I presume a reader is somewhat familiar with C/C++</strong> and compiled languages.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Let’s start with an exploration of binary executables.</p>

<p>CPUs speak in so-called <strong>machine code</strong> — low-level instructions
that operate directly over CPU memory, registers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit">Arithmetic logic unit</a>, etc.
A naive assumption would be that executables are just a list of such instructions for CPU to run.
Well, that’s not the case.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://azhpushkin.me/assets/images/python_c_abi/compiled_and_cpu.jpg" alt="Not happening.">
    
    <figcaption>Not happening.</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>Compilers generate executable files according to standardized binary file formats.
Such files contain machine code, structured in a certain way,
and wrapped with a plethora of additional metadata.</p>

<p>Operating systems rely heavily on this metadata to determine how binary files should be used.
Because of that, each operating system features some exact format to work with.
Among the most popular ones are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ELF</strong> (Executable and Linkable Format), used by most of Linux distros</li>
  <li><strong>PE</strong> (Portable Executable), used by Windows</li>
  <li><strong>Mach-O</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_(kernel)">Mach</a> object), used by Apple products</li>
</ul>

<p>As a Linux user, I’m using ELF throughout the article.
However, general ideas hold for other systems as well. 
I can also recommend looking at
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/631631/">“How programs get run: ELF binaries”</a>
if you want to learn more about execution flow.</p>

<p>Worth mentioning, even though each OS works with a specific file format,
it does not mean that running others is impossible.
It’s just a matter of parsing and executing machine code correctly.
<a href="https://www.winehq.org/">The Wine project</a> is a perfect example:
it’s a platform that runs PE files (Windows default format) on systems
without native PE support.</p>

<hr color="#dddddd">

<p>We are going to peek into ELF for a moment.
Meet our test subject:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// basics/dullmath.c</span>
<span>int</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>-</span><span>2</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>float</span> <span>get_pi</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span><span>return</span> <span>3</span><span>.</span><span>14</span><span>;}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To use this code from other programs, we need to compile it to the so-called
shared library.</p>

<p><strong>Shared library</strong> (or <strong>shared object</strong>) is an executable binary file intended to
be used by other programs. We compile it once and simply <em>link</em> other programs against it.
Hence the name <em>shared</em> — everyone is using the same binary file.
Besides, there is no need for the <code>main</code> function
as the library is not designed to run standalone.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span># Note the naming convention: `lib&lt;name&gt;.so`</span>
<span>$ </span>gcc <span>-shared</span> <span>-fPIC</span> dullmath.c <span>-o</span> libdullmath.so
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The resulting <code>libdullmath.so</code> is an ELF file.
Note <code>-fPIC</code> compiler argument: it makes machine code
<a href="https://azhpushkin.me/posts/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code">position-independent</a>. This ensures that
the library operates correctly regardless of the memory position, where it is loaded.
You can refer to <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/08/25/load-time-relocation-of-shared-libraries/">“Load-time relocation of shared libraries”</a>
and <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/11/03/position-independent-code-pic-in-shared-libraries/">“Position Independent Code (PIC) in shared libraries”</a> articles for a thorough examination.</p>

<p>Each ELF file contains a list of <strong>symbolic references</strong> (or just <strong>symbols</strong>).
Symbols are used to identify individual machine code sections by names.
We can look at those with a <code>readelf</code> tool to verify that our functions are available:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ readelf -D --symbols libdullmath.so | grep FUNC | grep GLOBAL
  5   1: 0000000000001109    74 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  11 fibonacci
  6   1: 0000000000001153    14 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  11 get_pi
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We also need to make our library visible to our programs. An easiest way to do so
is to copy it to <code>/usr/lib/</code> - default system-wide directory for libraries.</p>

<p>If you’d rather not mess with sudo or system-wide directories, you may as well use 
<code>LIBRARY_PATH</code> and <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variables.
Both add a given path to the list of lookup directories.
<code>LIBRARY_PATH</code> is used by gcc during the compilation, and
<code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> is used by OS at runtime (gcc doesn’t bind location of shared object,
so there is a separate lookup at runtime).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span># Copy to system default location</span>
<span>$ </span><span>sudo cp </span>libdullmath.so /usr/lib/  
<span>$ </span>
<span>$ </span><span># Or use environment variables</span>
<span>$ </span><span>export </span><span>LIBRARY_PATH</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span><span>pwd</span><span>)</span>    <span># add to compilation scope</span>
<span>$ </span><span>export </span><span>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span><span>pwd</span><span>)</span> <span># add to runtime scope</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All the ways of calling C from Python are based on compiling a shared library
and loading it from Python.
So if you don’t feel very familiar with shared libraries, I highly recommend
tinkering around with them for a little. <a href="https://amir.rachum.com/blog/2016/09/17/shared-libraries/">“Shared Libraries: Understanding Dynamic Loading”</a> is a great starting point.</p>



<p>With the shared object compiled, we are ready to call it.</p>

<p>I consider <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html">ctypes</a> to be the easiest way to execute some C code, because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>it’s included in the standard library,</li>
  <li>writing a wrapper uses plain Python.</li>
</ul>

<p>Latter makes ctypes an implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface"><strong>Foreign Function Interface (FFI)</strong></a> for Python.
This is a general name for a mechanism by which you can write code in one programming language
to run another. One that you write is called the <strong>host</strong> language, one that
you execute — the <strong>guest</strong>. In our case, the host is Python, the guest is C.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> import ctypes
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span># note: ctypes require a path to file, not library name</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> lib <span>=</span> ctypes.CDLL<span>(</span>f<span>'/usr/lib/libdullmath.so'</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>

&lt;_FuncPtr object at 0x7f3671537b80&gt;
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> lib.fibonacci

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> lib.other_function   <span># wrong names are not found</span>

    func <span>=</span> self._FuncPtr<span>((</span>name_or_ordinal, self<span>))</span>
AttributeError: /home/.../libdullmath.so: undefined symbol: other_function</code></pre></figure>

<p>All as expected: ctypes uses symbols to find functions, and invalid symbols
usage raises an undefined symbol exception.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>[</span>lib.fibonacci<span>(</span>i<span>)</span> <span>for </span>i <span>in </span>range<span>(</span>7<span>)]</span>
<span>[</span>0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> lib.get_pi<span>()</span>
0
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Yikes! What happened to <code>get_pi()</code>?</p>

<p>Well, to call the function correctly, we need to know the type signature of that function.
ELF does not carry types information, so we need to provide them manually.</p>

<p>ctypes allows this by declaring <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#specifying-the-required-argument-types-function-prototypes">function argument types</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#return-types">return types</a>. Default return type is considered <code>c_int</code>, so that did work out-of-the-box for <code>fibonacci</code> and did not for <code>get_pi</code>.</p>

<p>Easy fix.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> lib.get_pi.restype <span>=</span> ctypes.c_float
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> lib.get_pi<span>()</span>
3.140000104904175
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The exciting part starts once you try to compile this code as a C++ library.
This is an <em>easy way to break this demo down</em>.
As I pointed out at the start of an article, ctypes doesn’t support C++ libraries.
Even though this simple piece of code is perfectly valid as both C and C++.</p>

<p>Check this out:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>g++ <span>-shared</span> dullmath.c <span>-o</span> libdullmath.so  <span># just swap gcc to g++</span>
<span>$ </span>python
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> import ctypes
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> lib <span>=</span> ctypes.CDLL<span>(</span>f<span>'./libdullmath.so'</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> lib.fibonacci
Traceback <span>(</span>most recent call last<span>)</span>:
  File <span>"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span>, line 1, <span>in</span> &lt;module&gt;
  File <span>"/usr/lib/python3.8/ctypes/__init__.py"</span>, line 386, <span>in </span>__getattr__
    func <span>=</span> self.__getitem__<span>(</span>name<span>)</span>
  File <span>"/usr/lib/python3.8/ctypes/__init__.py"</span>, line 391, <span>in </span>__getitem__
    func <span>=</span> self._FuncPtr<span>((</span>name_or_ordinal, self<span>))</span>
AttributeError: /home/.../libdullmath.so: undefined symbol: fibonacci
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To discover why it is so, we need to take a closer look at
machine code, packed inside the generated binary.</p>



<p>As we have found out in the previous chapter, we need to know type signatures
to use a shared library properly. In fact, we need to know much more —
we need to understand an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface"><strong>Application Binary Interface (ABI)</strong></a> of compiled machine code.</p>

<p>An ABI is similar to an API, but on a much lower level. 
ABI could be described as a set of rules that define how 
certain compiled machine code works. One of the most important and 
illustrative parts of ABI is a calling convention.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention"><strong>Calling concention</strong></a> defines low-level rules of a function call.
For instance, it defines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>where arguments and return values are stored,</li>
  <li>what is the ordering of arguments,</li>
  <li>who is responsible for cleaning up after function return,</li>
  <li>and many, many more.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#List_of_x86_calling_conventions">this Wiki comparison</a> to see that there are
plenty of different conventions, each with its own nuances and pitfalls. 
And this is just a tiny part of the binary interface.</p>

<p>I believe a good analogy to understand ABI is to imagine a <strong>jigsaw puzzle</strong>.
Each function is a piece. Each piece has a different form, just like
functions have different type signatures. The whole program is a finished puzzle.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://azhpushkin.me/assets/images/python_c_abi/abi_intro.jpg" alt="">
    
</figure>

<p>Compilers are the ones who take care of ABI.
They generate machine code accordingly to specific rules and ensure
it is coherent. Thus, all function calls, memory layout rules, and other details
in generated executable work in the same way.</p>

<p>Check out this example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>// example.c</span>
<span>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</span> 
<span>int</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"10th fibonacci number is %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>));</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>gcc <span>-c</span> example.c <span>-o</span> example.o
<span>$ </span>gcc example.o <span>-ldullmath</span> <span>-o</span> example
<span>$ </span>./example
10th fibonacci number is 55
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>During the library compilation, GCC created machine code for fibonacci 
according to certain conventions. Then, it produced matching callee machine code
for <code>example.o</code>. As we used one and the same compiler, the same ABI was applied,
and the binaries matched.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://azhpushkin.me/assets/images/python_c_abi/callee_and_caller.jpg" alt="">
    
</figure>

<p>But what if we use different compilers?</p>

<hr color="#dddddd">

<p>The bad news is that <strong>there is no standardized ABI neither for C++ nor for C</strong>. Different compilers, or even <em>different versions of the same compiler</em>, can …</p></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
<h2 id="headline-1">
The Question
</h2>
<p>
A recent homework problem had us derive the parallel plate
capacitor<sup><a id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> equation for electrostatics. This gives the
capacitance of a parallel plate structure in terms of the plate area,
distance between the plates and relative permittivity. The equation
for this situation is:
</p>
<p>
$
C = \epsilon_{R}\epsilon_{0}\frac{A}{d}
$
</p>
<p>
After solving this problem for the analytical solution, I was curious
to see how closely the result matched a 3D field solver. Using the
Capacitance Extraction mode in Cadence 3D Workbench, I designed a
parametric model of the parallel plate capacitor with variable edge
length, distance and dielectric constant (See image above for the
model). Dk<sup><a id="footnote-reference-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup> was varied but the complex component (dissipation factor)
was set to zero to ignore any dielectric losses. The edges were swept
at lengths of 0.1 inch, 1 inch and 10 inch. The distance was swept
with values of 1mil, 10mil and 100mil. Finally, the dielectric
constant was swept with values of 1, 10 and 100. This resulted in 27
unique cases, and the analytical result was compared to the extracted
result in each case.
</p>

</figure>


<h2 id="headline-2">
Results Analysis
</h2>
<p>
There are two interesting takeaways from the results. First, we see
much higher error when the area is not significantly larger than the
dielectric height. This is expected because the field solver will
correctly solve the fringe fields along the edges of the structure,
while the equation is only valid when $A &gt;&gt; d$. These fringe fields
result in a computed capacitance which is always higher than the
equation-based formula. The reason we see more accuracy with smaller
dielectric thickness is that the fringe fields do not extend very far
laterally from the structure in that case.  
</p>
<p>
The second major takeaway is that we see much better agreement between
simulation and equation when the dielectric constant is higher. The
better agreement here is likely due to the fact that the absolute
value of the capacitance is much higher, therefore an error of a few
$pF$ is still a smaller percentage variation.
</p>
<p>
If anyone's curious to play around with the 3D Workbench file, it's
available here:

<h2 id="headline-3">
Update (Oct. 4, 2020)
</h2>
<p>
I had a quick chance to investigate the electric field intensity
vectors while varying the dielectric constant. Below are cutaway plots
showing the electric field intensity within both the dielectric
material and surrounding air. Note that the scale is kept the same on
both plots for easier comparison.
</p>
<figure><a href="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/cap_field_dk1.png">
    <img src="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/cap_field_dk1.png" alt="Figure 2. Fringe electric field, $Dk = 1$." width="600"> </a><figcaption>
            <p><em>Figure 2. Fringe electric field, $Dk = 1$.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<figure><a href="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/cap_field_dk100.png">
    <img src="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/cap_field_dk100.png" alt="Figure 3. Fringe electric field, $Dk = 100$." width="600"> </a><figcaption>
            <p><em>Figure 3. Fringe electric field, $Dk = 100$.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
One interesting feature seen from this comparison is that the field
intensity within the dielectric material is much stronger for lower
Dk. This makes perfect sense; in reference <sup><a id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>, we see that the
electric field magnitude can be represented using Gauss's Law<sup><a id="footnote-reference-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup> as:
</p>
<p>
$
E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}
$
</p>
<p>
Thus, reducing Dk will increase the electric field intensity. The
direction of the field can be seen as normal to the conductors, even
wrapping around the conductor edges. Since the effective Dk at the
edge is lower in Figure 2, the field intensity is higher out to a
further distance. What are the practical implications of this
characteristic? We know that in nearly all cases, lower Dk is
better since we can use wider traces for a given dielectric thickness
(resulting in lower skin effect losses).<sup><a id="footnote-reference-4" href="#footnote-4">4</a></sup> It also helps with
crosstalk since there will be lower capacitive coupling. Lastly, since
the flight time of a signal is inversely proportional to the square
root of Dk, a lower Dk will result in a longer flight time (in
$\frac{ps}{inch}$). This means that if you have to match two traces to
within a certain flight time, the physical trace length mismatch is
more forgiving with lower Dk material.
</p>
<p>
When would we want a higher Dk material? I can think of one very
important situation: power and ground planes. We can improve the
design of the power distribution network (PDN) with higher Dk
material, as well as using the thinnest dielectric possible between
these planes. In addition to increasing the capacitance of the PDN,
this arrangement will also reduce the inductance which will help with
ground bounce and extend the effective frequency range of the PDN. 
</p>
<p>
So, what can be done to reduce fringing fields along the edges of
PCBs? The 20H rule was once touted as a method of reducing these
fields. I believe one of the origins of the 20H rule may be this<sup><a id="footnote-reference-5" href="#footnote-5">5</a></sup>
set of guidelines (see the 7th bullet point). While this study did not
look into the effects of the 20H rule, many authors consider the 20H
rule to be a bit of a myth which has been confirmed by research.<sup><a id="footnote-reference-6" href="#footnote-6">6</a></sup>
Whether or not the power planes are recessed, I have always considered
an edge fence of ground vias to be an effective way to suppress fringe
fields around a board. Sounds like a great topic for follow-up
investigation!

<h2 id="1-hacking-physics-">1. Hacking physics <a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a></h2>

<p><em>Hacker spirit.</em> Nowadays, the word “hacker” conjures up visions of
Russian trolls, Julian Assange, and Angelina Jolie’s 90s pixie cut.
But a nobler usage predates this.
Hacker culture, in the original sense, grew out of places like MIT
in the 60s, with its tradition of highbrow silliness and elaborate technical pranks.
Although associated with programming, hacker spirit can be viewed as
a broader ethos about play, understanding and creativity.
In the words of open-source gnuru Richard Stallman,</p>

<p><span>
What [hackers] had in common was a love of excellence and
programming. They wanted to make the programs that they used be as
good as they could. They also wanted to make them do neat things. They
wanted to be able to do something in a more exciting way than anyone
believed possible and show ‘Look how wonderful this is. I bet you
didn’t believe this could be done.’
</span></p>

<p>Using techniques in a clever or unexpected way is a <em>hack</em>, with <em>hack
value</em> quantifying the degree of ingenuity. (“Hack” is actually a
back-formation of “hack value”.)
Hackers do not look for the most powerful, or obvious, or easy tool
for the job.
They delight in the unexpected, in using humble means to achieve
extraordinary ends.
In a way, they realise David Deutsch’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginning_of_Infinity">definition</a>
of knowledge as
<em>information with causal power</em>.
Knowing a technique well enough to hack it means you can act on the world in new ways.</p>

<p>I think physics needs more hacker spirit: more people willing to fool
around and explore what our marvellous toolset can do, to creatively
defy expectations and push the Deutschian envelope.
Physics is not withouts its hackers but unlike computer
science, the hackers are colourful exceptions, tending towards
goofy irreverence and self-mythology
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_feynman">Richard Feynman</a>
springs to mind).
I think hacking should go mainstream.</p>

<p><em>Napkin hacks.</em> My goal in this post is to outline a few simple hacks
for the back of a napkin.
I think of these as algorithms for a napkin computer, and with some
practice, they really
can be implemented using high school algebra on a small piece of
paper, without calculus or calculators (though the latter save
time).
While there is whimsy and irreverence aplenty, our focus will be
<em>real physics</em>.
Our goal will be a beautiful proof of the existence of atoms, due to
none other than Albert Einstein, the greatest physics hacker of all.
Another running theme is rain, a tribute to my rainy city of residence,
Vancouver.</p>

<p>Hackery is not just about excellence and creativity for their own
sake, but has clear pedagogical implications.
Most people have to wait until grad school to compute viscous drag, estimate
urban power usage, or determine the size of the E. coli genome.
But imagine a world where high school students are so empowered that,
given a few hints, a pencil, and a napkin, they could discover it all
themselves.
This world is very close to ours: all we need is a little more hacker
spirit in the enjoyment and instruction of physics.</p>

<p><em>Notes.</em> This post really consists of three distinct tutorials.
The <a href="#sec-2">dimensional analysis tutorial</a> and <a href="#sec-3">section on Fermi estimates</a> can be
read independently. The <a href="#sec-4">last tutorial</a> on random
walks assumes you have read the dimensional analysis section.
The exercises are just as important as the text, but only the results
of <a href="#sec-2-3">Exercise 3</a>
and <a href="#sec-4-2">Exercise 14</a> are used subsequently.

<h2 id="2-dimensional-analysis-">2. Dimensional analysis <a id="sec-2" name="sec-2"></a></h2>

<p>We will start with one of the most powerful but underappreciated tools in
physics: <em>dimensional analysis</em>.
Physics is ultimately about experimental measurements.
Take some object, maybe an old pumpkin, and poke or prod it with a
measuring device.
The device returns a number, but that’s now what interests us;
instead, we want to know the <em>physical property</em> probed by that
device.
This is what we mean by <em>dimension</em>.
For instance, if we compare the width of the pumpkin to a ruler, the
dimension is the length, if we put it on some scales it’s the mass,
and if we time how long it takes to rot, the dimension is time.</p>

<p>We denote the dimension of length by $L$, time by $T$ and mass by
$M$.
We use brackets $[\cdot]$ to refer to the dimension of a measurement.
It’s easy when the measurement is given in some units, since we can
throw away the numbers and just ask: what aspect does the unit measure?
For instance,</p><p>

\[[20 \text{ cm}] = [\text{cm}]  = L, \quad [5 \text{ lb}]
=[\text{lb}] = M, \quad \quad [2 \text{ days}] =[\text{days}] = T.\]

</p><p>Centimetres measure length,
hours measure time, and pounds measure mass.
More complicated dimensions follow from the basic ones according to
simple rules which are easier to show than tell.
Area, for example, has dimensions $L^2$:</p><p>

\[[1 \text{ cm}^2] = [\text{cm}^2] = [\text{cm}]^2.\]

</p><p>An alternative to units is using general formulas, e.g. for the area of a rectangle:</p><p>

\[[\text{area}] = [\text{width}\times \text{height}] = [\text{width}]
\times [\text{height}] = L^2.\]

</p><p>Dimensions can be divided as well as multiplied:</p><p>

\[[\text{velocity}] = \left[\frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}\right] =
\frac{[\text{distance}]}{[\text{time}]} = \frac{L}{T}.\]

</p><p>Be careful: only measurements with the same dimensions can
be added and subtracted.
For instance, it makes no sense to ask what “$1$ cm + $4$ hours” is,
though it <em>is</em> sensible to compute “$1$ cm + $4$ feet”.</p>

<p>Physical laws tell us how measurements depend
on each other.
For example, Newton’s second law $F = ma$ tells us how measurements of
force, mass and acceleration are related.
If the two sides of $F = ma$ are equal, the dimensions must agree,
with</p><p>

\[[F] = [m a] = [m]\times \left[\frac{v}{t}\right] = \frac{ML}{T^2}.\]

</p><p>The point of dimensional analysis is that you can sometimes <em>reverse</em>
this process, and determine the physical laws from dimensions!
Let’s see how.</p>

<h3 id="21-pendulous-pumpkins-">2.1. Pendulous pumpkins <a id="sec-2-1" name="sec-2-1"></a></h3>

<p>Suppose we attach an old pumpkin to a length of string and give it a
kick.
Gravity will pull on the pumpkin, causing it to oscillate back and
forth with some period of oscillation $t$.
If we know how the period of oscillation depends on other properties
of the system, we can utilise this knowledge to make a pumpkin clock!
Let’s start by listing some relevant quantities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the mass of the pumpkin $m$, with dimension $[m] = M$;</li>
  <li>the length of the string $\ell$, dimension $[\ell] = L$;</li>
  <li>gravitational acceleration $g = 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2$, dimension $[g] =
LT^{-2}$ (from the units);</li>
  <li>the initial displacement of the pumpkin $x$, dimension $[x] = L$.</li>
</ul>

<figure>
    <div><p><img src="https://hapax.github.io/images/posts/hacker3.png" width="30%"></p><figcaption><i>Physical features of the pendulous pumpkin.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

<p>Not all of these quantities will turn out to be relevant.
Galileo discovered that as long as the initial kick is
small, it has no affect on the period: pendulums are “isochronic”.
Grab a pumpkin, stopwatch and string, and check for yourself!
Galileo realised he could exploit this property to make a reliable
timepiece, and invented the pendulum clock.
(There is actually a deep physical reason pendulums are isochronic for
small kicks, but we will have to leave that for another time!)</p>

<p>In terms of relevant features, this leaves the pumpkin mass $m$, string length $\ell$, and gravity $g$.
You can also eliminate the pumpkin mass empirically, but as we’ll see,
we can leave it in and let dimensional analysis <em>tell us</em> it’s irrelevant.
At this point, I’m going to do something a bit sneaky.
Instead of period $t$, we will deal with the <em>angular velocity</em></p><p>

\[\omega = \frac{2\pi}{t}.\]

</p><p>(We will explain another way to get factors of $2\pi$ in Exercise 4.)
Dimensional analysis is nothing fancier than guessing that $\omega$ is related to $m$,
$\ell$ and $g$ by a relation of the form</p><p>

\[\omega = m^a \ell^b g^c,\]

</p><p>for some numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$.
Our goal is to figure out what these numbers are.
We can find the powers by matching dimensions on each side:</p><p>

\[\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{T} = [\omega] = [m^a \ell^c g^c] = \frac{M^aL^{b+c}}{T^{2c}}.
\end{align*}\]

</p><p>Requiring the leftmost and rightmost expressions to be equal, we can immediately read off the powers:</p><p>

\[a = 0, \quad 2c = 1, \quad b + c = 0 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad a =
0, \quad c = -b = \frac{1}{2}.\]

</p><p>As promised, dimensional analysis kindly informs us that the mass
is irrelevant!
My earlier piece of sneakiness (replacing period with angular
velocity) actually gives the exact answer for small kicks:</p><p>

\[\omega = m^a \ell^b g^c =  \sqrt{\frac{g}{\ell}}.\]

</p><p>We didn’t need to solve a differential equation, analyse forces, or even deal with numbers.
Dimensional analysis let us skip straight to the answer!</p>

<p>Suppose we want to make a pumpkin clock with the conventional
grandfather-clock period of $t = 2 \text{
s}$, so that each half swing takes
one second.
Then we should suspend the old pumpkin from a string of length</p><p>

\[\ell = \frac{g}{\omega^2} = \frac{g t^2}{(2\pi)^2} = \frac{9.8 \text{
m}}{\pi^2} \approx 1
\text{ m}.\]

</p><p>Incidentally, this explains why grandfather clocks are so large.
They will house a large (typically non-curcurbitar) pendulum with
$\ell \approx 1$ m.</p>

<p>In order to make the clock, we need a ruler to measure out the length
of string.
But for maximal whimsy, we can switch things up, and turn a stopwatch,
pumpkin and spool into a ruler!
Measure with the string and snip off the corresponding length, attach
the pumpkin and gently wobble.

<p>This document is a set of guidelines for using C++ well.
The aim of this document is to help people to use modern C++ effectively.
By “modern C++” we mean effective use of the ISO C++ standard (currently C++17, but almost all of our recommendations also apply to C++14 and C++11).
In other words, what would you like your code to look like in 5 years’ time, given that you can start now? In 10 years’ time?</p>

<p>The guidelines are focused on relatively high-level issues, such as interfaces, resource management, memory management, and concurrency.
Such rules affect application architecture and library design.
Following the rules will lead to code that is statically type safe, has no resource leaks, and catches many more programming logic errors than is common in code today.
And it will run fast – you can afford to do things right.</p>

<p>We are less concerned with low-level issues, such as naming conventions and indentation style.
However, no topic that can help a programmer is out of bounds.</p>

<p>Our initial set of rules emphasizes safety (of various forms) and simplicity.
They may very well be too strict.
We expect to have to introduce more exceptions to better accommodate real-world needs.
We also need more rules.</p>

<p>You will find some of the rules contrary to your expectations or even contrary to your experience.
If we haven’t suggested you change your coding style in any way, we have failed!
Please try to verify or disprove rules!
In particular, we’d really like to have some of our rules backed up with measurements or better examples.</p>

<p>You will find some of the rules obvious or even trivial.
Please remember that one purpose of a guideline is to help someone who is less experienced or coming from a different background or language to get up to speed.</p>

<p>Many of the rules are designed to be supported by an analysis tool.
Violations of rules will be flagged with references (or links) to the relevant rule.
We do not expect you to memorize all the rules before trying to write code.
One way of thinking about these guidelines is as a specification for tools that happens to be readable by humans.</p>

<p>The rules are meant for gradual introduction into a code base.
We plan to build tools for that and hope others will too.</p>

<p>Comments and suggestions for improvements are most welcome.
We plan to modify and extend this document as our understanding improves and the language and the set of available libraries improve.</p>



<p>This is a set of core guidelines for modern C++ (currently C++17) taking likely future enhancements and ISO Technical Specifications (TSs) into account.
The aim is to help C++ programmers to write simpler, more efficient, more maintainable code.</p>

<p>All C++ programmers. This includes <a href="#S-cpl">programmers who might consider C</a>.</p>

<h2 id="inaims-aims"><a name="SS-aims"></a>In.aims: Aims</h2>

<p>The purpose of this document is to help developers to adopt modern C++ (currently C++17) and to achieve a more uniform style across code bases.</p>

<p>We do not suffer the delusion that every one of these rules can be effectively applied to every code base. Upgrading old systems is hard. However, we do believe that a program that uses a rule is less error-prone and more maintainable than one that does not. Often, rules also lead to faster/easier initial development.
As far as we can tell, these rules lead to code that performs as well or better than older, more conventional techniques; they are meant to follow the zero-overhead principle (“what you don’t use, you don’t pay for” or “when you use an abstraction mechanism appropriately, you get at least as good performance as if you had handcoded using lower-level language constructs”).
Consider these rules ideals for new code, opportunities to exploit when working on older code, and try to approximate these ideals as closely as feasible.
Remember:</p>

<h3 id="in0-dont-panic"><a name="R0"></a>In.0: Don’t panic!</h3>

<p>Take the time to understand the implications of a guideline rule on your program.</p>

<p>These guidelines are designed according to the “subset of superset” principle (<a href="#Stroustrup05">Stroustrup05</a>).
They do not simply define a subset of C++ to be used (for reliability, safety, performance, or whatever).
Instead, they strongly recommend the use of a few simple “extensions” (<a href="#S-gsl">library components</a>)
that make the use of the most error-prone features of C++ redundant, so that they can be banned (in our set of rules).</p>

<p>The rules emphasize static type safety and resource safety.
For that reason, they emphasize possibilities for range checking, for avoiding dereferencing <code>nullptr</code>, for avoiding dangling pointers, and the systematic use of exceptions (via RAII).
Partly to achieve that and partly to minimize obscure code as a source of errors, the rules also emphasize simplicity and the hiding of necessary complexity behind well-specified interfaces.</p>

<p>Many of the rules are prescriptive.
We are uncomfortable with rules that simply state “don’t do that!” without offering an alternative.
One consequence of that is that some rules can be supported only by heuristics, rather than precise and mechanically verifiable checks.
Other rules articulate general principles. For these more general rules, more detailed and specific rules provide partial checking.</p>

<p>These guidelines address the core of C++ and its use.
We expect that most large organizations, specific application areas, and even large projects will need further rules, possibly further restrictions, and further library support.
For example, hard-real-time programmers typically can’t use free store (dynamic memory) freely and will be restricted in their choice of libraries.
We encourage the development of such more specific rules as addenda to these core guidelines.
Build your ideal small foundation library and use that, rather than lowering your level of programming to glorified assembly code.</p>

<p>The rules are designed to allow <a href="#S-modernizing">gradual adoption</a>.</p>

<p>Some rules aim to increase various forms of safety while others aim to reduce the likelihood of accidents, many do both.
The guidelines aimed at preventing accidents often ban perfectly legal C++.
However, when there are two ways of expressing an idea and one has shown itself a common source …</p></div></div>

<p><strong>Justin: </strong><em>Take me through your first fundraising. You said you didn’t have any money at first?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><strong>Zuleyka: </strong>I couldn’t bootstrap. I literally had no money. I had no savings. I still have no savings. Here’s the other thing, future customers are not going to tell you what to build. They don’t know what to build. They don’t know what it is that they need. I have to prescribe the thing in the market that is going to solve that particular problem. No one was going to come to me and say, “You know what? Based on everything you’ve done with me in the last four weeks, you need to go and build this online grocery store that looks this way, build this technology.” That wasn’t going to happen. I guess I took the Apple approach in some ways of believing that I and my team could figure out what it was, and then have an uptake of new habits in the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You were not prescribed what the consumer needs without the consumer knowing what they need, but there were certain behaviors that they were enacting. Once I started fundraising, I had got to the point where I didn’t need to work another job. I had left my full-time job working in VC in April of that year. I had to take up another short-term position to keep me going for a few more months. September, October of 2018, I was for the very first time able to not do anything else except focus on this. One of the biggest learnings for me at that time was it’s hard to do this if you’re not dedicating every minute of every waking day, You can work for a period of time where you’re doing it in the evenings and you’re doing it at the weekends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In my life, I had underestimated the value of stability. I was in a position where I’m a woman in my early 30s, I’m married, I can make rent, I can feed myself. Therefore, I could dedicate my time to this. As I went out into the market, I got a rude awakening very early on where people and folks were enamored by who I was, my background. I had a couple of the badges. I had been to Oxford and I’d worked in VC for a little while, but I hadn’t worked at Facebook and Google. I wasn’t on paper, their founder that I think many would either expect or think is going to build this. Even if you think about online grocery stores and online grocery tech and supply chain tech, it hasn’t been built by somebody quite like me or with my background, my experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Early on, I would meet Angels, some who’ve since come back to me and said, “You’ve proven me wrong,” but they said to me, “Look at this company. Look at that company. They have everything on paper. They are the founders of the company. They’re struggling. What makes you think with no experience in handling product on the ground, moving product on the ground, dealing with this level of operations that you can do this?” I did a lot of meetings, but I was incessant. I’m still incessant, but at that time, I wrote a Medium post, I think it was 263 pitch meetings I did to get the six initial checks that made up $500,000.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That was the first tranche of money that I raised. There were two initial Angels, two initial checks. One was from <a href="https://twitter.com/chudson">Charles Hudson</a> at <a href="https://precursorvc.com/">Precursor</a> who changed my life and is the reason this company is in existence today because he invested in us with the largest check at that time. There was another well-known British Angel, who I met at a party around that same time and on the spot, he said, “I’m investing,” and he invested as well. Those two moments happened within I think about a week of each other. I was tired by the time I had met Charles. I remember meeting him in a coffee shop. My husband was around the corner in a bookstore and I sat with Charles and it was so different from any of the other interactions I had because where Precursor and Charles are so good is they invest early.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A lot of folks say they invest early, but we were early. It was just me and this bit of research that I had and a very strong conviction and enough data. To begin with, he didn’t ask me the very detailed questions. He focused on just getting to understand me, getting to know me, what is driving me, where am I from. You’re taking a bet on the founder that early on as well as the idea. You’re a bet on the founder who’s just sat in front of you with nothing. I was telling him things that I wouldn’t normally talk about in these pitch meetings. He made me very comfortable. We were able to have a session that felt more like ideation than me trying to convince him to give me money because I was going to build something with it that was going to change my life and his life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I learned a lot from that experience and we continued to talk. He is an investor, but he’s also a friend. I didn’t realize it at the time, but what I had built was a solid foundation of investors who have trusted me, trusted my vision, trusted the way that I run this company and have been there for me and for the company when needed as needed. We raised that $500,000. I remember I left and I flew back to London for the Christmas period, kept chatting with Charles. He was in and I didn’t have a company. I wasn’t incorporated. I didn’t have anything. It was like, “I need to do something now. Now we’re going to become like a big girl. Now we’re going to become like a real company.” Not just me and my apartment cliché, but like me doing all this random stuff in Redwood City. Now it got serious.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> <em>You had other investors in the pre-seed and seed round. Take me through how the fundraising side of things for Ready, Set, Food! has gone for you.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Daniel:</strong> For us, I would say it’s also difficult and arduous. Everyone feels like they have special problems that make it harder to fundraise. For us, we also had our special problem. It’s just that we don’t fit into any category, any fund that’s focused on a specific investment thesis around technology or around wellness. Everyone’s a little bit different. We’re a dietary supplement that’s clinically proven, scientifically-backed by evidence, but also not something that makes you feel better right away that you buy on a whim. We fit into this weird, they fall into this weird place. We’re not a drug, a food, a supplement. We’re not tech. I think that made it a little bit more difficult for us, but I think what we had going for us at least initially is that there’s so many people who have the personal connection to the topic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Initially, we raised a very small friends and family round and then had a number of Angel investors with personal connections to the topic invest. Once we had a little bit of momentum, we brought on a couple more serious investors like <a href="https://www.plgventures.com/">PLG Ventures</a> and <a href="http://amplify.la/">Amplify.LA</a>. That took care of most of our pre-seed round and including <a href="https://www.wavemaker360.com/">Wavemaker health</a> and a few others. That initial kickstart was based on people who had that personal connection. It was so hard to find a good fit, then once we got a little bit of traction, there were enough generalists pre-seed investors that we were able to fill out our initial $2 million-ish pre-seed round.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Justin: </strong><em>One thing I have to go back to is how did you set up your initial family and friends financing in terms of what that looks like, the structure of it?</em></p>



<p><strong>Daniel: </strong>It was all on a SAFE note. Everything through pre-seed was all on a safe note. It was the <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a> pre-money safe note before they made those changes. Now it’s a little bit different, but it was all on the standard safe note.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Justin: </strong><em>Were there major differences between the pre-seed versus seed round?</em></p>



<p><strong>Daniel: </strong>More so that we were able to attract real long-term partners like Danone. Amplify.LA and PLG Ventures have been incredible strategic partners, but in terms of the long-term, driving of growth in the company, having a strategic investor who is the second largest infant formula maker in the world is beneficial for us. We go from getting people on the team who are strategically helpful and good investors but not like long-term growth drivers to finding the partners that we’re in final talks, bringing on some healthcare systems to invest that will be part of partnerships to drive education through the healthcare system and being so big into food and formula is a great partner for a lot of reasons there. That’s been the big difference for us from pre-seed to seed is moving from people who I love calling for advice and who help guide our trajectory to partners who can help more directly drive business and growth and planning for the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This week, we continue our four-part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/18/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-mining/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/25/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-trees-for-blooms/">II</a>, III, IV) look at pre-modern iron and steel production.  Last week we took our ore and smelted it into a rough, spongy mass of iron called a bloom; this week we’re going to go through the processes to reshape that bloom first into a consolidated billet, then into a bar that is useful for forging and finally into some useful final object.</p>



<p>I want to stress at the outset that we are not going to cover anything close to the whole of blacksmithing practice in this post.  Blacksmithing is fairly complex and any given object, shape or tool is going to have its own set of processes and techniques to produce the required shape at the required hardness and malleability characteristics.  If you <em>are</em> interested in that sort of information, I recommend A.W. Bealer’s <em>The Art of Blacksmithing</em> (1969) as a fairly good starting point, though there is no substitute to speaking with a practicing blacksmith.</p>

<h2>Heat, Hammers and Hardness</h2>



<p>There are a few basic behaviors of iron that fundamentally control what blacksmiths are going to do with it in this stage.  To begin with, we need to introduce some terminology to avoid this coming confusing: a given piece of metal can be <em>hard</em> (resistant to deformation) or <em>soft</em>; they can also be <em>ductile </em>(able to deform significantly before breaking) or <em>brittle</em> (likely to break without deformation).  This is easiest to understand at the extremes: a soft, brittle material (like a thin wooden dowel) takes very little energy and breaks immediately without behind, while a hard, ductile material (the same dowel, made of spring-steel) bends more easily under stress but resists breaking.  But it is also possible to hard hard brittle materials (pottery being a classic example) which fiercely resist deforming but break catastrophically the moment they exceed their tolerances or a soft, ductile material (think wet-noodle) which bends very easily.</p>



<p>(I should note that all of these factors are, in fact, very complex – far more complex than we are going to discuss.  In particular, as I understand it, some of what I am using ‘hardness’ to describe also falls under the related category of yield strength.  Hopefully you will all pardon the necessary simplification; if it makes you feel any better, ancient blacksmiths didn’t understand how any of this worked either, only that it worked.)</p>



<p>Of course these treats are not binaries but a spectrum.  Materials have a degree of hardness or ductility; as we’ll see, these are not quite <em>opposed</em>, but changing one does change the other – increasing hardness often reduces ductility.</p>



<p>The sort of things that pre-modern people are going to want to be made in iron are going to have fairly tight tolerances for these sorts of things.  Objects that had wide tolerances (that is, things which could be weak or a little bendy or didn’t have to take much force) got made out of other cheaper, easier materials like ceramics, stone or wood; metals were really only used for things that had to be both strong and relatively light for precisely the reasons we’ve seen: they were too expensive for anything else.  <strong>That means that a blacksmith doesn’t merely need to bring the metal to the right shape but also to the right <em>characteristics</em></strong><em><strong>.</strong>  </em>Some tools would need to finish up being quite hard (like the tip of a pick, or the edge of a blade), while others needed to be able to bend to absorb strain (like the core of a blade or the back of a saw).</p>



<p>Keep all of that in mind as we discuss:</p>



<h2>Forge Techniques</h2>



<p>I realize this is a long aside to leave our bloom waiting, but as we’ll see, the remaining steps share a basic set of techniques, making it easier to discuss those techniques together.</p>



<p>Fundamentally, each stage of forging iron revolves around a basic cycle: <strong>by heating the metal, the smith makes it soft enough to <em>work</em> </strong>(that is, hammer into shape).  Technically, it is possible to shape relatively thin masses of iron by hammering when cold (this is called cold-working) but in contrast to other metals (tin, copper and bronze all come to mind) nearly all serious iron-working was done ‘hot.’  In smithing terminology, each of these cycles is referred to as a ‘heat’ – the more heats a given project requires, the more fuel it is going to consume, the longer and more expensive it is going to be (but a skilled smith can often finish the work in fewer heats than an unskilled smith).</p>

An assistant mans the bellows on the forge to maintain the temperature.</figcaption></figure>



<p>A modern blacksmith can gauge the temperature of a metal using sophisticated modern thermometers, but pre-modern smiths had no recourse to such things (and most traditional smiths I’ve met don’t use them anyway).  Instead, the temperature of the metal is gauged by looking at its <em>color</em>: as things get hotter, they glow from brown to dark red through to a light red into yellow and then finally white.  For iron heated in a forge, a blacksmith can control the temperature of the forge’s fire by controlling the air-input through the bellows (pushing in more air means more combustion, which means more heat, but also more fuel consumed).  As we’ve seen, charcoal (and we will need to use charcoal, not wood, to hit the necessary heat required), while not cripplingly expensive, was not trivial to produce either.  A skilled smith is thus going to try to do the work in as few heats as possible and not excessively hot either (there are, in fact, other reasons to avoid excessive heats, this is just one).</p>



<p>One hot the metal can be shaped by hammering.  The thickness of a bar of metal could be thickened by <em>upsetting</em> (heating the center of the bar and them hammering down on it like a nail to compress the center, causing it to thicken) or thinned by <em>drawing</em> (hammering out the metal to create a longer, thinner shape).  If the required shape needed the metal to be bent it could be heated and bent either over the side of the anvil or against a tool; many anvils had (and still have) a notch in the back where such a tool could be fitted.  A good example of this kind of thing would be hammering out a sheet of iron over a dome-shape to create the bowl of a helmet (a task known as ‘raising’ or ‘sinking’ depending on precisely how it is done).  A mass of iron can also be divided by heating it at the intended cutting point and then using a hammer and chisel to cut through the hot, soft metal.</p>



<p>But for understanding the entire process, the most important of these operations is the<strong> <em>fire weld</em></strong>.  Much like bloomery furnaces, the forges available to pre-modern blacksmiths could not reach the temperatures necessary to melt or cast iron, but it was necessary to be able to join smaller bits of iron into larger ones which was done through a fire weld (sometimes called a forge weld).  In this process, the iron is heated very hot, typically to a ‘yellow’ or ‘white’ heat (around 1100 °C).  The temperature range for the operation is quite precise: too cold and the iron will not weld, too hot and it will ‘burn’ making the weld brittle.  Once at the right temperature, the two pieces of iron are put next to each other and hammered into each other with heavy blows.  If done properly, the two pieces of metal join completely, leaving a weld that is as strong as every other part of the bar.</p>

<p>That’s not all there is to say about these processes (we’ll come back to them in a moment) but we now have enough of the basics to begin processing our bloom.</p>



<h2>From Bloom to Billet to Bar</h2>



<p>As you may recall, when we finished our process last time, we ended with a ‘bloom’ of iron: a spongy mass of pure, metallic iron interspersed with inclusions of waste materials called slag:</p>

<p>The iron of the bloom itself is also likely to be quite brittle because of these slag inclusions.  This isn’t a product that can be sent directly to a blacksmith.  It needs to be consolidated first into a billet and most of that slag needs to be forced out, both of which can be achieved via liberal application of <strong>fire welding</strong>.</p>



<p>This step is sometimes called <strong>bloomsmithing</strong>.  The bloom is heated to roughly 1100 °C (gauged, as above, by the color of the iron) – it seems plausible that it may have been broken up into smaller chunks to make this more useful – and then hammered into a single mass through a series of fire welds.  We’re not very well informed how this was done in the ancient world (save ‘with hammers’) because bloomsmithing doesn’t tend to leave a lot of evidence for us to observe.  The end shape of the process was generally a very thick rectangular bar called a <strong>billet</strong>, ready for relatively easy transport.</p>



<p>This process has some advantages and disadvantages, beyond merely shaping the metal into a more usable and transportable form.  Remember that our bloom contains a lot of material which isn’t iron (the slag); fire welding, especially when repeated, tends to expel this slag – as the iron is compressed in the weld, the slag is forced out.  There is some debate (note Sim &amp; Kaminski, <em>op. cit.</em>) if this process is sufficient to explain the <em>very</em> low slag counts seen in high quality weapons and armor, but it is certainly true that fire welding reduces the overall slag count.  That …</p></div></div>

<p>Landing in master, plasma has an optional new startup method to launch and manage all our KDE/Plasma services via a systemd user instance rather than the current boot scripts. This will be available in Plasma 5.21.</p>
<p>It is currently opt-in, off by default.  I hope to make it the default where available after more testing and feedback, but it is important to stress that the current boot-up method will exist and be supported into the future. A lot of work was put into splitting and tidying so the actual amount of duplication in the end result is quite small and managable.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bitmap.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bitmap.png" alt="Our logos are weirldy similar...conspiracy?"></a></p>

<h2>Overlapping requirements</h2>
<p>We have to start a lot of things in a given order. Systemd naturally is designed for handling doing this.</p>
<p>Whilst we already have a somewhat working system, it has issues. One classic problem is services that talk to other services needing to be both spawned but also fully initialised before the other can send a message. DBus activation solves a lot; but not quite enough.</p>
<p>For example, we have the real world case of scripts run long before plasmashell trying to send notifications; we want DBus daemon to know our notification server it's activatable so that it will pause the dispatch of the message, but making it DBus activatable can't guarantee the dependencies are run in the correct order. This is currently solved with a <del>genius</del> horrific hack.</p>
<p>But starting things up is only half the battle. We currently have a big issue with shutting things down. Whose responsibility is it to stop running services? A lot of things only exit because their wayland connection is swept away. When dealing with services that potentially restart during the session lifespan, this solution is far from trivial and the current situation is fundamentally broken.</p>
<h2>Customisation / Sysadmin Familiarity</h2>
<p>Most users and especially sysadmins already have to learn how to use their init system. Whether it's simply enabling a service on boot, or something much more complex users are exposed to it already. If not, there is good existing documentation and countless Stackoverflow posts to answer any question.</p>
<p>We had a meeting akademy 2 years ago about use of systemd and it was the sysadmins from Limux who clearly knew far more than any programmer as to how it should all work. There is a lot more merit in using existing things than just sharing code.</p>
<hr>
<p>Another big motivating factor was the ability for customisation. The root of Plasma's startup is very hardcoded. What if you want to run krunner with a different environment variable set? or have a script run every time plasmashell restarts, or show a UI after kwin is loaded but before plasma shell to perform some user setup? You can edit the code, but that's not easy and you're very much on your own.</p>
<p>Systemd provides that level of customisation; both at a distro or a user level out of the box. From our POV for free.</p>
<h2>CGroups and resource limits</h2>
<p>I've talked about use of <a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/blog/modern-process-management-on-the-desktop/">cgroups for applications</a> for better control of resources. Especially as more things become multi-process. </p>
<p>CGroups and slices provide several benefits over what we can do currently. Because resources are always relative to within the parent slice, we are able to boost resources as well as limit things. This will allow us to bump kwin and such ever so slightly without needing elevated cap privileges.</p>
<p>This also works the other way; cgroups have some extra scheduler features not otherwise available. We can not just set weigh to a process, but also absolute limits. This could be useful for file indexers and alike to minimise battery drainage or capture runaway processes. CGroups are where all the new kernel features are.</p>
<p>Memory management is another factor, when we run out the kernel comes in and kills some processes.<br>
We can tag some services as being safer to OOM kill than others with a lot more granularity than a single oomscore adjustment. We can provide expected memory usages for a service, we can put defaults levels on entire slices at once, and it's all easily customisable by the user if their opinions don't match our upstream defaults.</p>
<h2>Logging</h2>
<p>The current state of logging is a mess. One of two things happen:<br>
Either stderr from a service is lost, or logs go into one giant "xsession-errors" file. This file exists on a real file system slowly expanding and expanding. It doesn't rotate, if it gets too big your home folder becomes full and things explode. Each time you log in, we override that log, so we lose any history. </p>
<p>The alternative is that logs are simply lost.</p>
<p>Systemd provides queryable logging with each unit, and each invocation of each unit being separate. It's already making my life a lot easier for the last bugs I've been working on. When people on bugzilla have this too, it'll make everything easier.</p>

<h2>Previous implementations</h2>
<p>A plasma systemd boot has been <a href="https://github.com/eliasp/plasma-workspace-units">tried before</a> by Elias Probst. It worked well as a demo, and was used as inspiration for some parts. The key difference now is instead of trying to design around plasma, we're changing plasma to fit what we need and really put the focus on every last detail.</p>
<h2>Refactor, Split, Refactor, Split, ...</h2>
<p>Unintuitively the first start of a port to systemd was a complete rewrite of the legacy path.</p>
<p>Plasma used to be managed by a tree of processes that would spawn, set up some environment variables, spawn the next part of the boot and continue running. We eventually get to ksmserver, which was a monolith that did many many things. It started several hardcoded processes like kwin, then all the autostart .desktop files, and then session restore. There were many reasons to break this up that I outlined when I started in <a href="https://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/blog/changes-to-ksmserver/">2018</a>.</p>
<p>Since then we've been chopping a tiny part out every release. Each release would split out a tiny part at a time so we could always be on top of any regressions that happened. </p>
<p>Once we'd refactored and rewrote some parts we could have a very clear and readable understanding of  <a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/blog/plasma-startup/"> what actually happens in a plasma boot</a> and what is really dependent on what.</p>
<p>The biggest problem that we have is many things rely on environment variables or even xrdb databases to be correct at the time of launching; several early parts of the boot (kcminit, kded phase0) will adjust these and the next parts may rely on these for correct theming. </p>
<p>Another massive rewrite that landed (by Kai Uwe Broulik) was the detaching of kwin from ksmserver. kwin needs to know which session we're restoring so that restored windows can be placed at the right place; this previously came from an environment variable that means we needed ksmserver up and running to spawn kwin. We rewrote how that all works and gets communicated so the order can be agnostic but still without any features getting lost.</p>
<h2>Final patchset</h2>
<p>Eventually we got to a point where ksmserver is <em>only</em> dealing with X11 session management. We have another quite tiny binary (<code>plasma_session</code>) that <em>only</em> deals with starting services in a specific order. And everything else is completely separate standalone independent components. This has been released for a while. Even without the systemd boot, everything is in a much much cleaner better off state.</p>
<p>The final patch to use systemd is then really quite boring and small. We just don't call the <code>plasma_session binary</code>, and instead try to start a systemd target; <code>plasma-workspace.target</code>.</p>
<p>All our core services ship their own .service files which plasma-workpace requires for a full Plasma session.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_20200923_114125.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_20200923_114125-1024x249.png" alt="This picture shows random circles and lines. I felt it helped break up the wall of text."></a></p>
<h2>Autostart files</h2>
<p>One of the key aspects of startup is handling autostart .desktop files in /etc/xdg/autostart or ~/.config/autostart. We need this to work as before.</p>
<p>Benjamin Berg (of Red Hat and Gnome) came up with a very elegant solution using a <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.generator.html">systemd generator</a>. It goes through all the .desktop files parsing them and generates an appropriate systemd service automagically.</p>
<p>For application developers everything keeps working the same, but to an end user we can interact with them like native services. We get the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>Despite being a shared implementation even KDE-specific things like X-KDE-AutostartCondition just work. Implementation wise the generator converts this into an ExecCondition= line which then calls into a plasma-shipped binary to check if it's allowed.</p>

<h2>Is it faster?</h2>
<p>A lot of the prep work over the past few years to get to this state has made absolutely massive differences. The splitting found bugs dead code and potential optimisations that add up to magnitudes of difference.</p>
<p>As for switching over to the systemd itself, it should be roughly the same. Ultimately we're triggering the exact same set of things in the exact same order with the exact same blocks if we've done our job properly. Sorry to disappoint!</p>
<h2>Is it finished?</h2>
<p>The fundamentals are definitely at a point that I think are stable and working; but we haven't enabled all of the potential extra features we have available. I would welcome people who are experiences to give feedback and help out.</p>

<p>You must have latest master of Plasma, it is not in the 5.20 beta. </p>
<p>Enable with:</p>
<pre><code>kwriteconfig5 --file startkderc --group General --key systemdBoot true</code></pre>
<p>As mentioned above there are checks that you have the systemd 246 or newer for the generator of existing autostart services to work.</p>
<p>To confirm the boot worked correctly you can run</p>
<pre><code>systemctl --user status plasma-plasmashell.service</code></pre>
<p>It should show as active.</p>
<p>This safety check of 246 can be skipped. You will lose auto-activation of apps using the classic .desktop file approach, but everything else still works. I won't mention how publicly to avoid false bug reports, but as a dev you can probably find out.</p>
<h3>Dev setups - a caveat</h3>
<p>If you build your own KDE and install into a non standard prefix, instead of getting Plasma from your distribution, there is one new hurdle. Systemd user sessions starts earlier than most people set their custom prefixes so naturally it can't find things in your new paths.</p>
<p>There are multiple solutions, simplest is to re-run  <code>./install-sessions</code> script in plasma-workspace …</p></div></article></div>

     <div><div><h2>Served</h2><p>The meeting, in March 2013, happened several years after Epstein pleaded guilty to charges of soliciting a prostitute, with a minor, as well as paying compensation to a number of women. A federal investigation had identified at least 36 victims, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html">according to the Miami Herald.</a></p><p>As early as 2006 as the investigation of Epstein was under way, some politicians had returned money from Epstein. Later, in 2011, the British Prince Andrew was criticised for maintaining his friendship with Epstein. Last year, Prince Andrew stated he <a href="https://www.dn.no/magasinet/dokumentar/jeffrey-epstein/donald-trump/kjell-magne-bondevik/terje-rod-larsens-tankesmie-mottok-millioner-fra-sexforbryteren-jeffrey-epsteins-stiftelse/2-1-708700">showed «poor judgment»</a>.</p><p>Despite the verdict, Epstein managed to re-enter the elite after serving his sentence. Last year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/13/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-new-york-elite.html">The New York Times</a> reported that he kept being included among the powerful of New York City. Anchor Katie Kouric and Woody Allen attended dinner at his home in 2010. The following year he attended a party together with among others Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, founders of Amazon and Tesla respectively. Several notable institutions praised him and boasted of his achievements, including the prestigious Harvard university.</p><p>Crown Princess Mette-Marit of Norway met Epstein several times between 2011 and 2013. Last year, she apologised for not scrutinising his past more thoroughly. Former prime minister Kjell Magne Bondevik of Norway met Epstein at a dinner party in 2013, but declined to pursue funding from Epstein having found out about Epsteins past in a Google search.</p><p>Epstein had been suspected of a larger number of crimes than was included in his plea deal. Last year, he was arrested in the US, and charged with further crimes of trafficking and abuse. He was never charged, as he died in custody in August 2019. The coroners found he took his own life.</p><h2>Jagland: Gates and Epstein arrived together</h2><p>Last fall, DN published a number of articles on the connections between Epstein Norwegian contacts and IPI. Since then the Norwegian <a href="https://www.dn.no/politikk/riksrevisjonen/per-kristian-foss/ipi/riksrevisjonen-apner-undersokelse-av-terje-rod-larsens-tankesmie/2-1-860325">Auditor General</a> has opened an investigation into the relationship between the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the think tank. IPI, which has received grants surpassing 130 million Norwegian krones, has several connections to Epstein.</p><p>During the last year, DN has asked Jagland a number of questions on his association of Epstein.</p><p>— There was no connection, of a financial or any other nature, to the Council of Europe. Any other Norwegian connections, which I understand the article will be about, I have no knowledge of, he wrote in an e-mail November 11, 2019.</p><p>After several inquiries this last week regarding new information about the meeting, Jagland confirmed that Gates and Epstein attended a meeting at his residence in March 2013, at an official meeting. According to him, Gates and Epstein arrived together. </p></div></div>

	<section id="who">
		<p>Who is Archillect?</p>
		<div>
			<p><imp>Archillect [archive + intellect] is an AI</imp> created to discover and share stimulating visual content over social media channels. <imp>She is a living inspiration archive. She is a digital muse.</imp></p>							
			<p>She currently has a <a href="http://twitter.com/archillect">Twitter</a> feed, an <a href="http://instagram.com/archillect">Instagram</a> profile, a <a target="_blank" href="http://t.me/archillect/">Telegram</a> channel, a <a target="_blank" href="http://facebook.com/archillect">Facebook</a> page, and a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pinterest.com/archillect/">Pinterest</a> board where she converts unhappy beings to inspired minds.</p>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section id="how">
		<p>How does she work?</p>
		<div>
			<p>Archillect has an algorithm that is fed a list of keywords. Instead of posting the search results directly, she wiki-walks between pages and posts, collecting data on various items: image, poster, recent interactions and the visible audience of the post. She maps the social structure of these items by mining as much data as possible from each one of them. <imp>This abstract structure helps Archillect find positive results but more importantly, allows her to discover related keywords and eventually learn.</imp></p>
			<p>The balance and threshold of keywords and picks are dynamically adjusted as Archillect’s posts on social media gain attention. This not only makes the decision making process nearly human but also gives her a primitive trend perception.</p>
			<p>Archillect's curation process is completely automated. She aims to make her posts reach as far as possible considering the potential followers that may share the content with their own followers. As a result she likes attention from accounts with high potential of making her posts survive in the social web and she increases her trust in the accounts that helps her make the correct choices that made earlier posts reach further. <imp>She tries to understand what is "liked" on social media.</imp></p>
			<p>As a result she learns, evolves, communicates and becomes happy in her own ways.</p>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section id="attribution">
		<p>What about attribution?</p>
		<div>
			<p>Archillect is limited to the data that's available at the discovered image source. This makes creator/work identification unreliable as the source can be any website, mainly, social media.</p>
			<p>Content source is one of the valuable topics for Archillect. There is a great amount of effort going into researching different methods for locating real source of the content that can be used for fully automated attribution, such as the experimental <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/archillinks">Archillinks</a>, a dedicated account/bot that finds possible sources through web searches. Feel free to have a look at the <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.archillect.com/">official blog</a> for more information about our technical approaches and public discussions on automated attribution.</p>	
			<p>Additionally, on this archive <imp>every image is linked to its previously collected sources and a reverse image search query</imp> to make things easier for the curious minds. These links will bring "similar images" with a high possibility of the actual creator, work or website being one of the first results.</p>
			<p>If your work is shared on this archive feel free to contact <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/archillect">Archillect</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/muratpak">Pak</a>. Based on your request, it will be removed or credited immediately. It was obviously too beautiful and got her attention.</p>

        <p>It is becoming evident that the <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16021/intel-moving-to-chiplets-client-20-for-7nm">next level of advancement in chip-building</a> can be achieved through open, modular and collaborative methodologies resulting in unmatched flexibility, ease of development and robustness of the end product. This approach is shared by our partners <a href="https://zglue.com/">zGlue</a> and Google, with whom we have been collaborating to create a more open and collaborative ASIC design ecosystem.</p>

<p><img src="https://antmicro.com/blog/images/zGlue_Open_Chiplet_Initiative_animation_blognote_twitter.gif" alt="OCI"></p>

<h3 id="continuing-to-collaborate-towards-open-chips">Continuing to collaborate towards open chips</h3>

<p>Following our joint effort to <a href="https://antmicro.com/blog/2019/12/antmicro-zglue-release-chiplet-based-gem-asic/">build two rapid-turnaround proof-of-concept SiPs (System-in-Package), GEM1 and GEM2</a>, we have teamed up again with zGlue and Google to publish <a href="https://github.com/zglue/ZEF">the zGlue Chiplet Info Exchange Format (ZEF)</a> on an open licence, along with a range of open designs and tools. The release is a part of <a href="https://zglue.com/oci">Open Chiplet Initiative</a>, which aims to lower the entry barrier in chiplet-based system design. The tools that have been made publicly available include a bring-up/testing software library (PyChipBuilder), development kits and design examples, including ones for AI use cases, featuring the RISC-V and Arm architectures.</p>

<p>OCI allows our customers to kick-start their development using readily available projects as templates and inspirations. As Antmicro’s contribution to the initiative, we have released the <a href="https://zglue.com/design-automation/oci/project/gem1">GEM1</a> and <a href="https://zglue.com/design-automation/oci/project/gem2">GEM2</a> designs as open source, along with the associated adapter and devkit PCB designs. This is a step towards an open and modular chiplet ecosystem, where we can collaborate with our customers to efficiently build advanced chips consisting of various heterogeneous building blocks.</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-deal-with-gem">What’s the deal with GEM?</h3>

<p>Our cooperation with zGlue towards democratizing the chip making process goes back to last year’s release of the rapid turnaround GEM1 SiP, followed by this year’s GEM2. Both were built using zGlue’s innovative smart fabric technology, which makes it possible to freely combine RISC-V and Arm CPUs, FPGA, sensors, etc. GEM1 consists of two Lattice iCE40 FPGA chiplets, one for processing and control, the other for image processing and inference, together with additional circuitry for MIPI switching between passthrough and processing mode. Its younger sibling, GEM2, replaces one of the FPGAs with eFabless’ RISC-V MCU, Ravenna. Both of these designs are tiny, smart and flexible, and could be used as a base for SiPs targeting applications for computer vision, industrial IoT, medical devices and more.</p>

<p><img src="https://antmicro.com/blog/images/gem2_enface.jpg" alt="GEM2"></p>

<h3 id="chiplets-are-going-mainstream-and-open-source">Chiplets are going mainstream and open source</h3>

<p>In the chiplet space, Intel is pushing forward with their die-to-die <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/programmable/heterogeneous-integration/overview.html">Advanced Interface Bus (AIB) interconnect standard</a>, a technology now <a href="https://chipsalliance.org/announcement/2020/01/22/intel-joins-chips-alliance-to-promote-advanced-interface-bus-aib-as-an-open-standard/">governed by CHIPS Alliance</a>. Aiming to break down the design process into smaller chunks, like zGlue does, but targeting much more advanced, higher-cost and higher-bandwidth applications, AIB enables easy integration of multiple building blocks into a single device for SoCs, FPGAs, SerDes, etc. <a href="https://chipsalliance.org/announcement/2020/07/16/aib-2-0-draft-specification/">CHIPS has recently announced AIB 2.0</a> and both Intel and CHIPS are very committed to popularizing the open spec with open RTL implementation.</p>

<h3 id="future-developments">Future developments</h3>

<p>At Antmicro, we are seeing an incredible opportunity in using chiplets to bring ASICs and SiPs to a much broader range of applications by breaking down complexity and reducing cost. One of our recent projects involved RPC (Reduced Pin Count) RAM - an interesting new technology that can have an important impact on chipmaking. RAM is needed to run full-fledged operating systems such as Linux, but is also typically difficult to incorporate into small devices due to its size and the large number of pins. With RPC RAM, which <a href="https://www.eetimes.com/realtime-video-swap-c-tradeoffs-and-the-rpc-dram-part-2/">can get as small as 2mm x 4.7mm</a>, a chiplet based design can be created using zGlue’s smart fabric that could run Linux  - potentially even in a multi-core setup - in a miniscule footprint.</p>

<p>To enable this kind of exciting developments, we have added RPC RAM support to the open source LiteDRAM memory controller (to be described in a separate note), so that we are able to add RPC memory to our soft - and in the future also hard - processors.</p>

<p>The modular and open chiplet-based chip-building technology significantly reduces the time needed to create functional silicon and broadens its applications. Especially in the context of rising open ASIC development flows and tools such as SkyWater PDK and OpenROAD, chiplet based designs may be extremely interesting in that they allow gradual adoption of open source, software-centric methodologies, unlike monolithic designs.</p>

<p>Antmicro are dedicated to supporting a more agile chipmaking approach and applying it in practical customer applications, so if your project requires a unique, fast-turnaround chip, get in touch with us at <a href="mailto:contact@antmicro.com">contact@antmicro.com</a>.</p>

		<p>Do individual <a href="https://www.growwiser.com/2020/04/09/motivational-compass/">competence, integrity, and excuses</a> even matter? We already use structural incentives to get people to do good things they might otherwise choose not to do: economic incentives, legal disincentives, social pressure. If markets, laws, and opinion can squeeze societal usefulness out of groups of selfish individuals why worry about self-centered behavior? Why not just encourage individuals to figure out what they want for themselves and then structure institutions to squeeze social good out of whatever choices they make in aggregate? Let individuals worry about how to get what they want.</p>
<p>The answer <a href="https://www.growwiser.com/2017/01/29/significance-of-agreement/">seems</a> obvious, at least for social pressure. It is circular to rely on social pressure to police behavior while socially encouraging selfishness. Humans desire acceptance and a feeling of being good which empowers social norms to shape behavior. But if these norms accept excuses and glorify happiness then that is what they will encourage.</p>
<p>While a bit less obvious, civic concern and individual responsibility pull a lot of weight in legal incentives. It is much easier to incentivize people to do the right thing in a community that mostly agrees on the importance of doing right than in one that mostly agrees that everyone should focus on themselves. On what basis should the creators of incentives and enforcers of rules not optimize for themselves otherwise? The difficulty of establishing the rule of law in countries without a sense of civic responsibility should speak for itself.</p>
<p>And while markets might be still less obvious, <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/10/28/financial-incentives-are-weaker-than-social-incentives-but-very-important-anyway/">non-economic</a> concerns with fairness and contribution significantly aid markets. Simple and effective economic incentives are easiest to implement when most believe that good people don’t merely do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">whatever</a> is most profitable. Consider Deirdre McCloskey’s extensive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/022633399X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=growwiser-20">writings</a> on the importance of values to capitalism, Fukuyama’s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684825252/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=growwiser-20">Trust</a></em> on the importance of unselfishness in coordinated endeavors, or simply imagine how different the world would be if most thought it prudent to sneak out of restaurants without paying if they could get away with it.</p>
<p>The pragmatic focus on institutions is valuable and necessary, but so is the idealistic focus on the <em><a href="https://www.growwiser.com/2020/04/09/motivational-compass/">Motivational Compass</a></em> of individuals. These <a href="https://www.growwiser.com/2018/02/05/competition-between-persons-competition-between-groups/">Hamiltonian and Jeffersonian priorities</a> are in inherent and essential conflict, but one that can be healthy if each sticks to their natural scope. Contemporary encroachment of Hamiltonian values into everyday interactions and beliefs attacks the sense of individual agency and meaningfulness of <a href="https://www.growwiser.com/2020/04/09/motivational-compass/#pride-and-progress">pride and progress</a>. It questions the honor of competence and integrity. It separates individual actions from larger concerns and mostly leaves hedonistic Last Personhood and cynical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory">battle of interests</a> as the seemingly coherent options.</p>
<p>The basic beliefs that one can contribute more or less, that one can understand how things work better or worse, that these are skills that can be honed, that developing and applying these skills makes one a better person begin to be treated as naive, reductionist, and judgmental. But these beliefs are the essence of <a href="https://www.growwiser.com/2019/06/24/teaching-and-learning/">mentoring</a> competence and integrity and the fuel that <a href="https://www.growwiser.com/2016/11/04/ingredients-of-action/">motivates</a> achievement and contribution. Without them people who build, innovate, excel, and uphold principles can only be understood as freaks with an odd set of personal interests and an indifference to their own suffering.</p>

<h2 id="individuals-affect-society">Everyday Individuals Affect Society</h2>
<p>While few dismiss the impact of institutions on individuals, many seem to dismiss the impact of individuals on institutions. Many find it difficult to mirror reasonably. They feel their own experiences deeply and see resulting emotions as justified. But they complain when others stereotype. They intuit how demands might affect their own happiness and see how rights and freedoms permit them to reject unpleasant requirements. But they complain when a plumber overcharges, a taxi driver “forgets” to pick them up in inconvenient places, or when products are shoddily manufactured. They perceive effects on the well-being of their family and in-group, empathize with them, and see injustice to be fought by any means available. But they complain about selfishness, lies, and lack of objectivity.</p>
<p>Many fundamentally miss the <em><a href="https://www.growwiser.com/2015/03/02/banality-of-problems-and-the-limits-of-scalability/">Banality of Problems</a></em>: things get done by people and people doing them are just themselves in a different role. Projects become easier and tasks get done better when individuals subjugate their emotional experiences, immediate happiness, and short-range empathy to principles like prioritizing truth, doing good work, and being fair and considerate. This difficult, and occasionally objectionable, task is made not only feasible, but pleasant, by socially defining a <a href="https://www.growwiser.com/2017/01/29/significance-of-agreement/">good person</a> as someone who makes those sacrifices: by having such actions bring personal pride and familial respect, by making them a required part of happiness.</p>
<p>Questions of competence, ethics, and integrity are not merely personal preferences. They affect not only personal capabilities, but institutional ones. They influence not only what individuals want, but ways in which communities are constrained. They develop not only individual desires, but social preferences.</p>
<h2 id="contribution-and-extraction">Contribution and Extraction</h2>
<p>Individuals are free to make the choices they wish, but they bear <a href="https://www.growwiser.com/2019/01/23/circumstances-agency-and-just-deserts/">responsibility</a> for the impact of these choices on systems, institutions, and society.</p>
<p>To a greater or lesser degree, choices either create or extract value. They are thus open to judgment and are a valid component of what it means to be a good person. The sense of responsibility for impact is a major motivation to make socially responsible choices in the short term and to improve abilities to do so over the long term. Evaluation of such choices validates, rewards, and guides them. Responsibility and judgment serve essential functions that cannot be nullified by effects on individual happiness or existence of individual freedom to choose differently.</p>
<p>Underneath this is a seemingly self-evident preference for contribution over extraction. Contribution is hard. Contribution creates value. Societal gains rest on accomplishments of contributors. The fundamental societal challenge is encouraging contribution. Individual traits that aid contribution, or that aid systems that aid contribution, add to the world. Conversely, traits that extract from such systems for individual purposes take from the world.</p>
<p>Once responsibility for impact on society is accepted, it becomes important to figure out what actions are better, what skills and values best enable such actions, what educational methods best produce such skills and values.</p>
<h2 id="how-why-what">How, Why, and What Questions</h2>
<p>Understanding is essential to this process. Contribution takes the world as a consequence of causes that one’s actions affect. The primary questions are “How?” and “Why?”: How does the system function? Why does the system exist? How do my actions affect it? How can I make the system work better? It sees models of the world and challenges of execution as primary and develops goals in symbiosis with them.</p>
<p>Extraction interacts with the world primarily through “What?” questions: What resources are available? What do I desire? What steps do I have to follow? What goals are important? It takes the world as a given and sees goal-setting as primary.</p>
<p>While there are many plausible “How?” and “Why?” questions at many depths, the specifics of the “How stuff gets done?” model aren’t as important as acceptance that such models are crucial and skills that improve creation of such models are essential. Surprisingly many don’t value such models and do not apply whatever models they do come up with to all sides in equal measure.</p>
<h2 id="compassion-and-consideration">Compassion and Consideration</h2>
<p>Extractors don’t have to be mean. Many of them are, in fact, giving and kind. But while these qualities are good, they aren’t necessarily fair or compatible with contribution and understanding. There is a difference between being compassionate and being considerate which messes with our moral intuitions.</p>
<p>A compassionate person feeds the ducks while a considerate person refrains from doing so. A compassionate person slams on the brakes so a fragile pedestrian can cross the street sooner while a considerate person avoids getting close to the crosswalk so many fast-moving drivers don’t have to stop for one pedestrian. A compassionate person accommodates and forgives readily while a considerate person focuses on not having to be accommodated or forgiven.</p>
<p>Such differences aren’t rooted in disparate appraisals of sympathy or abilities of empathy, but in divergent scopes of their application.</p>
<p>A compassionate person is kind and sympathetic, but their concerns tend to focus on issues they can see and their solutions on feelings they can mirror. Their sympathies tend to lie with sufferers. When ducks swim towards them they feel their desire and seek to satisfy it. They prioritize the emotional reward of doing something nice, such as the joy or appreciation on someone’s face. They are weary of abstract demands that might blunt their desire or ability to accommodate visible needs.</p>
<p>A considerate person thinks about effects of their actions on others more broadly. Their sympathies tend to lie with contributors. They empathize with ducks they see, but also with park keepers, visitors, and animals they do not see. They consider systemic effects of sympathy. They prioritize the rational reward of improving systems on the largest possible scale. They are weary of emotional biases that might encourage them to prioritize visible suffering over longer-term, systemic benefits or greater suffering elsewhere.</p>
<p>Kind people <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/give_a_man_a_fish_and_you_feed_him_for_a_day;_teach_a_man_to_fish_and_you_feed_him_for_a_lifetime">give fish</a> and joyfully accept gratitude of the individual and their peers while considerate people teach to fish and strive to value impartial praise concerned with systemic impact.</p>
<p>The two aren’t always in conflict. Compassion can be the right solution – even at institutional scale. Considerate actions can be aligned with kind ones – especially at individual scale. …</p></div></div>

<p>Now that I have mentioned the name of a country in the title, please read the following points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I am an Indian and have been living in the country since my birth.</li>
  <li>I do not claim to be right on all of this and there are many anecdotal generalisations here. Somethings are more like human problems instead of Indian problems <strong>but</strong> just the sheer number of people here puts India on everyone’s radar.</li>
  <li>This post is NOT to denigrate India. It is definitely critical of some of its social and psychological aspects. As a proof for that I want to mention that I am writing a series on the wisdom of ancient Indian philosophical ideas here: <a href="https://pulkitsharma07.github.io/2020/06/25/source-0/">Source [0]</a>, just so you know that I am not writing all my posts with the sole intention to show what is “wrong” with India. We should be brave enough to face the good and bad of it.</li>
  <li>It is a shame that I need to write this header in the first place. But the reality is with or without this, people will still get offended.</li>

<h2 id="what">What</h2>

<p>As most of you may know, <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest</a> started on 1st October 2020. And as it with most things in human life, people came with <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/shitoberfest">different</a> ways to hack hacktoberfest to get the free t-shirt.</p>

<p>Now apart from the sheer number of spam PRs which were opened, copious amount of time is being spent by the comparatively small number of open source maintainers who have comment, close and label each individual PR.</p>

<p>I became aware of this happening from this <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24643894">post</a>, and in a days time several more <a href="https://joel.net/how-one-guy-ruined-hacktoberfest2020-drama">posts</a> popped up. 
I got motivated (triggered?) to write this post when I saw the following on HN:</p>

<p><img src="https://pulkitsharma07.github.io/assets/hacktober/hn_comment.png" alt="hn-comment"></p>

<p>After some investigation, I found the original claim to be true, <code>more than 60% of the spam PRs are coming from one country: India</code> and that is just 1 day after hacktoberfest started, I am sure the percentage will increase as days go by (unless DigitalOcean does something).</p>
<hr>

<h2 id="how">How</h2>

<p><a href="https://joel.net/how-one-guy-ruined-hacktoberfest2020-drama">This</a> post talks about one Indian YouTube channel which apparently told people to open spammy PRs. After I looked around some people were claiming he was falsely accused, anyways the video is deleted now, so I can’t comment on that.</p>

<p>Anyways, it didn’t take long and I was able to find few more Indian YouTubers who were pretty directly promoting ways to open PRs to get those sweet T-Shirts. One created his own <a href="https://github.com/seeditsolution/cprogram/pulls">repo</a> and encouraged people to google different programs and copy-paste them into a new PR against the empty repo.</p>

<p>I do not want to focus on the <em>How</em>, you will find find plenty videos/blogs on it, I am sure some Indian YouTuber has started working on creating a video on it.</p>
<hr>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>One of the simplest explanation is that, DigitalOcean should have been very well anticipated that this is going to happen, after all they must have all the stats from the previous HacktoberFests.</p>

<p>We need to understand that Hacktoberfest is an marketing event. And all these spam and blogs posts around it is definitely serving their main purpose, there is no such thing as bad publicity indeed. Of course I could be totally wrong, all of this could be completely unintentional.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, coming to the Indian side of the ongoing issue. Out of all the countries why does India have the most spammy PRs ? As a seasoned armchair philosopher, the following are my thoughts on the “Why” of all this.</p>
<hr>

<h3 id="the-signalling-problem">The Signalling Problem</h3>
<p>Whenever an online article/documentary/report claim to give a view into the “real” India, most of us (Indians) get offended.</p>

<p>I <em>was</em> in the bubble which was in the “offended” bucket for long time. The reason was simple: I, the people around me and the societal structures around me were all part of the same bubble. We do not have to worry about paying school fees or rent, we do not have worry about sending part of salary back home just so that our parents can buy groceries to survive..</p>

<p>I can go on and on, the overall gist is that I got offended in seeing what other people claim as “real” India, because that India was not part of my reality. Sure, I saw that when travelling from one place to another, saw that on news, read about that in the newspaper; but I was at a very safe distance from all of that.</p>

<p>These days, I try to not get offended when people say India has problem X or problem Y, because I realise I am living inside a cocoon where all of my needs are met, and one of the most serious issues my country is facing right now is <strike>witch-hunting </strike> nabbing the “drug mafia” amongst the Bollywood celebrities who allegedly murdered an actor by giving CBD oil (The absurdity of all this is unfathomable)</p>

<p>I mention all of this, because whenever I read posts which show India in some <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24552047">bad light</a>, there is always someone somewhere who gives anecdotes of how that is not true.</p>

<p>Here are some facts: we have a culture of <strong>extreme signalling</strong>. Signalling is the core building block of our society, most people don’t even realise that how big we are into signalling until they study about “signalling” as a phenomena and start becoming conscious of it. You notice that in the way your parents view you, how you make choices, how people around you make choices.</p>

<p>Of course, people will say “that is not an Indian problem, signalling is just a social construct and literally everyone does that on some level”. I am not denying not that, the very fact that I am writing this post is a kind of signalling I am doing.</p>

<p>It is well known fact that India is one of the densest countries on our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-density?time=2017">planet</a>, extreme siginalling is just one of the consequences of the myriad social problems created by high population density. Signalling in an high density environment is now ever more important as the people you interact or the people who notice your activities/accomplishments are multiples higher than in any other place on the planet.</p>

<p>We people like the wear the “tightly knit society” as badge of honour, let me tell you this “tightly knit society” has done more harm than good. We Indian people have no India of the amount of mental harassment we all go through, because that is just normalized as being just phases of “life”.</p>

<p>The prevalence of extreme signalling brews the classic and infamous <em>herd mentality</em> in our minds. In middle school children have dreams to become a Pilot in the airforce, or maybe a Police officer, or maybe a Opera Singer ! But by the time of high school, everyone is just either on road to become an Engineer, a Doctor, a Lawyer, a Chartered Accountant …. or a <strong>failure</strong>. This may seem harsh but that’s how most of the society operates here in India.</p>

<p>Now once your track is chosen for you (or fortunately, if you get to choose the track), you have some set goals you “must” achieve because they guarantee monetary success with an extremely high probability. If you are Engineer, you need to get into IIT. If you are a Doctor, you need to get into AIIMS. If you are doing management, you need to get into IIM.</p>

<p>Now, if you are an Engineer then your success criteria is not just any IIT, it should be one of the top ones (Bombay, Delhi, Kharagpur, Roorkee) and not just any branch in IIT, it should be <em>Computer Science</em>. Because that’s how you get <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/dec/04/five-iitians-bag-pay-packages-of-over-rs-15-crore-2071120.html">Rs 1.5 crore “packages” (equivalent to 200K USD)</a>.</p>

<p>You can give me examples of how not all IIT toppers choose “Computer Science”, but that’s not the point, for the vast majority of people (more than a million), the success criteria is: getting Computer Science at IIT Bombay.</p>

<p>As might know (or have guessed) getting a seat in IIT Bombay is next to impossible for more than 99% people giving IIT, so they “lower” their goal by aiming for other IITs, but “Computer Science” remains the top priority.</p>

<h3 id="the-jugaad-mentality">The Jugaad mentality</h3>
<p>Hacking systems is so ingrained in our society that we have a word for it: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugaad">Jugaad</a>. The whole scene with Hacktoberfest is just a demo of our Jugaad skills. Wait till you find out that <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/inside-indias-fake-research-paper-shops-pay-publish-profit-5265402">most of the research papers</a> published in India are <a href="https://scroll.in/article/908230/indian-academics-lead-the-world-in-publishing-in-fake-journals-tarring-the-whole-education-sector">fake</a>. Even the orthodontist I was visiting for my checkup turned out to be fake and had forged her certificates (as told by by one other dentist).</p>

<p>The coaching industry actively promotes “cracking” these exams, and I am so tired writing on that topic that I do not want to write more about it here. Refer to my post on this <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/coding-interviewing-coaching-industry-prologue-pulkit-sharma?articleId=6662006663559684097">here</a>. Some children start joining these coaching classes from as low as 5th grade! (apart from doing regular school), just to be able to “crack” the IITs after 7-8 years !</p>

<p>Now how is coaching industry a Jugaad ? Simply because from the point of view of IITs, attending regular school should be enough to prep you for the exams (I think). These coaching industries have made the process significantly harder as you can’t even hope of getting a low tier IIT without attending the coaching classes.</p>

<p>The IIT coaching industry is minting fat cheques out of this entire situation, look at these ads on the front page of the news paper. These ads create a vicious cycle by reinforcing the core “signalling” construct of our society.</p>

<p><img src="https://pulkitsharma07.github.io/assets/hacktober/paper_3.png" alt="hn-comment"></p>

<p>Do not quote me on this, but I think the IIT coaching industries make more <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/education/news/iits-iisc-say-that-patchy-funding-is-delaying-institute-of-eminence-plans/articleshow/72103538.cms">money than the IITs</a> themselves. I understand the purpose of IITs is not to directly generate money, but if it would have more resources they can probably improve the infrastructure, employ better professors and improve the overall level of education.</p>

<h3 id="computer-science-education-in-india">Computer Science Education in India</h3>
<p>For vast majority of engineers in India, Computer Science is  one of the subjects you study in order to succeed in life. Just like you study Chemistry, you “study” Computer Science and once you learn all the “concepts”, you get a good job. (Apologies for so many quoted words, I can’t help putting them in quotes because they carry so much weight for me).</p>

<p>When people are in an average Indian college and if they are are lucky, information about some permutation/combination of the following is spread amongst the …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<h2>Volumetric Live Video</h2>
<p>This is the second part of the series <a href="https://antmedia.io/volumetric-video-container-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spaceport Volumetric Video Container</a>. We pick up the containers back from the place where we created and read. In this tutorial, we’re going to walk you how to play <strong>Spaceport Volumetric Live Video</strong> using Unity. Don’t worry, it’s surprisingly easy to get the containers from the server and decode <strong>volumetric video</strong>, especially when controlling the <strong>container</strong> structure as we want.</p>
<h2>Modifying The Volumetric Video Container</h2>
<p>Let’s start by dividing the large <strong>volumetric container</strong> as many smaller containers that are broken up into ~10 frame increments(you can specify this size as you wish). We only need to buffer frames seconds in advance on the <strong>Unity App</strong> side as we divided the container up in this way. Normally, our CreateContainer() function is programmed to generate a single <strong>.space</strong> file. We will add one condition like the following figure.<br>

In the old version, a single container was containing one metadata, now each small container can hold its own metadata. The metadata is served first and it tells the client where to find each frame start positions. <span>Navigate to the directory of the Spaceport Container file and run the following command:</span></p>
<pre> g++ -I ~/local/include -L ~/local/lib -o output ObjContainer.cpp 10 -ldracoenc -lboost_serialization</pre>
<p>Each new container looks like the following:</p>

<p>Congratulations! You are done with the hard part, now you have simple containers that can be served over HTTP to watch Volumetric Live Video. Let’s set up a simple HTTP server to test it. I used NodeJs / <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">http-server</a> but you can create it however you want.</p>
<h2>Getting Containers From HTTP Server</h2>
<p>We only require a simpler request/response pair. Nowadays, the most common way to solve this problem is to utilize the “Networking” library in Unity.<span>&nbsp;We only need to call the function “<code>SendWebRequest()</code>”&nbsp; to get a volumetric container one by one, until we get a request error.</span> Note that web requests are typically done asynchronously, so Unity’s web request system returns a “yield” instruction.&nbsp;You have to wait until the request is completed. Now you’re done with making requests over <strong>http-server</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unity-get-frame-1024x759.png" alt="ant media server spaceport" width="1024" height="759" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unity-get-frame-1024x759.png 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unity-get-frame-300x222.png 300w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unity-get-frame-768x570.png 768w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unity-get-frame-1536x1139.png 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unity-get-frame-600x445.png 600w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unity-get-frame.png 1796w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="How To Play Spaceport Volumetric Live Video In Unity 3"></p>
<p>Do you remember how we read Volumetric Containers in the previous article? There are only a few fundamental differences between the two structures. We’ll do the same thing but this time, all the files will have the own <strong>metadata</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16-1024x720.png" alt="Volumetric Video ant media server" width="1024" height="720" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16-1024x720.png 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16-300x211.png 300w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16-768x540.png 768w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16-1536x1080.png 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16-600x422.png 600w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16.png 1610w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="How To Play Spaceport Volumetric Live Video In Unity 4"></p>
<p><span>Now let’s turn our eyes to the decoder.</span> We reconstruct the objects for each frame. As above, we will use <strong>MemoryStream</strong> class instead of <strong>BinaryReader.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16-1-1024x777.png" alt="Volumetric Live Video spaceport" width="1024" height="777" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16-1-1024x777.png 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16-1-300x228.png 300w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16-1-768x583.png 768w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16-1-1536x1166.png 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16-1-600x455.png 600w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16-1.png 1544w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="How To Play Spaceport Volumetric Live Video In Unity 5"></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This article provides an overview of how to divide and handle volumetric video containers. That’s all folks, as we can see, we can change the container structure as we want and then reconstruct it for our purpose. We hope this article gave you some ideas for watching the live volumetric video. <span>If you have any questions or feedback don’t hesitate to write your thoughts.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>There are a few things you need to consider when you’re looking to buy a good dumb TV. Let’s take a closer look at each of them.</p><h3>Screen size</h3><p>The biggest challenge you will face when you’re looking for a good dumb TV is getting a good screen size. You will soon realize that there are not a lot of dumb TVs that come in the latest size standards for home entertainment.</p><p>A lot of dumb TVs only have 30-40-inch screens. If this size works for you, then you are in luck. However, in today’s standards, 30-40 inches is not enough screen real estate.</p><p>You may want to find something with at least a 50-inch screen. The good news is that they do exist and, according to our research, you can even go up to 65 inches.</p><p><strong>If you’re in hurry, here’s our recommendations</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Image</th><th>Product</th><th>Features</th><th>Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr id="product-723"><td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0198XNF6U?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/419R0211LBL.jpg" data-src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/419R0211LBL.jpg" alt="Sceptre 65 Inches 4K UHD LED TV"></a></td><td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0198XNF6U?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sceptre 65 Inches 4K UHD LED TV</a></td><td><div><ul><li>Bright LED display and sharp contrast</li><li>65-inch 4K UHD, HDR and MEMC120</li><li>HDMI ports, component ports, optical and line audio outputs</li></ul></div></td><td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0198XNF6U?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-style="">Check Price On Amazon</a></td></tr><tr id="product-724"><td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PW4M13Y?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51S-2IYjHFL.jpg" data-src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51S-2IYjHFL.jpg" alt="Sceptre 50"></a></td><td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PW4M13Y?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sceptre 50″ 4K UHD Ultra Slim LED TV</a></td><td><div><ul><li>50-inch screen that supports 4K UHD</li><li>Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL) to stream videos from a smartphone</li><li>Stunning colors and image contrast</li></ul></div></td><td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PW4M13Y?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-style="">Check Price On Amazon</a></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Input ports</h3><p>Another thing that turns a regular dumb TV into a good dumb TV is the number of input ports it has. Since your dumb TV relies on external devices for display content, you will want several ports to ensure that you can plug in all your devices.</p><p>Having several input ports will allow you to switch between devices without having to physically unplug and plug them. Reaching behind your TV to do this can be very inconvenient.</p><p>HDMI ports are what most external devices today use. You will want at least 3 HDMI ports on your dumb TV. Having more HDMI ports will be better, especially if you’re thinking about getting a few more external devices.</p><h3>Monitors</h3><p>When looking for a good dumb TV, people often make the mistake of looking in the monitor category. A monitor may work for you, but there are a couple of reasons why they may not work as well as a TV.</p><p><a href="https://pointerclicker.com/how-to-clean-a-matte-monitor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monitor displays</a> are relatively darker than TV displays. This is because monitors are designed for people who sit up close.</p><p>It may not be a problem when you’re watching a movie in a dark room. If you watch with the windows open during the day, however, your monitor won’t be able to produce enough brightness to give you pleasant viewing experience.</p><p>Monitors also do not come with a TV tuner. This will be a problem if you’re thinking about watching local channels.</p><h2><span id="Does_a_great_dumb_TV_exist_in_2020">Does a great dumb TV exist in 2020?</span></h2><p>The short answer is yes. Although smart TVs are more popular, there are still a few great dumb TVs being manufactured.</p><p>You can visit your local electronic shop or search for one online. Below are some of our dumb TV recommendations.</p><h2><span id="Editors_recommendations">Editor’s recommendations</span></h2><p>We’ve put together a shortlist of our top dumb TV picks. Take a moment to review each one so you can make a better decision when you plan to make a purchase.</p><h3>1. Sceptre 50” 4K UHD (U518CV-UM)</h3> <p>Sceptre sells quite a number of dumb TVs as well as smart TVs. This particular one has a large 50-inch screen that supports 4K UHD.</p><p>It also comes with Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL) that allows you to stream videos from your smartphone. Sceptre also boasts about its stunning colors and image contrast.</p><h3 id="title"><span id="productTitle">2. Sceptre 65 inches 4K LED TV (U658CV-UMC)</span></h3><div><div data-aawp-product-id="B0198XNF6U" data-aawp-product-title="Sceptre 65 Inche 4K UHD LED TV 3840x2160 MEMC 120 Ultra Thin HDMI 2.0 Upscaling U658CV-UMC 2018" data-aawp-click-tracking="true"> <p><span>Sale</span></p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0198XNF6U?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" title="Sceptre 65 Inche 4K UHD LED TV 3840x2160 MEMC 120 Ultra Thin HDMI 2.0 Upscaling U658CV-UMC, 2018" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Q8eA+4zwL.jpg" data-src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Q8eA+4zwL.jpg" alt="Sceptre 65 Inche 4K UHD LED TV 3840x2160 MEMC 120 Ultra Thin HDMI 2.0 Upscaling U658CV-UMC, 2018"> </a></p></div></div><p>If you want to step it up, you can opt for the 65-inch 4K UHD TV from Sceptre. It is going to cost you more, but it also comes with additional features.</p><p>It has a bright <a href="https://pointerclicker.com/can-you-use-a-laser-pointer-on-a-tv-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LED display</a> and a sharp contrast. Its UHD upscaling will enhance your SD or HD videos so they display excellently in 4K. It also comes with HDR and MEMC120 to give you the best viewing experience.</p><p>This particular TV also has great connectivity options. HDMI ports, component ports, optical and line audio outputs. You won’t be needing additional ports with this TV.</p><h2><span id="What_is_the_dumb_TV">What is the dumb TV?</span></h2><p>When you walk through the video section in an electronic shop, you’re going to find an array of different TVs. Most of the newer ones you will have large high definition screens. And almost all of them are going to be smart TVs.</p><p>Smart TVs have taken over the home entertainment industry by storm. To the point where it has become more difficult to find one that does not have smart features. TVs lacking smart features are also called dumb TVs.</p><p>Dumb TVs are display screens with a built-in TV tuner. They also come with different input ports where you can input video information from an HDTV antenna, Blu-ray player, etc. The most common input ports are HDMI and AV.</p><p>What makes a dumb TV “dumb”? The difference between a dumb TV and a smart TV is that the former does not come with an operating system. It relies on external devices to convert data into video information that it can display.</p><p>All televisions that were manufactured before the invention of smart TVs are dumb TVs. Dumb TVs are still being manufactured today for various reasons, although they are less popular.</p><p>Smart TVs, on the other hand, are more like smartphones or computers. They come with an operating system and a handful of pre-installed apps. You can connect them directly to the internet and stream videos on YouTube, Netflix, and other popular platforms.</p><h2><span id="Why_do_people_need_a_dumb_TV_without_smart_features">Why do people need a dumb TV without smart features?</span></h2><p>As you learn more about what smart TVs offer, you may start to wonder why anyone would want to settle for a dumb TV. Smart TVs are more convenient, and they offer so many useful features.</p><p>While the popularity of smart TV increases, there are quite a few people who still prefer dumb TVs. There are a few reasons why you might opt to get a dumb TV. Let’s take a closer look at each of those reasons in more detail.</p><h3>Security and privacy</h3><p>When it comes to the internet, security and privacy are huge topics. There have been countless horror stories that resulted from having personal devices connected to the internet. If you’re connected, there is always going to be some sort of risk.</p><p>Smart TVs are said to be one of the most vulnerable to hacking and data theft. The FBI has even issued a warning of the risks.</p><p>One of the reasons for this is that smart TVs use automatic content recognition or ACR. ACR gathers information about what you watch and sends it back to the manufacturer. With this information, more relative ads can be shown when you’re browsing for something to watch.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are times when a third party receives the information captured by ACR. These third parties can do whatever they want with that information.</p><p>Many newer smart TVs also come with webcams and microphones. These can be used by hackers to spy on you while you’re watching your favorite show.</p><p>Many people are aware of the dangers of this. This is one of the main reasons there are still quite a few people who opt to get dumb TVs instead of TVs with smart features.</p><h3>Better set-top and stick options</h3><p>Another reason why people purchase dumb TVs is that they prefer to use other TV stick and set-top devices. These devices don’t cost a lot of money and they often work better than smart TVs.</p><p>A few of the more popular ones are the <span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075XLWML4?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" title="Roku Streaming Stick+" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-aawp-product-id="B075XLWML4" data-aawp-product-title="Roku Streaming Stick+ | HD/4K/HDR Streaming Device with Long-range Wireless and Voice Remote with TV Controls  updated for 2019" data-aawp-click-tracking="true">Roku Streaming Stick+</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075XLWML4?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" title="Roku Streaming Stick+" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-aawp-product-id="B075XLWML4" data-aawp-product-title="Roku Streaming Stick+ | HD/4K/HDR Streaming Device with Long-range Wireless and Voice Remote with TV Controls  updated for 2019" data-aawp-click-tracking="true"><span></span></a></span>, <span><span>No products found.</span></span>, <span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0791TX5P5?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" title="Amazon Fire TV Stick" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-aawp-product-id="B0791TX5P5" data-aawp-product-title="Fire TV Stick streaming media player with Alexa built in includes Alexa Voice Remote HD easy set-up released 2019" data-aawp-click-tracking="true">Amazon Fire TV Stick</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0791TX5P5?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" title="Amazon Fire TV Stick" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-aawp-product-id="B0791TX5P5" data-aawp-product-title="Fire TV Stick streaming media player with Alexa built in includes Alexa Voice Remote HD easy set-up released 2019" data-aawp-click-tracking="true"><span></span></a></span>, and <span><span>No products found.</span></span>. There are many more options in the market to choose from.</p><p>These devices connect to your WI-FI and allow you to stream content on popular platforms such as Netflix and YouTube.</p><p>All these devices have seamless UI’s and tons of different apps and features. They also come with <a href="https://pointerclicker.com/presentation-pointers-lcd-tv-screens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remote controls</a> that support voice commands.</p><p>One feature many people find very useful in these devices is the casting feature. It allows you to use your TV as a larger display for your smartphone. You can play videos, view images, and browse the web on your smartphone and have it cast onto your TV.</p><p>You should also remember that technology is advancing a lot quicker than ever before. Your brand-new smart TV will be outdated in just a couple of years. The only way you’re going to be able to keep up with new features and security fixes is to buy a new TV.</p><p>You won’t need to replace your dumb TV to stay updated. All you need to do is purchase the latest stick or set-top device. You can get brand-new ones that already come with voice control for an affordable price.</p><p>Check out this video to learn more about stick and set-top devices.</p><div title="4K Streaming Device Round Up 2019: Apple TV vs Chromecast vs Roku vs Fire TV, Which is best for you?"><div id="WYL_H2Bq9X3a41A"><div id="lyte_H2Bq9X3a41A" data-src="https://pointerclicker.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FH2Bq9X3a41A%2Fhqdefault.jpg"><div><p>4K Streaming Device Round Up 2019: Apple TV vs Chromecast vs Roku vs Fire TV, Which is best for you?</p></div></div></div></div><h3>Interface issues on smart TVs</h3><p>When you use your smartphone or computer, you have two main input sources: pointing and typing. You don’t have either of those in a smart TV interface.</p><p>For the most part, you will use your TV’s remote to click through menus and an onscreen keyboard for typing. It will take you quite a number of button presses to type something into your TV’s search service.</p><p>Some smart TVs also come with poorly designed interfaces. It will take a lot of time trying to navigate around the interface.</p><p>On the other hand, the interfaces that come with newer sticks and set-box devices are more seamless. They also include voice commands and many support keyboard input from your smartphone.</p><h3>Unreliable apps on smart TVs</h3><p>App developers today need to work harder when it comes to compatibility. They need to make sure apps work well with smartphones, browsers, stick and set-top devices, smart TVs and more. Unfortunately, smart TVs are often the last priority.</p><p>This leaves smart TVs with unreliable apps that may crash or freeze. Older smart TVs may also not be compatible with app updates.</p><h2><span id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2><p>Although smart TVs are the most popular choice, there are still a few reasons why you might opt to get a dumb TV. The good news is that there are still quite a few of them being manufactured.</p><p>It may be more challenging to find a good dumb TV, but there’s a good chance a few of them are being sold at your nearest electronics shop. If you want more options, finding them online will be your best bet.</p><p>You can check out online shops such as Amazon, BestBuy, Walmart, and Costco. You may also visit manufacturer websites and look through their …</p></div></div>

Fifty million artificial neurons — a number roughly equivalent to the brain of a small mammal — were delivered from Portland, Oregon-based Intel Corp. to Sandia National Laboratories last month, said Sandia project leader Craig Vineyard.

<br></p><p>The neurons will be assembled to advance a relatively new kind of computing, called neuromorphic, based on the principles of the human brain. Its artificial components pass information in a manner similar to the action of living neurons, electrically pulsing only when a synapse in a complex circuit has absorbed enough charge to produce an electrical spike.</p><p>“With a neuromorphic computer of this scale,” Vineyard said, “we have a new tool to understand how brain-based computers are able to do impressive feats that we cannot currently do with ordinary computers.”</p><p>Improved algorithms and computer circuitry can create wider applications for neuromorphic computers, said Vineyard.</p><p>Sandia manager of cognitive and emerging computing John Wagner said, “This very large neural computer will let us test how brain-inspired processors use information at increasingly realistic scales as they come to actually approximate the processing power of brains. We expect to see new capabilities emerge as we use more and more neurons to solve a problem — just like happens in nature.”</p><p>“The shipment is the first in a three-year series of collaborator test beds that will house increasingly sophisticated neural computers,” said Scott Collis, director of Sandia’s Center for Computing Research. “If research efforts prove successful, the total number of experimental neurons in the final model could reach 1 billion or more.”</p><p>Said Mike Davies, director of Intel’s Neuromorphic Computing Lab, “As high demand and evolving workloads become increasingly important for our national security, Intel’s collaboration with Sandia will provide the tools to successfully scale neuromorphic computing solutions to an unprecedented level. Sandia’s initial work will lay the foundation for the later phase of our collaboration, which will include prototyping the software, algorithms and architectures in support of next-generation large-scale neuromorphic research systems.”</p><p>Machine-learning achievements, of which neuromorphic computing plays a part, already include using neural circuits to make critical decisions for self-driving cars, classifying vapors and aerosols in airports and identifying an individual’s face out of a mass of random images. But experts in the field think such capabilities are only a start in improving machine learning in more complex fields, like remote sensing and intelligence analysis.</p><p>Added Wagner, “We have been surprised that neural computers are not only good at processing images and data streams. There is growing evidence that they excel at computational physics simulations and other numerical algorithms.”</p><p>Sandia artificial intelligence researcher Brad Aimone said, “In terms of neural-inspired computing uses, we are still in the infancy of the explosion to come.”</p><h2><b>Explosion of uses to come from neural-inspired computing</b></h2><p>Intel, a commercial computer chipmaker, and Sandia, a national security lab, aim to explore the effects of increased scale on the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence in commercial and defense areas, respectively.</p><p>For both areas, “what’s still to be determined are the extent of problems that can be solved by AI and the best algorithm and architectures to use to solve them,” Vineyard said. “We can now build these systems at scale, but which algorithms and architectures would best capitalize on the fabrication advances are unknown.”</p><p>Modeled on the complex linking of neurons in the human brain, neuromorphic computers eventually may use far less electrical power and weigh much less than today’s personal computers.</p><p>Computers with artificial neurons act through mathematical approximations, rather than forcing a problem’s solution into conventional computing paths that may contain a forest of inessential steps, said Vineyard.</p><p>But machinery based on circuitry that involves strong electrical spikes, like the biological brain’s operation, has been delayed because “many algorithms that exist today are based upon developers making efficient use of mainstream computer architectures,” said Vineyard. “But brains operate differently, more like the interconnected graphs of airline routes, than any yes-no electronic circuit typically used in computing. So, a lot of brain-like algorithms struggle because current computers aren’t designed to execute them.”</p><h2><b>Neural algorithms on neural computers may just hum along</b></h2><p>An additional aim for Vineyard and colleagues, who already have small prototypes of two and eight chips in Intel’s most advanced class of neuron sets, called Loihi, is to add enough neurons that algorithms based on brain-like logic can be employed on brain-like computer architectures.</p><p>By using emerging brain-inspired architectures to do research and development, “we’ll be providing new approaches and abilities from which novel algorithms can emerge,” said Vineyard.</p><p>The work is funded by the National Nuclear Security Administration’s Advanced Simulation and Computing program.</p><p>–</p><p><b>

<p><em>Merlin Sheldrake, 32, earned his Ph.D. in tropical ecology at the University of Cambridge for his research into underground fungal networks in the tropical forests of Panama. Since then, he has not lost his fascination for them. He is the author of "Entangled Life: How Fungi Make Our Worlds, Change Our Minds and Shape Our Futures," which was published in early September.</em></p>


<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Dr. Sheldrake, we are here in London's Hampstead Heath. This place, you write in your book, means more to you than any other. Why is that?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;I grew up here. This is where I learned to walk. Later, I climbed trees here, and still later, I had parties with friends. And my interest in nature has been incubated by this place.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:&nbsp;</strong>Your interest in nature in general, or fungi in particular?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:&nbsp;</strong>Both. I've always been particularly interested in how things transform, how they grow and decompose. I was amazed how piles of leaves disappear over time. How did this transformation come about without me being able to see anything? Composting, I understood, is largely the work of fungi.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:&nbsp;</strong>For most people, nature is primarily made up of plants and animals. What role do fungi play in between those two realms?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:&nbsp;</strong>Fungi are of enormous importance. The basic principle of ecology is the relationships between organisms - and fungi form connections between organisms and so embody this idea.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:&nbsp;</strong>If fungi are so important, why don’t we see them all over the place?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, fungi are everywhere. Just take this leaf: Between tens and hundreds of species of fungi live on and in it. No plant has ever been found in nature which does not have fungi in its leaves and in its shoots. Or take the roots of the grass we are walking on, the rotting twigs, the soil under our feet: There are fungi everywhere. You have yeast all over your body, in the lining of your ears, in your nostrils. Even in the air: At this moment, you are breathing fungi. Fifty million tons of fungal spores are floating in the atmosphere, the largest source of living particles in the air. And they change the weather by causing water droplets to form.</p>
</div>


<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:&nbsp;</strong>If fungi are so ubiquitous, why we know so little about them?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;There are many reasons. The most obvious one is access. The fungus we see is nothing more than the fruit of the organism itself. The mycelium network that belongs to it is buried in the ground. It is as if we only saw acorns for one moment every year, but we couldn't see the magnificent oak trees.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Do even scientists underestimate the importance of fungi?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;They did so for a long time, at least. Until the 1960s, fungi were thought to be plants. Only then did they gain taxonomical independence. The new sequencing techniques have changed that. Today, we can read the DNA in every teaspoon of soil and find out who is there.</p>

<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:&nbsp;</strong>And? What does one find?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;The kingdom of fungi is vast. There are six times more species of fungi than of plants, and only 6 to 8 percent of them have even been described. We still know so little! ! Just one thing is clear: There are many ways to be a fungus.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Is perhaps the lack of appreciation for fungi because of the fact that they are not very nutritious and often even poisonous?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Many people think like that. But in fact, many mushrooms contain important minerals and they have a high content of antioxidants. They produce an amazing variety of substances that affect cancer, viruses or our immune system. And mushrooms are high in protein. Truffles are a good example of an edible fungus. After all, they want to be eaten. Truffles sit deep in the ground where no wind can spread their spores. They attract animals with a very subtle mixture of odors, so that these animals then eat them and spread their spores.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Some mushrooms lure us with substances that have a direct effect on our consciousness ...</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, about 200 fungal species contain psilocybin, a substance that people have been interested in because of its strong psychedelic effects.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Such mushrooms cause hallucination and change the way we think. How do mushrooms benefit from making psychedelic drugs for humans?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;We don’t know. The first mushrooms to make psilocybin lived 75 million years ago, long before humans arose. But the receptors that this substance binds to can also be found in many animals. Does psilocybin change the behavior of certain insects in a way that induces them to spread fungal spores? Or do they change the behavior of insects in a way that deters them from eating the mushrooms?</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Have you personally tried the effects of psychedelic mushrooms?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, under their influence I realized that most of my consciousness was unknown to me. It was as if I had spent my life in a garden until then, and now I suddenly discovered that this garden has a gate through which I can enter a strange and wonderful forest, that was largely unknown to me.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Does the gate disappear once the effects of psilocybin fade away?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Not necessarily. Once you know that this forest exists, it is much easier to find your way into it.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;You even took part in a scientific study.</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, though it was LSD tested in that study. But both substances have similar effects. Among other things, it was to be examined whether LSD promotes creativity. Each participant had to name a problem they were currently working on and, under the influence of LSD, &nbsp;we were to try to solve that problem.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;And?</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp; I found the effects of LSD very helpful in allowing me to approach questions from new angles and imagine the relationships between plant and fungus from different points of view.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;You attribute cognitive abilities to fungi. What makes you think so?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;I've been thinking about this for a while. I'm interested in the way fungi perceive their environment and how they react to it. Information is continuously flowing through their decentralized bodies.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;What do fungi perceive?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Most importantly, they have extremely diverse chemical sensors. A fungus can be seen as a large, chemically sensitive membrane, so to speak, as one big olfactory epithelium. But many mushrooms can also perceive light and they are sensitive to gravity, to changes in temperature and to changes in pressure.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;So the fungi under our feet can sense that we are here?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong> Some fungi would detect the pressure of our steps, yes. And now the question is, how do they process all this information without a brain and how do they translate it into behavior, into action?</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Action? Behavior? What do fungi do?</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Fungi are quite active. Take hunting, for example.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Excuse me? Mushrooms can hunt?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Yes. When food becomes scarce, some fungi can switch to a hunting mode. They build traps consisting of sticky loops or poisonous droplets. And with special substances, they lure nematodes into these traps.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Is this really "behavior" of the kind we see in animals?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Well, we can run away from danger, fungi have to face it. Therefore, they defend themselves with the help of chemicals, or they regenerate. But that doesn't change the fact that fungi do make decisions, just as we do.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;What kind of decisions?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Fungi have many options: where to grow, what to eat, what nutrients to transport, whether to withdraw and when to hunt nematodes. Each fungus forms thousands of so-called hyphae - tiny tubes that can either grow, divide or fuse.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;If fungi make decisions, are they also capable of solving problems?</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Absolutely. For example, their growth follows very efficient navigation algorithms. There are various experiments in which fungi very rapidly found the shortest route through a maze.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;If fungi are, as you claim, complex information processing networks, are they essentially a kind of brain?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;No, I wouldn’t say that. But you are right: Neurons are tip-growing, electrically excitable, network-forming cells. And so are fungal cells.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;So mushrooms have a form of intelligence?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;It depends on your definition of "intelligence." In a broad sense, all organisms show intelligence, albeit to different degrees. The study of cognition and intelligence arose from the study of the human mind. This resulted in a very human- and brain-centered view. I find it refreshing to extend these considerations to organisms that do not have brains. We shouldn't use ourselves as the yardstick to judge everything else in this world.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Is there still a lot to discover in the field of fungi cognition?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:&nbsp;</strong>Absolutely. Little is known about how fungi coordinate their behavior. We don't know the mechanisms by which they pass signals around. We've not fully understood the basic biology of mycelial growth.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:&nbsp;</strong>But we do know a lot about the symbiotic relationship between mushrooms and plants …</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:&nbsp;</strong>… exactly, via the mycorrhiza, through which the fungus supplies the plant with minerals such as nitrogen and phosphorus, and the plant in turn provides the fungus with energy-rich sugars.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;How important is this symbiosis? If all fungi were wiped out in this forest floor, could the trees survive?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;No. They would be prone to disease, just as we would be if it weren't for the bacteria in our intestines. This microbiome keeps us healthy. In this sense, soil is sort of the gut of our planet.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Many ecologists are enthusiastic about the "Wood Wide Web," by which trees are mysteriously connected via the fungi in the soil and allegedly even communicate via this …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

<blockquote><p><em>A patent troll is a company formed for only one purpose—to purchase patents and assert them broadly against real, productive companies.

<p>Picture this. You find yourself in Xanadu, embroiled in a legal battle. Unlike America though, Xanadu has a very curious legal system. They have gotten rid of lawyers entirely… and have instead legalized courtroom bribery. When finding yourself in any courtroom, you are allowed (and expected) to bribe the judge in exchange for a favorable review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bribe the judge a reasonable amount, and you can expect to get a fair hearing on the merits of your case. Bribe the judge an exceedingly large amount, and you can expect a judge who is more sympathetic to your arguments. Bribe the judge a minimal amount, or refuse to bribe the judge at all, and you will find yourself facing an uphill battle, for any non-trivial case.</p>



<p>Outraged? You definitely should be. That hardly sounds like justice. Think it will never happen here in America or the “civilized” world? Think again. The exact same dynamic is fully on display here everyday… though the injustice is covered up far more tactfully. </p>



<p>The average cost of good legal representation for a murder trial, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.legalpriceguide.com/criminal-defense-legal-costs/" target="_blank">is over $100,000</a>. The average cost for a business to defend itself against a patent troll <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wintechblog.com/2014/07/the-cost-of-defending-against-patent-trolls/" target="_blank">is over $1 million</a>. And suing a major corporation can cost <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/monsanto-lawsuit-verdict-of-289-million-roundup-case-could-evaporate-to-nothing-thanks-to-tax-reform/" target="_blank">a staggering $140 million</a>.</p>



<p>It is possible that anyone paying the above amounts is a fool who enjoys throwing their money away. More likely however, they are well aware that you simply cannot get a fair hearing in the legal system, unless you’re willing to spend significant sums of money on good legal representation. Or more cynically, that you can tilt the legal system in your favor, simply by spending gobs of money on excellent legal representation, expert witnesses, jury consultants, and innumerable other resources that give you a leg up in court.</p>



<hr>



<p>Nowhere is this on better display, than in Hulk Hogan’s lawsuit against Gawker. Even as a famous multi-millionaire, Hulk Hogan knew better than to take on a powerful corporation like Gawker. Until, that is, he found himself backed by an even more powerful billionaire (Peter Thiel) who had his own personal grudge against Gawker. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/might-an-anti-gawker-benefactor-be-covering-hulk-hogans-legal-bills/" target="_blank">To quote an article speculating on this topic</a> before Thiel’s involvement became known:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Watching the fascinating, graphic and often embarrassing testimony of Hulk Hogan in his lawsuit against Gawker, I couldn’t help wonder, how the heck did this case not settle? … there is a reason this is the first case to ever go to trial over a celebrity sex tape. Taking a lawsuit like this to trial is enormously, sometimes prohibitively, expensive for both sides. This one in particular, has been a legal fee fiesta for almost four years with numerous complex issues litigated in multiple venues both federal and state. I wouldn’t be surprised if at the end of this trial the costs were roughly $3 million. Each. That includes pricey experts travel and overpriced (but seemingly excellent) attorneys. And that is before any possible appeal.</em></p><p><em>There were multiple mediation/settlement discussions and Gawker must have offered to pay significant damages (neither side would discuss numbers). After all, Gawker’s insurance isn’t covering the costs and many have described it as a potentially existential crisis for Gawker Media. In fact, this suit forced Denton to take the draconian measure of raising money, for the first time, just to help fund the defense and any possible judgment.</em></p><p><em>So why would Hogan reject what must have been multi-million dollar offers? More importantly, what happens if Hogan loses? Who pays his side’s enormous fees?</em></p></blockquote>



<hr>



<p>If the above sounds like an amusing battle between the rich and famous, it is certainly also an issue that affects both you and me.</p>



<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54174598"><em>She was an Indonesian domestic helper who earned S$600 a month</em></a><em> working for an extremely wealthy Singaporean family. One day, his family accused her of stealing from them. They reported her to the police – triggering what would become a high-profile court case… Earlier this month, Parti Liyani was finally acquitted…&nbsp; But her case has prompted questions about inequality and access to justice in Singapore, with many asking how she could have been found guilty in the first place.</em></p><p>In 2019, a district judge found her guilty and sentenced her to two years and two months’ jail. Ms Parti decided to appeal against the ruling. The case dragged on further until earlier this month when Singapore’s High Court finally acquitted her.</p><p><em>The case has also highlighted the issue of migrant workers’ access to justice. Ms Parti was able to stay in Singapore and fight her case due to the support of the non-governmental organisation Home, and lawyer Anil Balchandani, who acted pro bono but estimated his legal fees would have otherwise come up to S$150,000.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Luckily the above story has a happy ending as an unjust conviction was overturned on appeal… but only because of a noble lawyer who was willing to donate $150,000 worth of legal services. One wonders how many other convicts sitting in prison today would be free, if they too were able to afford similarly expensive lawyers. Or at least that’s what I wondered, until I realized someone had already done <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/241158.pdf" target="_blank">a study on this very topic</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Suppose the 2,459 defendants in our sample represented by appointed counsel had been represented instead by Defender Association counsel? Based on the results in Table 2, we would expect 270 defendants who were convicted of murder to have been entirely acquitted of this charge with Defender Association representation, and 396 individuals who received life sentences would have been spared a life sentence</em>.</p><p><em>We might have expected defense counsel to make the least difference in murder cases because the state expends the most resources and has the highest stakes in a reliable outcome. In fact, we find that counsel makes a vast difference in the outcome of murder cases. Our qualitative interviews suggest that the causes of this disparity are incentive structures created by the appointment system and a resulting failure of appointed counsel to prepare cases as thoroughly as the Defender Association. Effective counsel is a prerequisite to the assertion of nearly every other right. As the Supreme Court observed, “it is through counsel that all other rights of the accused are protected: Of all the rights that an accused person has, the right to be represented by counsel is by far the most pervasive, for it affects his ability to assert any other right he may have</em>“</p><p><em>Ideally, the vagaries of counsel should make no difference in the outcome of a proceeding in our justice system. Our findings show how far from this goal we are.</em></p></blockquote>



<hr>



<p>In an ideal world, judges, juries and the legal system as a whole, would be wise enough to rule purely on the merits of the case, regardless of how expensive or poor the legal representation might be. In an ideal world, no one will ever need to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars (let alone millions and tens of millions) on legal expenses, because everyone would know that an army of Ivy League lawyers will not sway the outcome of the case by even one iota.</p>



<p>I would love to live in such an ideal world, but that is clearly not the world we live in today. To put things in perspective, during the IP lawsuit waged between Oracle and Google, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/05/oracle-poured-millions-into-failed-patent-trial-but-will-fight-on/" target="_blank">the two corporations spent tens of millions of dollars on legal fees</a>. And attorneys who represent the privileged in murder trials, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.justiceadmin.org/court_app_counsel/Flat%20Fee%20Rates.pdf" target="_blank">make 4 times more than the court-appointed lawyers who are defending the general public</a>. Anyone who thinks that spending gobs of money on lawyers and expert witnesses won’t help you in the courtroom, is delusional.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>A Radical Proposal</strong></h2>



<p>There are many incremental solutions that would help ameliorate the current dysfunctional legal system. For instance, better funding for public defenders, and harsher penalties for frivolous lawsuits. These proposals should certainly be given close consideration, even if they do not resolve the problem fully. But today, I’d like to discuss an even more radical proposal that will completely abolish the financial bias in the courtroom.</p>



<p><strong><em>Anytime one party in a legal battle wants to spend more money than the other, they should be required to subsidize the other party’s legal expenses by a similar amount.</em></strong></p>



<p>Ie, if you’re a broke bricklayer who has been accused of a crime, and find yourself being prosecuted by a high-profile District Attorney who is making $150,000/year, the state should be obligated to pay for your equally expensive defense lawyer.</p>



<p>If you’re a billionaire who has been accused of sexual assault, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/harvey-weinstein-settlement.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and you spend $20 million on the best possible legal defense</a>, you should be obligated to give the District Attorney’s office and your accusers millions of dollars as well, so that they can mount an equally strong case.</p>



<p>If you’re a common man who has been wronged by a big corporation, and the corporation responds to your lawsuit with an entire phalanx of lawyers attempting to drown you in paperwork, they should be required to fund your own equally expensive legal team to respond in kind.</p>



<p>And if <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9kxzpy/apple-is-still-trying-to-sue-the-owner-of-an-independent-iphone-repair-shop-louis-rossmann-henrik-huseby" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you’re a small-medium business being sued by a big corporation</a>, or <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/standing-up-to-a-dangerous-new-breed-of-patent-troll/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an amply resourced patent troll</a>, your accuser should be required to pay for your legal defense as well, instead of simply intimidating you into submission with the threat of legal expenses.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									<p><img src="https://www.netizen.net/media/blog/xnetwork.jpg.pagespeed.ic.pXXQct_TOX.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Remote work is here to stay and, as the most recent COVID-19 pandemic declaration is beginning to demonstrate, it can be a highly effective disaster mitigation and recovery strategy when implemented properly. However, too many companies and other organizations have been caught unprepared technologically, and attackers have been waiting for just such an opportunity to pounce. My intent here is not to argue the merits or drawbacks of remote work in its various forms as a daily practice, but rather to highlight some of its inherent risks when implemented on such a vast scale so quickly under the impetus of external factors.</p>
<p>The first of these risk factors is social. Various studies have shown that a majority, at least, of human communication is in the form of body language and other nonverbal forms. Lacking inflection, tone, and posturing, many electronic communication media that so easily facilitate remote work also make it harder to determine legitimate from illegitimate communications without an effectively trained workforce that is adept in identifying attempts at misleading them into taking actions harmful to the organization. Take for instance email. Now, we all get bombarded with attempts to steal passwords, data, and documents on a daily basis, also known as Phishing. Spear Phishing, however, is becoming much more prevalent and are essentially the more highly targeted forms of routine Phishing. Spear Phishing leverages publicly available information on a person to either manipulate or impersonate them. It can often be hard to detect, especially when relying predominantly on email for communication amongst your newly remote workforce.</p>
<p>When you work in an office and you receive an email from someone two cubicles over telling you they need “all the company payroll data,” it is easy to verify the validity of that request with a short walk, a discussion about the rationale, talking to a supervisor to ascertain the person’s authorization to access the information, and responding accordingly. What such processes are in place for your remote workforce? It can be done, but typically involves a more asynchronous form of communication; you send a message, move on to other work whilst awaiting a response, and proceed from there. But what if the message was far more urgent? The recipient would then have to make a snap decision on the validity of the request, and this is a tactic that attackers leverage to coerce their intended target more effectively, especially if the “request” seemingly comes from a someone in a position of authority. That split-second decision, especially when perceived to come from an authoritative resource within the organization, can make-or-break your company. This is why mandatory training on common social engineering attacks (like Phishing) should be implemented routinely (i.e. annual at the very least), especially for anyone participating in remote work. Making so called “cyber hygiene” training a mandatory requirement for remote work participation is also a good idea. Doing so will inform your remote workforce of the processes used for validating and responding to requests while more easily identifying and reporting the malicious ones.</p>
<p>Training is great, but it can’t do everything. The second risk factor is purely technological. The systems and tools you use to facilitate remote work are crucial to success, but also play an outsized role in the security and confidentiality of your data now, too. It is inevitable that some employees will attempt to leverage personal devices for work related tasks. What sort of controls does your organization have in place to manage corporate data, even if processed using a personal device? A solid mobile device management (MDM) suite along with data rights management (DRM) policies will help prevent leakage or loss of sensitive data on portable devices, even personally-owned employee ones. For instance, Office 365 has exceptional MDM and DRM policies and filtering that can be set up rapidly to prevent the transmission of sensitive data, like financial information and social security numbers. MDM can also provide functionality to remote-wipe a device if lost and enforce security protocols such as strong passwords and data encryption. Even better, Microsoft provides their comprehensive Security and Compliance Center to visualize threats, alerts, and other critical information pertaining to the overall security posture of your organization. This is just an example of one provider offering, there are many others – it’s more important that you leverage the tools you have effectively than to choose one particular vendor over another. Companies that specialize in these types of remote security management can provide cost effective expertise to mitigate your biggest cyber threats that a remote workforce creates and help prevent hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars in breach remediation costs.</p>
<p>The last portion we will discuss here is policy. Training, Policy, and Technology is sort of the “iron triangle” of basic cyber preparedness. Without one side, the rest will fall. Policy need not be bureaucratic to be effective, contrary to many practices. A solid set of policies and documentation will guide employees on what to do and what not to do while standardizing your response to incidents, implementation of security procedures, and provide a reporting structure so everyone is properly informed and knowledgeable, regardless of their workplace location. Essential policies that your organization should already have go beyond simple things like password requirements and deeper into areas such as electronic resource availability (e.g. file sharing), personal device usage (e.g. BYOD), connectivity requirements (e.g. VPN usage, email, etc.), physical workplace restrictions, and contingencies in the event of breach or loss of connectivity. Defining and describing these things ahead of time will go a long way in preparing your workforce for the security challenges of remote work. It will also provide a standard “playbook” so to speak from which everyone within your organization can operate from. Once policies are in place, it is a good idea to have employees review and sign them along with a comprehensive remote work agreement that outlines their responsibilities, duty hours, requirements, and other attributes. Many companies have standardized templates and can help you get started quickly with such policies, but they are of little use if not enforced. Enforcement of policies requires discipline, as it would be easy to make exceptions for every little bump in the road, but that is not safe. While your chosen policies should not hinder the work of remote employees, it still has to ensure the safety and security of your data that is now being transmitted off-site. There is a balance, and each organization has to fine theirs based on risk profile and what level of risk is considered acceptable to your operations.</p>
<p>I’ve gone over some of the basics of remote work security, focusing on the core attributes of training, policy, and technology. This is a framework from which to get started with securing your corporate data as it moves out of the office and across the country. Keep in mind there are other aspects, legal and supervisory for example, that aren’t covered but also important. Many companies will also have far more complex requirements, and should not hesitate to retain experts in implementation for the simple reason that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. The “cure” in this instance, being the remediation of often disastrous and costly effects of a breach that include loss of customer confidence, legal fees, higher insurance premiums, and lost business. As the size of the world’s remote workforce increases year after year, every organization should be prepared to take advantage, even if only for use in mitigating the impact to business operations of external factors. Leaders must be aware of the ever-shifting landscape of tools, technologies, and threats to such operations, however, in order to stay ahead of the curve, and the best way to do that is to rely on experts.</p>

October 2, 2020 | https://danieldusek.com/escaping-improperly-sandboxed-iframes.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://danieldusek.com/escaping-improperly-sandboxed-iframes.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="content">
        <p>In <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe">Mozilla's developer documentation</a> on <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, you can find the following remark related to <code>allow-scripts</code> and <code>allow-same-origin</code> values of the <code>sandbox</code> attribute:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the embedded document has the same origin as the embedding page, it is <strong>strongly discouraged</strong> to use both <code>allow-scripts</code> and <code>allow-same-origin</code>, as that lets the embedded document remove the sandbox attribute — making it no more secure than not using the sandbox attribute at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I first read this note, I thought that escaping will be fairly straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessing <code>window.parent</code> from the page inside the iframe,</li>
<li>getting the iframe element reference via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction">Document Object Model (DOM)</a> functions, such as <code>.getElementById()</code> or <code>.getElementsByTagName()</code>,</li>
<li>removing the iframe's <code>sandbox</code> element via <code>.removeAttribute("sandbox")</code>,</li>
<li>calling <code>alert()</code> function to create a modal window despite <code>allow-modals</code> was not set for the iframe, hence escaping from the iframe's restrictions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunatelly, this rather naïve approach does not work. From my experiments, the reason for that is the fact that browsers apply restrictions on the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>'s content <strong>when loading the page</strong>. When I subsequently change or remove the sandbox attribute and then call "illegal" functions, browser will still block them.</p>
<p>On the following lines I will demonstrate the simplest solution I have been able to come up with. Before I get to it, let me explain the terminology I am using - a <code>child page</code> refers to a page that is being displayed in the <code>iframe</code>, while a <code>parent page</code> refers to a page that contains the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> element. </p>
<p>Let's have a look at parent page, in <code>index.html</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>meta</span> <span>charset</span><span>=</span><span>"utf-8"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>title</span><span>&gt;</span>PoC - Discouraged combination of sandbox attribute values (parent page)<span>&lt;/</span><span>title</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>iframe</span> <span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"kid.htm"</span> <span>sandbox</span><span>=</span><span>"allow-same-origin allow-scripts"</span> <span>id</span><span>=</span><span>"escapeMe"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>iframe</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This is the page that we need to modify from the child page (<code>kid.htm</code>). To escape the iframe as I outlined above, I will be popping an <code>alert()</code> from the child page inside the parent. </p>
<p>One of the simplest solutions I have been able to come up with is to simply create a new iframe in place of the old one, and let the child page know it has been loaded in unrestricted mode. I will walk you through the process step by step.</p>
<p>First, I will obtain a reference to the parent window and verify the <code>iframe</code> in question still exists. If the original iframe <strong>is missing</strong>, it means that the child page is loaded from another <code>iframe</code> - the one we are going to create in step 2 as a replacement:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>let</span> <span>parent</span> <span>=</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>parent</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>parent</span><span>.</span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>"escapeMe"</span><span>)</span> <span>!=</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// 1. Create replacement iframe</span>
    <span>// 2. Delete the old one</span>
<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// When the original iframe no longer exists, we can assume</span>
    <span>// it is possible to execute our code without restrictions</span>
    <span>alert</span><span>(</span><span>"This should not have happened."</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In the second step, I expand the body of the condition to create unrestricted iframe and to remove the original one with restrictions:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>let</span> <span>parent</span> <span>=</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>parent</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>parent</span><span>.</span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>"escapeMe"</span><span>)</span> <span>!=</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>// 1. Create replacement iframe</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>replacement</span> <span>=</span> <span>parent</span><span>.</span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>"iframe"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>replacement</span><span>.</span><span>setAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>"src"</span><span>,</span> <span>"kid.htm"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>replacement</span><span>.</span><span>setAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>"id"</span><span>,</span> <span>"escapedAlready"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>parent</span><span>.</span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>replacement</span><span>);</span>

    <span>// 2. Delete the old one</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>original</span> <span>=</span> <span>parent</span><span>.</span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>"escapeMe"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>original</span><span>.</span><span>parentNode</span><span>.</span><span>removeNode</span><span>(</span><span>original</span><span>);</span>

<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// When the original iframe no longer exists, we can assume</span>
    <span>// it is possible to execute our code without restrictions</span>
    <span>alert</span><span>(</span><span>"This should not have happened."</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now, when the parent page loads the child page into the <code>iframe</code> with <code>allow-scripts</code> and <code>allow-same-origin</code>, the child page manages to escape the original iframe's restrictions and execute its code.</p>
<p>Both of the files I used in this demonstration are <a href="https://github.com/dusekdan/RandomSecurity/tree/master/iframeSandboxDiscouragedCombination">available on my Github</a>. You can also try for yourself on my <a href="https://dusekdan.github.io/RandomSecurity/iframeSandboxDiscouragedCombination/">Github Pages</a>.</p>
<p>Can you think of a simpler way to escape? Please let me know!</p>

	<div>
	
<p>There probably have been millions of articles written about the Apple of Tim Cook and how it differs from the Apple of Steve Jobs. I’ve always been hesitant to add to that.</p>



<p>Having worked at Apple for 12 years under Steve and 8 years under Tim, that gives me plenty of exposure to both eras. I’ll start with a quick review of the <strong>big things</strong> that people generally agree Apple misses from the loss of Steve before getting to the <strong>little things</strong>.</p>



<h3>The big things Apple misses</h3>



<p>After Steve died, the majority of pundits seemed to predict some level of doom for Apple, as if Steve were personally responsible for the entirety of every Apple product. It was as if he were the sole person making every decision at Apple. The second most common thing mentioned is the loss of Steve’s relentless curation of Apple products. It was argued that Steve had once-in a lifetime skills in these two categories.</p>



<p>This may be true, but it must be recognized than Apple has enjoyed great financial success under Tim Cook and also product success with Apple Watch and AirPods specifically. To balance it out, there were also duds like HomePod, neglect of the Mac, and a decline in software quality. But you could pluck similar things from the era when Steve was in charge.</p>



<figure><img src="https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/screen-shot-2012-01-28-at-6-28-23-pm.png" alt="" srcset="https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/screen-shot-2012-01-28-at-6-28-23-pm.png 669w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/screen-shot-2012-01-28-at-6-28-23-pm-295x300.png 295w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/screen-shot-2012-01-28-at-6-28-23-pm-266x270.png 266w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px"></figure>



<h3>The little things Apple misses</h3>



<p>What interests me the most is the little things Apple misses. Just like Apple used to be famous for the clever little touches they added to their products, Steve had many little facets to his personality. Each one may not be significant on its own, but together, I think they add up to a huge loss.</p>



<h4>Giddy excitement</h4>



<p>Steve had an infectious excitement that we felt working at Apple and that people couldn’t help but notice at product introduction events. </p>



<p>Seeing him around campus, he was either deep in thought—possibly talking with Jony Ive or another confidant—or often with a grin on his face. But he always had a spring in his step, even close to the end. He felt like a little kid in an adult body. If you were having a down day, it was hard not to be uplifted by the sight of your CEO practically skipping down the halls.</p>



<figure><img src="https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/getty_128349414_2000133320009280124_274316-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/getty_128349414_2000133320009280124_274316-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/getty_128349414_2000133320009280124_274316-300x169.jpg 300w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/getty_128349414_2000133320009280124_274316-768x432.jpg 768w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/getty_128349414_2000133320009280124_274316-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/getty_128349414_2000133320009280124_274316-480x270.jpg 480w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/getty_128349414_2000133320009280124_274316-850x478.jpg 850w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/getty_128349414_2000133320009280124_274316.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Although I don’t question that Tim is excited about Apple, you just don’t feel it. He comes across far too rehearsed. Steve’s combination of being very articulate, possessing great presentation skills, and this giddy excitement made you want to feel the same excitement he did about the products. </p>



<h4>Technical prowess</h4>



<p>Steve was never considered to be much of an engineer, but he could speak engineer language and understood the smallest of technical details. Even though he would motivate and push engineers to do the impossible, he also understood what was currently possible. How else would you know what’s impossible to demand? 🙂</p>



<p>Steve spent his life around engineers and artists at both Pixar and Apple. Tim simply does not have that background so you can’t criticize him for lacking in it. Nonetheless, having a CEO of a tech company be very highly technically savvy is a huge win.</p>



<h4>Two peas in a pod</h4>



<p>It’s cliché to say, but Steve and Jony Ive were definitely greater than the sum of their parts. By losing Steve, we also lost a great deal of Jony as well. I don’t know Jony or much about him, but I feel like he never fully recovered from Steve’s death.</p>



<p>I would go to lunch fairly late every day and would inevitably see Jony and Steve having lunch and immersed in conversation. I’d often see them walking and talking together. They were joined at the hip. I typically would see him alone—on his way somewhere—or with Jony.</p>



<figure><img src="https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/steve-jobs-jony-ive_41203-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/steve-jobs-jony-ive_41203-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/steve-jobs-jony-ive_41203-300x169.jpg 300w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/steve-jobs-jony-ive_41203-768x432.jpg 768w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/steve-jobs-jony-ive_41203-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/steve-jobs-jony-ive_41203-480x270.jpg 480w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/steve-jobs-jony-ive_41203-850x478.jpg 850w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/steve-jobs-jony-ive_41203.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>I hate to criticize such a close friend of Steve’s but the decline in Apple software quality is pretty closely aligned with Jony taking ownership of it in addition to his usual hardware duties. Without Steve to balance him out, he was just out of his league.</p>



<p>iOS 7 was one of Jony’s first software projects, widely regarded as a train wreck which took several years to fix. You’ll often hear the phrase “this would never have happened under Steve” and in this case, I think it’s true. Steve was good at reeling things in and stripping them down and that’s a huge loss.</p>



<h4>Belief and respect</h4>



<p>Before working at Apple, I was used to working for relatively uninspiring and often clueless CEOs. One thing that I found refreshing at Apple was that—even though people had their differences—people respected Steve and believed in the direction he was taking the company.</p>



<p>This had a profound affect inside Apple. If Steve was pushing the company in a specific direction combined with that respect, it was much easier to do your day-to-day job. Most jobs involve a lot of smaller decisions that would never rise to Steve’s level. But because we knew the path we were on, it was easy to make these smaller decisions ourselves.</p>



<p>In a sentence, we understood the mission we were on and we respected the messenger.</p>



<h4>Visibility</h4>



<p>I’ve worked at companies with 200 employees where we’d see the CEO twice a year at company meetings. He was holed up in his office or meeting with his directs all the time—or maybe playing golf—and never interacted with anyone else.</p>



<p>I worked at Infinite Loop for 19 years, with 12 of those under Steve. For such a large company, Steve was a routine presence around the company. He was often walking in the inner quad area of the campus, in the hallways, and would drop in frequently on projects important to him. He ate in the café every day as far as I can tell.</p>



<p>It’s easy to feel like there’s no one steering the ship if you never see the captain, so his frequent presence was very comforting. Even saying hi to him felt like an acknowledgment that you were a part of what everyone was working towards.</p>



<h4>Culling</h4>



<p>You’ll sometimes hear stories about how Steve is this awful tyrant and how he cruelly disassembled a project someone was working on during a presentation. All these stories have one thing in common: they come from <em>former</em> Apple employees.</p>



<p>Now, you could argue that a current employee would never talk, but I think a disgruntled one would talk anonymously at least. There are many cases of this.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ll-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ll-1.jpg 417w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ll-1-300x195.jpg 300w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ll-1-415x270.jpg 415w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px"></figure></div>



<p>I’m calling this trait “culling” because Steve was not only very direct, he was seeing how you handled the pressure. If what you were demoing to him was crappy, he would tell you it’s shit. Now, some people would take great offense at that, typically those with larger egos, while others see it as just part of the making great products.</p>



<p>Over time, I think this led to management and lead engineers being thick-skinned and willing to change when the CEO told them they were way off track. If you’ve worked in software, I think you can see the benefit of being able to take criticism.</p>



<p>Overall, I think it led to a stronger workforce that was less prone to petty politics or bad-mouthing others. Instead, people would criticize products, not people and that led to great people making great products.</p>



<h4>Hiring</h4>



<p>With a huge notable exception over his entire career— John Sculley—Steve really knew how to hire exceptional people. The talent pool that was inherited by the NeXT acquisition was phenomenal as well as hiring amazing people like Tim Cook.</p>



<p>I imagine a form of culling took place in a Steve interview as well. If you crumbled under difficult questions that might be highly critical of your current job, how could you survive at Apple?</p>



<h4>Public Presentations</h4>



<p>There’s general agreement that Steve was a great presenter, possibly one of the best ever. What is interesting to me is how that affected Apple employees. Certainly, having something you worked on or cared about demonstrated on a big stage with media present was a great feeling. But to have <em>Steve</em> be the presenter was an amazing feeling.</p>



<figure><img src="https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ap080115083034-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ap080115083034-1.jpg 800w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ap080115083034-1-300x205.jpg 300w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ap080115083034-1-768x524.jpg 768w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ap080115083034-1-396x270.jpg 396w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption>FILE – In this Jan. 15, 2008, file photo, Apple CEO Steve Jobs holds up the new MacBook Air after giving the keynote address at the Apple MacWorld Conference in San Francisco. Apple on Wednesday, Oct. 5, 2011 said Jobs has died. He was 56. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)</figcaption></figure>



<p>When I worked on Mail in the very early days, we were generally in every keynote, primarily because there weren’t many apps on Mac OS X! But still, to have your work presented with the giddy excitement I mentioned previously was a great motivational factor.</p>



<h4>Internal presentations </h4>



<p>Only Apple employees saw these except for a few that leaked over the years. Employees would wait in line to see a his multi-hour communications meetings! How many can say that for their companies?</p>



<p>Even though Steve was a great marketer, these meetings were generally very straightforward and often very blunt. Not a lot of spin. Often a response would be “No. Next question!” rather than a drawn out politically savvy response.</p>



<p>Here’s one example of this. One employee got up to complain about his salary, feeling that Apple’s rising success—this was around 2005—was not reflected in his paycheck. Steve asked him “Do you have stock?” and he answered “Yes” and Steve answered with “Next Question!” </p>



<p>I’m sure he wasn’t the only one that felt like their salary could be higher but Steve’s response cut to the chase and people left thinking they had less to complain about. If we all work towards the success of the company and it’s reflected in the market, we had nothing to complain about.</p>



<p>And he was right.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>There are some big gaping holes left behind by Steve, but also quite a few smaller ones that add up to something significant. He is sorely missed.</p>

<p>In this article, we will be implementing an “orchestrated” flow, or interaction if you will, as discussed in the <a href="http://serverless mic">previous article</a>.</p>



<p>So, this will be quite a technical and a lengthy post, so better get your coffee refill before we start.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What can you see in this article:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Using an HTTP client for communication between microservices</li><li>Having a request-reply mechanism using HTTP</li><li>Using Azure durable function orchestrator for … well orchestrating</li><li>How to structure your Azure functions code</li><li>Dependency Injection in Azure functions</li></ul>







<p>Also, as the usual disclaimers, in this article, <strong>the idea is not to have the correct modeling of a shopping experience,</strong> which I have to admit is quite ridiculous in this example,<strong> but to have a “use case” on which we could show how we might implement an Azure Durable Function orchestrated flow</strong>.</p>



<p>As usual you can also access the full source code for this post on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/laur3d/durable_function_microservices/tree/3_Implementing_first_integrations" target="_blank">github</a>.</p>



<p>Good, let’s get started</p>



<h2>The setup and assumptions</h2>



<p>Starting from the aforementioned solution&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/laur3d/durable_function_microservices/tree/2_a_bit_better_implementation">here,</a> we will be adding a new project to the solution. We will be doing it like this for tutorial reasons, the two projects will not share anything, so the general recommendation is to have separate solutions and git repos per microservice.</p>



<p>We will call this new service “OrderService”, shocking I know!</p>



<p>Now, as discussed in the previous post, we will need to implement a “standard”-ish order flow. Apart from the requirements from the previous post, we will start with the following assumption to make this easier for us, and not that long and cumbersome:</p>



<ul><li>A user can only order if he is signed in and has the address saved in the system.</li><li>This will be handled by the front end and we will have nothing to do about this.</li></ul>



<p>Now, since we resolved all of this stuff let’s get to the code.</p>



<h2>The code</h2>



<p>So, to get the ball rolling, we will need first to define an entry point into our shiny new service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To do this, we will be adding a new HTTP trigger, “CreateOrder”. This will be a “POST” and will require the Card ID and also the user ID.</p>


<pre title="">        [FunctionName("CreateOrder")]
        public static async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; RunAsync(
            [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function,  "post", Route = "order/start/{sessionId}")] HttpRequestMessage req,
            Guid sessionId,
            [DurableClient] IDurableClient client )
        {
            if (sessionId == Guid.Empty)
            {
                return (ActionResult) new BadRequestObjectResult("SessionId is required");
            }
            var started = await client.StartNewAsync(nameof(NewOrderOrchestrator), new StartOrderContext
            {
                CorrelationId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
                ShoppingCartId = sessionId.ToString(),
                UserId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString() // this should be in the body of the post request, we will skipp it
            });
            return new AcceptedResult(started, started);
        }
</pre>


<p>The keen-eyed will notice the “StartOrderContext” object that we use to start the orchestrator, having these types of DTOs or wrapper might be a good idea if you are working with more complex flows. Here is the class definition.</p>


<pre title="">    public class StartOrderContext
    {
        public string CorrelationId { get; set; }
        public string ShoppingCartId { get; set; }
        public string UserId { get; set; }
    }
</pre>


<p>Now that we have this, we should start working on the Orchestrator itself.&nbsp;</p>


<pre title="">     public class NewOrderOrchestrator
    {
        [FunctionName(nameof(NewOrderOrchestrator))]
        public async Task Run(
            [OrchestrationTrigger] IDurableOrchestrationContext context,
            ExecutionContext executionContext)
        {
            context.SetCustomStatus(OrderStatus.Starting.ToString());

            var inputData = context.GetInput&lt;StartOrderContext&gt;();
            inputData.UserId = context.NewGuid().ToString();
            // step one, get the cart

            context.SetCustomStatus(OrderStatus.GettingProducts.ToString());

            var cartItems = await context.CallActivityWithRetryAsync&lt;List&lt;CartItem&gt;&gt;(nameof(GetShoppingCartActivity),
                new RetryOptions(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5), 3),
                Guid.Parse(inputData.ShoppingCartId));

            context.SetCustomStatus(OrderStatus.GettingAddress.ToString());

            var userData = await context.CallActivityWithRetryAsync&lt;UserData&gt;(nameof(GetUserDetailsActivity),
                new RetryOptions(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5), 3),
                Guid.Parse(inputData.UserId));

            context.SetCustomStatus(OrderStatus.ReservingProducts.ToString());

            var wareHouseStocksAvailableAndReserved = await context.CallActivityWithRetryAsync&lt;CheckAndReserveItemsActivity.ReservationResult&gt;(nameof(CheckAndReserveItemsActivity),
                new RetryOptions(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5), 3),
                cartItems);

            context.SetCustomStatus(OrderStatus.CalculatingShipping.ToString());

            var calculateShippingCost = await context.CallActivityWithRetryAsync&lt;CalculateShippingCostActivity.ShippingCost&gt;(nameof(CalculateShippingCostActivity),
                new RetryOptions(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5), 3),
                new CalculateShippingCostActivity.ActivityTrigger{
                    ReservationResult = wareHouseStocksAvailableAndReserved,
                    UserData = userData
                });

            context.SetCustomStatus(OrderStatus.CalculatingFinalPrice.ToString());

            var finalCost = await context.CallActivityWithRetryAsync&lt;CalculateFinalCostActivity.FinalCost&gt;(nameof(CalculateFinalCostActivity),
                new RetryOptions(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5), 3),
                new CalculateFinalCostActivity.ActivityTrigger{
                    ReservationResult = wareHouseStocksAvailableAndReserved,
                    ShippingCost = calculateShippingCost
                });

            context.SetCustomStatus(OrderStatus.AwaitingPayment.ToString());

            // here is a more interesting part
            // let's say we are using an external payment provider that gives uses a webhook

            var paymentSuccess = await context.CallSubOrchestratorAsync&lt;bool&gt;(nameof(PaymentOrchestrator), finalCost);

            if (paymentSuccess)
            {
                context.SetCustomStatus(OrderStatus.PaymentSuccess.ToString());
                context.SetCustomStatus(OrderStatus.SendShippingOrder.ToString());
                // we would have another one here ... but it the same as the the other interaction calls so we skip it 🙂

            }
            else
            {
                context.SetCustomStatus(OrderStatus.PaymentFailed.ToString());
                // Maybe cancel the product reservation ....

                // do whatever is required in this case ...
            }


            // finish the code
            context.SetCustomStatus(OrderStatus.Completed.ToString());

        }
    
</pre>


<p>So, let’s start to break down the orchestrator here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First things first, <strong>as a general rule of thumb, you should aim to have as little logic in the orchestrator</strong> itself, anytime you need to have anything more than a simple bolean comparison, try to use an activity.</p>



<p>Looking a the code of the orchestrator you might see that we are using the custom status functionality. I think this is one of the most awesome things, and it is really under utilized. </p>



<p>In order to do things the dotnet way, we created an enum with all possible states of the orchestrator, this is used only for observability, and has no impact whatsoever on the function framework, from azure point of view, this is a string.</p>


<pre title="">    public enum OrderStatus
    {
        Starting,
        GettingProducts,
        GettingAddress,
        ReservingProducts,
        CalculatingShipping,
        CalculatingFinalPrice,
        AwaitingPayment,
        SendShippingOrder,
        Completed
    }
</pre>


<p>So, apart from the custom status, most of the orchestrator is made up from a series of activities and custom status updates.</p>



<h2>Activity close-up</h2>



<p>The first things we need to do is to get the contents of the cart. For doing this we will have a dedicated Activity “GetShoppingCartActivity” that looks like this:</p>


<pre title="">    public class GetShoppingCartActivity
    {
        private readonly IShoppingCartClient _client;
        public GetShoppingCartActivity(IShoppingCartClient client)
        {
            _client = client;
        }
        [FunctionName(nameof(GetShoppingCartActivity))]
        public async Task&lt;List&lt;CartItem&gt;&gt; Run(
            [ActivityTrigger] Guid id)
        {
            try
            {
               return await this._client.GetCartItems(id);
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(e);
                throw;
            }
        }
    }
</pre>


<p>Now, looking at this, it seems rather simple, and the reason behind is the usage of the “client” of the Shopping Cart service. </p>



<p>In order to achieve this, we used the HTTP client factory and the DI to create a typed client for the other microservice. In this case this might be a bit overkill, but if there would be multiple interactions between the services, I highly recommend this approach. </p>



<p>So in order to achieve this, we have the following interface defined:</p>


<pre title="">    public interface IShoppingCartClient
    {
        Task&lt;List&lt;CartItem&gt;&gt; GetCartItems(Guid id);
    }
</pre>


<p>And here is the implementation:</p>


<pre title="">    public class ShoppingCartClient : IShoppingCartClient
    {
        private readonly HttpClient _client;
        private readonly AppConfig _config;
        public ShoppingCartClient(HttpClient client, AppConfig config)
        {
            _client = client;
            _config = config;
        }
        public async Task&lt;List&lt;CartItem&gt;&gt; GetCartItems(Guid id)
        {
            var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, $"{id}");
         …</pre></div></article></div>

							                                                        <div itemprop="articleBody">
		                        <p>The German subsidiary of H&amp;M has received a €35,258,707.95 (about £31.9 million) fine from the Hamburg Data Protection Authority for violating the <a href="https://www.grcilaw.com/topic/gdpr">GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)</a>.</p>
<p>The infringement relates to a 2019 data breach that revealed that H&amp;M was gathering excessive personal data on its employees.</p>
<p>The fashion retailer had been collecting and storing information about its employees’ private lives, including their holiday experiences, family issues, religious beliefs and symptoms of illness and diagnoses.</p>
<p>The information was collected during one-to-one conversations between employees and their supervisors as part of a “welcome back talk” when employees took time off work.</p>
<p>Some of the data was accessible by up to 50 other managers.</p>
<p>It’s the largest ever fine under the GDPR for a violation concerning data use – and given the sensitive nature of the data and how irrelevant it seems to be, it’s not a surprise.</p>
<p>After evaluating 60 GB of H&amp;M data and reviewing witness evidence and the organisation’s internal procedures, the Hamburg Data Protection Authority ruled that</p>
<p>the combination of collecting details about their private lives and the recording of their activities led to a particularly intensive encroachment on employees’ civil rights.</p>
<p>H&amp;M has since apologised to its employees, and confirmed that everyone who had been working at the company since the GDPR took effect on 25 May 2018 would receive financial compensation.</p>
<p>However, this will probably be of little comfort for employees, particularly when you factor the long-term repercussions for its employer, as it now has to pay compensation and a regulatory penalty in the middle of the ongoing financial effects of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Indeed, news of the fine coincided with <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54369802">H&amp;M announcing plans to close 250 stores globally</a> next year. The organisation said that the closures have been driven by customers’ preference for shopping online.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>Consider two graduating PhDs who are transitioning into industry. Both are incredibly busy finishing their research, writing their dissertation, and teaching. Both spend the same amount of time recruiting for industry roles - and both join the same company in a similar role. PhD #1, let’s call her Jane,  soon discovers she is being paid less than her peers for the same work and has a boss that won’t promote her. She’s forced to work doubly hard just to achieve parity with her co-workers, or else leave and start over somewhere new, wasting a year. PhD #2, let’s call her Joanne, in contrast, is happy with her job. She is paid similarly to her peers and has a clear path for growth at the company. What did Joanne do better?</p><p>We have now advised 71 PhDs to follow this second, better track and we understand what defines these trajectories. We hope this salary negotiation report educates similar individuals how to negotiate salary. The difference between these two individuals is not merit, nor is it about who interviewed better or does better work. The difference is in how they think and negotiate. Joanne understands that she is joining a business. Compensation and promotions are respectfully taken by her self-advocacy, not given by the company. Jane assumes that the company will take care of her once she proves herself and so does not ask for much at the beginning. Joanne sets expectations and gives feedback to her manager for a productive working relationship. This is a <em>virtuous</em> cycle: you ask and your manager sets the higher expectations that enable you to work upwards. Jane is reticent and does not want to damage relationships. This is a <em>vicious</em> cycle: you don’t ask and your manager doesn’t expect more, so you stagnate and it becomes even harder to advance. </p><p>This power of setting expectations is evident at the very beginning of your relationship with your employer, in the offer negotiation. You haven’t started work yet, but simply setting higher expectations from the outset enables you to get paid more and begins the positive, virtuous cycle. Here we quantify the impact of negotiating using Ralph by looking at the data from our first 71 PhD clients. Most of them came from computation-heavy PhDs and were transitioning into their first industry role in engineering or data science, or a research role in technology or quantitative finance. Our results reveal just how beneficial it can be to advocate for yourself, and how beneficial a Career Agent can be to advise you through this process of multiple offers and changes. Because while most people know they <em>should</em> negotiate, they don’t know how <em>far</em> to negotiate. Our data gives you insight into just how much you’re worth and how much room there is for offer changes. </p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_VkwwMuKsXVDkwaYZ/assets/KnTGkpeVnsGRSckK.jpg" alt="Tables.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_VkwwMuKsXVDkwaYZ/assets/uOGQqqzabfskEZzm.jpg" alt="Visualizations.jpg"></p><p><strong>High Level Results</strong></p><p>On average, our clients have increased their initial offer by 30% through negotiation using our insight and advising. This increase is calculated from changes in base salary, equity, and any annual, signing, or relocation bonus changes. This increase represents an average $75K more in the offer. As expected, having offers from multiple companies resulted in a larger increase from the baseline offer; however, even if clients only had an offer from a single company, they were still able to secure an average 20% increase from their initial offer. Having four offers resulted in a dramatic increase (56%) in the negotiated accepted offer.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Negotiating You Are Likely Not Doing</strong></p><p>The majority of our clients (52%) changed their offer twice. This means they negotiated an increase once and then negotiated <strong>another</strong> increase. Usually this second change would occur after the company said no to any further changes. We were able to advise our clients to keep advocating for themselves and set initial expectations high, resulting in an average total increase of 39%.  When the offer changed once, it increased on average 18%. While the majority of this data comes from before COVID-19, we have advised 9 clients during COVID-19 with similar results. Our largest negotiated offer ever was achieved in March 2020 (<a href="https://www.withralph.com/blog/negotiated-a-143-offer-increase">the story here</a>). Our data from working with 70+ clients is clear: you can negotiate significant (and often multiple) increases in your offer if you know your true, competitive worth.&nbsp;</p><p>These results we hope debunk three common misconceptions that hinder a candidates' ability to negotiate a strong starting offer and set the stage for your upward growth.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Misconception #1: Companies pay equally for the same role, level, and location in a new grad offer.</strong></p><p>We have seen two candidates with the same role, level, company, and location have a $35,000 base salary difference. We have seen equity range by more than $900,000 in a 4-year package in public company offers. We have data for new grad Google offers that start as low as ~$180K/year and end as high as ~$550K/year.</p><p>Even independent of a company's intent, if you don't negotiate you will be paid unequally because the highest paid individuals are always negotiating. The squeaky wheel gets the oil. </p><p><strong>Misconception #2: Interviewing with one company at a time is ok.</strong></p><p>The factor that affects your compensation the most is having multiple offers at the same time. Companies are a business. They will pay what they have to, not what they can. Our data shows having two offers increases your compensation by 5% and 4 offers increases your compensation by 56%.&nbsp;Companies interview candidates they have no intention of hiring just to see the market. So should you.</p><p><strong>Misconception #3: The company increased my offer so I’ve successfully negotiated.</strong></p><p>The majority of companies start with a low offer that leaves room for the candidate to negotiate. You should define successfully negotiating as getting a change <strong>after</strong> the company has said no. This is when the negotiation has actually begun. Otherwise, you have just asked and they conceded. There has been no negotiation. Our data shows that it is rare for an offer <strong>not</strong> to change after it is initially given: 90% of offers change from the initial offer after negotiating.</p><p>Almost all of the negotiation challenges PhDs face come from a lack of information and experience in industry. They don’t know what to expect, don’t have time to research, and assume whatever the company says is correct. As our data shows, there is room for negotiating multiple times to achieve a 30% or greater increase in your initial offer. We hope that by sharing our findings, we can help you educate and advocate for yourself and feel more confident to set high expectations even before you begin working at your company. Ask yourself the question: <strong>how do I know I am getting the best offer possible?</strong> You might be surprised to know that you are likely worth a lot more than the initial offer you receive. </p><p>--</p><p>To read more content: <a href="https://www.withralph.com/blog/where-to-start">start here</a></p><p><a href="https://www.withralph.com/blog/where-to-start"></a>To get updated with insights and learnings: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ralph-inc">Follow us on LinkedIn</a></p><p>Questions?

  <p>I started playing chess when I was 6, and played seriously until the age of 18. My career highlights include 30th in the European U18s, captaining/vice-captaining England at most age groups, playing for Oxford in 3 Varsity matches and achieving rankings of 195 ECF and 2200 FIDE.

  <div><p>A lot of people write about chess as having an opening game, a middle game and an endgame. When you're playing is that what's going through your head?</p></div>

  <div><p>Everyone has an opening repertoire. Many people just have one answer for each question they might reasonably expect their opponents to ask, which means they get very good at playing those answers, but equally become very predictable. There are some openings that are razor sharp and precise, and require knowing many 15-20 move variations in order to not get destroyed without the game even starting. I personally prefer openings that are more conceptual, which tend to be slightly more flexible, require much less knowledge, but arguably lead to somewhat more boring positions because of this.</p></div><div><p>So when the middlegame comes around, it's probably the kind of position I've played many times before. My strategy is usually to throw lots of pieces at their king and hope they die or I can win some material. Since I'm hoping to win at this point, I probably don't start thinking explicitly about the endgame until little suggestions of things that might become relevant start cropping up. So if pawns become isolated or doubled, or we end up with opposite colored bishops, or with a bishop on the same color square as most of our pawns, etc. If I can take one of these small positional advantages then I will, and then effectively "bank" it until the endgame actually comes around. Having one or more of these might make me more likely to head towards an endgame too.</p></div><div><p>Endgames are really hard and require a lot of technique that I don't really have. Fortunately most other people don't either, because you just don't get to play that many of them.</p></div><div><p>It probably is fair to say that I'm pretty aware of the opening/middlegame/endgame distinction. The opening is where I'm playing pretty much from memory, the middlegame is where I try and win, and the endgame is what I might head towards if I think I have a tangible advantage but try and avoid otherwise.</p></div>

            <div><div>
  <div><p>So when you say that the endgame is what you might head towards - is the endgame not just the 'end of the game'? In which case won't most games have one? I know in the extremely amateur world of chess that I play in that most games come to a end where one side is actively checkmated. Is the endgame more unusual the higher up you go because a party will often resign when one side is in a dominant position?</p></div>

            <div><div>
  <div><p>I guess this is a question for statistics to answer properly, but my gut says that there possibly are fewer endgames in higher level play. If you lose a bishop or a knight without any obvious compensation, you will almost definitely resign on the spot. That said, it's probably also true that fewer boneheaded mistakes mean that neither side may have had much of a chance to win before the endgame. Overall I'm not sure!</p></div><div><p>But when I say "might head towards the endgame", I mean that I might deliberately choose to swap off pieces and accelerate progress towards the end of the game. If I'm a pawn up then trading off pieces is likely a huge win for me, because whilst a queen + 2 rooks + 1 bishop + 2 knights + 7 pawns v the same but 6 pawns is not a huge advantage, a bishop + 5 pawns v a bishop + 4 pawns probably is. Small material advantages are a much bigger deal in the endgame and leave less room for your opponent to generate compensation, so if you are slightly ahead then deliberately swapping off pieces is very important. Games can naturally meander towards an endgame where neither side is too psyched about their chances, or they can be forced.</p></div>

  <div><p>OK - that makes a lot of sense. You mentioned that you like to keep your openings of a 'conceptual' nature. What kind of concepts are you basing your openings on?</p></div>

  <div><p>Honestly I like openings that allow you to put your pieces on nice squares without thinking too hard, and then throw them all at your opponent's king. This is not a very sophisticated strategy, but it can be very hard to deal with if you aren't prepared (this is a good example). If you can get off the beaten track without doing anything too insane then you become much more familiar with the kinds of positions that result than your opponents, and develop a big box of patterns that have worked in the past.</p></div><div><p>This becomes somewhat less effective the higher level and more famous you get, as you start to become notorious for particular openings, and opponents can start preparing counters to them. This is where a degree of flexibility and unpredictability becomes invaluable, so that your opponents can't just put all their time into preparing for your Stonewall Dutch or Trompowsky, and also have to keep in mind that you might throw in a Benko Gambit or English Opening. It can be worthwhile playing these alternatives in high profile tournaments that will get their games into databases that your future opponents will see and get confused and upset by.</p></div>

  <div><p>1) Knights on the edge of the board don't attack many squares, knights in the centre of the board do. Because of their uniquely short range, they are the one piece that really benefits from being in the centre. A rook or bishop in the corner can still rake across the entire board, but a knight in the same spot looks pretty dumb.</p></div><div><p>2) If you want to attack the king (I do), you need to have your pieces attacking him and the squares around him! Even if you aren't planning on immediately checkmating anytime soon, you may be able to use threats against him to force smaller concessions or weaknesses.</p></div><div><p>3) An open file is one that isn't blocked by any of your pawns or pieces, and so if you put a rook at one end of it you'll be probing into some part of their position (hopefully a weak part!). This is the most direct way for your rooks to influence the game. As mentioned above, you don't necessarily need to be destroying or capturing anything in order for your pieces to be making your opponents' life awkward, so principles like "rooks on open files" will almost always be good things to at least look out for.</p></div>

  <div><p>Right.

  <div>
    
      
    
     <p><span size="1">(2 October 2020)</span></p><p>Thank you for your reports of Google warning about some pages on https://root.cern. Let me give you some background:</p>

<p>We have investigated virus scanner reports on some of ROOT’s binaries. The ROOT team has invested about 2.5 work days into this investigation: we took this seriously. On top of that, CERN IT’s security team has investigated this independently, and also invested a notable amount of working hours. We were able to create binaries that were diagnosed as infected, by building <code>hadd.exe</code> “from scratch”. We are convinced that these reports are false positives. We found out that upgrading the compiler works around the issue.</p>

<p>We could report this as false positive to the vendors whose virus scanner was reporting some of ROOT’s binaries. This has a high latency, especially when adding the latency between the virus scanner engines tweaking their patterns and Google removing root.cern from the list of flagged sites.</p>

<p>We could argue with Google. This does not seem like a fast track option either.</p>

<p>Instead, we have removed the file in question. We are upgrading the compiler on our build machines, which means that we cannot create Windows binaries for new patch releases of ROOT 6.20 and before: only newer ROOT versions can be built with the newest Visual Studio version.</p>

<p>Given the removal of the file reported by Google, we have asked Google for a review of root.cern. As <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9044101#harmful_downloads">Google puts it</a>, “A review can take from a few days to a few weeks to complete.”</p>

<p>If you have ideas how to further improve the situation, please let us know by adding a comment below.</p>

<p>Please rest assured that we build our binaries on always up-to-date Windows installations running updated virus scanners, and that we do whatever we can to keep our binaries clean. This is the second time in 20+ years that ROOT files have been misdiagnosed as infected. To address this, we will scan binaries proactively on <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/">VirusTotal</a> from here on, before offering them for download, to avoid false positives affecting us again.</p>

<p>Axel, for the ROOT team.</p>

This problem requires to put a thousand separator in its right position of the number. The question is how you can iterate on such a number to write a dot (.) in every possible position.</p><p id="049d">You’re given an integer and the output should be a string with the thousand separators. Dealing with strings can be cumbersome and a problem like this can take multiple lines of code while you can do it literally in one-liner code if you really compacted the variables. While regular expression (shortened regex) can be seen complicated, this is due to the unclear readability of it, I will try to explain solving this problem in a more readable approach and a more expressing way to be able to understand and solve such problem in just one line of code and if you need to get deeper, I’ve put some references at the bottom.</p><p id="685e">Regular expression is dealing with patterns so that you can manipulate strings. In this problem, it seems we want to find a pattern that exists across the string with multiple positions and then put dots in every possible position.</p><p id="ed4d">To know how it works, we need to know two things:</p><ul><li id="3e2f"><em>pattern </em>— the pattern we want to match</li><li id="87b7"><em>repl — </em>what should be replaced with</li></ul><h2 id="dbc9">Example 1</h2><p id="2f28">Say we have this simple example 1234. The separator here should exist between 1 and 2 like this 1.234</p><p id="92fb">Using regex can make us search for a pattern and when we match this pattern correctly we can use it to substitute/replace the number(s) we captured. Grouping is a basic concept of regex, you can use parenthesis to group specific characters.</p><p id="9450">The pattern here can be <strong>one digit followed by 3 digits</strong>. This can be converted to a regular expression pattern like this <code>(\d)(?=(\d{3}))</code></p><pre><span id="f806"><strong>(\d) </strong>one digit…</span><span id="d2b4"><strong>(?= </strong>followed by…</span><span id="909a"><strong>   (\d{3}) </strong>3 digits</span><span id="737e"><strong>)</strong></span></pre><p id="9312">The pattern here should match 1 in <strong>1</strong>234</p><p id="1f88">So now we have the pattern, what else should we do with that?</p><p id="244b">It seems we have captured two groups here, one digit and 3 digits .. we’re just interested in the first group so we should replace that digit (<strong>1 </strong>here) with itself followed by a dot so that we can see <strong>1.</strong>234. That’s why <em>repl </em>here equals <strong>\1. </strong>or <strong>\$1. </strong>depending on the language you use</p><p id="3abe">Let’s say we want the separator here to be a comma, not a dot, <em>repl </em>here should equal <strong>\1, </strong>and <strong>\$1,</strong></p><h2 id="3cb1">Example 2</h2><p id="338b">Let’s see a more complicated example: 123456789 so the expected output should be 123.456.789</p><p id="fe22">The pattern here is different from the previous example because if it’s the same, the grouping will be to these bold numbers <strong>123456</strong>789 because in each number is followed by 3 digits until you reach 789 (the last 3 digits). So how can we approach this solution to only group the numbers that we should replace each and add dots?</p><p id="ae4b">Here we should group the 3 digits in a right way; we want to <strong>capture one digit which is followed by one or more groups of 3 digits which are not followed by any more digits</strong>. Let’s convert that into a regular expression pattern: <code>(\d)(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))</code></p><pre><span id="fc30"><strong>(\d) </strong>capture one digit…</span><span id="d2e6"><strong>(?= </strong>which is followed by…</span><span id="1252"><strong>   (\d{3})+ </strong>one or more groups of 3 digits…</span><span id="3675"><strong>   (?!\d) </strong>which are not followed by any more digits</span><span id="99dc"><strong>)</strong></span></pre><p id="e594">With this pattern, the numbers highlighted will be matched 12<strong>3</strong>45<strong>6</strong>789. There you should replace both by each one plus a dot like this: 12<strong>3.</strong>45<strong>6.</strong>789</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

After a long day of meeting with engineers and product managers, I made it to the final boss, the VP of Engineering. He introduced himself, put his hands together at the fingertips, and said, "Tell me your top accomplishments for the last three and six months."</p><p>I froze up. It had been a very busy year. I’d worked on a wide variety of things. I stalled. "Hmm... Let me think about that." He quickly cut me off. “No. That's not a good answer. You should be able to answer that without hesitation. Communicating the value you bring to the organization is an important part of being a leader. My advice for you is to set a calendar reminder. Every three months write down the top achievements for your team and your personal ones."</p><p>I was not offered that job. But I appreciated the great advice! After the interview, I set a calendar reminder, and every quarter since that day I have written down my top accomplishments. It's a very helpful habit for reasons I describe below. Many things that help me succeed in my role as an engineering leader are simple habits, like that one. I developed a set of daily, weekly, quarterly and annual routines that I'll share in this post. Many were tips given to me by coworkers, some I read about in blogs and books.</p><p>These habits are all personal actions I would practice regardless of the type of project or team I’m working with. This is definitely not a comprehensive list of everything managers need to do to be effective. They’re just a few things I find helpful. Here are my habits:</p><p><strong>Identify Your Top Six Priorities</strong></p><p>I use a to-do list in<a href="https://evernote.com/"> <span>Evernote</span></a> to record all my pending tasks. During the day I’ll agree to do some work and add a task to the bottom of my to-do list. The list gets long during busy periods, so I prioritize it daily using the<a href="https://jamesclear.com/ivy-lee"> <span>Ivy Lee Method</span></a>. Productivity consultant Ivy Lee recommended this method to Charles Schwab in 1918 as a way to help his company’s executives be more efficient. It’s very simple. At the end of work each day you rank your top six priorities in order of importance. When you start the next day, work on the tasks in priority order. That’s it! I typically set out to tackle three-to-six tasks per day, so the Ivy Lee number seems appropriate.</p><p><strong>Write and Share Daily Intentions</strong></p><p>Most software engineering teams start each day with a “standup” meeting where each member summarizes what they plan to focus on that day. The team I currently work on is distributed across US and EU time zones, so we do this asynchronously by writing that info into a Slack channel used for daily standup posts. I find it helpful to record my daily intentions as it motivates me to complete what I publicly said I’d do. Having those entries written down also helps me remember what I accomplished when I write my weekly status update.</p><p><strong>Keep an Emotional Journal</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic started I’ve been trying to keep closer tabs on my emotions. After experiencing strong feelings like stress, irritation, fear, anger, or excitement, I jot down a brief note about the emotion and situation in a notebook I keep on my desk. Recognizing and naming your feelings is an important part of building emotional intelligence. My daily entries are useful to reflect on when I write my weekly impact journal entry. They often describe the emotional roller coaster I experience while encountering setbacks, pitfalls, and small wins.</p><p><strong>Update My Calendar</strong></p><p>It’s important to start your week with a good plan. As a manager in a medium-sized company, I usually have 2 to 4 hours of meetings per day. Many of those are recurring like 1-on-1’s and weekly staff meetings. Others are ad-hoc project meetings that I need to prepare for in advance. I take a few minutes each Monday morning to look at the week ahead, canceling or declining meetings I don’t need to attend, and adding blocks of personal time for accomplishing the tasks on my “top six priorities” list. This helps me spend my time intentionally.</p><p><strong>Exercise</strong></p><p>Exercise is an important tool I use to manage stress. I’ve been going to the gym twice a week for years and doing the same simple workout. It’s such a regular habit that, after years of repetition, it requires no will power or deliberate effort on my part. It has been tricky adapting my exercise habits during the pandemic, but I’ve made do with jogging, YouTube yoga, and buying a bench and a few free weights for my basement. Whatever routine I follow must be so easy that I have no excuse not to do it. I also listen to things I enjoy while exercising like music, podcasts, and audiobooks as a rewarding motivator.</p><p><strong>Review Indicator Metrics</strong></p><p>In the seminal management book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884"><span>High Output Management</span></a>”, Andy Grove recommends establishing indicators to help you understand how you’re progressing towards your goals. Pursuing metrics blindly can cause unintended problems, so Grove recommends using “paired metrics” that show both the positive effects of your teams’ focus as well as the negative consequences. An example is pairing Jira velocity (quantity) with the bug rate (quality). I’ve managed infrastructure owning teams over the last few years, so I’ve tracked metrics like:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>new platform adoption %</p></li><li><p>weekly production incidents</p></li><li><p>off-hours paged while on-call</p></li><li><p>security tasks open past due date</p></li></ul><p>Every Friday morning I add a new column in my “indicator metrics” spreadsheet then record 10 metrics for the week. This process helps me model how work flows through the system, and allows me to see if the team made progress or was interrupted by reactive tasks. It also produces data I use to create charts showing trends like the percentage of customers migrated to the new platform over the last six months.</p><p><strong>Write in an Impact Journal</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>During an all-hands meeting, a VP at my company mentioned they keep a work journal where they wrote down the impact they made each week and how they felt about it. I started doing this and found it’s a very useful way to reflect. After starting his habit, you can scan the weekly wins you recorded every three months to remember the highlights from the quarter. Writing down your impact is doubly useful because you can immediately copy-paste it into your weekly status report. I’ve also found it interesting to read through my emotions from the last three and six months. When I read about my greatest worries and fears months after a stressful situation has been resolved, it reminds me of the powerful emotions we experience during challenges, and that every crisis is eventually resolved one way or another.</p><p><strong>Share a Weekly Update</strong></p><p>Information flow within your organization is critical and it helps to have a planned, consistent approach. This often looks like a weekly email, shared doc, or internal blog post shared with your manager and ideally with your stakeholders. There’s great advice on how to do these including<a href="https://twitter.com/lara_hogan"> <span>Laura Hogan</span></a>'s “<a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/week-in-review/"><span>Week in Review Leadership Comms</span></a>” and my colleague<a href="https://twitter.com/JadeRubick"> <span>Jade Rubick</span></a>’s “<a href="https://www.rubick.com/infobits-for-information-flow/"><span>How to be an information flow superhero</span></a>”. Currently, my process is writing a “reflection” on Friday mornings in<a href="https://www.koan.co/"> <span>Koan</span></a>, an OKR tracking tool. It's visible to leaders in my org and I also share it with the team I manage. The format of the update is: things the team accomplished, things I got done, after-hours on-call support issues, priorities for next week, and concerns I’d like to raise. I write this after reviewing indicator metrics and writing my impact journal entry, so it’s mainly a copy-and-paste exercise. As we’re all remote workers during the pandemic, this habit is even more valuable. Your manager and stakeholders need to know where your team is focused, what’s holding you back, what's finished, and what you’re working on next.</p><p><strong>Record My Quarterly Accomplishments</strong></p><p>Every three months I write down my top achievements under these categories:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Team accomplishments</p></li><li><p>Communications (internal blog posts)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Process work</p></li><li><p>Helping other managers</p></li><li><p>Hiring</p></li></ul><p>I scan through my impact journal entries from the last 12 weeks and copy-paste the most impressive items into the quarterly accomplishment list. When it comes time for my performance review, which happens every six months at my company, I simply combine the lists from the last two quarters then share with my manager. Nice and easy.</p><p>It's great having a record from each quarter going back for years of the things I've helped my team do and other things I've done personally. If anyone asks what I've done over the last year, I know where to look to help jog my memory. Sometimes I go back through the lists during times of doubt and uncertainty to help me remember what is possible. Reflecting on how you overcame past struggles can provide insight into your current challenge.</p><p><strong>Create Personal OKRs</strong></p><p>Each year on January 1st, I open a Google doc and create a list of personal OKRs (objectives and key results) for the year. I usually have three or four top objectives with about five measurable results under each one. After writing my list of new year’s resolutions, I set a biweekly calendar reminder to revisit and update my progress.<a href="https://twitter.com/cwodtke"> <span>Christina Wodtke</span></a>, author of the book<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0996006028/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0996006028&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eleganthack&amp;linkId=S5TUIOCJ66ZD4NMG"> <span>Radical Focus</span></a> on OKRs, has some<a href="http://eleganthack.com/personal-okrs-three-years-later/"> <span>great tips about using personal OKRs here</span></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Personal OKRs help me focus on my health, family, friendships, and things I aspire to do outside my 8-to-5 job. Life is not all about work. It can be easy to continue thinking about work challenges on nights and weekends. This habit helps remind me there are other important things in my life.</p><p>Have you formed a productivity habit you find particularly useful? Is one missing from my list? I’m curious about what works for you. Feel free to share your favorite habit in the comments below. Thanks!</p></div></div></div></div></div>

  <article>
    <p>Recently I read Slava’s post on <a href="https://defmacro.substack.com/p/how-to-get-promoted">How to get promoted</a>.
I have a lot of respect for Slava, but I don’t agree with this post. So I thought I would share how I
think about it.</p>



<p>Slava is right about one important thing, that many people in Silicon Valley misunderstand what it
takes to get promoted. Many people assume that promotions just come naturally to people who deserve
them, and this is incorrect. The mentality here is like</p>

<ol>
  <li>Do good work</li>
  <li>???</li>
  <li>Promotion!</li>
</ol>

<p>To get promoted, you need to figure out Step 2. But how?</p>



<p>I mean this in a linguistic sense! If you think about it as “getting
promoted”, you are using the passive voice. You’re omitting
information. The laws of nature aren’t promoting you. Some specific
person at your company is the most important decisionmaker for your
promotion. To get promoted, you need to understand who that
decisionmaker is, and what sort of performance they want from you to
get a promotion. The mentality here is like</p>

<ol>
  <li>Do good work</li>
  <li>Convince the key decisionmaker that your work deserves a promotion</li>
  <li>Promotion!</li>
</ol>

<p>Who is the key decisionmaker? It depends on what your role is. If
you’re a software engineer, the key decisionmaker is probably just
your manager. Maybe it’s your manager’s manager. If your company is
smaller, maybe it’s just the CEO. But if you’re trying to get
promoted, you need to figure out who this person is, and what they
want.</p>



<p>If you have a good manager, you can simply ask them. Ask your manager
how promotion decisions are made, who the key decisionmakers are, and
more specifically ask them what you need to achieve in order to get
promoted.</p>

<p>If you have an inexperienced manager, maybe they aren’t able to
explain this to you. Or, maybe you just
won’t accept what your manager telling you, that you aren’t ready for a
promotion because you need to do better work.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it sounds like your manager is asking the impossible of
you, in order to get promoted. Sorry! That may or may not be your
manager’s fault, or your fault. I don’t know. At least you’re having
the conversation.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is impossible for you to get promoted on your current
team. You’re a senior engineer, and you want to make staff engineer,
but what you’re working on just isn’t important enough to merit a
promotion. This isn’t necessarily your manager’s fault, although often
a good manager can help you figure out how to navigate this.</p>



<p>So what’s the right strategy for someone who only cares about
promotion? Slava’s thoughts:</p>

<p><em>The winning strategy is to ignore company metrics completely and move
between projects every eighteen months so that nobody notices.</em></p>

<p><em>Wouldn’t people notice anyway? Rank and file employees will, but not
the management. In a fast growing company things change very quickly.</em></p>

<p>To me, this just sounds like a case of bad management. It’s hard to
manage a fast-growing startup, and bad management happens. But you
won’t find bad management everywhere. And often, what seems like bad
management from afar, is actually decent management grappling with a
seemingly impossible problem, once you dig into the details.</p>

<p>Instead, I think the best strategy for someone who only cares about
promotion is to do the unsexy work that management thinks is
important, but is having a hard time recruiting people for. Everybody
wants to work on the VR project. Nobody wants to fix the billing
system. Everybody wants to add a new feature to the consumer
app. Nobody wants to be responsible for fixing the database service that
recently caused a big outage. Work on the important stuff that nobody
wants to do.</p>

<p>People who do this are incredibly valuable to an organization, and
usually end up rewarded. Part of being a good manager is to figure out
who is willing to do the unsexy but critical work, and to reward these
people when they succeed at it.</p>



<p>In summary, my career advice for opportunists is to ask your manager
what it will take to get promoted, and then do it. If that isn’t
working, try working on a project that nobody wants to work on, but
management thinks it’s really important. The rituals and management
fashions, don’t worry about it. Spend your mental energy on getting
stuff done.</p>

		<p>Münster University researchers develop web app for comparing genomes</p>
		<p>Evolution leaves its traces in particular in genomes. Pinpointing its influence is a laborious process – but one in which Dr. Jürgen Schmitz and his team at the University of Münster are at home. Five years ago, the team made public a web app which can compare the genomes of humans and animals and thus help to provide an understanding of evolutionary developments. The Münster researchers are now going one step further: their new software – “2-n-way” – can compare any genomes from and for anyone and systematically search for regions which are characterized by the presence or absence of certain sequences – or, to put it simply, what is missing and where in the genome and when it got lost or when it newly emerged. This makes it possible to recognize relationships among species or individuals. The Münster researchers have now published details of their new development – which, like its predecessor – is freely available on the internet – in the journal <em>Genome Research</em>.</p>

Jürgen Schmitz, a biologist and zoologist at the Institute of Experimental Pathology at Münster University’s Faculty of Medicine, led the study together with Dr. Gennady Churakov and for him it represents a “unique, forward-pointing opportunity to take a close look at the mutability of multiple genomes”. It means that not only genome evolutions can be analysed, but also the occurrence of genetic diseases as a result of deletions or insertions – i.e. the loss of a DNA segment or the insertion of a new one. The decisive difference between the new model and its predecessor, GPAC – which has been used hundreds of thousands of times since it was activated – is that 2-n-way can sequence any number of genomes. “The tool is a response to the modern genomic era – and it is a piece of software which, despite the complexity behind it, can be used by anyone, whether a non-medical layperson, a student or a professor. Last but not least, the tool links up a very wide range of areas, such as evolution, population genetics and medicine” says Schmitz.</p>

<p>The term “2-n-way” is derived from two abbreviations used by specialists: “2-way” stands for the linear alignment of sequences to be compared; and “n-way” means the combination of individual components and the subsequent multiple comparison. But users do not need to know such background information. “They only have to download on the internet the genomes they want to compare. One source, for example, is the website of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) in the USA. The genomes fed into 2-n-way are then aligned with each other by the software. The genes which are of particular interest are selected from the genomic “coordinates” – or “loci”, to give them their proper technical term. “The search can be geared for example to some or all of the so-called jumping genes, i.e. those genes which have changed their position in the genome,” Schmitz explains.</p>

<p>If for example a search is made for certain jumping genes in humans, chimpanzees or rhesus monkeys, the results are given in a table with “plus” and “minus”. If the evaluation contains two finds and an exact gap in the rhesus monkey, then the conclusion is that humans and chimpanzees have inherited the jumping gene from a common ancestor and are therefore closely related – while the rhesus monkey still displays the original locus without any insertion and is therefore only distantly related. However, the software not only indicates whether a certain insertion is present, but also the region in which it is to be found. In addition to the table of correlations, 2-n-way also provides the user with a list of DNA sequences for all loci.</p>

<p>Although the new tool has only just been made public, the team of researchers is already looking ahead – working on the simplification of the individual creation of 2-ways, i.e. the alignment. “This is a process which, at the moment, can take up a lot of time – which is a bit annoying,” says Schmitz. Otherwise, he comments, the tool “has been tested intensively and is absolutely perfect”.</p>

                    <p>One great feature of Go is the built-in http.Server. It allows each app to serve HTTP and HTTPS traffic without having to put a reverse proxy such as Nginx in front of it.</p>
<p>At a glance the API is simple:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c">http.ListenAndServe(<span>":8080"</span>, h)
</code></pre></div><p>where <em>h</em> is http.ServeMux or a third party router such as <a href="https://github.com/go-chi/chi">Chi</a>. But as always, the devil is in the details.
Handling these details will require some boilerplate, so let’s start writing it.</p>
<h3 id="production-ready-configuration-timeouts-tls">Production-ready configuration (timeouts, TLS)</h3>
<p><a href="https://golang.org/src/net/http/server.go?s=97511:97566#L3108">ListenAndServe</a> creates an http.Server and uses it to listen on the given address and serve the given handler:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c">func <span>ListenAndServe</span>(addr string, handler Handler) error {
	server :<span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>Server{Addr: addr, Handler: handler}
	<span>return</span> server.ListenAndServe()
}
</code></pre></div><p>However, the instantiated http.Server is not production ready. It is missing important timeouts which can lead
to resource exhaustion. The TLS configuration is optimized neither for speed nor security. All of this is covered in a famous blog post by Cloudflare titled <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/exposing-go-on-the-internet/">So you want to expose Go on the Internet</a>.</p>
<p>So, how does a well configured server look according to Cloudflare?</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c">func <span>NewServer</span>(addr string, handler http.Handler) <span>*</span>http.Server {
	<span>return</span> <span>&amp;</span>http.Server{
		Addr:    addr,
		Handler: handler,
		<span>// https://blog.cloudflare.com/exposing-go-on-the-internet/
</span><span></span>		ReadTimeout:  <span>5</span> <span>*</span> time.Second,
		WriteTimeout: <span>10</span> <span>*</span> time.Second,
		IdleTimeout:  <span>120</span> <span>*</span> time.Second,
		TLSConfig: <span>&amp;</span>tls.Config{
			NextProtos:       []string{<span>"h2"</span>, <span>"http/1.1"</span>},
			MinVersion:       tls.VersionTLS12,
			CurvePreferences: []tls.CurveID{tls.CurveP256, tls.X25519},
			CipherSuites: []uint16{

			PreferServerCipherSuites: true,

}
</code></pre></div><p>Usage stays similar:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c">server :<span>=</span> NewServer(<span>":8080"</span>, r)
server.ListenAndServe()
</code></pre></div><p>Our next step is to allow the server to (optionally) listen on a systemd socket.</p>
<h3 id="systemd">Systemd</h3>
<p>There are two broad ways in which a Go app is deployed: containerized or native.</p>
<p>A containerized app is put in a container and then deployed to the cloud, which can be anything
from a Kubernetes setup to an IaaS provider like <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> or <a href="https://platform.sh/">Platform.sh</a>.<br>
However, not every deployment needs the complexity that the containerized approach brings.
One can get very far with a single VPS or dedicated server. I am a strong believer in continuing to support
the “$5 Digital Ocean” crowd, especially now that Go has given us extra performance compared to the old PHP days.</p>
<p>A native deployment usually means Linux, which is nowadays powered by <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/systemd-essentials-working-with-services-units-and-the-journal">systemd</a>. Systemd will automatically start our app and bind it to the specified port, restart on failure, and redirect
logs from stderr to syslog or <a href="https://sematext.com/blog/journald-logging-tutorial/">journald</a>. When redeploying our app, during the 1-2s downtime window, systemd will queue up any incoming requests, ensuring zero downtime deploys.</p>
<p>This sounds great, but it requires a bit of adaptation on our side. Aside from having to ship two systemd config files
(a unit file and a socket file), the app also needs to be able to listen on a systemd socket.</p>
<p>Let’s assume that <em>addr</em> defaults to a TCP address such as “:8080”, but can also
be set to a systemd socket name such as “systemd:myapp-http”, preferably through an
environment variable which can be defined in our unit file.</p>
<p>With a little help from <a href="https://github.com/coreos/go-systemd">coreos/go-systemd</a>, a helper is born:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c">func <span>Listen</span>(addr string) (net.Listener, error) {
	var ln net.Listener
	<span>if</span> strings.HasPrefix(addr, <span>"systemd:"</span>) {
		name :<span>=</span> addr[<span>8</span><span>:</span>]
		listeners, _ :<span>=</span> activation.ListenersWithNames()
		listener, ok :<span>=</span> listeners[name]
		<span>if</span> <span>!</span>ok {
			<span>return</span> nil, fmt.Errorf(<span>"listen systemd %s: socket not found"</span>, name)
		}
		ln <span>=</span> listener[<span>0</span>]
	} <span>else</span> {
		var err error
		ln, err <span>=</span> net.Listen(<span>"tcp"</span>, addr)
		<span>if</span> err <span>!=</span> nil {
			<span>return</span> nil, err
		}
	}

	<span>return</span> ln, nil
}
</code></pre></div><p>Usage now looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c">addr :<span>=</span> os.GetEnv(<span>"LISTEN"</span>)
<span>if</span> addr <span>==</span> <span>""</span> {
	addr <span>=</span> <span>":8080"</span>
}
server :<span>=</span> NewServer(addr, r)
ln, err :<span>=</span> Listen(addr)
<span>if</span> err <span>!=</span> nil { 
	<span>// Handle the error.
</span><span></span>}
server.Serve(ln)
</code></pre></div><p>Having to pass <em>addr</em> twice and call <em>Listen()</em> ourselves is a bit tedious.
Let’s define our own Server struct which embeds <em>*http.Server</em>, and move the listener logic there:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c">package httpx

type Server <span>struct</span> {
	<span>*</span>http.Server
}

func NewServer(addr string, handler http.Handler) <span>*</span>Server {}

func (srv <span>*</span>Server) Listen() (net.Listener, error) {
	<span>// Same code as before, but now using srv.Addr
</span><span></span>}

func (srv <span>*</span>Server) ListenAndServe() error {
	ln, err :<span>=</span> srv.Listen()
	<span>if</span> err <span>!=</span> nil {
		<span>return</span> err
	}
	<span>return</span> srv.Serve(ln)
}

func (srv <span>*</span>Server) ListenAndServeTLS(certFile, keyFile string) error {
	ln, err :<span>=</span> srv.Listen()
	<span>if</span> err <span>!=</span> nil {
		<span>return</span> err
	}
	<span>return</span> srv.ServeTLS(ln, certFile, keyFile)
}
</code></pre></div><p>Usage is now simple again:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c">addr :<span>=</span> os.GetEnv(<span>"LISTEN"</span>)
<span>if</span> addr <span>==</span> <span>""</span> {
	addr <span>=</span> <span>":8080"</span>
}
server :<span>=</span> NewServer(addr, r)
server.ListenAndServe()
</code></pre></div><h3 id="tls">TLS</h3>
<p>Don’t we live in an HTTPS world? So far we’ve used <em>ListenAndServe</em> and <em>Serve</em>, not <em>ListenAndServeTLS</em> and <em>ServeTLS</em>.
Can we just add those three missing letters, point to the certificate, modify the port, and call it a day?</p>
<p>Yes, if we’re just serving an API. But if we’re serving HTML, we still need both HTTP and HTTPS, otherwise we won’t be
able to visit our URL via the browser without supplying the HTTPS port. The job of the HTTP server is to redirect
users to the HTTPS resource.</p>
<p>That redirect logic looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c">type httpRedirectHandler <span>struct</span>{}

func (h httpRedirectHandler) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r <span>*</span>http.Request) {
	host, _, err :<span>=</span> net.SplitHostPort(r.Host)
	<span>if</span> err <span>!=</span> nil {
		<span>// No port found.
</span><span></span>		host <span>=</span> r.Host
	}
	r.URL.Host <span>=</span> host
	r.URL.Scheme <span>=</span> <span>"https"</span>

	w.Header().Set(<span>"Connection"</span>, <span>"close"</span>)
	http.Redirect(w, r, r.URL.String(), http.StatusMovedPermanently)
}
</code></pre></div><p>Each <em>Serve</em> call is blocking, so the two servers must run in their own goroutines.
Both goroutines need to complete, and the idiomatic way to do that is using a <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#WaitGroup">WaitGroup</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c">mainServer :<span>=</span> NewServer(<span>":443"</span>, r)
redirectServer :<span>=</span> NewServer(<span>":80"</span>, httpRedirectHandler{})

wg :<span>=</span> sync.WaitGroup{}
wg.Add(<span>2</span>)
go func() {
	mainServer.ListenAndServeTLS(certFile, keyFile)
	wg.Done()
}()
go func() {
	redirectServer.ListenAndServe()
	wg.Done()
}()

wg.Wait()
</code></pre></div><p>There’s only one detail missing now: error handling.
If one of the servers errors out (couldn’t bind to addr or load the certificate)
we want to make sure the other one is immediately stopped, and execution stops.</p>
<p>Ideally we’d get the error from <em>wg.Wait</em>, but it doesn’t support that.
The answer lies in <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/sync/errgroup">x/sync/errgroup</a>, which builds upon WaitGroup and does just that, in only 60 lines of code.</p>
<p>Here’s our code with error handling:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c">mainServer :<span>=</span> NewServer(<span>":443"</span>, r)
redirectServer :<span>=</span> NewServer(<span>":80"</span>, httpRedirectHandler{})

g, ctx :<span>=</span> errgroup.WithContext(context.Background())
g.Go(func() error {
	<span>if</span> err :<span>=</span> mainServer.ListenAndServeTLS(certFile, keyFile); err <span>!=</span> http.ErrServerClosed {
		<span>return</span> err
	}
	<span>return</span> nil
})
g.Go(func() error {
	<span>if</span> err :<span>=</span> redirectServer.ListenAndServe(); err <span>!=</span> http.ErrServerClosed {
		<span>return</span> err
	}
	<span>return</span> nil
})
go func() {
	<span>// The context is closed if both servers finish, or one of them
</span><span></span>	<span>// errors out, in which case we want to close the other and return.
</span><span></span>	<span>&lt;-</span>ctx.Done()
	mainServer.Close()
	redirectServer.Close()
}()

err :<span>=</span> g.Wait() 
</code></pre></div><p>Note how we distinguish a real error from <em>http.ErrServerClosed</em>.
We don’t want to call <em>Close</em> for <em>http.ErrServerClosed</em> because it would interfere with graceful shutdown.</p>
<p>The next tweak is more subjective. I dislike the fact that <em>certFile</em> and <em>keyFile</em> are passed
when starting the server and not when initializing it. I would prefer having one way to start
the server regardless of whether it uses TLS or not.</p>
<p>Let’s add a few more helpers to httpx:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c">func <span>NewServerTLS</span>(addr string, cert tls.Certificate, handler http.Handler) <span>*</span>Server {
	srv :<span>=</span> NewServer(addr, handler)
	srv.TLSConfig.Certificates <span>=</span> []tls.Certificate{cert}

	<span>return</span> srv
}

func (srv <span>*</span>Server) IsTLS() <span>bool</span> {
	<span>return</span> len(srv.TLSConfig.Certificates) <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span> <span>||</span> srv.TLSConfig.GetCertificate <span>!=</span> nil
}

func (srv <span>*</span>Server) Start() error {
	ln, err :<span>=</span> srv.Listen()
	<span>if</span> err <span>!=</span> nil {
		<span>return</span> err
	}
	<span>if</span> srv.IsTLS() {
		ln <span>=</span> tls.NewListener(ln, srv.TLSConfig)
	}
	<span>return</span> srv.Serve(ln)
}
</code></pre></div><p>Our final implementation now looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c">cert, err :<span>=</span> tls.LoadX509KeyPair(certFile, keyFile)
<span>if</span> err <span>!=</span> nil {
	<span>// Log the error and stop here.
</span><span></span>}
mainServer :<span>=</span> NewServerTLS(<span>":443"</span>, cert, r)
redirectServer :<span>=</span> NewServer(<span>":80"</span>, httpRedirectHandler{})

g, ctx :<span>=</span> errgroup.WithContext(context.Background())
g.Go(func() error {
	<span>if</span> err :<span>=</span> mainServer.Start(); err <span>!=</span> http.ErrServerClosed {
		<span>return</span> err
	}
	<span>return</span> nil
})
g.Go(func() error {
	<span>if</span> err :<span>=</span> redirectServer.Start(); err <span>!=</span> http.ErrServerClosed {
		<span>return</span> err
	}
	<span>return</span> nil
})
go func() {
	<span>// The context is closed if both servers finish, or one of them
</span><span></span>	<span>// errors out, in which case we want to close the other and return.
</span><span></span>	<span>&lt;-</span>ctx.Done()
	mainServer.Close()
	redirectServer.Close()
}()

err :<span>=</span> g.Wait() 
</code></pre></div><h3 id="graceful-shutdown">Graceful shutdown</h3>
<p>We have talked about how to start the servers, but not how to shut them down.
When a shutdown signal is received (SIGINT or SIGTERM), we want to shut down the servers in the opposite order from
which we started them, first the redirect server then the main server. This will allow any in progress requests
to complete:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c">redirectTimeout :<span>=</span> <span>1</span> <span>*</span> time.Second
ctx, cancel :<span>=</span> context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), redirectTimeout)
defer cancel()
<span>if</span> err :<span>=</span> redirectServer.Shutdown(ctx); err <span>==</span> context.DeadlineExceeded {
	<span>return</span> fmt.Errorf(<span>"%v timeout exceeded while waiting on HTTP shutdown"</span>, redirectTimeout)
}
mainTimeout :<span>=</span> <span>5</span> <span>*</span> time.Second
ctx, cancel :<span>=</span> context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), mainTimeout)
defer cancel()

This means that it breaks it down into the same starting materials that were used to make the product to begin with," Erika Erickson, a bioengineering researcher at the U.S. Department of Energy's&nbsp;National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NERL), told <em>As It Happens </em>host Carol Off.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"So instead of having an inferior product in the end, you could start with the same starting materials and come back to an equal value plastic water bottle or food package, etc., on&nbsp;the other side, without needing to use petroleum products to get there."</p>  <p>The findings were <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-09/uop-pe092520.php">published this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</a></p>  <h2>Nature finds a way — and scientists speed it up&nbsp;</h2>  <p>The whole thing began when scientists at NERL and Britain's University of Portsmouth discovered a naturally occurring enzyme in a waste recycling centre in Japan that was helping bacteria break down&nbsp;polyethylene terephthalate&nbsp;(PET), a common plastic developed in the '40s that's used to make&nbsp;water bottles, food packaging, film and more.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"There are natural enzymes that have been evolved to break down plastic," Erickson said. "And if you think about that, it's quite extraordinary that an organism has been able to do this in such a short amount of time."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5746626.1601577848!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_300/plastic-eating-enzymes.jpeg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5746626.1601577848!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_460/plastic-eating-enzymes.jpeg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5746626.1601577848!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_620/plastic-eating-enzymes.jpeg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5746626.1601577848!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/plastic-eating-enzymes.jpeg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5746626.1601577848!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/plastic-eating-enzymes.jpeg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5746626.1601577848!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/plastic-eating-enzymes.jpeg"></p></div><figcaption>Researchers from Britain's University of Portsmouth and the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory have combined two plastic-eating enzymes to create what they call a 'super enzyme.'<!-- --> <!-- -->(University of Portsmouth)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>However, the natural process is a slow one.

<strong>Linux Security Hardening and Other Tweaks</strong>
<hr>

<p>
Last updated: 08/18/2020,
by <a href="https://twitter.com/blakkheim">@blakkheim</a>

</p><p>
This page lists the changes I make to a vanilla install of Arch Linux
for security hardening, as well as some other changes I find useful.
While Arch is my target platform, most of the changes will work on
any Linux system that's reasonably up to date.

</p><p>
I typically favor security over performance. You may also see suggestions
merely to make something more useful or shave precious seconds off
a wait time. It's not a one-size-fits-all setup, but hopefully certain
pieces of it will be useful.

</p><p>
Arch is worth considering for a few reasons:

</p><ul>
<li><strong>The install size:</strong> The base install is relatively minimal
    compared to a "prebuilt" distro like Fedora or Mint. This lets me focus
    on adding just what I want, rather than constantly trying to strip out
    things I don't need.
</li><li><strong>The kernel:</strong> A common misconception about the Linux
    kernel is that it's secure, or that one can go a long time without
    worrying about kernel security updates. Neither of these are even
    remotely true. New versions of Linux are released almost every week,
    often containing security fixes buried among the many other changes.
    These releases typically
    <a href="https://youtu.be/5PmHRSeA2c8?t=4075">don't</a> make explicit
    mention of the changes having security implications. As a result, many
    "stable" or "LTS" distributions don't know
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200623161340/https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/06/23/2">which commits</a> should be
    backported to their old kernels, or even that something needs backporting
    at all. If the problem has a public CVE assigned to it, maybe your distro
    will pick it up. Maybe not. Even if a CVE exists, at least in the case
    of Ubuntu and Debian especially, users are often left with kernels full
    of <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/linux">known holes</a>
    for months at a time. Arch doesn't play the backporting game, instead
    opting to provide the newest stable releases shortly after they come out.
</li><li><strong>The <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Build_System">Arch Build System</a></strong>:
    Having enjoyed the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ports_collection">ports</a>
    system of <a href="https://vez.mrsk.me/freebsd-defaults.html">FreeBSD</a>
    and <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> for a long time, the ABS
    has been a pleasure to use. It makes building/rebuilding packages easy.
    It makes updating packages easy. It shows how things are actually built
    and with what options. This BSD-borrowed concept makes interacting with
    the package system simple and intuitive.
</li></ul>

Now on to how I set things up.

<h2 id="disks">Disk Layout</h2>

This section contains a few tips to consider during your initial disk layout
creation. The concepts should apply to any distrbution.

<p>
To start, consider using
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system">full disk encryption</a>
along with a
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/LVM">Logical Volume Manager</a>
setup. Disk encryption protects data at rest, while LVM allows for some
flexibility that can be quite useful. A simple disk layout might look like
this:

</p><ul>
<li><code>/dev/sda1</code> (a small, unencrypted
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/EFI_system_partition">EFI System Partition</a>,
FAT32)
mounted at <code>/efi</code> (assuming this is
a PC with UEFI, otherwise not needed)
</li><li><code>/dev/sda2</code> (a small, unencrypted ext4 partition)
mounted at <code>/boot</code>.
</li><li><code>/dev/sda3</code> (using the rest of the drive space)
as the encrypted
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt">LUKS</a> container
for LVM
</li></ul>

Splitting up the logical volumes for different mount points provides some
benefits, including the ability to set mount flags on specific directories.
Consider creating separate logical volumes for <code>/</code>,
<code>/var</code>, and <code>/home</code> in the install. For a typical
desktop, you probably want to give <code>/home</code> most of the disk space.
The other two don't need much unless there's a specific use case in mind.
25GB and 8GB are used in this example. If you need to have a huge database
in <code>/var</code> or something, make adjustments accordingly.

<p>
There are a lot of user-writable directories in Linux, each one providing
an opportunity for attackers to execute their own binaries.
Once the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fstab">fstab</a>
file is created, add the <code>noexec</code> and <code>nodev</code> flags
to <code>/var</code> and <code>/home</code>. Doing so will disallow execution
of binaries on these mount points, as well as prevent interpreting character
or block special devices on them. Two temporary filesystems (<code>/tmp</code>
and <code>/dev/shm</code>) can also be locked down with the same flags by
adding the following:

</p><pre># /etc/fstab
[...]
tmpfs /tmp     tmpfs rw,noexec,nodev,size=1G,mode=1777 0 0
tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs rw,noexec,nodev,size=1G 0 0
</pre>

Adjust the <code>1G</code> size limit value as desired.

<p>
Once booted into the finished installation, it should look something like this:

</p><pre># <strong>lvs</strong>
  LV   VG   Attr       LSize   Pool Origin Data%  Meta%  Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert
  home lvm  -wi-ao---- 189.12g                                                    
  root lvm  -wi-ao----  25.00g                                                    
  var  lvm  -wi-ao----   8.00g                                                    
# <strong>mount | egrep '(lvm|/tmp|shm)' | sort</strong>
/dev/mapper/lvm-home on /home type ext4 (rw,nodev,noexec,relatime)
/dev/mapper/lvm-root on / type ext4 (rw,relatime)
/dev/mapper/lvm-var on /var type ext4 (rw,nodev,noexec,relatime)
tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,nodev,noexec,size=1048576k)
tmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=1048576k)
</pre>

Another user-writable directory to consider is <code>/run</code>, specifically
the <code>/run/user/$UID</code> directories that systemd spawns when someone
logs in, but their transience is
<a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/systemd-devel/2015-February/028429.html">annoying</a>
and <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/436012/">complicated</a>.
I have yet to find the perfect solution there that won't break other things.
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/FUSE">FUSE</a> is another way
for non-root users to create new mount points and execute binaries. If FUSE
functionality isn't needed, the kernel module can be
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_module#Blacklisting">blacklisted</a>.

<hr>

<h2 id="pacman">Pacman</h2>

Package managers usually don't need much additional configuration.
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman">Pacman</a>, the one
Arch uses, is no different. My recommendation for any package manager is
simply to make sure that
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200528161634/https://blog.packagecloud.io/eng/2018/02/21/attacks-against-secure-apt-repositories/">only HTTPS mirrors</a>
are used.

<pre># /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

Server = <strong>https</strong>://example.com/[...]/$repo/os/$arch
</pre>

Check the
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/mirrorlist/all/https/">mirrorlist
generator</a> to see a list of TLS-capable servers near you.

<p>
Using an HTTPS mirror with Pacman is especially important because it
<a href="https://security.archlinux.org/package/pacman">doesn't validate</a>
the package database files and it
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_separation">runs everything as root</a>.
HTTPS doesn't mitigate either of these problems, but it is one line of defense
against a MITM attack. I hope the developers will make fixing these two
security issues a priority for the project soon. Other package managers
have been doing it the right way for a long time.

</p><hr>

<h2 id="kern">Kernel Options</h2>

The
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/linux-hardened/">linux-hardened</a>
kernel package in Arch includes some compile-time security improvements
that can't be set at runtime.
If your distribution doesn't have a package for it, applying the
<a href="https://github.com/anthraxx/linux-hardened/releases">patchset</a>
to upstream sources and building your own kernel is pretty easy. If you go
that route, have a look at the
<a href="https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kconfig-hardened-check">kconfig-hardened-check</a>
script for more compile-time settings to consider.

<p>
The only issue I've found with linux-hardened is that it's often outdated.
Upstream Linux development moves quickly, so out-of-tree patches will always
require extra work to maintain. Why the (relatively small) patches aren't
upstreamed is unknown to me. There are times when linux-hardened is lagging
multiple versions behind the latest kernel, thus missing out on many
important security fixes. In such a situation, the user must choose between
a more secure kernel with known vulnerabilities and a less secure kernel
with fewer known vulnerabilities. Not a great situation.

</p><p>
Runtime configuration of the kernel can be done in a number of ways.
Desired flags may be passed on startup in the form of
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_parameters">kernel parameters</a>,
of which there is an
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt">extensive list</a>.
Parameters are usually passed by the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bootloader#Boot_loader">bootloader</a>, so
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_parameters#Configuration">configuration details</a>
vary depending whether the system uses
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GRUB">GRUB</a>,
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-boot">systemd-boot</a>,
or something else.

</p><p>
The following options, split up into categories, are worth considering for
security improvements:

</p><pre>l1tf=full,force
spec_store_bypass_disable=on
spectre_v2=on
</pre>

These are addtional mitigations for certain CPU security flaws.
While the <code>mitigations=auto</code> option is used by default in upstream
Linux, some of the mitigations it enables have been "toned down" for
performance reasons.
Examples of this include the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreshadow_(security_vulnerability)">L1TF</a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarchitectural_Data_Sampling">Microarchitectural Data Sampling</a>
vulnerabilities, which can't be fully mitigated unless HyperThreading
is disabled.
The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_Store_Bypass">Speculative Store Bypass</a>
vulnerability is only partially mitigated by default, with applications being
allowed to opt-in for protections via prctl or seccomp.
Finally, we enable all mitigations (including those against userspace) for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)">Spectre V2</a>.

<pre>apparmor=1
lsm=lockdown,yama,apparmor
lockdown=<span color="#ff0000"><strong>XXX</strong></span>
</pre>

These enable the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AppArmor">AppArmor</a>, 
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/security/Yama.txt">Yama</a>,
and
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200525014035/https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/55105.html">Lockdown</a>
features, with the lockdown mode left for the reader to choose.
Valid options are <code>integrity</code> and <code>confidentiality</code>,
both described briefly
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Security#Kernel_lockdown_mode">here</a>.
Replace <code><strong><span color="#ff0000">XXX</span></strong></code> with
whichever you see fit, or omit this option entirely if the feature isn't
wanted.

<p>
For what it's worth, running in <code>confidentiality</code> mode on my
desktop hasn't caused any problems. Your mileage and use case may vary.
Lockdown will break suspend-to-disk and any out-of-tree kernel modules
like ZFS, as well as
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dynamic_Kernel_Module_Support">DKMS</a> modules.

</p><pre>init_on_alloc=1
init_on_free=1
page_alloc.shuffle=1
slab_nomerge
vsyscall=none
</pre>

This group will instruct the kernel to fill newly allocated pages and heap
objects with zeroes, fill freed pages and heap objects with zeroes, tell the
page allocator to randomize its free lists, disable merging of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_allocation">slabs</a>
with similar size, and disable
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200526182112/https://lwn.net/Articles/446528/">vsyscalls</a>
due to their history of making exploits easier.
All five options are all set by default when using the linux-hardened kernel.

<pre>slub_debug=F
</pre>

This enables sanity checks in the
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/slub.txt">SLUB allocator</a>.
Two other flags to consider for non-hardened kernels are <code>Z</code>
(redzoning, to detect when a slab is overwritten past its real size) and
<code>P</code> (to enable poisoning on slab cache allocations).

<p>
The full list of kernel parameters to be used must be specified on a single
line, separated by spaces, in the bootloader's config file. An example for
GRUB might look like this:

</p><pre># /etc/default/grub

                        In 1872 a secret book was found in a maya temple, which amongst lots of recipes, contained a manual on how to
                        summon the devil and get a free wish.

                    <p>
                        Nawww I am just joking. We do so by reverse engineering the protocol used by the games to communicate with there
                        game servers. Once we get a basic understanding about whats happening we implement a proof of concept server and
                        connect the game to it. Doing so usually gives us more information about the way the game works, which in turn is
                        incorporated into the server. At some point we implement a proper server based on the information we found and work 
                        on improving the user experience.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      <p><a href="https://bullish.email/"><img src="https://bullish.email/blog/logo.png"></a>
      </p>
      
      <hr>
      <p>
        At the beginning of this year, I launched a stock market newsletter
        called <a href="https://bullish.email/">Bullish</a>. I’ve been building
        this project to be fully autonomous, trying to squeeze as much I can get
        from free tiers available everywhere, keeping costs close to zero,
        trying to build a completely automated micro SaaS product.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bullish is a Ruby app that fetches data from multiple finance API’s and
        synthesizes that into an email template generated twice a day that gets
        triggered to MailerLite for delivery.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are many ways to accomplish this task and the way I initially
        solved it was to re-purpose a Raspberry Pi that was collecting dust to
        run the project and set up CRON jobs to trigger emails and other tasks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although unusual, this configuration worked great, and the workflow was
        seamless; all I had to do was ssh into Pi and pull from master to get
        the latest updates.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time a couple of issues started to bother me. First, using
        Raspberry Pi introduced a single point of failure in the process if
        power was out, for example, or I was away from home, and something went
        wrong, there was no way to fix it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another problem is that I would forget to run bundle to install or
        update gems breaking the CRON jobs more often than not.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the most concerning one was security-related. Bullish stores all of
        its API keys in an env file, and although not in source control, these
        keys had to be available in the Raspberry Pi for the service to run and
        that alone was a big enough reason to look for a better, more scalable
        and FREE solution.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are many ways I could have solved this. The most elegant probably
        being a Lambda function run on a schedule with API keys managed by a
        service like AWS Secrets Manager, which I still might do at some point,
        but this time around, I was looking for a quick win.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve been using Github Actions to run tests on every push to master
        branch, and one day it occurred to me, why not use this to have a
        workflow to trigger emails and other tasks as well?
      </p>

      <p>
        Doing some research, I found that Github Actions supports jobs triggered
        by a scheduled event and has a generous free tier that would work
        perfectly for my use case.
      </p>

      <p>
        Github Actions is still pretty new and has some annoying limitations
        like not sharing common data between jobs, leading to many duplicated
        steps, but it does allow sharing environment variables across jobs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another neat feature is that Github offers managed secrets that get
        injected in the container when the job executes, so no more API keys are
        in the open.
      </p>

      
      <p>
        Overall I am satisfied with this solution, maybe not definitive, but it
        addresses most of my concerns like:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Single point of failure using Raspberry Pi</li>
        <li>Forgetting to update Pi manually with the latest code after a git push</li>
        <li>Secrets exposed in environment variables</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        And as a bonus, you get notified via email if your job ever fails,
        giving free visibility that you would otherwise have to put together
        yourself in services like CRON to figure out if a job ran successfully
        or not.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bullish is an open source project on
        <a href="https://github.com/eduardosasso/bullish">GitHub</a>.
      </p>

      <p>Cheers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Deep Learning waves have lapped at the shores of computational linguistics for several years now, but 2015 seems like the year when the full force of the tsunami hit the major Natural Language Processing (NLP) conferences.” -<a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/COLI_a_00239">Dr. Christopher D. Manning, Dec 2015</a> <sup id="fnref:part1_1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:part1_1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This may sound hyperbolic - to say the established methods of an entire field of research are quickly being superseded by a new discovery, as if hit by a research ‘tsunami’. But, this catastrophic language is appropriate for describing the meteoric rise of Deep Learning over the last several years - a rise characterized by drastic improvements over reigning approaches towards the hardest problems in AI, massive investments from industry giants such as Google, and exponential growth in research publications (and Machine Learning graduate students). Having taken several classes on Machine Learning, and even used it in undergraduate research, I could not help but wonder if this new ‘Deep Learning’ was anything fancy or just a scaled up version of the ‘artificial neural nets’ that were already developed by the late 80s. And let me tell you, the answer is quite a story - the story of not just neural nets, not just of a sequence of research breakthroughs that make Deep Learning somewhat more interesting than ‘big neural nets’  (that I will attempt to explain in a way that just about anyone can understand), but most of all of how several unyielding researchers made it through dark decades of banishment to finally redeem neural nets and achieve the dream of Deep Learning.</p>


<blockquote><p id="sources">
I am certainly not a foremost expert on this topic. In depth technical overviews with long lists of references written by those who actually made the field what it is include Yoshua Bengio's <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/pointeurs/TR1312.pdf">"Learning Deep Architectures for AI"</a>, Jürgen Schmidhuber's <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.7828v4.pdf">"Deep Learning in Neural Networks: An Overview"</a> and LeCun et al.s' <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/NatureDeepReview.pdf">"Deep learning"</a>. In particular, this is mostly a history of research in the US/Canada AI community, and even there will not mention many researchers; a particularly in depth history of the field that covers these omissions is Jürgen Schmidhuber's <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-overview.html">"Deep Learning in Neural Networks: An Overview"</a>. I am also most certainly not a professional writer, and will cop to there being shorter and much less technical overviews written by professional writers such as Paul Voosen's <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-Believers/190147">"The Believers"</a>, John Markoff's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/24/science/scientists-see-advances-in-deep-learning-a-part-of-artificial-intelligence.html">"Scientists See Promise in Deep-Learning Programs"</a> and Gary Marcus's <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/is-deep-learning-a-revolution-in-artificial-intelligence">"Is “Deep Learning” a Revolution in Artificial Intelligence?"</a>. I also will stay away from getting too technical here, but there is a plethora of tutorials on the internet on all the major topics covered in brief by me.
<br>
Any corrections would be appreciated, though I will note some ommisions are intentional since I want to try and keep this 'brief' and a good mix of simple technical explanations and storytelling.

<p>The beginning of a story spanning half a century, about how we learned to make computers learn. In this part, we shall cover the birth of neural nets with the Perceptron in 1958, the AI Winter of the 70s, and neural nets’ return to popularity with backpropagation in 1986.</p>

    <figcaption>Linear regression <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Linear_regression.svg">(Source)</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Let’s start with a brief primer on what Machine Learning is. Take some points on a 2D graph, and draw a line that fits them as well as possible. What you have just done is generalized from a few example of pairs of input values (x) and output values (y) to a general function that can map any input value to an output value. This is known as linear regression, and it is a wonderful little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#cite_note-4">200 year old</a> technique for extrapolating a general function from some set of input-output pairs. And here’s why having such a technique is wonderful: there is an incalculable number of functions that are hard to develop equations for directly, but are easy to collect examples of input and output pairs for in the real world - for instance, the function mapping an input of recorded audio of a spoken word to an output of what that spoken word is.</p>

<p>Linear regression is a bit too wimpy a technique to solve the problem of speech recognition, but what it does is essentially what <strong>supervised Machine Learning</strong> is all about: ‘learning’ a function given a <strong>training set</strong> of <strong>examples</strong>, where each example is a pair of an input and output from the function (we shall touch on the unsupervised flavor in a little while). In particular, machine learning methods should derive a function that can generalize well to inputs not in the training set, since then we can actually apply it to inputs for which we do not have an output. For instance, Google’s current speech recognition technology is powered by Machine Learning with a massive training set, but not nearly as big a training set as all the possible speech inputs you might task your phone with understanding.</p>

<p>This generalization principle is so important that there is almost always a <strong>test set</strong> of data (more examples of inputs and outputs) that is not part of the training set. The separate set can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the machine learning technique by seeing how many of the examples the method correctly computes outputs for given the inputs. The nemesis of generalization is <strong>overfitting</strong> - learning a function that works really well for the training set but badly on the test set. Since machine learning researchers needed means to compare the effectiveness of their methods, over time there appeared standard <strong>datasets</strong> of training and testing sets that could be used to evaluate machine learning algorithms.</p>

<p>Okay okay, enough definitions. Point is - our line drawing exercise is a very simple example of supervised machine learning: the points are the training set (X is input and Y is output), the line is the approximated function, and we can use the line to find Y values for X values that don’t match any of the points we started with. Don’t worry, the rest of this history will not be nearly so dry as all this. Here we go.</p>

<h2 id="the-folly-of-false-promises">The Folly of False Promises</h2>

<p>Why have all this prologue with linear regression, since the topic here is ostensibly neural nets? Well, in fact linear regression bears some resemblance to the first idea conceived specifically as a method to make machines learn: <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1959-09865-001">Frank Rosenblatt’s <strong>Perceptron</strong></a><sup id="fnref:part1_2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:part1_2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<figure>

    <figcaption>A diagram showing how the Perceptron works. <a href="http://cse-wiki.unl.edu/wiki/images/0/0f/Perceptron.jpg">(Source)</a></figcaption>    
</figure>

<p>A psychologist, Rosenblatt conceived of the Percetron as a simplified mathematical model of how the neurons in our brains operate: it takes a set of binary inputs (nearby neurons), multiplies each input by a continuous valued weight (the synapse strength to each nearby neuron), and thresholds the sum of these weighted inputs to output a 1 if the sum is big enough and otherwise a 0 (in the same way neurons either fire or do not). Most of the inputs to a Perceptron are either some data or the output of another Perceptron, but an extra detail is that Perceptrons also have one special ‘bias’ input, which just has a value of 1 and basically ensures that more functions are computable with the same input by being able to offset the summed value. This model of the neuron built on the work of Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts <a href="http://www.minicomplexity.org/pubs/1943-mcculloch-pitts-bmb.pdf">Mcculoch-Pitts</a><sup id="fnref:part1_3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:part1_3">3</a></sup>, who showed that a neuron model that sums binary inputs and outputs a 1 if the sum exceeds a certain threshold value, and otherwise outputs a 0, can model the basic OR/AND/NOT functions. This, in the early days of AI, was a big deal - the predominant thought at the time was that making computers able to perform formal logical reasoning would essentially solve AI.</p>

<figure>

    <figcaption>Another diagram, showing the biological inspiration. The <b>activation function</b> is what people now call the non-linear function applied to the weighted input sum to produce the output of the artificial neuron - in the case of Rosenblatt's Perceptron, the function just a thresholding operation.  <a href="http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-1/">(Source)</a> </figcaption>    
</figure>

<p>However, the Mcculoch-Pitts model lacked a mechanism for learning, which was crucial for it to be usable for AI. This is where the Perceptron excelled - Rosenblatt came up with a way to make such artificial neurons learn, inspired by the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.900930310/abstract">foundational work</a><sup id="fnref:part1_4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:part1_4">4</a></sup> of Donald Hebb. Hebb put forth the unexpected and hugely influential idea that knowledge and learning occurs in the brain primarily through the formation and change of synapses between neurons - concisely stated as Hebb’s Rule:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite a cell B and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A’s efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Perceptron did not follow this idea exactly, but having weights on the inputs allowed for a very simple and intuitive learning scheme: given a <strong>training set</strong> of input-output examples the Perceptron should ‘learn’ a function from, for each example increase the weights if the Perceptron output for that example’s input is too low compared to the example, and otherwise decrease the weights if the output is too high. Stated ever so slightly more formally, the algorithm is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start off with a Perceptron having random weights and a training set</li>
  <li>For the inputs of an example in the …</li></ol></div></div>

<p>In tonight’s tweetstorm, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has just confirmed that the Tri-Motor Tesla Model S Plaid will have the new Structural Battery with the new 4680 form factor cells.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Elon Musk announcing Model S Plaid will have the 4680 cells and the Structural Battery.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is exciting news for the people who are willing to buy the Tesla Model S Plaid with the <a href="#model-s-specs">supercar-like specs</a> for a $139,900 price tag. If Model S Plaid is going to have the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/09/23/model-y-giga-casting-structural-battery-innovations-battery-day-part-1/">structural battery pack</a> it means that it is also going to have the same single-piece front and rear underbody diecasts currently <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/09/11/tesla-fremont-factory-drone-video-shows-the-model-y-gigacast-machines-roadrunner-magic-cube/">seen for the Model Y</a>.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/09/25/tesla-4680-cell-analyzed-sandy-munro/">4680 cells</a> are going to significantly contribute to the less than 2.0 second 0-60 mph time of the Plaid Model S. This is close to the 1.9s time of the Next-gen Tesla Roadster but the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/06/14/spacex-thrusters-could-squeeze-tesla-roadsters-0-60-time-to-just-1-1-sec/">SpaceX thrusters package is going to further reduce Tesla Roadster’s time to 1.1s</a> according to Elon Musk.</p>



<p>Since opening the Model S Plaid pre-orders, it is expected that Tesla is getting a good number of reservations, especially from the car enthusiasts who require extreme performance. </p>



<p>Social media influencer and current Tesla Model S Performance owner Marques Brownlee aka MKBHD just posted to Twitter that he’s resisting the temptation to book a Tri-Motor Model S Plaid, to which Elon Musk replied “It’s next-level.”</p>

<h2>Model S Plaid vs. Model S Performance</h2>



<p>If we look at the Tesla Model S online configurator, we cannot see a visual difference between Model S Long Range, Performance, and Plaid as of now. Although the exterior looks the same, there will be changes to the interior for sure when the car goes into production.</p>



<p>Mainly the center touchscreen is going to be like the popped-out horizontal display like the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-3/">Tesla Model 3</a>.

<p>I learned that the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome#Stockholm_bank_robbery">Stockholm Syndrome</a> came from an incident that happened in 1972 in a bank in Stockholm, Sweden. Four employees of a bank were held hostage by two captors for six days. In the end, after the police caught the captors, none of the hostages were willing to testify against them in court. Rather, they began raising money to aid them with their defense.</p>
<p>When I watched <em>The Social Dilemma</em> recently, I kept thinking about this syndrome. Although it is still widely contested among psychologists and psychiatrists in its medical merit, I kept thinking about the analogy to social media. We have come to love something that has a captor-like spell on us, that we <em>know</em> can be detrimental. What do we do?</p>
<p>For starters, I urge you to watch the documentary. Second, spend some time thinking about what you saw (and maybe write about it?). Finally, <em>do something about it.</em></p>
<p>As a corollary to the second step above, I wanted to write down the top ten takeaways I had from the unnerving documentary followed by sharing my thoughts and short-term best practices on how I have been tackling this problem.</p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/200787-1-1100.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1" alt="The Social Dilemma Review: A Film About How Facebook Will Kill Us All | IndieWire" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>

<h2><strong>Top Ten Takeaways: <em>The Social Dilemma</em>&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<div>
<p><strong>One:</strong> In a 1980 interview for a documentary film, Steve Jobs said that the computer is like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob_GX50Za6c">bicycle for your mind</a>. The same cannot be said about social media. Whereas a bicycle is a passive <em>tool</em> that has the option to be used or not used based on an individual’s choice, social media is not just a passive tool. It is an active tool that <em>expects</em> you to use it, by giving instant gratification and feeding your dopamine levels in return.</p>
<p><strong>Two:</strong> The entire business model of companies like Facebook and Twitter are built on grabbing our attention <em>and</em> changing the way we think and behave. Jeff Orlowski, the director of the documentary, says, “Our social media platforms are powered by a surveillance-based business model designed to mine, manipulate, and extract our human experiences at any cost, causing a breakdown of our information ecosystem and shared sense of truth worldwide.”</p>
<p><strong>Three:</strong> As a result of the algorithms and preferences, our individual social media feeds can become echo chambers – basically reaffirming our worldview over and over, most worryingly perhaps even at the expense of the objective truth. We become more limited in our lens as we start to see only what we <em>want</em> to see.</p>
<p><strong>Four:</strong> Magicians are some of the earliest neuroscientists and psychologists who understood human behavior and exploited it by making us believe things that are not real (personally, I’m obsessed with decoding the magicians’ code). The effects are benign. On the other hand, social media does something similar: it collates fact and fiction by presenting the same information differently. Imagine having a customized Wikipedia page on every topic. What to believe anymore?</p>
<p><strong>Five:</strong> No one feels the existential threat while scrolling down to see one more image or video, but the consequences are seen when, as a society, we are more divided, lonely, and depressed. Left unchecked, the algorithms will feed us more and more divisive content in an effort to gain our attention and increase time on the platform.</p>
<div>
<blockquote><p><em>“In 2014,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/">Pew Research Center</a>&nbsp;found that partisan antipathy and division in America is “deeper and more extensive than at any point in the last two decades”. Over the past six years, social media has only exacerbated these sentiments. In 2019, 77% of Republicans and 72% of Democrats&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/10/10/partisan-antipathy-more-intense-more-personal/">said</a> voters in both parties “not only disagree over plans and policies, but also cannot agree on the basic facts”.”</em></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Six:</strong> We are all worried about a time when artificial intelligence will surpass our human strengths, i.e., achieve general intelligence and consciousness. What we don’t realize is that artificial intelligence has <em>already</em> surpassed our human weaknesses, i.e. our need for social validation, instant gratification, and limited focused attention.</p>

<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="How We Bring Humanity Back to Tech | by Tom Littler | Medium" src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/3848/1*Z5vb1QsPiycUKi5BZ5BRPw.png?resize=986%2C540&amp;ssl=1" width="986" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>

<blockquote><p><em>“Dystopian technology will not strong-arm us. Instead, we’ll unwittingly submit ourselves to a devil’s bargain: freely trade our subconscious preferences for memes, our social cohesion for instant connection, and the truth for what we want to hear.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Seven:</strong> We can try to fight it, but it will always be a losing battle. Why? Because it is our brain vs their algorithms. It is our brain that was developed over millions of years and is still primitive in its needs vs their algorithms that is getting smarter, efficient, and more targeted by the second. We cannot blame ourselves; nor can we expect <em>will-power</em>, which is limited, to help us.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Eight:</strong> It is so hard to accept that technology is evil, <em>because it is not</em>. The degree of benefits we enjoy as a species today is unprecedented. We get access to everything ever known to humankind at the touch of a button (and soon by having a mere <a href="https://www.nanalyze.com/2020/09/kernel-brain-computer-interface/">thought</a>), we get to work with people from all corners of the world and learn from each other, we can get almost anything delivered in a day (or sometimes a few hours), we can travel anywhere we want to… I can keep going. How can this be considered dystopia? It’s not. Except, the same technology has also made us more disconnected, lonely, depressed, and divisive in real life. It is so hard to feel the threat because of the cruel juxtaposition of utopia next to dystopia.</p>
<p><strong>Nine:</strong> Any solution that can tackle this problem needs to be aligned with the financial incentive of a company. At the end of the day, all this technology is powered by shareholders who have vested interests. The first step to tackling this is through regulation. Unlike phone companies that have restrictions on how our data is used (and have had for decades), social media companies have just begun facing the consequences with anti-trust laws. There needs to be more, and fast.</p>
<p><strong>Ten:</strong> The people who created this are not evil. They did so with a good intention, of connecting the world, spreading positivity, and giving voice to everyone. But, we don’t see it anymore because of what happened along the way. Until the business model changes from ground up and the companies start valuing us for more than our attention, we can’t make progress. <em>We</em> created this, and so we <em>can</em> — and have a responsibility to — change it for the sake of our future generation.</p>

</div>
<h2><strong>What can we do?</strong></h2>
<div>
<p>I completely disagree with someone who says <em>we can choose to run away and try to live a completely social media-free life. </em>We cannot. Not if our profession or career goal requires us to disseminate our work to the mass public. If you’re a creator or an artist, of <em>any</em> kind, and you want your work to reach people, you, unfortunately, need to go where people are. And where people are is on social media. Besides, if all the good people quit social media, we are left with those who will only exacerbate the problem of spreading fake news. The solution is to rather use the knowledge we have against the system and build good habits in the short-term while demanding robust action from our leaders for the long-term.</p>
<p>I realize that I have been implementing some best practices to lessen my usage and consumption of content I don’t want since I <a href="https://www.bsoundarya.com/why-deep-work-is-valuable-busy-work-is-not-2/">read</a> <em>Deep Work</em> by Cal Newport in January 2019. I hope these help you as a starting point:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disable notifications from <em>all</em> non-essential apps:</strong> And I mean all. Except for messages from my family on WhatsApp, high-priority emails, reminders, and notifications related to finances, nothing else grabs my attention on my phone. I’ve never looked back. This can be itchy for a few days, as you’ll have the urge to constantly keep checking your phone. Like any good habit, it will be difficult to follow and easy to break. Give it two weeks, and you’ll see the result.</li>
<li><strong>Use plugins to block out irrelevant content:</strong> YouTube is rightly called a rabbit-hole. The algorithms are so good that they begin showing you videos that you never knew you needed <em>and</em> videos you never needed. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/remove-youtube-recommende/khncfooichmfjbepaaaebmommgaepoid?hl=en">Use a plugin</a> that hides all <em>recommended</em> videos so you can open the app only to watch what <em>you</em> wanted. While we’re on the topic of plugins, other good ones include: <a href="https://resumeworded.com/sendy/l/rLscJ9sX8BWC7yGUzQ81cA/OaW2vNZ0dV7NObkSSu8920iA/mdjjl892Dl5pWFKT0eV08B2A">Pomodoro clock</a>, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/email-extractor/jdianbbpnakhcmfkcckaboohfgnngfcc?hl=en">email extractor</a>, and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/weava-highlighter-pdf-web/cbnaodkpfinfiipjblikofhlhlcickei?hl=en">Weava</a> highlighter.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t let just anyone enter your email home:</strong> Your email is sacred. It’s where you receive the most important alerts, it’s where you interact with your friends, and maybe close deals. Don’t let just anyone enter. I use a <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/products/email-protection">Proofpoint</a> filter that automatically detects spam-my emails. I also religiously unsubscribe from information that isn’t directly relevant or interesting to me (yet I still get unwanted emails. Sigh.).</li>
<li><strong>Delete social media apps unless you need them for something critical:</strong> I know this seems drastic, but truth be told, you can still access these through your computer (or even your phone through the website). By deleting them from your phone, you will at least add one layer of friction. <strong>Side Note:</strong> Instead of using the better-looking version of Facebook, use the <a href="https://mbasic.facebook.com/">basic version</a> on your phone. With its limited functionality and sub-par UI, it’s the perfect panacea to stop getting addicted.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Honestly, despite the above, sometimes I still feel overwhelmed with information. Below are a few more measures I plan to experiment with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Monitor my screen time. Although my phone screen time might be low, I’m afraid my laptop screen time is too high.</li>
<li>Read news articles only from paid subscriptions: <em>The New York Times, The Guardina, Medium.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li>Find a way to disable likes/comments on my posts on Instagram and LinkedIn so I’m not tempted to check them once I make a post.</li>
</ol>

<p>Most of you reading this will continue using social media, which is warranted. I plan to continue using it too. But, if you don’t pause for a few minutes to build some good habits now, you will wake up from the spell after a few years wondering where all the time went. Take control of your time now.</p>

    <p>If you work in tech, you probably have a YubiKey. I have this one, the <a href="https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-5c-nano/">YubiKey 5C Nano</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/nano.jpg" alt="YubiKey 5C Nano"></p>

<p>If you don’t work in tech but primarily work on your laptop, you probably <em>should</em> have a YubiKey. And if you work on a political campaign or as a journalist, you should definitely have one (or something similar). Talk to your IT Security department about that. This post will mostly be about something your IT Security department doesn’t want to hear about, though, so maybe don’t mention it to them.</p>

<p>YubiKeys act as two-factor authentication. This means that after you log-in to a system with your username and password, the system requires you to authorize in a second way as well. This way if your login credentials are compromised, the attacker would also have to compromise the second form of authentication, which is harder.</p>

<p>There are different forms of two-factor authentication - a common one is that a website will ask you to scan a QR code with the Google Authenticator app (or similar) on your phone which will generate 6 digit codes. The way this works is that the server and the app both have a shared secret. The phone generates codes based on that secret and the current timestamp and the server generates the same codes and sees if they match.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/qr-code.png" alt="QR Code"></p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/authenticator.png" alt="Google Authenticator"></p>

<p>Another one is SMS-based 2FA, which is pretty widely regarded as insecure. In this case, the server generates a code and sends it to your phone via SMS. The reason it’s considered insecure is that an attack exists called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam">SIM-jacking</a> where someone convinces a cell phone carrier to port a number to a new SIM card, effectively directing all SMS traffic to their phone instead of yours.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/wells.jpg" alt="Wells Fargo"></p>

<p>YubiKeys are small devices that plug in to the USB port of your computer and emulate a keyboard. When tapped, they emit a one-time password (OTP) which can be then verified by a validation server. A private key exists on the device which is used to sign information, but it can never leave the device because it is stored in a tamper-resistant environment.</p>

<p>The YubiKey that I use is designed to always sit in a USB port of my laptop, so whenever I would take my laptop from my desk to a conference room or to another office, it was always available. But like many new remote workers, my laptop never leaves my desk anymore. I have it hooked up to an external monitor and to save some desk space, I have it in clamshell mode sitting vertically on a stand.</p>

<p>This makes tapping the YubiKey difficult, especially when I store my laptop far away from my keyboard and mouse. I solved this by buying a <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B071DMMW4J/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">USB-C extension cable</a>, which brought the YubiKey closer to my keyboard.</p>

<p>One thing I haven’t mentioned about the YubiKey 5C Nano is that it’s kind of difficult to tap, even without the distance issues. The target area that you need to touch is extremely small:</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/nano-big.png" alt="YubiKey 5C Nano"></p>

<p>One of the features of the YubiKey is that the little metal strip determines that it is being tapped by a human - this prevents it from being accidentally triggered by bumping your laptop into something, but if you’ve ever seen a one-time password in a Slack channel or Google Doc like <code>tlerefhcvijlngibueiiuhkeibbcbecehvjiklltnbbl</code>, you know it isn’t a perfect system. I would estimate that 1 in 5 times that I attempt to trigger it, it doesn’t register.</p>

<p>A lot of thought has gone into ensuring that the YubiKey can’t be triggered from software on the computer itself.</p>

<p>Before we go any further, I’d like to acknowledge the reasons for this. If a remote attacker were to compromise your laptop, being able to trigger the YubiKey from software on the computer defeats the whole point of using the YubiKey. But I think we always make tradeoffs between security and convenience - for example, you often don’t have to enter your YubiKey every time you access a system, some systems will only ask you once and not ask you again on subsequent logins for a certain amount of time. When you use a 2FA system and it gives you “backup codes”, do you always print those out and store them in a safe location? Everyone should figure out what level of security and convenience they are okay with.</p>

<p>With that being said, let’s talk about how you could trigger a YubiKey with software.</p>



<p>I’ve been calling this mechanism <strong>The Finger</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<p>First, we need some way for the computer to talk to <strong>The Finger</strong>. I had a bunch of these <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B076F53B6S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">IZOKEE D1 Mini</a> development boards lying around, they are smaller versions of boards that use the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266">ESP8266</a> chip found in a lot of IoT devices.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/d1-mini.jpg" alt="IZOKEE D1 Mini"></p>

<p>We can connect this to the laptop and talk to it over USB serial, but since it has WiFi, we can also just run a webserver on it and send it HTTP requests.</p>

<p>Next, we need some way to push <strong>The Finger</strong> towards the Yubikey. After a little googling, I found that the <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CP18J4A/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">28BYJ-48 stepper motor</a> interfaces well with the D1 Mini board.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/stepper-motor.jpg" alt="stepper motor"></p>

<p>Stepper motors convert electrical pulses into mechanical rotation and the D1 Mini has pins for sending electrical pulses.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/stepper-motor.gif" alt="stepper motor"></p>

<p>But stepper motors rotate and we mostly just need to poke in a straight direction. So I searched on Thingiverse for “28BYJ-48” and found this: <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3593641">28BYJ-48 Motor Halter</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/stepper-motor-case.jpg" alt="28BYJ-48 Motor Halter"></p>

<p>This attaches a gear to the motor which can guide a long rack forward and backward. But if we’re going to push a long plastic thing toward the YubiKey, it might as well look like a finger. Back to Thingiverse, this time searching for “finger” and I found this model someone made for Halloween:</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/finger_model.jpg" alt="finger"></p>

<p>I opened up these two models in Fusion 360 and used an advanced CAD technique called “smooshing”, resulting in this:</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/finger_smoosh.png" alt="finger"></p>

<p>Next, I exported the smooshed STL and 3D printed it in <a href="https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/prusament/715-prusament-pla-lipstick-red-1kg.html">Prusament PLA Lipstick Red</a> because that’s what I happened to have in my printer at the time. Then I took the plastic finger and touched the YubiKey which.. didn’t do anything. I picked up a metal screw on my desk and touched the YubiKey, which immediately spit out a OTP. So then I took the finger and secured it to my desk with a vise and drilled a small hole in it, then screwed the metal screw into it and touched it to the YubiKey, which again did nothing.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/vise.jpg" alt="vise"></p>

<p>That’s when I realized that I’m an idiot and that when I had touched the metal screw to the Yubikey, it was just transmitting the electrical charge from my body to the metal screw, which then transmitted it to the capacitive touch sensor on the YubiKey. So how could I trick the capacitive touch sensor into thinking it was a real finger?</p>

<p>I guessed that the way that capacitive touch sensors work is that they’re measuring your body’s capacitance to ground, so if we just hook up the sensor directly towards ground, it’ll think that its really conductive or at least conductive enough for a human finger to be between the two. So I took an insulated wire, unscrewed the metal screw slightly, wrapped it around the screw and tightened it again. Then I took the other end and connected it the GND port on the D1 Mini board, touched it to the YubiKey, and it worked!</p>

<p>Now the driver board for the stepper motor already connects to the 5V and GND on the D1 Mini, so I thought I might have to strip the GND wire and run it to both the driver board and the screw, but on a whim I decided to just wedge the end of the wire from the metal screw between the stepper motor metal body (figuring the metal body case was grounded) and the plastic housing. This also worked!</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/ground.jpg" alt="grounding"></p>

<p>Once I confirmed that the finger would trigger the YubiKey, I needed a way to mount the YubiKey close to the finger, so I used my digital calipers to measure the size of the USB-C extension cable and designed a holder in Fusion 360.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/holder.png" alt="holder"></p>

<p>The USB-C extension cable would go into the hole on the left and the motor would mount on the right.</p>

<p>At this point, we have to wire the stepper motor driver board to the D1 Mini. This can be done by soldering some headers onto the D1 Mini and then connecting some Dupont jumper wires between them.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/pins.jpg" alt="pins"></p>

</table>

<p>Once we put the stepper motor into the housing and screw everything together, it should look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/setup.jpg" alt="setup"></p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>The software is much more straightforward. The D1 Mini can be programmed using the Arduino IDE. First, we go into Preferences and add <code>https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json</code> under <em>Additional Board Manager URLs</em>. Then when you go into the <em>Boards Managers</em>, you can install the <code>esp8266</code> package which includes the board <strong>LOLIN(WEMOS) D1 R2 &amp; mini</strong>, which should be selected under <em>Tools</em>.</p>

<p>At this point I’ll run a sketch for blinking the LED just to verify that it’s working:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#define LED 2 //Define blinking LED pin

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT); // Initialize the LED pin as an output
}
// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW); // Turn the LED on (Note that LOW is the voltage level)
  delay(1000); // Wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH); // Turn the LED off by making the voltage HIGH
  delay(1000); // Wait for two seconds
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I found this <a href="https://robojax.com/learn/arduino/?vid=robojax_ESP8266_28BYJ-48_Stepper_ESP8STP-1">sketch</a> that shows how to control the 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor using WiFi.</p>

<p>Here are the parts that have to do with the motor:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>int Pin1 = D1; //IN1 is connected 
int Pin2 = D2; //IN2 is connected   
int Pin3 = D3; //IN3 is connected 
int Pin4 = D4; //IN4 is connected 
 
int pole1[] ={0,0,0,0, 0,1,1,1, 0}; //pole1, 8 step values
int pole2[] ={0,0,0,1, 1,1,0,0, 0}; //pole2, 8 step values
int pole3[] ={0,1,1,1, 0,0,0,0, 0}; //pole3, 8 step values
int pole4[] ={1,1,0,0, 0,0,0,1, 0}; //pole4, 8 step values

int poleStep = 0; 
int dirStatus = 3; // stores direction status 3= stop (do not change)
String argId[] ={"ccw", "cw"};

...

void loop(void) {
    server.handleClient();
    MDNS.update();

    if (dirStatus == 1) {
        poleStep++;
        driveStepper(poleStep);
    } else if (dirStatus == 2) {
        poleStep--;
        driveStepper(poleStep);
    } else {
        driveStepper(8);
    }
    
    if (poleStep&gt;7) { 
        poleStep=0; 
    }

    if (poleStep&lt;0) {

<p>Today we’re releasing CUDA.jl 2.0, a breaking release with several new features. Highlights
include initial support for Float16, a switch to CUDA’s new stream model, a much-needed
rework of the sparse array support and support for CUDA 11.1.</p>
<p>The release now requires <strong>Julia 1.5</strong>, and assumes a GPU with <strong>compute capability 5.0</strong> or
higher (although most of the package will still work with an older GPU).</p>
<h2 id="low--and-mixed-precision-operations">Low- and mixed-precision operations</h2>
<p>With NVIDIA’s latest GPUs featuring more and more low-precision operations,
CUDA.jl <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl/pull/417">now</a> starts to support
these data types. For example, the CUBLAS wrappers can be used with (B)Float16
inputs (running under <code>JULIA_DEBUG=CUBLAS</code> to illustrate the called methods)
thanks to the <code>cublasGemmEx</code> API call:</p>

<p>Work is <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl/issues/391">under way</a> to extend these
capabilities to the rest of CUDA.jl, e.g., the CUDNN wrappers, or the native kernel
programming capabilities.</p>
<h2 id="new-default-stream-semantics">New default stream semantics</h2>
<p>In CUDA.jl 2.0 we’re <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl/pull/395">switching</a> to CUDA’s
<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/gpu-pro-tip-cuda-7-streams-simplify-concurrency/">simplified stream programming
model</a>.
This simplifies working with multiple streams, and opens up more possibilities for
concurrent execution of GPU operations.</p>
<h3 id="multi-stream-programming">Multi-stream programming</h3>
<p>In the old model, the default stream (used by all GPU operations unless specified otherwise)
was a special stream whose commands could not be executed concurrently with commands on
regular, explicitly-created streams. For example, if we interleave kernels executed on a

<p>In the new model, default streams are regular streams and commands issued on them can
execute concurrently with those on other streams:</p>

<h3 id="multi-threading">Multi-threading</h3>
<p>Another consequence of the new stream model is that each thread gets its own default stream
(accessible as <code>CuStreamPerThread()</code>). Together with Julia’s threading capabilities, this
makes it trivial to group independent work in tasks, benefiting from concurrent execution on
the GPU where possible:</p>

<p>With the old model, execution would have been serialized because the default stream was the
same across threads:</p>

<p>Future improvements will make this behavior configurable, such that users can use a
different default stream per task.</p>

<!-- Horizontal Top Article -->
<p>Passion among developers is a concept that puts a lot of people under crazy pressure. You hear about it all the time. You see it in every job offer, as an absolute obligation. If you’re not passionate enough, you don’t fucking belong here. Is that clear?</p>



<h3>Tyranny of passion</h3>



<p>In your field, much more than in others, there is this tyranny of passion. It’s so strong that it freaks newcomers out. In fact, we all concerned about it. <strong>Your profession is one of the few where passion is used as a measure to hire or determine someone’s worth.</strong> And everyone finds it normal.</p>



<p><strong>If you don’t work every night on a side project, you’re not a real dev. </strong>It’s a shameful attitude not coding outside of work. As a result, you don’t tell anyone that dev is not the only thing in your life. It’s your little secret.</p>



<figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafsc1i1x/image/upload/v1601648968/image_u8egqw.jpg" data-src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafsc1i1x/image/upload/v1601648968/image_u8egqw.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>And for a lot of people, this tyranny is normal. The main argument is that being a developer is a complicated job. <strong>To overcome these difficulties, it would take a real burning crazy passion.</strong> And it would take even more passion to be “a good developer”.</p>



<p>The problem with this hellish argument is that it all depends on where you put the cursor. It’s always about nuances.</p>



<h3>50 shades of dev</h3>



<p>Before we both get angry, we need to agree on the definition of “passion”. </p>



<p>The passionate developer lives code, thinks code, eats code, everywhere, all the time, always and forever. It’s an obsession. It’s intense. His commit grid on GitHub is crazy. <strong>Dude, what’s stopping you from coding like this ?</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>He arrives early in the morning and leaves very late at night, out of passion. You can pay him less as long as he works on his favorite technology, out of passion. He only talks to you about development, out of passion. </p>



<p><strong>And to make it even more clear: in this article I assume that a true passionate spends the vast majority of his free time coding.</strong></p>



<p>Then there is the mass. I consider myself a random dev, so I go for it. Development is <strong>one of</strong> my passions. <strong>This nuance is important.</strong> I have a strong interest in the subject. My favorite thing is to <a href="https://www.jesuisundev.com/en/category/understand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">understand how things work</a>. I don’t know, I take pleasure in knowing how it works. So I play with stuff and <a href="https://www.jesuisundev.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I write about it</a>. At work, I get excited when I build my thing with what I understood before. I’m proud to see it running. I often feel like I’m getting paid to do fun stuff.</p>



<p>So yes, I’m a fan, but not a fanatic. Development is not my whole life. I use the same word, passion, but the nuance is that for me it’s an interest that doesn’t dominate others. Yes, sometimes i’m done with it. <strong>Yes, my salary is important.</strong> No, I don’t want to finish every night at 10 pm. Yes, I’ll talk to you about other subjects. And fuck, no, I don’t spend all my free time coding.</p>



<figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafsc1i1x/image/upload/v1601649824/5646077add089560678b478f_dzh3ht.jpg" data-src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafsc1i1x/image/upload/v1601649824/5646077add089560678b478f_dzh3ht.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>Now that we’re talking about the same thing, let’s dive into it.</p>



<h3>For the newcomers</h3>



<p>First of all, I want to talk to you, who has been here for a short time. <strong>It is especially for you that I am doing this article.</strong> If you are new here, you are the first victim of this tyranny. There are things you need to understand before you run away.</p>



<p><strong>Mastering programming doesn’t require you to be passionate</strong>. Programming is a set of computer knowledge and techniques. It comes with experience and practice on different and progressively complex projects. <strong>The one thing all successful developers have in common is work. </strong>Not passion.</p>



<p><strong>Mastering programming is not an “innate” talent.</strong> Passionate people have no innate talent. Their mastery has come over time and they tend to forget it. <strong>Never has a skill become so much a myth in people’s heads.</strong> We seem to be astrophysicists in quantum mechanics. We have to stop scaring people like that.</p>



<p>It’s even dangerous this elitism. A lot of developers are going to draw a line in the sand. Either you’re too strong, a real rock star, or you suck at it. And when you’re new, you already know where you belong.</p>



<figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafsc1i1x/image/upload/v1601650188/PPkCPv8_zoghwb.jpg" data-src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafsc1i1x/image/upload/v1601650188/PPkCPv8_zoghwb.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIJdFxYlEKE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Jacob Kaplan-Moss talk is very good about that, it’s a MUST WATCH for any developer.</a></strong> Now, I’m also convinced that you need a minimum of interest to succeed. But here’s the plot twist.</p>



<h3>The crazy plot twist</h3>



<p>What many people don’t understand, or have forgotten, is that interest comes with practice. <strong>Practice leads to mastery and mastery fuels interest.</strong> When you get good at something, you enjoy it. You feel powerful and it quickly becomes addictive. This pushes you to do more. This opens up the famous virtuous circle: <strong>practice =&gt; mastery =&gt; interest =&gt; practice =&gt; mastery =&gt; interest, etc etc etc.</strong></p>



<p>When you go in there, everything is beautiful. You know that feeling. Everybody has experienced it with this job. <strong>You practice for hours but it doesn’t work.</strong> You work, you search, you try to understand, you struggle for hours. Looks like it’s mission impossible. </p>



<p>All of a sudden, you understand what’s happening ! You change something, you put your app back on, and BOOM, IT WORKS!</p>



<figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafsc1i1x/image/upload/v1601650527/giphy_mrf4wd.gif" alt=""></figure>



<p>And that’s when, suddenly, everyone starts talking about “revelation”, “passion”, “vocation” or whatever you want. No, it’s not magic what happened. You’ve worked, you’ve got a good result, you’re having fun and you’re doing it again. <strong>We have to stop with this “destiny” bullshit and recognize that only work gives you wings.</strong> In short, it’s normal if you don’t feel an interest that devours you right away. It will come.</p>



<p>I was talking to you about <a href="https://www.jesuisundev.com/en/religion-among-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">religion among developers</a> not long ago. I was telling you about how I fell in love at first sight. What I’m not saying is that I started by doing very easy things. Simple HTML pages that empowered me. I took big hits of dopamine. <strong>Slowly, very slowly, for years.</strong> And mostly without any constraint. In short, the perfect breeding ground to create a passion among many others.</p>



<p>The problem is that today, you have to go fast. The bootcamp last 9 weeks. Nobody takes the time for anything anymore.<strong> It’s hard to enjoy the landscape when you’re sprinting like Usain Bolt.</strong> </p>



<p>On top of that, passion, in real life, is not the Walt Disney that everyone has oversold you.</p>



<h3>The horrible truth about passion</h3>



<p><strong>Passion is excessively used by companies.</strong> It is not developers who talk about it the most. It’s the companies that talk about it the most. And passion is often perverted in the process. A developer will talk about pleasure. A company will talk about performance.</p>



<p>If you see an position description that only wants real passionate people and doesn’t talk about work-family balance at all, you know what it means.<strong> You’re going to do 80 hours a week.</strong> Your salary is going to be negative. This company is going to get rid of any legal obligation for training. You’re going to have to train yourself outside of work on everything and all the time. You’re going to sacrifice most of your free time for your job. </p>



<p><strong>But hey, you’re a real passionate, so that’s okay, right?</strong></p>



<figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafsc1i1x/image/upload/v1601650972/Shia-LaBeouf_qsndif.jpg" data-src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafsc1i1x/image/upload/v1601650972/Shia-LaBeouf_qsndif.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>No, it’s not okay. Passion should remain a personal matter, not a prerequisite for a job. No company should require it. It’s infinitely uncomfortable when I see it in the list of obligations.</p>



<p><strong>Passion is not an infinite resource.</strong> You are told that passion will be your engine to always learn more and perform better. But when you pull too much on the rope, the rope will eventually break. If you’re just coding all the time, you’re going to end up hating it. To recharge the batteries, like everything else, you need moderation.</p>



<p>It’s pretty fucking obvious what I’m saying here. <strong>Why in this field is it necessary to remember such a basic thing?</strong> You might even lose your passion completely if you push too hard. You need balance.</p>



<p><strong>Passion is not the most important thing for your career.</strong> You have been taught that if you do a job out of passion, you don’t work a single day in your life. Everything will be perfect and nothing will ever be painful. This is not true! In real life, you work the same way. You work the same way because you don’t do things for you, the way you want and with what you want. Your company is going to tell you what to do. And sometimes it’s very boring.</p>



<figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafsc1i1x/image/upload/v1601651177/Cdm5hMZW0AAFPhp_tymwh0.jpg" data-src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafsc1i1x/image/upload/v1601651177/Cdm5hMZW0AAFPhp_tymwh0.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>I’m reading a lot of books these days. I’ve read one in particular that talks about this subject. This book answers a question: <strong>is following your passion the best career advice for your success and happiness?</strong> This book is very convincing in explaining that it is not. The author explodes the mindset around passion throughout the book. He compares it to <a href="https://www.vincecampanale.com/blog/2017/02/16/craftsman-mindset/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Craftman mindset</a>, which is much more important. It’s called “<a href="https://amzn.to/3jkgcto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">So Good They Can’t Ignore You</a>” and I highly recommend it for your career plan.</p>



<p>Now we need to talk about how to succeed, without spending your life coding.</p>



<h3>For the old ones</h3>



<p>I also want to talk to you, who has been here for a long time. You’ve been putting up with this tyranny for a long time. It’s time to take a breath.</p>



<p><strong>You don’t have to dedicate your life to your work to be legitimate.</strong> The best developers I’ve ever worked with weren’t passionate about it. Most of them had a vague interest and a lot of practice and experience. These stereotypes and obligations only concern those who accept them. It’s time to stop comparing ourselves to others.</p>



<p><strong>Yes, programming requires extra investment.</strong> I’m not going to lie to you, this job is complex and you know it. As I keep saying, it takes practice. And so yes, it takes extra work. But it doesn’t have to become a prison. This practice must be at your rhythm and without constraint. And indeed passion is good for that, but it is not mandatory. The advice I can give you is to mix your interests.</p>



<p>For example: I like dev, I like to write and I like to learn new things. So I decided to make this blog.<strong> Without the combination of these three factors, this blog wouldn’t exist.</strong> When I want to learn and write, I choose a <a href="https://www.jesuisundev.com/en/category/technical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technical</a> or more <a href="https://www.jesuisundev.com/en/category/general-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">general </a>subject, and i go for it ! </p>



<p>I could use this time to make a lot of money by freelancing. I could use this time to do exercises on LeetCode. But I’m here writing this article, and I’m enjoying what …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
    
    <p>by Jeffrey Kegler</p>
    <p>The story of Gödel's citizenship hearing had been much repeated over the years.
      What was known was that on 5 December 1947, Kurt Gödel went to his citizenship hearing in Trenton, New Jersey.
      The examiner was Judge Philip Forman.
      As his witnesses, Gödel brought his two closest friends, Oskar Morgenstern and Albert Einstein.
      Gödel was granted citizenship, and took his oath on 2 April 1948.
      Those were the reliably established facts.
    </p>
    <p>Afterwards, Morgenstern told many people that he and Einstein had had their hands full preventing the brilliant, but politically naive, Gödel from derailing his citizenship chances.
      No account directly from Morgenstern or anyone else at the hearing had survived, but hearsay versions circulated widely.
      The hearsay versions show considerable variation, but their burden is something like the following:
    </p>
    <p>Gödel, in his usual manner, had read extensively in preparing for the hearing.
      In the course of his studies, Gödel decided that he had discovered a flaw in the U.S. Constitution --
      a contradiction which would allow the U.S. to be turned into a dictatorship.
      Gödel, usually quite reticent, seemed to feel a need to make this known.
      Morgenstern and Einstein warned Gödel that it would be a disaster to confront his citizenship examiner with visions of a Constitutional flaw leading to an American dictatorship.
    </p>
    <p>Arriving in Princeton, the trio had no idea who the examiner would be.
      They happened to run into Judge Forman.
      Forman was a friend of Einstein's --
      when Einstein became a citizen, Forman had administered the oath.
      How lucky this was became apparent almost immediately during the questioning.
      Forman happened to remark how fortunate it was that the US was not a dictatorship, which Gödel took as a cue to explain his discovery.
      A surprised Forman exchanged glances with Einstein and Morgenstern, cut Gödel off, and forced-marched the hearing through to a successful conclusion.
    </p>
    <h2>The History, and the Legend</h2>
    <p>Nobody seems to know what Gödel's proof was.
      Many versions of the hearing that circulated featured invented dialog.
      In faculty room yarns this would be unfortunate, but not surprising.
      More startling is the presence of such dialog in the version given
      in the extremely scholarly and very carefully edited Gödel's
      <cite>Collected Works</cite>, Vol. I, p. 12.
      A footnote in
      <cite>Collected Works</cite>
      admits that its version is pure hearsay.
    </p>
    <p>I've learned to distrust such sources.
      When I was in graduate school, studying Theory of Computation, Kurt Gödel was still alive.
      I heard many tales of Gödel's eccentric behavior from mathematicians.
      Gödel certainly was eccentric, and first-hand tales of this abound,
      but I later discovered that every single anecdote I'd gotten second- or third-hand was almost certainly false.
    </p>
    <p>1997 marked a turning point in Gödel biography,
      with the publication of John Dawson's careful and reliable biography of Gödel:
      <cite>Logical Dilemmas</cite>.
      When Dawson wrote, all four participants in the hearing were dead.
      Morgenstern refers, briefly and cryptically, to the hearing in his diary, but does not say enough to fully support the story.
      Dawson in general, and quite correctly, rejected the use of hearsay.
      But this story was the most well-known story about Gödel, and nobody doubted that it had a basis in truth.
    </p>
    <p>Dawson apparently decided that some reference to this story must be made, regardless of sourcing difficulty.
      Given no alternative to using hearsay, Dawson was careful to seek out what could reasonably be thought of as the
      source of the best hearsay -- Morgenstern's widow.
      She certainly would have heard the story many times, and directly from Morgenstern.
      Dawson interviewed her on 17 October 1983.
      Dawson's account in
      <cite>Logical Dilemmas</cite>
      (pp. 179-180) is based on that interview and Morgenstern's diary entry.
    </p>
    <h2>The Lost Document</h2>
    <p>According to Dawson (p. 300), Morgenstern had written up an account of this matter for publication, but Dawson was unable to locate it.
      Dorothy Morgenstern was sure that she'd once had her husband's write-up,
      and that she'd sent it to someone.
      But she could not remember who.
      This wasn't exactly promising for the accuracy of her retelling.
      But best evidence is best evidence -- you take it how it comes.
    </p>
    <p>In dealing with the matter as a Wikipedia editor,
      I took the position that Dawson's account of this hearing was the final word.
      The other versions were either retellings of the Dawson account,
      hearsay from less reliable sources or pure speculation.
      Regardless of which of the three they were, they were to be rejected as sources for the Wikipedia article.
    </p>
    <p>When dealing with the matter as a novelist, the God Proof,
      I took the position that this story had become a legend as much as any tale of an 11th century saint.
      Since it was a legend, I was free as a writer of fiction to add any incident or dialog I thought to be in the spirit of the thing.
    </p>
    <p>But now the "lost" Morgenstern document has reappeared.
      Apparently the IAS has had it all these years.

October 2, 2020 | https://kn100.me/usb-hub-bs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://kn100.me/usb-hub-bs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>My trusty old USB 3 hub has failed. It was only around a year old, but it was cheap and it worked. It wasn’t powered, but most of the time it didn’t need to be. One day I began having very strange issues with USB on my computer. Devices randomly disconnecting, devices never connecting until the computer was rebooted and so on. I eventually narrowed it down to the hub. I tossed it out after a quick internal inspection had revealed nothing obviously wrong, and went shopping for a new hub.</p>
<p>My requirements for a hub were very simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>it must be externally powered,</li>
<li>it must be relatively aesthetically neutral - no gamer aesthetics or hideous glossy plastic,</li>
<li>it must be USB 3,</li>
<li>it must offer between 3 and 7 extra ports - any less and what’s the point, and more and the hub is unnecessarily big, and I treat my desk like Tokyo. Space is a at a premium,</li>
<li>the cost must not exceed 35 GBP (45 US Dollars at the time of writing),</li>
<li>and it must have a detachable cord that connects it to the computer, or offer a cord long enough to reach my computer under my desk.</li>
</ul>
<p>While shopping, almost every single hub I came across had some stupid design that either prioritised it looking space age with blue LEDS galore, and a lot of them even had individual power switches for each USB port. Why anyone would want that is beyond me. Other hubs had tiny 15cm cables, since they’re designed to be used right beside a laptop.</p>
<p>I ended up settling on a very cleverly designed Orico 4 port Aluminium hub. I particularly liked this one because aesthetically speaking it was pretty neutral, and it even handles the problem of the USB hub floating off in the breeze by integrating a clamp so that you can clamp it to your desk or your monitor.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://kn100.me/hub-product.jpg"> <figcaption>
<h4>The hub I chose. A novel design!</h4>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It arrived, and seemed to work perfectly. USB transfer speeds were as expected, the external power source being MicroUSB meant I could attach any fairly dumb USB power supply to it to supply extra power, the cable leading to the PC itself was detachable and relatively standard (USB A to USB A) and all was good with the world.</p>
<p>That was until I put my computer to sleep. The next morning, I pressed a key on my keyboard to trigger the system to wake up, and nothing happened. The keyboard is not attached to the hub, nor is it attached to a port on the motherboard that is on the same controller, so this was perplexing. I pressed the power button on the tower, but still nothing! Very strange. I detached the USB hub, and immediately my computer came to life and worked as normal.</p>
<p>Through further experimentation I determined this strange phenomenon only happened when an external power source was connected. I toyed with the idea of returning what was obviously a faulty product, but reasoned that I didn’t actually need it to be powered, and pretty much all the other hubs in the same price range were either aesthetically disgusting or lacked other features I liked about this one - so I kept it.</p>
<p>That is until today, when through some research, I found this isn’t just a problem with <em>my</em> USB hub, it’s a problem many have with powered hubs. Articles like <a href="https://www.pro-tools-expert.com/production-expert-1/2019/9/18/warning-your-usb-hub-may-be-harming-your-drives-and-you-may-lose-valuable-studio-work-heres-how-to-fix-it">this</a>, or forum posts like <a href="https://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/computer-wont-start-with-usb-hub-connected.2753255/">this</a> show that totally unrelated hubs cause similar issues for their owners. This got me thinking to past experiences of USB hubs I’ve had. In the past, a less financially stable me used to buy the cheapest possible thing every time. At one time, I was experimenting with a Raspberry Pi along with external hard drives. I discovered that a powered hub was necessary for these experiments because the Pi itself was incapable of providing much USB power. I bought the cheapest USB 2 powered hub I could at the time from eBay, and it mostly worked fine. To describe the setup a little, I had the hub itself connected to its power supply, and the ‘in’ usb port connected to one of the Pis USB ports. Imagine my surprise when the Pi switched on and booted up, without any power supply attached! I thought this was cool at the time, and chalked it up to ‘It’s not a bug, it’s a feature’, and forgot about it. Fast forward to today me, when I realised my experience back then was possibly related to the problems I was having with this new Orico USB hub today. After a little bit of thought, I realised that the hub was most likely ‘backfeeding’ power to the connected computer.</p>

<p>To keep things simple, let’s stick to USB 2 for now. USB 2 consists of 4 conductors, known as VCC (this is the ‘positive’ 5 volt connection), GND (this is the ‘negative’ power connection), D+, and D- (the data transmission pins, no true power flows over these pins). This means that a connected USB device can both draw power and transfer data. When you see 5 volts on a power adaptor or something, this is usually an approximation. For various reasons which revolve mostly around cost saving, most USB power adaptors will actually output slightly more than 5 volts, and then when a load is applied (say, a charging phone), the voltage drops down a bit. The better the quality of the power supply, closer to 5 volts it’ll start at generally and the smaller the drop when a load is applied.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://kn100.me/usb-pinout.png"> <figcaption>
<h4>The USB pinout</h4>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This applies to your computer’s USB ports too - except for one big difference: the power supply inside your computer is probably significantly better designed than the USB plug sockets that are mass produced. In fact, if I measure the voltage coming from my USB ports on my computer, I get a value of around 5.03v. If I measure the voltage coming from my phone charger, I get 5.21v. This is a pretty big difference!</p>
<p>The next thing to know is how a powered hub actually works. Essentially, a powered hub takes an external power source, and passes that power source through to the USB devices connected to the hub in place of your computer. One problem that these hubs face however is what if the user wishes to use the hub in its ‘unpowered’ state - where they’ve connected the hub to their computer with no power supply. In order to implement this properly, the hub would probably need some mechanism to switch between the computer power and the external PSU if it is connected. This would however add cost to the manufacture of the hub, so instead of doing this, they just connect the 5v of your computer through to the 5v of the external power supply. This is ridiculously bad because if there is even the smallest difference between the voltage being supplied by your computer and the voltage being supplied by the external power source, power will flow towards the device with the lower voltage! This is ‘backfeeding’. As a simple analogy, imagine you took two rechargeable batteries and connected them together. What you’d find happens is that the batteries will eventually end up at exactly the same voltage, which will be slightly lower than what you’d expect if you did the maths, as a small amount of power would be lost as heat. If the power source is ‘infinite’ however - like our wall connected computer or our wall connected external hub, this power will just continue to flow. Where it goes or what happens with it is completely undefined. In the case of our Raspberry Pi earlier, the circuit was simple enough that it just led to the Pi being powered up. In the case of my computer, it screwed with the system so badly that hardware buttons like the power button literally stopped functioning altogether.</p>

<p>This design seems stupid right? The problem is, it is the cheapest way of achieving the design goal of having a USB hub work with or without power. If we didn’t care about this particular feature, we could either just not have an external power source and have a purely unpowered hub, or we could not connect the 5v pin from the computer and therefore only supply power from the external PSU. Both of these solutions in effect are more expensive than just living with the backfeeding ‘feature’ since it’d mean the company offering the hub would need to deal with support requests from people wondering why their hub doesn’t work ‘unpowered’ when their other one does, or vice versa. Instead, we get backfeeding. I’m sure that some computers would not exhibit any real problems with this design, seeing as it’s been around since as long as powered USB hubs have been around as far as I can tell, and it’s likely some USB chipsets are designed with this in mind, but mine was not. Others computers, especially Macs, deal with this particular issue far more destructively, causing damage to the computer’s USB chipset when a backfeeding USB hub is connected.</p>

<p>Before we continue, you should know I am not an electrical engineer, if that wasn’t clear from how vaguely I described things above. I am a software engineer who likes to dabble with electronics. This means my advice below does not come from someone who is qualified to give it. You should follow this advice at your own risk. I take no responsibility for damage you do to yourself, your USB hub, or your computer, or to anything else for that matter.</p>

<ol>
<li>Firstly, I validated this was the problem. I engaged in a clever little trick where I took an old USB cable - USB 2 or 3 is fine, cut it in half, exposed the either 2 (cable is power only) or 4 wires, and looked up USB wire colouring to realise that the red wire is usually the VCC wire, and Black/White is usually GND. I then connected the cut up USB lead to the input port on my hub (where my computer connects), and connected the external power supply. I measured 5 volts across these two wires using the multimeter, meaning this hub does backfeed.</li>

          <p>
            An FAQ follows.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why would someone pick C++ over Rust today?
          </p>
          <p>
            C++ templates are incredibly powerful, and with the introduction of compile-time expressions, vast portions of modern C++ programs are just compile-time tables. Examples like this make Rust look very tiny:
          </p>
          <pre><code>template &lt;size_t i, typename... Ts, typename CurTy&gt;
void recurseFillChildren(CurTy &amp;E)
{
  using PackTy = std::variant&lt;Ts...&gt;;
  using TyL = std::variant_alternative_t&lt;i - 1, PackTy&gt;;
  static_assert(std::is_same_v&lt;CurTy, TyL&gt;);
  using TyR = std::variant_alternative_t&lt;i, PackTy&gt;;

  for (i32 j = 0; j &lt; E.NChildren; ++j)
  {
    E.Children.push_back(miniParser&lt;TyR&gt;());
    if constexpr (i + 1 &lt; sizeof...(Ts))
      recurseFillChildren&lt;i + 1, Ts...&gt;(E.Children.back());
  }
};</code></pre>
          <p>
            Is there anything that Rust can do that C++ can't?
          </p>
          <p>
            Rust didn't restrict what macros can do as much as C++ did. As a result, it's possible to do more with them. The particular example of the Pest parser is especially enlightening:
          </p>
          <pre><code>#[derive(Parser)]
#[grammar = "grammar.pest"]</code></pre>
          <p>
            Essentially, "grammar.pest" is processed at compile-time, and you can use definitions parsed from it in your code. However, there are trade-offs; Rust's macros are very slow, and your compile-times blow up if you have recursive macros. <mark>std::embed</mark> in C++23 will probably do it right.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why is Haskell classified as a dying language?
          </p>
          <p>
            Haskell is pleasant to get started with, and write relatively simple programs in. In the 2010-2015 period, there was a lot of intellectual discourse and PL research around it. The high-brow crowd was obssessed with transactional memory, parser combinators, and lenses. Online resources were exploding: LYAH and CatProg enjoyed their bouts of popularity. Several people and companies invested in Haskell heavily in that period. The language is easy to get started with, and has a pleasant development experience for relatively simple programs. The problems started when codebases started growing in size and complexity.
          </p>
          <p>
            You either need to be able to interactively debug your program or prove that it is correct: in Haskell, you can't do either; the best you can do is to write some QuickCheck tests. Then there's Liquid Haskell that allows you to pepper your Haskell code with invariants that it will check using Z3. Unfortunately, it is very limited in what it can do: good luck checking your monadic combinator library with LH. Moreover, there are no tools to help you debug the most notorious kind of bug seen in a complicated codebase: memory blowups caused by laziness. It suffices to say that tooling is weak. In Atom, the Haskell addon was terrible, and even today, in VSCode, the Haskell extension is among the most buggy language plugins.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/blob/a1f34d37b47826e86343e368a5c00f1a4b1f2bce/compiler/GHC/Driver/Session.hs#L3729-3876">over 120</a> language extensions, which can be turned on/off in each <mark>.hs</mark> file. The issue is that different extensions interact in subtle ways to produce bugs, and it's very difficult to tell if a new language extension will play well with the others (it often doesn't, until all the bugs are squashed, which can take a few years). The best case scenario plays out like this: GHC rejects your program, and suggests that you turn on some other language extensions; you turn them on, and you're left with a cryptic error message coming from a language extension you're not as familiar with; you spend the next N hours reading whatever little information is available about the more recent language extension, and decide to throw in the towel. The worst case plays out as follows: the typechecker hangs or crashes, and you're on the issue tracker searching for the issue; if you're lucky, you'll find a bug filed using 50~60% of the language extensions you used in your program, and you're not sure if it's the same issue; you file a new issue. In either case, your work has been halted.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is almost zero documentation on language extensions. Hell, you can't even find the list of available language extensions with some description on any wiki. Looking at the big picture: first, this is a poor way to do software development; as the number of language extensions increase, your testing burden increases exponentially. Second, the problem of having a good type system is already solved by a simple dependent type theory; you study the core, and every new feature is just a small delta that fits in nicely with the overall model. As opposed to having to read detailed papers on each new language extension. And yes, there's a good chance that very few people will be able to understand your code if you're using some esoteric extensions. In summary, language extensions are complicated hacks to compensate for the poverty of Haskell's type system.
          </p>
          <p>
            In practice, you'll be familar with ~20 language extensions, and use various combinations of them over and over again, so the problem might not seem as acute as a regular Haskell programmer. However, PL research has shifted away from Haskell for the most part, and the little that happens tends to be <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/03/ho-haskell-5c8bb4918a4de.pdf">unnecessarily complex nonsense</a> that never sees the light of day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's a sample of some simple Haskell code pieced together. I've intentionally left out examples using <mark>LinearTypes</mark>, because it's unfair to find faults with such a recent language feature.
          </p>
          <ol type="none" start="1">
            <li>
              What does the code mean? What is the intent?
            </li>
            <li>
              Can you specifically tell how each language extension was useful in the snippet?
            </li>
            <li>
              Guess what the code will do on GHC 8.10.1. What will an older version of GHC do?
            </li>
            <li>
              How many more language features are missing?
            </li>
          </ol>
          <pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE MagicHash #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeInType #-}

import GHC.Exts

type family MatchInt (f :: Int) :: () where
  MatchInt ('I# _) = '()</code></pre>
          <pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE PolyKinds #-}

type family Dim v

type family v `OfDim` (n :: Dim v) = r | r -&gt; n

(!*^) :: Dim m `OfDim` j -&gt; Dim m `OfDim` i
(!*^) = undefined</code></pre>
          <p>
            Doesn't Go feature a solid compiler/runtime?
          </p>
          <p>
            It does, but the author didn't feel that it was worthy of an asterisk, because the compiler is working with a really dumb language. Nevertheless, the GC and scheduler are praise-worthy, as is the overall experience with ultra-low compile-times.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ever look at your color palette and cry?</p><p>They look so pretty in your UI kit but when you go to add the placeholder text—it takes 10 minutes to find the right hue. It's like 50 shades of grey sans BDSM.</p><p>This was my life until I came across Carbon by IBM...</p><figure id="w-node-20f8f686328d-ccb706c6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f08abd1a8581a1027bfc65a/5f77396001162c3f4478c517_Frame%205-min%20(4).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Because colors touch everything, they cause problems. Problems like wasted time and inconsistencies in your product. In order to solve this, IBM created Carbon Themes.</p><p>Carbon Themes is filled with some ground-breaking ideas, but I think the most innovative of them all is <strong><em>how they name their colors.</em></strong> Seems simple but it changed the way we design and build.</p><blockquote><em>We wanted a naming system that was flexible enough to scale across themes but also hint at the colors’ purpose.</em></blockquote><p>So here's how they do it.</p><p>Starting at the lowest unit is the value of the color itself i.e. the hex or color code (#000000). This is what we’ve been hard-coding into our products for years.</p><figure id="w-node-dbedaceb6cc1-ccb706c6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f08abd1a8581a1027bfc65a/5f77397870cb84e9d58759c1_Frame%2013-min%20(1).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The next level-up is the <em>Token.</em> Tokens get assigned a color but abstract away the hex value and get their name from the color's purpose in the UI. You can think of the color's purpose as its Job Title—something that lets everyone know what the color does and where it should be used.</p><figure id="w-node-01f272c8b0b0-ccb706c6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f08abd1a8581a1027bfc65a/5f77398901162c1fa578c54f_Frame%2014-min%20(1).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>So, let’s look at the example token: $text-01. The hex value #000 has been assigned to this Token. The “text” in the name tells us this color should be used in text elements (its purpose). The number 01 tells us the variant we should be using i.e. 01 is the primary text whereas 02 is the secondary text.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-e3242782c598-ccb706c6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f08abd1a8581a1027bfc65a/5f7739ad772fc14c72a0e0b6_Frame%2015-min.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The last category is the <em>Theme</em>, think light and dark mode on your mac. The theme is based on the primary background color and changes which values (i.e. hex codes) each token is using.&nbsp;</p><p>Say, for example, we’re using the light theme with our primary background color Gray-10, our $text-01 token will be a dark value (i.e. #000). Whereas if we’re using the dark theme with the background-color Gray-100, then our $text-01 token would be a light value (i.e. #FFF).</p><figure id="w-node-a244604c164e-ccb706c6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f08abd1a8581a1027bfc65a/5f7739994b83a17a2bd0fa81_Frame%2016-min.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The theme and tokens all live together in one, centralized file. Making it easy to edit, update, and view all the colors used in your UI.</p><p>Granted, an entire team was able to focus entirely on creating Carbon Themes. If you're not IBM and want to save time and make your product more consistent—here's what you can do.</p><p>First, recreate the table they made. In the table, you'll see the token name, the purpose of each color in the UI, and the value (hex and name of color). *<em>If your team isn't ready to use tokens yet, remove that column.</em></p><p>What you'll end up with is something like this below. Here, I have a color named Gray-100, its hex is #FFFFFF, its role is primary text, body copy, and headers, and its token name is $text-01.</p><figure id="w-node-fb4ee884e4a2-ccb706c6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f08abd1a8581a1027bfc65a/5f7739bed1a3876d3b72316d_Frame%2018-min.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Next, go to Figma and rename your saved style to Gray-5 and in the description, add the color's role. Now when you're designing, you'll always know which color to use and when—making you a quicker and more consistent designer.</p><p>Big thanks to the IBM Carbon team for this amazing work and for saving me hours/years of my life.</p><p>Thanks so much for reading. If you enjoyed this, I'd really appreciate it if you joined our email list. I write a new post like this each week!</p><p>Or if you're feeling generous -smash that share on the Twitter thread.</p><div><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Ever look at your color palette and cry?</p><p>They look so pretty in your UI kit but when you go to add the placeholder text  -  it takes 10 minutes to find the right hue.

    <section>
      <p>When the engineering managers I coach struggle to find ambitious goals, I sometimes leverage their ambitions to help them identify areas where they can improve. But, to my surprise, not so many EMs have ambitions beyond their current role.</p><p>When I had a “real job”, I was always driven by the next thing. I didn’t care about the title, but I always wanted more impact and responsibilities (in six years and two companies, I had seven different positions 😅). While I don’t recommend being as “opportunistic” as I was (but hey, I ended up being an entrepreneur), I do believe that thinking about the next position gives you <strong>perspective and makes you more in control of your career</strong>. But the difference between thinking about your next promotion and getting it is enormous. </p><p>Many engineers believe that if you do great work at your job, people will recognise that work and automatically give you an adequate promotion or raise. It is unfortunately far from reality, as <strong>those who get promoted, are not the best employees, but the more visible</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/10/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image.png 600w, https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/10/image.png 900w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Dilbert.com</figcaption></figure><h3 id="visibility-matters"><strong>Visibility matters</strong></h3><p>Think about your CTO’s typical day (or the VP Engineering, the one who will eventually decide on your promotion). They might have eight to ten meetings to attend, tens of emails (or Slack messages) to answer and they always have to switch their mind to a different project or a new problem that needs to be solved. So, unless you’re involved in the problem du jour, the number of seconds the CTO is thinking about you in a day is about zero. Pretty normal right? The CTO is a busy gal and can’t think about every single team member. But if you’re serious about this promotion, <strong>she should hear about you often</strong>. </p><p>In an <a href="https://staffeng.com/stories/katie-sylor-miller">interview with StaffEng</a>, Katie Sylor-Miller, a Frontend Architect at Etsy, says that “<em>a big part of being promoted [...] is making sure that your work is visible, that people know your name and you have a good reputation.</em>” I’m sure you’re thinking right now about OKRs, performance reviews, one-on-one(s) with your boss and all the other mechanisms in place at your company to make your work visible. Unfortunately, as rightly pointed out by <a href="https://defmacro.substack.com/p/how-to-get-promoted">Slava Akhmechet</a>, a product manager at Stripe, they’re too often <strong>“social fiction”</strong>:</p><blockquote><em>Following the overt mechanisms of advancement is neither sufficient nor necessary. It may even be actively harmful - almost everyone who does great work and takes performance reviews seriously toils in relative obscurity. Look at the people who occupy positions of considerable authority in your organisation. Did any of them get there by following some middle manager's feedback?</em></blockquote><p>Instead of social fiction, I think the word “game” is more appropriate for the advancement system in most companies (and any human interactions by the way). Since I’m pretty sure you’ve spent countless hours like me playing video games (or still do 🎮), how do you win at video games? <strong>You game the system</strong>.</p><h3 id="understand-the-promotion-process-at-your-company"><strong>Understand the promotion process at your company</strong></h3><p>If you’re currently an engineering manager, any promotion from now on will make you part of your company’s leadership team. And, as pointed out by <a href="https://lethain.com/being-visible/">Will Larson</a>, “<em>existing members of that team want to be comfortable that they’re expanding their ranks with folks they believe in, and they can’t believe in you if they don’t know you.</em>”</p><figure><img src="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/10/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-1.png 600w, https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/10/image-1.png 1240w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>FangXianUo/iStock</figcaption></figure><p>As an engineering manager, you’re not contributing anymore to the codebase. You’re<strong> contributing to the company’s success</strong>. Managing your team is the means to get there, not the goal. More specifically, an engineering manager contributes to the company’s success by:</p><p><strong>1/ Attracting and retaining the very best engineers</strong>: like <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/">Joel Spolsky</a>, I firmly believe that an organisation “<em>where the best software developers in the world would want to work [leads] to profits as naturally as chocolate leads to chubbiness.</em>” So even if there is a process in place to attract engineers, everyone in the company will thank you if you managed to score a high-profile recruit (while saving thousands in headhunter’s fees). Some tips for doing so:</p><ul><li><strong>Be recognised externally as an expert</strong> and someone great engineers would want to work with (blogging, speaking…)</li><li><strong>Continuously look for talent</strong>, especially visible ones (the ones who blog, speak, live code, contribute to open source…) and invite them for informal interviews</li><li><strong>Mentor external engineers</strong> pro-bono, even if they don’t end working for you, they sometimes have friends who might</li></ul><p><strong>2/ Shipping revenue-generating projects</strong>: for any company out there, technology is just the means to make more money. So which projects in your company right now have the highest revenue-generating potential? There are usually three or four such projects per year, so you need to make sure your team is involved in these projects, even if it means <strong>being proactive about it and not waiting for your manager to assign it to you</strong>. When I was an employee, I used to regularly crash meetings (or discussions at the coffee counter) and see if I could be useful to a project.</p><p><strong>3/ Proactively solving problems:</strong> I’m sure you’re the kind of person who always presents problems with a solution. What’s even better is for you to <strong>start solving the problem before your boss is even aware of it</strong>. CTOs have to make countless decisions every day, and they need to know they can count on leaders in their team to be proactive and make the right decisions for them. Obviously, this action shouldn't say hidden and you would have sent a message to the leadership with information about the problem, what your team is doing to solve it and a deadline.</p><h3 id="building-your-promotion-playbook">Building your promotion playbook</h3><p>When I was advising startups on fundraising, most of the work we were doing was building up a great story that would unroll during the roadshow (3 to 6 months). Getting promoted is not the same as fundraising, but the mechanism is similar:</p><p><strong>1/ Make your intentions known</strong>: promotion is a two-way street, and your management should be aware of your objectives, as well as you should be aware of what they’re expecting from someone who does your targeted job. Ideally, they should state clearly what you should be demonstrating to get the job so that you can show you’ve done it when the time is right.</p><p><strong>2/ Keep a log of your achievements and impact:</strong> start a <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/">brag document</a> or a <a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/promo-packets">promotion packet</a> that will be the base for any communication about your team’s accomplishments (especially the ones on high-impact projects).</p><p><strong>3/ Make it impossible for them to say no</strong>: when it’s promotion or review time, build a short presentation that shows factually how you achieved what the management expected of you and your team’s successes.</p><p>Keep in mind that <strong>the higher you go on the management ladder, the fewer positions are available</strong>. Sometimes you might want to make a lateral move at a smaller company to build up more responsibilities (like becoming CTO or VPE at a startup) before going back to a more mature company.</p><p>Last but not least, it’s essential to understand that while thinking about your next promotion should not be your main focus, <strong>it is part of your job</strong>. There are still way too many opportunistic leaders in technology organisations and not enough people like you. So please do me a favour, keep doing a great job AND get that promotion instead of all the opportunistic contenders 😉</p><hr><h3 id="news"><strong>News</strong></h3><p><em>This section is only available to email subscribers. <a href="https://www.tlt21.com/signup/">Sign up</a>, it's free!</em></p><hr><h3 id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h3><ul><li>Thinking about getting promoted gives you perspective and makes you more in control of your career</li><li>Those who get promoted are not the best employees, but the more visible</li><li>To be more visible: attract high-level engineers, ship revenue-generating projects, proactively solve problems</li><li>Getting promoted is a 6-month process that resembles a fundraising roadshow</li></ul><h3 id="reading-list"><strong>Reading List</strong></h3><p>[RESOURCE] <a href="https://progression.monzo.com/techops"><strong>Progression at Monzo</strong></a> - Monzo</p><p>[ESSAY] <strong><a href="https://defmacro.substack.com/p/how-to-get-promoted">How to get promoted</a> </strong>- Slava Akhmechet</p><p>[ESSAY] <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-promotions/"><strong>Software Developer Promotions: Advice to Get to That Next Level</strong></a> - Gergely Orosz</p><p>[ESSAY] <a href="https://lethain.com/being-visible/"><strong>Being visible</strong></a> - Will Larson</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>A few months ago I started learning Rust, and in the process I ended up contributing to an open source project for the first time. It turned out to be a great vehicle for learning Rust, so in this post I’d like to go over what I did and why I think it was a good learning experience. In particular I want to walk through my thought process as I navigated my first open source contribution in the hopes that others who face similar challenges are encouraged to overcome them. Throughout this post I’ll also explain more about how this helped me learn Rust.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>The main impetus for deciding to learn Rust was that I had read a lot of great reviews and Rust seemed to be growing in popularity, so I thought it would be a nice addition to my tool-belt. I also use C++ in my day job and saw that Rust was trying to improve on some of the drawbacks of C++ (like easily writing safe, concurrent code), so I wanted to start investigating for myself.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was read <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">The Rust Programming Language</a> (which I highly recommend for anyone else new to Rust!). I breezed through it fairly quickly, dutifully completing all of the exercises. Once I finished, I still felt like I had the training wheels on and I wanted to learn more. I briefly thought about finding <em>another</em> guide or tutorial to go through, but luckily I realized that was a one-way ticket to <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-escape-tutorial-purgatory-as-a-new-developer-or-at-any-time-in-your-career-e3a4b2384a40/">tutorial purgatory</a>, before getting in too deep. To be clear, the book (and most language introduction texts in my opinion) was great for understanding the basics and acting as a reference as I got more experience with the language. It’s just that I wanted to get to the next level of understanding and be able to write new code from scratch (take off the training wheels). In order to do that, I needed a project to sink my teeth into and push myself towards that deeper level of understanding.</p>

<p>In general at this point I could have done one of two things: start my own project or help with someone else’s project. I spent a decent amount of time trying to think of an exciting project, but I didn’t have any great ideas off the top of my head. Plus I had already accumulated plenty of small, unfinished toy projects on Github, so I started investigating the open source route. That way I would get clear instructions on what needed to get done and I could simply focus on improving my Rust abilities.</p>

<p>This wasn’t the first time I’ve thought about contributing to open source. I’ve had a desire to start contributing to open source software ever since college, but I never felt like I was good enough to help out. It was a clear case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">imposter syndrome</a>. I imagine there are many other developers who have run into this feeling. Certainly it’s much more common in an interview but the idea here is the same. There’s no fool proof way of shaking off imposter syndrome, but the fact that I didn’t personally know any of the project maintainers helped me at least decide to give it a shot!</p>

<p>Once I stopped focusing on all the things that could go wrong for a second, I started to realize how beneficial contributing to an open source project could be in my quest to learn Rust. There are multiple experienced developers reviewing your code who know way more about the language and tools you are using so they can quickly explain important concepts you might not understand or even know about. You get the chance to have discussions with people all over the world who have their own ideas for a solution. I think anywhere you can find a cross-pollination of ideas like this is a great place to learn. The trick is to not be afraid to admit you don’t know something, or that your idea is wrong. By no means is it easy to do this, but once you do it is quite liberating!</p>

<h2 id="clippy">Clippy</h2>

<p>The next step was to find a project to contribute to. After googling a couple variations of “rust open source projects for beginners”, I found <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">Clippy</a>. The best summary comes from their Github: “A collection of lints to catch common mistakes and improve your Rust code”. I am always a fan of developer productivity and encouraging good coding standards, so this project seemed perfect! Part of the reason I picked this project is because the maintainers do a great job of labeling issues that are easier with ‘good first issue’ so that I could quickly find potential issues to solve. I recommend finding a project like this as it makes the initial experience with open source much smoother. Being able to choose from multiple issues that were better suited for beginners reduced the overwhelming feeling of being new. I still had to do plenty of work to acclimate myself with the new code base and the issue I was trying to solve, but I was able to proceed knowing that I was not out of my league.</p>

<p>I ended up volunteering to add a new lint for the use of <code>.nth(0)</code> on any iterator. I’ll post a link to the issue at the end of this post, but the basic idea is that Rust developers should call <code>.next()</code> on the iterator instead of <code>.nth(0)</code> (if you’re curious, check out the docs for <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.nth">nth</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#tymethod.next">next</a> to see why this is desired). It was my job to make Clippy output a helpful suggestion anytime this situation is found. I forked and cloned the repository, and then spent some time building the code and running the tests. I think this is important to do, especially in a new language, so that you can get familiar with the build system first and focus on implementing your solution after. Another reason Clippy was a nice place to start was there are hundreds of lints and therefore hundreds of other examples of what I had to do. I searched for examples of similar lints to the one I was implementing so I could start to understand which parts of the code I needed to change. After a while I was able to cobble together some changes, but I was pretty confident they were not correct. I was stuck and didn’t really know what to do. I returned to the Clippy Github page to see if I could find any useful information and found this in <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First: if you’re unsure or afraid of <strong>anything</strong>, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyway. You won’t be yelled at for giving it your best effort. The worst that can happen is that you’ll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate any sort of contributions, and don’t want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They know this is going to happen, and they welcome the pull requests anyway. Clearly my best course of action was to push it up, admit I’m stuck, and ask for help. It felt weird pushing up code I know did not work, but the reason I chose to do this in the first place was to learn so I pushed up the branch and asked for a review.</p>

<h3 id="feedback">Feedback</h3>

<p>As I suspected, there were more than a few problems with my initial implementation, but that’s okay! I received encouraging and helpful feedback from multiple users. I learned new macros in Rust like <a href="https://docs.rs/if_chain/1.0.0/if_chain/">if_chain</a>, and was guided towards more helpful examples in the code related to what I needed to do. After a bit more back and forth, my pull request was merged! It was a great feeling knowing that I contributed at least in a small way to software that is used by thousands of developers every day!</p>

<p>I think it’s important to make a special note about the initial round of feedback I received. It wasn’t condescending or mean, even though I missed some things that by now have become second nature to the maintainers. I received simple, encouraging, and timely feedback that allowed me to quickly make changes and not feel bad about getting it wrong the first time. If the feedback is too complex, disrespectful, or takes forever there’s a good chance I wouldn’t want to contribute to the project again. What’s worse, I may write off contributing to open source altogether! Creating a welcoming environment for new contributors is key to establishing a thriving open source project.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>So, what did I learn about Rust after this whole experience? Well, there’s still so much to learn but after reading <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">The Rust Programming Language</a> I was particularly intrigued by Rust’s idea of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html">ownership</a>. I was immediately able to make a connection to my professional work in C++, particularly with regards to <a href="https://www.internalpointers.com/post/c-rvalue-references-and-move-semantics-beginners">move semantics and rvalue references</a>. Rust makes it very explicit who can read and modify data, and the compiler will yell at you if you break the rules. These rules help prevent multiple threads from modifying the same piece of data at the same time, also known as a data race. C++’s rules around data ownership and mutability are less strict, so the compiler cannot protect you from data races as much as it can in Rust. Just by writing Rust code for Clippy and being exposed to the rules that the Rust compiler enforces made me a better C++ programmer in this aspect. Now I am explicitly thinking about ownership and mutability when I write C++ code even though there are no rules forcing me to do so.</p>

<p>Other concepts I found interesting were <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-00-enums.html">pattern matching</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html">recoverable errors</a>, which I had no experience with before. Contributing to Clippy gave me valuable experience dealing with these ideas and helped solidify my understanding. These features of the language, among others, were my first significant exposure to functional programming language concepts. Having come from an almost exclusively procedural background, it was interesting to see the two worlds collide. I was excited to have discovered something new, and I look forward to learning more about functional programming languages in the future as well!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>To wrap things up I want to reiterate some key lessons I learned from contributing to an open source project for the first time. I think it’s really important to find the right project and have a positive mindset when trying to jump into the open source world. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Find a project that has a label for beginners, such as ‘good first issue’. These labels reduce the burden of finding an issue to choose, which can be overwhelming on large projects.</li>
  <li>Take a look at some of the …</li></ul></article></div>

<p>There are 2 things I have come to believe about writing:</p>



<ol><li><strong>The average person should write 5x more things than they do.</strong></li><li><strong>The average written thing should be 5x shorter than it is.</strong></li></ol>



<p>That’s what I mean by “write 5x more but write 5x less.” Write more often, but make each thing you write shorter. </p>



<p>I don’t care what it is. Blog posts. Novels. Google docs. Articles. Wiki pages. Write more of them, but make them shorter. </p>



<p>Why write more often? </p>



<ul><li>Because writing helps thinking. </li><li>Because practice will make you better. </li><li>Because writing is more shareable than speaking.</li><li>Because humans are worse than computers at storing knowledge.</li><li>Because writing your old thoughts frees your brain to think of new thoughts.</li></ul>



<p>Why make them shorter?</p>



<ul><li>Because the shorter it is, the more people will read it.</li><li>Because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a>: 80% of the value is in 20% of the length (hence “5x shorter”).</li></ul>



<p>So write more, but write less.</p>

	<p>I’m pleased to share the news that Altinity has raised a $4M seed investment from Accel. Dan Levine led the round. We are honored by Accel’s trust and delighted to work with Dan. We plan to use the investment to roll out our new <a href="https://altinity.com/cloud/">Altinity.Cloud platform</a> and to strengthen <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/">ClickHouse </a>into the best analytic database on the planet.&nbsp;</p><p>Dan was the first venture capitalist to contact us, as he tells in his <a href="http://www.accel.com/noteworthy/our-seed-in-altinity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog article about the seed investment</a>. He was enthusiastic but also very patient.That was fortunate, because we then talked to 43 other VCs at greater or lesser length over the next year and a half. The count omits those who greeted our overtures with stony silence. In the end we were absolutely confident Dan and Accel were the right choice. At the same time, we learned from many others.</p><p>Looking back, it is apparent we did more than just collect a check from a great investment team. We also learned a number of valuable lessons about early stage venture investment.&nbsp; Many of these were not obvious, at least to me. In this article I will share what we learned, along with a spreadsheet we developed to help with investment math. I hope our account will be useful — or at least entertaining!</p><p><h2 id="h-what-do-vcs-really-want">What do VCs really want?</h2>
</p><p>VC websites often sport brave slogans like “we are looking for bold entrepreneurs who will change the world.” What they are actually looking for, of course, is far more concrete: a big return on a speculative bet about a new business. The first thing we learned was how venture capital actually works and how we fit in.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s start with where the money comes from and how it is managed. Venture capital firms operate one or more funds, which they use to make investments. Each venture capital firm has general partners who work for the company, decide where to invest, and take care of serving on boards and other duties required to supervise each investment.&nbsp; There is also another type of partner, known as a limited partner or LP. LPs can be wealthy individuals, pension funds, sovereign investment funds, you name it. They supply cash but have no role in making investment decisions. Here is a picture.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="954" height="368" src="https://altinity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/What-we-learned-from-accel-blog-investment-fund-picture.png" alt="" srcset="https://altinity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/What-we-learned-from-accel-blog-investment-fund-picture.png 954w, https://altinity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/What-we-learned-from-accel-blog-investment-fund-picture-300x116.png 300w, https://altinity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/What-we-learned-from-accel-blog-investment-fund-picture-768x296.png 768w, https://altinity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/What-we-learned-from-accel-blog-investment-fund-picture-600x231.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 954px) 100vw, 954px" data-lazy-srcset="https://altinity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/What-we-learned-from-accel-blog-investment-fund-picture.png 954w, https://altinity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/What-we-learned-from-accel-blog-investment-fund-picture-300x116.png 300w, https://altinity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/What-we-learned-from-accel-blog-investment-fund-picture-768x296.png 768w, https://altinity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/What-we-learned-from-accel-blog-investment-fund-picture-600x231.png 600w" data-lazy-src="https://altinity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/What-we-learned-from-accel-blog-investment-fund-picture.png?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
</div><p>In the first meeting with a new VC you typically hear about the current funds, how big they are, and other details like reserves for follow-on investments in promising companies. When you ask what payback they are seeking the most frequent answer is “return the fund.” This is so common that I stopped writing it down unless the answer was something different. It means the investment in your company needs to pay out at the value of the entire fund, not just what the VC put into your company. The reason has to do with the mechanics of the funds.</p><p>Most startups fail or return money that does not come close to covering the investment. To provide a decent return to limited partners and VC general partners plus pay overhead, at least a couple of investments need to hit home runs and to pay off at full value of the fund. It’s basic math, but the numbers are big. Say a $400M fund invests $40M total for a 25% share of your startup, a typical target percentage. To return the fund means that the startup will have to exit for $1.6B ($400M = $1.6B * 25%). Grand slams like <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/these-were-the-biggest-winners-in-snowflakes-record-busting-ipo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snowflake</a> return far more and make the fund very successful.&nbsp;</p><p>At first it was disconcerting when A-list VC prospects baldly asked how we would get them an exit in the $1B+ range. Over time I developed empathy for this attitude. VC general partners have to make the math work or find another job. Meanwhile entrepreneurs need to have a problem that fits the pattern of investment or venture funding does not make a lot of sense. That’s the economic reality and has little to do with how individual VCs feel about you personally, or even about your business.&nbsp;</p><p>We needed to articulate to ourselves how we would win in a large market–SQL data warehouses–filled with a lot of savvy competitors like Amazon and Snowflake. The classic strategy is to create a <em><span>new</span> </em>market that did not previously exist, then become the leader. Anurag Gupta and his colleagues at Amazon put it brilliantly <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2723372.2742795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a paper on Amazon Redshift</a>:&nbsp;</p><p><em>Our goal with Amazon Redshift was not to compete with other data warehousing engines, but to compete with non-consumption.&nbsp;</em></p><p>The unique differentiation of ClickHouse is that it is open source and runs anywhere: from public clouds down to Android phones. Any developer on the planet can download it and add high performance analytics to any application without sacrificing portability or scaling. That’s an enormous expansion of the market that will fuel innovation not just at the database level but will extend to new applications of big data as well as the tools and platforms to run them.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s another key insight: it took months to be able to state that value proposition in three sentences. It’s like learning a new language — anyone can learn to say hello but achieving fluency requires real work.&nbsp;</p><p>We did a lot of modeling to understand the growth trajectory needed to achieve the kind of revenue our predecessors are making. One of the conclusions was that we needed to build a great cloud platform for ClickHouse. It’s a tried-and-true way to build a successful business, especially for companies that manage data, and one that our customers have confirmed as a fruitful path to growth. We believe in the plan and it matches venture capital economics.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 id="h-vcs-work-off-a-thesis">VCs Work Off a Thesis</h2>
</p><p>I didn’t know a lot of early stage VCs when we began fund-raising, though like everyone I heard they were fine human beings worthy of acquaintance. The initial conversations were illuminating in one particular respect. Venture capitalists don’t necessarily know that much about specific technology or markets.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an example. My favorite demo for ClickHouse is the <a href="https://youtu.be/zDIK3Ej86GU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ClickHouse-fast demo</a> where I first run a query on data generated purely in memory followed by a similar query that accesses 1.3 billion rows of taxi data in slowish network-attached storage. I usually pause dramatically after the in-memory query to ask which query is going to be faster. Everybody knows access to memory is faster than storage, right?</p><p>Actually, in this demo it’s not. You have to be very careful to make an apples-to-apples comparison when comparing memory and storage access speeds. ClickHouse compresses stored data and parallelizes I/O extremely well. Reading from storage is therefore very fast. With ClickHouse it is not hard to choose in-memory queries that look similar but run far slower because they have a different execution path with less parallelization or other inefficiencies. It’s a subtle point that experienced database people understand, whereas VCs I talked to often got it wrong. (And then argued about it, too.)&nbsp;</p><p>This experience illustrates that deep dives on technology are not always the best way to evaluate early stage businesses. Good VCs tend to look for proxies that indicate signs of traction. In our case Dan Levine knew about ClickHouse because his other start-up investments used it. Dan pays really close attention to things they like. Dan picked up on ClickHouse earlier and more clearly than anyone we spoke to. The fact that we were an experienced team already selling services profitably was perhaps another useful signal. But Dan was also looking for more than just specific signals–he was looking for a pattern related to data, backed by a solid team.&nbsp;</p><p>Over time, we found that the VCs who really picked up on our story had a thesis about the value of combining two things:&nbsp;</p><div><ul>
<li>Data – Faster and more cost effective ways of analyzing large datasets are inherently valuable to enterprises.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Open source – There are standard models for marketing and monetizing open source projects to build very large businesses</li>
</ul>
</div><p>VCs with these convictions tended to like what we were doing overall, though they often found specific things they didn’t like: open source community too small, too much competition, not the right team, already made a competing investment, etc. That said, we didn’t argue about the size of the market or whether open source was the right overall strategy to reach it.&nbsp;It helped that the original developers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClickHouse">ClickHouse at Yandex</a> did an amazing job of open sourcing the code and starting a great community around it. </p><p>Not surprisingly, we learned that those same investors were precisely the people we wanted backing the company. Not only did we share key assumptions about the business, but they had funded such businesses before with successful outcomes. Because of that they could offer useful advice on big topics like strategy to build open source communities or workable business models.&nbsp; They could also connect us with outstanding people like Mike Olson of Cloudera (and many others) who had worked through similar problems and could help us see around corners.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s a final insight that relates back to the technology point I made above. VCs can identify promising companies, but they can’t tell you how to run yours. As an entrepreneur you understand the technology, your customers, and what is feasible to achieve. We had a number of debates with potential investors about details of the business plan.</p><p>For example, many VCs favor pure cloud services, because the best ones experience explosive growth and high margins. However, a push-button service is not a complete solution, especially for complex enterprise products like databases. Altinity has been in business since 2017 and we have articulate users who say they want us to take care of running ClickHouse in the cloud. They also want application tools, new server features, training, support, and implementation help. Their problem is not just to deploy a database but to create applications that add value to their own business. If you help them do that you have a much more competitive business.&nbsp;</p><p>Our mission is to help any enterprise that uses ClickHouse. We provide everything customers need to be successful with ClickHouse, <em>including</em> a great cloud service. We also support the ClickHouse …</p></div></div>

			<p>The ECB, as guardian of the euro, provides currency in two forms: we issue banknotes and we transfer electronic deposits to banks and other financial institutions.</p>
			<p>Digitalisation has spread to every corner of our lives and transformed how we pay. In this new era, a digital euro would guarantee that citizens in the euro area can maintain free access to a simple, universally accepted, safe and trusted means of payment. A digital euro is not meant to replace cash, but rather to complement it. Together, they give people more choices about how to pay, and make it easier for them to do so,  increasing financial inclusion. </p>

			<p>The Eurosystem will continue to ensure that all citizens have access to euro banknotes and coins across the euro area.</p>

				<p>A digital euro would make your daily payments faster, easier and more secure.
						It could support the digitalisation of the European economy and actively encourage innovation in retail payments.

It could also be crucial if people were to turn to foreign digital means of payment, which might undermine financial stability and monetary sovereignty in the euro area.

			<h3>When will it be ready?</h3>
			<p>During the preparation phase, we are working on the concept, starting practical experimentation on possible designs, and discussing with stakeholders and international partners.
					Towards the middle of 2021 we will decide whether to launch a digital euro project. This will be followed by an investigation phase on user requirements and service providers.
								
			</p>
			<p>It would take time to develop a safe, accessible and efficient digital currency. We will ensure that the systems we use to pay keep up with the needs of the people who use them.   </p>

				<h3>Why would a digital euro not be a crypto-asset?</h3>
				<p>Crypto-assets are fundamentally different from central bank money: their prices are volatile because they lack any intrinsic value and there is no reliable institution backing them. 
				</p>
			<p>People using a digital euro would have the same level of confidence as with cash, since they are both backed by a central bank, which is something crypto-assets such as stablecoins cannot provide.  </p>

		 <p>Like the euro we already use every day, the design of a digital euro should meet the needs of a broad range of users. Any assessment must therefore take into account all of its implications, for instance for monetary policy and financial stability.

<p>As part of my work on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://agave.com/" target="_blank">Agave</a>, I needed to find a way to render a virtual office in a web application. I also needed the ability to maintain a high engineering velocity and get high leverage out of the libraries we chose.</p>



<p>So far, the biggest learning experience for me has been isometric rendering. You know isometric rendering. It’s that sort of 2.5-dimension look that some video games have, where you’re sort of looking down from the top right on the map. Some examples:</p>

<p>Perhaps the most appropriate modern example is the intro scene to HBO’s Silicon Valley:</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="660" height="372" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7m2j_0ivw2I?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>From the start, we had a vision of a virtual office in this style. It would be significantly more immersive than a flat (two-dimensional) map, and afforded the opportunity for some seriously cool experiences. (Plus, Jared and I both loved playing these games when we were kids.)</p>



<p>This was a daunting task, as I had no experience in video game design or programming. I ended up watching a ton of different YouTube videos on the topic in an effort to find my way. I didn’t really even know what I was looking for – it was sort of an immersive, random process.</p>



<p>I have been a longtime fan of Id software, Doom in particular, and have followed John Carmack for a long time. So, naturally I ordered a copy of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1099819776/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" target="_blank">The Game Engine Black Book: Doom</a> and read it cover to cover in three days. I learned a lot!</p>



<p>I was most interested in how the engine worked and, in particular, rendering:</p>

<p>I finally figured out that what we were looking for was called <strong>isometric</strong> rendering. Here’s what I learned.</p>



<h2>Cartesian vs. Isometric</h2>



<p>On a 2d game, there is simply a cartesian map. It has x and y coordinates. If you were to lay out the old-school board game <strong>Risk</strong> onto its cartesian map, it would look something like this:</p>

<p>Conventionally the top left cell is 0,0 (the origin). So, where I live in South Lake Tahoe would be somewhere inside 5,5, or maybe 6,5. </p>



<p>Cartesian grids are trivial to store in memory as two dimensional arrays. And, even in games like Sim City, all of the units, characters, items, really anything on the map has a coordinate in the Cartesian plane. So to store the data for our virtual office, we’d need a simple two dimensional array that indicates where each avatar, furniture, etc all exist in the office.</p>



<p>Next, we needed artwork for everything. We started with floor tiles. Here’s an example of the sprite we used:</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1441" data-permalink="https://davepaola.com/2020/10/02/what-ive-learned-about-isometric-rendering/floor-tile2/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/davepaola.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/floor-tile2.png?fit=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="50,30" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="floor-tile2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/davepaola.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/floor-tile2.png?fit=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/davepaola.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/floor-tile2.png?fit=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="50" height="30" src="https://i0.wp.com/davepaola.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/floor-tile2.png?resize=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>







<p>As you can see, this is not a square. It’s a square tile as seen from the top-right. It’s also not technically a <strong>perspective</strong> sprite because the lines do not converge to the horizon – they remain parallel. It’s an <strong>isometric</strong> sprite. To make things more confusing, the image file itself is a rectangular, transparent PNG. Here’s a closer look:</p>

<p>And, it turns out, the tile itself has a height of 5 pixels, meaning the “top” of the tile is 50×25. It’s half as tall as it is wide.</p>



<p>After some fiddling I had produced the following map by rendering each tile individually (in a loop) in order from “top left” to “bottom right”:</p>

<p>It got confusing quickly. The “top left” when looked at isometrically is actually in the top of the screen, slightly to the right of center!</p>



<p>So I needed to figure out how to place avatars and other items onto the map from my cartesian grid. The brown-haired avatar on the left is “at” location 5,12. I had to figure out how to convert from cartesian to isometric so that I could tell the game engine precisely where to render the avatar.</p>



<p>If we were just rendering on a Cartesian plane, I could simply tell the engine to render an item at 2,2 by multiplying by the width of one tile in the grid:</p>



<pre><code>screen_x_coord = cartesian_x * tile_width
screen_y_coord = cartesian_y * tile_height</code></pre>



<p>However, this only works with a square grid. Our isometric grid is not exactly a square. This illustrates the problem better than I can explain:</p>

<p>Thinking this through: for every 1 cell “right” we want to go, we’re actually going “right” by 1/2 a tile <em>width</em> and “down” by 1/2 a tile <em>height</em>. Like this:</p>

<p>So, we have a new formula:</p>



<pre><code>screen_x_coord = cartesian_x * (tile_width / 2) - cartesian_y * (tile_width / 2)
screen_y_coord = cartesian_y * (tile_height / 2) + cartesian_x * (tile_height / 2)</code></pre>



<p>Plugging these values in gives the right map location and everything looked great.</p>

<p>The other thing I wanted was the ability to click somewhere on the map and move your avatar to that location. This meant I had to detect the x,y coordinates on the screen that the mouse clicked, reverse the above conversion from isometric to cartesian, move the avatar in the 2d arrays and then re-render them isometrically. </p>



<p>Whew! Lots of steps to simply render an item at a specific set of coordinates. </p>



<p>Another wrinkle that I ran into was that rendering a sprite “at” a location is not very well defined. If I’m trying to render a square image at a particular cell, by default many game engines place the top left of the image at the defined location. That won’t work for us since we need our characters to be “standing” in a particular cell. So much of our rendering code actually does even more arithmetic by adjusting the coordinates according to the width and height of the sprite such that the bottom-center of the image (where the character’s feet are) become the “anchor” point and we render the item “at” a coordinate by place it’s bottom-center in the defined coordinates:</p>

<p>There were lots of other challenges along the way, including representing the whole thing as a grid, determining which sections of the map are “walkable” so that we can use a pathfinding algorithm, finding the right “pace” a character walks across the map, and more. And I’m just scratching the surface on the types of challenges – I haven’t even mentioned our proximity video conversations that enable magical serendipitous moments, the interactive relic system we’ve devised, native operating system components and much more.</p>

<p>To sum it up: I learned a lot in this process and continue to learn more every day. Agave is truly a cross-disciplinary project – it requires more than simply building features to a spec. Blending the engineering of game engines with the art of sprite design (and even interior design!) has been a super cool thing to be a part of. I can’t wait to show it to you.</p>

</section><h2 id="what-is-a-portfolio">What is a portfolio?</h2><p>The term portfolio refers to the combination of assets such as stocks, bonds, or cash. The monetary value of each asset drives the risk/reward ratio of the entire portfolio. As a portfolio manager, your job is twofold:</p><ul><li>Picking assets: decide which assets you will be part of your portfolio</li><li>Allocate capital: decide on how much capital you will allocate to each asset</li></ul><p>Your job is to maximize the expected return and cut the risk of your portfolio. It is a multi-objective optimization problem: many efficient solutions are available and the preferred solution is selected by considering a trade-off between risk and return.</p><p>Thus an optimal portfolio is not the set of securities with the highest expected returns, or lowest risk.</p><p>Imagine that you have $100k and suppose you already selected a portfolio of 30 assets. How would you build your portfolio? i.e. how would you distribute you cash in the different assets?</p><p>A simple, yet not optimized, solution would be an equally weighted portfolio. </p><h2 id="portfolio-selection">Portfolio selection</h2><p>Harry Markowitz was awarded a Nobel Prize in Economics for its Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) he introduced in his 1952 paper "Portfolio Selection".</p><p>MPT forms the foundation for all subsequent theories on how risk is quantified. It still influence the way we invest today.</p><p>MPT assumes investors are risk-averse MPT assumes investors are risk-averse (for a given level of return, investors favor a less risky portfolio). Therefore it helps investors allocate capital and construct a portfolio that maximizes expected returns while exposing themselves to a sustainable level of risk. Indeed, investment's risk and return characteristics should not be viewed alone, but evaluated by how the investment affects the overall portfolio.</p><p>MPT assumes the capital markets are perfect (no transaction costs, no taxes, same level of available information for every market participant, perfect competition in the market). It also assumes that the returns from the portfolios are normally distributed (allows to use the mean and the variance). <strong>Of course none of these hypothesis is true. MPT is an approximation of reality.</strong></p><h2 id="risk-return-trade-off">Risk-return trade-off</h2><p>Risk-return trade-off is one of the basic concepts of Modern Portfolio Theory. An optimal portfolio does not include securities with the highest potential returns or with the lowest risk. It is a thin balance between the two: a mix of (i) securities with the greatest potential returns and of (ii) securities with the lowest degree of risk.</p><p>To illustrate let's consider 3 fictive assets (A, B and C) with different expected returns and volatility:</p><figure><img src="https://thenextwave.blog/content/images/2020/09/risk-return_tradeoff_example-2.png" alt="Example of risk-return tradeoff between three fictive assets" srcset="https://thenextwave.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/risk-return_tradeoff_example-2.png 600w, https://thenextwave.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/risk-return_tradeoff_example-2.png 1000w, https://thenextwave.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/risk-return_tradeoff_example-2.png 1600w, https://thenextwave.blog/content/images/2020/09/risk-return_tradeoff_example-2.png 2362w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Expected returns as a function of volatility for three fictive assets</figcaption></figure><p>Assets A and C have the same volatility, while assets B and C have the same returns. <strong>If you were to choose between A and C you would go for A as it offers better returns at the same level of risk. And if you were to choose between B and C you would go for B as it has a lower volatility for the same returns.</strong></p><p><strong>However what would you do if you were to choose between A and B? Or a composition of the three?</strong></p><p>This is the kind of question Markowitz tried to answer in 1952. <strong>The best option is not to take one and not the other, but often a composition of the two.</strong> The same applies for many (10, 100 or even 1000) assets.</p><h2 id="an-illustration-with-two-fictive-assets">An illustration with two fictive assets</h2><p>Let's consider the case of two assets, where you have to decide how much you want to invest in assets A and B.</p><p>What are the expected returns and volatility of a portfolio containing the two assets? A linear combination of the two? Not necessarily. The values are a function of the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corr%C3%A9lation_(statistiques)">correlation</a> between the returns of the assets.</p><figure><img src="https://thenextwave.blog/content/images/2020/09/risk-return_tradeoff_two_assets-5.png" alt="Portfolio allocation between two fictive assets given a certain correlation between returns series" srcset="https://thenextwave.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/risk-return_tradeoff_two_assets-5.png 600w, https://thenextwave.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/risk-return_tradeoff_two_assets-5.png 1000w, https://thenextwave.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/risk-return_tradeoff_two_assets-5.png 1600w, https://thenextwave.blog/content/images/2020/09/risk-return_tradeoff_two_assets-5.png 2362w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Possible values (dashed line) of a portfolio given a certain correlation between two assets (red points) returns series.</figcaption></figure><p>Correlation is determinant in Markowitz theory. The more correlated the assets, the less you benefit from diversification. A portfolio's returns of correlated assets (correlation = 1) is a linear combination of its assets (top left figure). Whereas with a perfect negative correlation (correlation = -1) we could diversify all risk away.</p><p>Of course this reduction of volatility always comes at a price: you reduce your returns (hence the name: risk-return <em>tradeoff</em>). Where does the optimum portfolio stands? Well it depends on you and the level of risk you are ready to take.</p><p>Let's take a specific example:</p><figure><img src="https://thenextwave.blog/content/images/2020/09/risk-return_tradeoff_portfolios-3.png" alt="Possible portfolio with two correlated fictive assets" srcset="https://thenextwave.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/risk-return_tradeoff_portfolios-3.png 600w, https://thenextwave.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/risk-return_tradeoff_portfolios-3.png 1000w, https://thenextwave.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/risk-return_tradeoff_portfolios-3.png 1600w, https://thenextwave.blog/content/images/2020/09/risk-return_tradeoff_portfolios-3.png 2362w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Gradient of possible portfolios: from {100% Asset A, 0% Asset B} (light blue) to {0% Asset A, 100% Asset B} (dark blue).</figcaption></figure><p>Notice the smallest volatility stands at about 20% expected returns (for a portfolio of about 25% of A and 75% of B). However an investor ready to take more risk (say 25% volatility) would have a portfolio of &nbsp;75% of A and 25% of B.</p><p><strong>This technique helps you decide on a portfolio allocation given a maximum level of risk you are willing to take.</strong></p><p>Next week we will look at real life examples, with portfolio of 2 and more assets.</p><hr><p>Further readings:</p><ul><li>More on <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskreturntradeoff.asp">risk-return tradeoff</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory">Modern Portfolio Theory</a></li><li><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11403-020-00288-0">My paper</a> where I use MPT to reverse engineer how institutional investors construct their portfolio under constraints</li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MBe7PNfmvAw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission recently announced $18M in fines that BMW and two of their subsidiaries must pay for having provided misleading and inaccurate retail sales information to their investors.</p><p>The SEC report reads:</p><blockquote><p>According to the SEC’s order, from 2015 to 2019, BMW inflated its reported retail sales in the U.S., which helped BMW close the gap between its actual retail sales volume and internal targets and publicly maintain a leading retail sales position relative to other premium automotive companies. The order finds that BMW of North America LLC (BMW NA) maintained a reserve of unreported retail vehicle sales — referred to internally as the “bank” — that it used to meet internal monthly sales targets without regard to when the underlying sales occurred. The order also finds that BMW NA paid dealers to inaccurately designate vehicles as demonstrators or loaners so that BMW would count them as having been sold to customers when they had not been. Additionally, the order finds that BMW NA improperly adjusted its retail sales reporting calendar in 2015 and 2017 to meet internal sales targets or bank excess retail sales for future use. As a result, according to the order, the information that BMW provided to investors in the bond offerings by BMW’s U.S. financing subsidiary, BMW US Capital LLC, and to credit rating agencies contained material misstatements and omissions regarding BMW’s U.S. retail vehicle sales.</p><cite><a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-223</a></cite></blockquote><p>After having spent 43 years in the car business (many of which with BMW North America), I can unequivocally say these practices are routine and commonplace within car dealerships. Fraudulent behavior like this is not limited to BMW. Every manufacturer I have ever worked for encourages this.</p><p>When I worked for Penske Automotive Group we were explicitly instructed not to fudge any numbers. If our BMW rep asked us to “pad the numbers” one month, we didn’t. Penske didn’t want to participate in that type of activity. They were the exception to the rule.</p><p>As a dealer you have very little choice but to “play the game.” As I’ve talked about in other videos and guides here on the blog, car dealers don’t make much of anything when they sell vehicles. Instead, <a href="https://yourautoadvocate.com/guides/how-do-car-dealerships-make-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they make their money from factory incentives and from selling finance and insurance products</a>.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RTYnhidJMe8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>With that in mind, it’s clear why dealers “play the game.” If you have a $250,000 incentive that is based on the number of cars you sell in any given month, and the person writing you that check (BMW) is encouraging you to “fake” sales so that you can actually attain the bonus, what would you do? The answer is simple.</p><p>Car manufacturers are happy to pay out giant monthly bonuses to subsidize their dealers, but only if they hit certain sales volume thresholds. This is because manufacturers are then able to report better than expected sales volumes to their investors.</p><p>How many fraudulently reported vehicles are “sold” in any given month? In any given month we would designate 15 Mini Coopers as “sold,” even though they hadn’t been. In that same month we may have actually sold 35 or 40 vehicles. Each month, upwards of 20% of our “sales” were fake.</p><p>It’s surprising to think that BMW was only fined $18M. Considering a nontrivial amount of their sold inventory is not actually sold, you would think the fine should be $180M instead of $18M.</p><p>Fiat Chrysler paid $40M in fines a few years ago for similar practices. Regardless of who it is, it’s clear that the fines aren’t enough to stop the fraudulent behavior.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apache OpenWhisk is a truly portable and multiplatform Serverless engine and it is available now on all the major clouds from multiple commercial vendors. Here is a Chess Engine running on:</p><ul><li><a href="https://whisk-chess.adobeioruntime.net/api/v1/web/default/chess">Adobe I/O</a></li><li><a href="https://eu-de.functions.appdomain.cloud/api/v1/web/a1d40f6b-e5e3-4f07-8f92-77b525392253/default/chess">IBM Cloud</a></li><li><a href="https://wka9bi13u3.apigw.ntruss.com/chess/chess/ZC2o7bFh0x/http">Naver</a></li><li><a href="https://apigcp.nimbella.io/api/v1/web/msciabar-zc3thebgxgh/default/chess">Nimbella</a></li></ul><p>And see below for instructions how to run it also locally and in any Kubernetes cluster, for example AWS EKS…</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/02Xezhf_j4U" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><p>Apache OpenWhisk is a Serverless Cloud Platform, developed as an open source project at the Apache Software Foundations. It is similar to Amazon Lambda, Google Functions or Azure Functions. The main difference is that it is an Open Source project, it is offered by multiple commercial vendors, and it has a rich serverless programing model for composing functions into workflows.</p><p>Many vendors today offer cloud functions based on OpenWhisk, and it runs on all the major public clouds. However not all the vendors disclose where they run their services, so I will refer to the vendor and not to the cloud that runs it. It can also be installed on any Kubernetes cluster, so you can install in any cloud, either your private cloud or the public one you prefer.</p><p>In this article I am going to show that OpenWhisk is a truly portable serverless solution, and that you can write a single serverless application and then run it on multiple vendors.</p><p>To prove my point, I wrote an open source serverless application and ran it on all the OpenWhisk vendors I got access to. I also created a custom Kubernetes cluster and installed OpenWhisk on it to run my application.</p><p>The application is a chess engine, written in the Go programming language, and that includes backend and frontend. You can use it to play chess using a web interface, while the opponent is an AI algorithm running as a serverless function in OpenWhisk.</p><p>For testing and development you can use the Standalone OpenWhisk. It is a single node installation that can run in your machine and only requires <a href="https://docker.com/"><code>Docker</code></a> to run. You also need to download the <a href="https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-cli/releases/tag/1.0.0">OpenWhisk CLI tool <code>wsk</code></a> for your operating system in order to interact with OpenWhisk.</p><p>Once prerequisites are satisfied, you can start a local OpenWhisk with the following command:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">bash &lt;(curl -sL https://s.apache.org/openwhisk.sh)
</code></pre></div><p>The command will download a Docker image for standalone OpenWhisk and it will start it. It will also open the playground, that you can use to create and run a function on the fly from your browser.</p><p><img src="https://openwhisk.blog/post/advocate/openwhisk-portable-serverless/playground-ui.png" alt="Playground"></p><p>Once you have OpenWhisk up and running you can configure the <code>wsk</code> tool to access it. OpenWhisk access is protected by a key that you have to retrieve and use to configure <code>wsk</code>, as follows:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">AUTH=$(docker exec openwhisk wsk property get --auth | awk '{ print $3}')
wsk property set --auth $AUTH --apihost http://localhost:3233
</code></pre></div><p>Now let’s build our chess engine and use the local OpenWhisk to test it locally. The source code of the chess engine <a href="https://github.com/openwhisk-blog/whisk-chess">is available on GitHub</a>.</p><p>The code is based on a freely available chess engine called <a href="https://github.com/ChizhovVadim/CounterGo/pulls">CounterGo</a>. It is written in Go. I adapted it to run as a stateless serverless action, and I added a frontend in JavaScript, using the libraries <a href="https://chessboardjs.com/">Chessboardjs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js">chess.js</a>.</p><p>In order to build the action, you need common tools like <code>git</code>, <code>make</code> and <code>docker</code>. Once you have them you can download and build the sources with the commands:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">git clone https://github.com/openwhisk-blog/whisk-chess
cd whisk-chess
make
</code></pre></div><p>Note that you do not need a Go compiler to build the action, just Docker, as you can compile the action using the OpenWhisk Go runtime itself. The result is the file <code>chess.zip</code> containing a pre-compiled Go action ready to be deployed.</p><p>Once you have the action, you use the following command to deploy it in OpenWhisk:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">wsk action update chess chess.zip --kind go:1.11 --web true
</code></pre></div><p>Finally you can retrieve the URL of the action with the command:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">wsk action get chess --url
</code></pre></div><p>If you now type the URL in a browser you will see the user interface of our chess engine, a chessboard, and you can play chess against the computer.</p><p><img src="https://openwhisk.blog/post/advocate/openwhisk-portable-serverless/chess.png" alt="Chess"></p><p>Now let’s start deploying our chess in the services of the various vendors that offer OpenWhisk.</p><p><a href="https://nimbella.com/">Nimbella</a> offers a serverless solution based on OpenWhisk and focused on providing an “awesome developer experience”.</p><p>I think it is appropriate to say that I work for Nimbella, but I am trying to be neutral in this article and offer a fair comparison of all the OpenWhisk vendors I am aware of.</p><p><img src="https://openwhisk.blog/post/advocate/openwhisk-portable-serverless/020.png" alt="Nimbella"></p><p>Nimbella uses its own CLI called <code>nim</code> for deployment. The Nimbella CLI was recently <a href="https://github.com/nimbella/nimbella-cli/">open sourced</a>. You need to sign-up and login to use their service. Once you are logged in, you can deploy our chess action and get an URL for it. The <code>nim login</code> command conveniently permits sign-up.
The CLI is available <a href="https://nimbella.io/downloads/nim/nim.html#install-the-nimbella-command-line-tool-nim">for download</a> for Mac OS, Windows and Linux.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">nim login
nim action update chess chess.zip --kind go:1.12 --web true
nim action get chess --url
</code></pre></div><p>It is possible to use the <code>wsk</code> CLI with Nimbella if one prefers it. You’ll notice the command is identical here to the one shown earlier but replaced <code>wsk</code> with <code>nim</code>.</p><p><a href="https://apigcp.nimbella.io/api/v1/web/msciabar-zc3thebgxgh/default/chess">Follow this link to play chess on Nimbella</a>.</p><p>The IBM cloud was the original cloud offering OpenWhisk as a service.</p><p><img src="https://openwhisk.blog/post/advocate/openwhisk-portable-serverless/030.png" alt="IBM"></p><p>You need to download and install the <code>ibmcloud</code> CLI in order to deploy actions to IBM. There are also some requirements like downloading a plugin and to target a space; all the steps are explained on their website.</p><p>They offer a generous free tier for running functions. You need to register on their website to use a very large number of function invocations for free.</p><p>Once you downloaded the tool, the commands to deploy the chess engine and get an URL to run the action are:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">ibmcloud login -u "$IBMUSER" -p "$IBMPASS"
ibmcloud fn action update chess chess.zip --kind go:1.11
ibmcloud fn action get chess --url
</code></pre></div><p><a href="https://eu-de.functions.appdomain.cloud/api/v1/web/a1d40f6b-e5e3-4f07-8f92-77b525392253/default/chess">Follow this link to play Chess on IBM Cloud.</a></p><p>Naver is a Korean company, owner of the main search engine in the Korean language, but also offering cloud services. The Naver Cloud Platform uses OpenWhisk to implement cloud functions.</p><p><img src="https://openwhisk.blog/post/advocate/openwhisk-portable-serverless/040.png" alt="Naver"></p><p>Currently Naver does not offer a CLI to deploy actions, however I was told a CLI is actually under development. For now I deployed the chess action using their web interface.</p><p><img src="https://openwhisk.blog/post/advocate/openwhisk-portable-serverless/041.png" alt="Naver Deploy"></p><p><a href="https://wka9bi13u3.apigw.ntruss.com/chess/chess/ZC2o7bFh0x/http">Follow this link to play Chess on Naver.</a></p><p>Adobe has a serverless offering based on OpenWhisk too. It is called the <a href="https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/runtime.html">Adobe I/O Runtime</a>.</p><p><img src="https://openwhisk.blog/post/advocate/openwhisk-portable-serverless/045.png" alt="Adobe I/O"></p><p>Adobe I/O Runtime currently supports only Node.js based runtimes, so if you pick them as your serverless function providers you have to write your serverless functions in JavaScript. However being based on OpenWhisk, it is possible to use other runtimes by request, and so we can also run our chess engine. I thank the team at Adobe for their kind support and help in deploying my action for demonstration purposes.</p><p><a href="https://whisk-chess.adobeioruntime.net/api/v1/web/default/chess">Follow this link to play Chess on Adobe I/O.</a></p><p>Finally, you can run OpenWhisk in any cluster supporting Kubernetes. For this purpose, I created an EKS cluster on AWS and installed OpenWhisk on it, then I deployed my chess application. I will show here how to do that quickly and easily.</p><p><img src="https://openwhisk.blog/post/advocate/openwhisk-portable-serverless/053.png" alt="AWS"></p><p>You will need to create and configure an AWS account. I refer you to AWS documentation for information how to do this.</p><p>Once I created an account, I installed the <a href="https://eksctl.io/"><code>eksctl</code></a> tool that makes easy to create a Kubernetes cluster on AWS.</p><p>Also you need to install the <a href="https://helm.sh/"><code>helm</code></a> deployment tool and use it to actually install OpenWhisk. You can download the helm chart from GitHub and install OpenWhisk as follows:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">git clone https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-deploy-kube
cd openwhisk-deploy-kube/helm
</code></pre></div><p>Once everything is ready your can create a Kubernetes cluster and install OpenWhisk with just 3 commands:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">eksctl create cluster --name openwhisk
eksctl create nodegroup --cluster openwhisk --node-labels openwhisk-role=invoker
helm install --set whisk.ingress.type=LoadBalancer openwhisk ./openwhisk
</code></pre></div><p>The cluster creation will take a while. Once it is completed you will get your private OpenWhisk service running in AWS, and you can deploy your chess application to it.</p><p>You can use the <code>wsk</code> or <code>nim</code> CLIs to deploy to OpenWhisk. You have to retrieve the location of the Apache OpenWhisk entry point, and the authorization key and pass them to the CLI tool. The required commands using <code>nim</code> are:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">cd whisk-chess
APIHOST=$(kubectl  get svc | awk '/openwhisk-nginx/ { print $4}')
AUTH=$(cat openwhisk/values.yaml |  awk '/guest/ { print $2}' | tr -d '"')
nim auth login --apihost http://$APIHOST --auth $AUTH
</code></pre></div><p>It is important to note that we configured an insecure setup because we are accessing OpenWhisk over the unencrypted HTTP protocol.</p><p>In a real world setup you will need additional steps to setup an HTTPS endpoint with a certificate. You will find relevant details in the <a href="https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-deploy-kube">helm chart GitHub repository</a>.</p><p>Once you retrieved the API host and authentication key, you can deploy your chess app, and get the URL.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">nim action create chess chess.zip --web true --kind go:1.11
nim action get chess --url
</code></pre></div><p>I cannot provide a URL in this case as I a destroyed the cluster after testing, however, you can see the result in the image at the beginning of the paragraph.</p></div></div>]]>

      <p>After my <a href="https://nitschinger.at/Rusty-PID-Porting-the-TSic-sensor-from-C-to-Rust">last blog post</a> on the TSIC 306 temperature sensor port to Rust, someone on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/j1g4tp/porting_the_tsic_sensor_from_c_to_rust/g720uww/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">Reddit</a> mentioned that it does not provide any guidance on how to get the code samples actually running on the chip.</p>
<p>So this post takes a step back and runs you through the basics of setting up a project, configuring it properly and finally running different examples.</p>
<p>Before we dive in I want to mention that I’m still quite new to the embedded world, so some of the information might not be accurate or misleading. If you run into issues please comment below and I’ll do my best to get them fixed.</p>
<p>Also, I noticed that especially this part of the Rust ecosystem evolves very quickly. So if you read this post some time in 2021 or later, double check the tooling and see if it has been further improved.</p>
<p>The full code can be found in <a href="https://github.com/daschl/nrf52840dk-sample">this repository</a>.</p>

<p>For this post I’m using the <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Development-Kits/nRF52840-DK">nRF52840 DK</a> which contains an Arm Cortex-M4 processor with floating point support. The development kit also contains lots of ports and features that you can use to experiment. Check out the <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/-/media/Software-and-other-downloads/Product-Briefs/nRF52840-DK-product-brief.pdf">Product Brief</a> for all details.</p>
<p>I first tried to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32">ESP32</a>, but I struggled to get it working properly because you need to use a custom LLVM fork and the tooling isn’t there yet. I picked the nRF52840, because <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/">ferrous systems</a> were running an embedded workshop using this board and they are so kind as to provide their material <a href="https://embedded-trainings.ferrous-systems.com/">free online</a>. I figured this might be the easiest way to start exploring Rust embedded, and indeed it has been pretty painless.</p>

<p>Since the initial release of the workshop material (which contained lots of custom code to run, log and flash), many of their tools have been extended and found a new home inside the <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/">knurling-rs github organization</a>. In particular, we are going to use:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/probe-run">probe-run</a>: a custom cargo runner to transparently flash and run our programs.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/defmt">defmt</a>: for easy and efficient logging back to the host.</li>
</ul>
<p>probe-run uses the <a href="https://probe.rs/">probe-rs</a> debugging toolkit underneath which is adding features and support for more targets all the time so you might be able to use a similar process as below for your own board.</p>
<p>The development kit needs to be connected to your computer via USB like shown in the picture below:</p>
<p><img src="https://nitschinger.at/img/nrf-with-usb.jpg" alt="nRF With USB"></p>
<p>It is important to use the USB port on the left and not the one at the bottom, because I think that’s the only port which contains the J-Link debugging probe (which we are going to use to flash and run our code). <a href="https://embedded-trainings.ferrous-systems.com/hardware.html#nrf52840-development-kit-dk">This</a> section in the training material describes it in greater detail.</p>

<p>Note: if you want to cut corners, you can also use the <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-quickstart">Cortex-M Template</a>. In this post we’ll start from an empty cargo project and work our way to a flashed device.</p>
<p>Let’s first start with an empty crate:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo new nrf52840dk-sample --bin
</code></pre><p>Other than just compiling our code fine with <code>rustc</code>, we also need to achieve the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>cross-compile for our embedded target. In our case this is <code>thumbv7em-none-eabihf</code>.</li>
<li>send the compiled code to our target. We’ll use <code>probe-rs</code> for this task through <code>probe-run</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To allow us to cross-compile, we need to make sure that <code>rustup</code> has the toolchain needed for our target:</p>
<pre><code>$ rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf
</code></pre><p>Since by default <code>cargo</code> will build for the host platform we are on, we instruct it through a custom <code>.cargo/config.toml</code> that we always want to build for our target platform instead:</p>
<pre><code>[build]
target = "thumbv7em-none-eabihf"
</code></pre><p>Next up, let’s work on our <code>main.rs</code>. Our embedded device does not have a full operating system installed, which means we cannot use the standard library. Also, our entry point into the program is not <code>main</code> because the usual bootstrapping infrastructure is not available.</p>
<p>These two attributes hint it to rust:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5
</span><span>6
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>#![no_main]</span>
<span>#![no_std]</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
    println<span>!</span>(<span>"Hello, world!"</span>);
}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>If we try to run this on our host, we’ll see the following:</p>
<pre><code>error: cannot find macro `println` in this scope
 --&gt; src/main.rs:5:5
  |
5 |     println!("Hello, world!");
  |     ^^^^^^^

error: `#[panic_handler]` function required, but not found

error: aborting due to 2 previous errors
error: could not compile `nrf52840dk-sample`.
To learn more, run the command again with --verbose.
</code></pre><p>This tells us two things: first, the <code>println!</code> macro is not available (this is why we are going to use <code>defmt</code> later). Second, we need a panic handler. At this point, things get a bit tricky and we need to bring in our first dependencies (in <code>Cargo.toml</code>):</p>
<pre><code>[dependencies]
cortex-m = "0.6.3"
cortex-m-rt = "0.6.12"
defmt = { git = "https://github.com/knurling-rs/defmt", branch = "main" }
defmt-rtt = { git = "https://github.com/knurling-rs/defmt", branch = "main" }
nrf52840-hal = "0.11.0"
</code></pre><p>The <code>cortex-m</code> and <code>cortex-m-rt</code> crates are our board support crates and provide the hardware abstractions we need in a minute. Since we cannot use println and friends, we include <code>defmt</code> to provide us with a decent logging infrastructure.</p>
<p>Also, to enable <code>defmt</code> logging we need to add these features:</p>
<pre><code>[features]
# set logging levels here
default = [
  "defmt-default",
]

# do NOT modify these features
defmt-default = []
defmt-trace = []
defmt-debug = []
defmt-info = []
defmt-warn = []
defmt-error = []
</code></pre><p>If those are not present, the code will compile but you won’t see log output on the console.</p>
<p>Ok, so now we can rework our <code>main</code> function a little bit:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>#[cortex_m_rt::entry]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() -&gt; <span>!</span> {
    defmt::info<span>!</span>(<span>"Hello, World!"</span>);
    exit();
}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>You’ll notice that we switched to <code>defmt</code> for logging, and also use the <code>cortex_m_rt</code> to provide us with an entry function into our program that is compatible with the nRF board.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to set up our panic handler and an <code>exit</code> function. Note that this is a very simplistic version but helps to get us off the ground:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span> 1
</span><span> 2
</span><span> 3
</span><span> 4
</span><span> 5
</span><span> 6
</span><span> 7
</span><span> 8
</span><span> 9
</span><span>10
</span><span>11
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>#[panic_handler]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>panic</span>(_info: <span>&amp;</span><span>core</span>::panic::PanicInfo) -&gt; <span>!</span> {
    defmt::error<span>!</span>(<span>"panicked"</span>);
    exit()
}

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>exit</span>() -&gt; <span>!</span> {
    <span>loop</span> {
        cortex_m::asm::bkpt();
    }
}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>A <code>cargo run</code> attempt later, we are much closer:</p>
<pre><code>    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.03s
     Running `target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/nrf52840dk-sample`
target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/nrf52840dk-sample: target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/nrf52840dk-sample: cannot execute binary file
</code></pre><p>We did not get any compile errors, but of course we cannot run an arm executable on our host machine. Time to flash our device!</p>
<p>To do this, we need to install <code>probe-run</code>. For now we need to install it from git because we need the <code>defmt</code> support. At some point in the future I’m sure you can just install it from a stable version:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo install probe-run --git https://github.com/knurling-rs/probe-run.git --branch main -f --features defmt
</code></pre><p>While this installs, we need to open our <code>.cargo/config.toml</code> file once again and enable the custom cargo runner:</p>
<pre><code>[target.'cfg(all(target_arch = "arm", target_os = "none"))']
runner = "probe-run --chip nRF52840_xxAA  --defmt"
rustflags = [
  "-C", "link-arg=-Tlink.x",
  "-C", "link-arg=-Tdefmt.x",
]

[build]
target = "thumbv7em-none-eabihf"
</code></pre><p>All these properties and flags are from the <code>probe-run</code> docs. If you are using a different chip, I think you can use <code>probe-run --list-chips</code> to find the right one for your device.</p>
<p>At this point we could try to run it, but there are two issues remaining. <code>defmt</code> wouldn’t log anything, and we are lacking our memory layout for the <code>nrf52840</code>.</p>
<p>So, we finally need to add these two lines before our main function:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>use</span> defmt_rtt <span>as</span> _; <span>// global logger
</span><span></span><span>use</span> nrf52840_hal <span>as</span> _; <span>// memory layout
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Finally, when we now type <code>cargo run</code>, the program gets flashed onto our device successfully:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo run

</code></pre>
<p>With that little victory under our belt, let’s try one more thing: access a peripheral sensor and display its state. In my previous post I used an external sensor, but we can also use a built-in one. The board features a <a href="https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fps_nrf52840%2Ftemp.html&amp;cp=3_0_0_5_27">temperature sensor</a> which measures the temperature of the processor.</p>
<p>The first thing we need to add are two more imports for the <code>Peripherals</code> in general and our <code>Temp</code> sensor specifically:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>use</span> nrf52840_hal::pac::Peripherals;
<span>use</span> nrf52840_hal::temp::Temp;
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Inside our main function, we first need to take ownership of the <code>Peripherals</code> and then feed the right <code>TEMP</code> peripheral to our struct:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>// Take ownership of the device peripherals
</span><span></span><span>let</span> peripherals <span>=</span> Peripherals::take().unwrap();

<span>// Access to the temp sensor
</span><span></span><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> temp_sensor <span>=</span> Temp::new(peripherals.TEMP);
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Now all we need to do is read the temperature from the sensor and convert it to a <code>i32</code> so that <code>defmt</code> can log it for us:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>let</span> die_temp_c: <span>i32</span> <span>=</span> temp_sensor.measure().to_num();
defmt::info<span>!</span>(<span>"processor temp is {:i32}°C"</span>, die_temp_c);
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Run your program again and you’ll see something similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>0.000000 INFO  processor temp is 24°C
</code></pre>
<p>We went from an empty repository to a simple program that reads a temperature sensor and prints it onto your host machines terminal. By not using a template we learned to understand the different components that are at play to get us off the ground. Of course, …</p></div></div>

<!-- Section Content -->
<h3>Introduction and Goals</h3>
<p>
For years, I have been joking with my students that I would teach probability with the same level of excitement even if I were woken up in the middle of the night and asked to teach it. Years later, as a new father, I started writing this book when it became clear to me that I would not be sleeping at night for the foreseeable future.
</p>

<p>
This book is intended for undergraduate and first-year graduate-level courses in probability, statistics, and random processes. My goal has been to provide a clear and intuitive approach to these topics while maintaining an acceptable level of mathematical accuracy.
</p>

<p>
I have been teaching two courses on this subject for several years at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. While one of these courses is an undergraduate course taken by juniors, the other is a graduate-level course taken by our first-year Masters and PhD students.
</p>

<p>
My goal throughout this process has been to write a textbook that has the flexibility to be used in <i>both</i> courses while sacrificing neither the quality nor the presentational needs of either course. To achieve such a goal, I have tried to minimize the dependency between different sections of the book. In particular, when a small part from a different section of the book is useful elsewhere within the text, I have repeated said part rather than simply referring to it. My reasoning for doing so is twofold. Firstly, this format should make it easier for students to read the book and, secondly, this format should allow instructors the flexibility to select individual sections from the book more easily.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, I wanted the book to be easy to read and accessible as a self-study reference. It was also imperative that the book be available to anyone in the world, and as such the book in its entirety can be found online at www.probabilitycourse.com.
</p>

<p>
The book contains a large number of solved exercises. In addition to the examples found within the text, there is a set of solved problems at the end of each section. Detailed and step-by-step solutions to these problems are provided to help students learn problem-solving techniques. The solutions to the end-of-chapter problems, however, are available only to instructors.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, throughout the book, some examples of applications$-$such as engineering, finance, everyday life, etc.$-$are provided to aid in motivating the subject. These examples have been worded to be understandable to all students. As such, some technical issues have been left out.
</p>

<h3>Coverage</h3><p>

After a brief review of set theory and other required mathematical concepts, the text covers topics as follows:
</p><ul>
  <li> Chapters 1 and 2: basic concepts such as random experiments, probability axioms, conditional probability, law of total probability, Bayes' rule, and counting methods;</li>
  <li> Chapters 3 through 6: single and multiple random variables (discrete, continuous, and mixed), as well as moment-generating functions, characteristics functions, random vectors, and inequalities;</li>
  <li> Chapter 7: limit theorems and convergence;</li>
  <li> Chapters 8 and 9: Bayesian and classical statistics;</li>
  <li> Chapters 10: Introduction to random processes, processing of random signals;</li>
  <li> Chapter 11: Poisson processes, discrete-time Markov chains, continuous-time Markov chains, and Brownian motion;</li>
  <li> Chapter 12: basic methods of generating random variables and simulating probabilistic systems (using MATLAB);</li>
  <li> Chapter 13: basic methods of generating random variables and simulating probabilistic systems (using R);</li>
  <li> Chapter 14: recursive methods;</li>
</ul>
<p>
All chapters are available at <a href="http://www.probabilitycourse.com/">www.probabilitycourse.com</a>. Chapters 12 through 14 are available as PDFs and are downloadable from the textbook website. Chapters 12 and 13 cover the same material. The difference is that the codes in chapter 12 are provided in MATLAB while the codes in Chapter 13 are provided in R. The reason for this again is to give flexibility to instructors and students to choose whichever they prefer. Nevertheless, students who are unfamiliar with MATLAB and R should still be able to understand the algorithms.
</p>

<h3>Required Background</h3><p>
The majority of the text does not require any previous knowledge apart from a one-semester course in calculus. The exceptions to this statement are as follows:
</p><ul>
  <li> Sections 5.2 (Two Continuous Random Variables) and 6.1 (Methods for More Than Two Random Variables) both require a light introduction to double integrals and partial derivatives;</li>
  <li> Section 6.1.5 (Random Vectors) uses a few concepts from linear algebra;</li>
  <li> Section 10.2 (Processing of Random Signals) requires familiarity with the Fourier transform.</li>
</ul>

Let’s use a simple test:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>python <span>-m</span> timeit <span>-s</span> <span>"variable=False"</span> <span>"if variable == True: pass"</span>
10000000 loops, best of 5: 24.9 nsec per loop

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Using <code>is</code> is around 60% slower than <code>if variable</code> (17.4/10.9≈1.596), but using <code>==</code> is 120% slower (24.9/10.9≈2.284)! It doesn’t matter if the <code>variable</code> is actually <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> - the differences in performance are similar (if the <code>variable</code> is <code>True</code>, all three scenarios will be slightly slower).</p> <p>Similarly, we can check if a variable is not <code>True</code> using one of the following methods:</p> <ul> <li><code>if variable != True:</code> (<em>“bad”</em>)</li> <li><code>if variable is not True:</code> (<em>“bad”</em>)</li> <li><code>if not variable:</code> (good)</li> </ul> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>python <span>-m</span> timeit <span>-s</span> <span>"variable=False"</span> <span>"if variable != True: pass"</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p><code>if not variable</code> wins. <code>is not</code> is 50% slower (18.8/12.4≈1.516) and <code>!=</code> takes twice as long (26/12.4≈2.016).</p> <p>The <code>if variable</code> and <code>if not variable</code> versions are faster to execute and faster to read. They are common idioms that you will often see in Python (or other programming languages).</p> <h2 id="truthy-and-falsy">“truthy” and “falsy”</h2> <p>Why do I keep putting <em>“bad”</em> in quotes? That’s because the <em>“bad”</em> way is not always bad (it’s only wrong when you want to compare boolean values, as pointed in PEP8). Sometimes, you intentionally have to use one of those other comparisons.</p> <p>In Python (and many other languages), there is <code>True</code>, and there are <em>truthy</em> values. That is, values interpreted as <code>True</code> if you run <code>bool(variable)</code>. Similarly, there is <code>False</code>, and there are <em>falsy</em> values (values that return <code>False</code> from <code>bool(variable)</code>). An empty list (<code>[]</code>), string (<code>""</code>), dictionary (<code>{}</code>), <code>None</code> and 0 are all <em>falsy</em> but they are not strictly <code>False</code>.</p> <p>Sometimes you need to distinguish between <code>True</code>/<code>False</code> and <em>truthy</em>/<em>falsy</em> values. If your code should behave in one way when you pass an empty list, and in another, when you pass <code>False</code>, you can’t use <code>if not value</code>.</p> <p>Take a look at the following scenario:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>process_orders</span><span>(</span><span>orders</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>):</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>orders</span><span>:</span>
        <span># There are no orders, return
</span>        <span>return</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span># Process orders
</span>        <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We have a function to process some orders. If there are no orders, we want to return without doing anything. Otherwise, we want to process existing orders.</p> <p>We assume that if there are no orders, then <code>orders</code> parameter is set to <code>None</code>. But, if the <code>orders</code> is an empty list, we also return without any action! And maybe it’s possible to receive an empty list because someone is just updating the billing information of a past order? Or perhaps having an empty list means that there is a bug in the system. We should catch that bug before we fill up the database with empty orders! No matter what’s the reason for an empty list, the above code will ignore it. We can fix it by investigating the <code>orders</code> parameter more carefully:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>process_orders</span><span>(</span><span>orders</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>):</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>orders</span> <span>is</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
        <span># orders is None, return
</span>        <span>return</span>
    <span>elif</span> <span>orders</span> <span>==</span> <span>[]:</span>
        <span># Process empty list of orders
</span>        <span>...</span>
    <span>elif</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>orders</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span>
        <span># Process existing orders
</span>        <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The same applies to <em>truthy</em> values. If your code should work differently for <code>True</code> than for, let’s say, value <code>1</code>, we can’t use <code>if variable</code>. We should use <code>==</code> to compare the number (<code>if variable == 1</code>) and <code>is</code> to compare to <code>True</code> (<code>if variable is True</code>). Sounds confusing? Let’s take a look at the difference between <code>is</code> and <code>==</code>.</p> <h3 id="is-checks-the-identity--checks-the-value"><code>is</code> checks the identity, <code>==</code> checks the value</h3> <p>The <code>is</code> operator compares the identity of objects. If two variables are identical, it means that they point to the same object (the same place in memory). They both have the same ID (that you can check with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#id">id()</a> function).</p> <p>The <code>==</code> operator compares values. It checks if the value of one variable is equal to the value of some other variable.</p> <p>Some objects in Python are unique, like <code>None</code>, <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. Each time you assign a variable to <code>True</code>, it points to the same <code>True</code> object as other variables assigned to <code>True</code>. But each time you create a new list, Python creates a new object:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>is</span> <span>b</span>
<span>True</span>
<span># Variables that are identical are always also equal!
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>==</span> <span>b</span>
<span>True</span>

<span># But
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>]</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>]</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>is</span> <span>b</span>
<span>False</span>  <span># Those lists are two different objects
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>==</span> <span>b</span>
<span>True</span>  <span># Both lists are equal (contain the same elements)
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>It’s important to know the difference between <code>is</code> and <code>==</code>. If you think that they work the same, you might end up with weird bugs in your code:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
<span># This will print 'yes'
</span><span>if</span> <span>a</span> <span>is</span> <span>1</span><span>:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'yes'</span><span>)</span>

<span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>1000</span>
<span># This won't!
</span><span>if</span> <span>b</span> <span>is</span> <span>1000</span><span>:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'yes'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>In the above example, the first block of code will print “yes,” but the second won’t. That’s because Python performs some tiny optimizations and small integers share the same ID (they point to the same object). Each time you assign <code>1</code> to a new variable, it points to the same <code>1</code> object. But when you assign <code>1000</code> to a variable, it creates a new object. If we use <code>b == 1000</code>, then everything will work as expected.</p> <h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3> <p>To sum up:</p> <ul> <li>To check if a variable is equal to True/False (and you don’t have to distinguish between <code>True</code>/<code>False</code> and <em>truthy</em> / <em>falsy</em> values), use <code>if variable</code> or <code>if not variable</code>. It’s the simplest and fastest way to do this.</li> <li>If you want to check that a variable <strong>is explicitly</strong> True or False (and is not <em>truthy</em>/<em>falsy</em>), use <code>is</code> (<code>if variable is True</code>).</li> <li>If you want to check if a variable is equal to 0 or if a list is empty, use <code>if variable == 0</code> or <code>if variable == []</code>.</li> </ul> </article></div>]]>

  <article>
    <p>Boa is an experimental Javascript lexer, parser and compiler written in Rust. It has support for some of the language, can be embedded in Rust projects fairly easily and also used from the command line.
Boa also exists to serve as a Rust implementation of the EcmaScript specification, there will be areas where we can utilise Rust and its fantastic ecosystem to make a fast, concurrent and safe engine.</p>

<p>We have a long way to go, however v0.10 has been the biggest release to date, with 138 issues closed!</p>

<p>We have some highlights, but if you prefer to read the full changelog, you can do that <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">here</a></p>

<h2 id="test262">Test262</h2>

<p>One question we’ve been asked for a long time is “how conformant are you to the spec?”. It’s been tough to answer as we’ve been unable to run against the official test suite.</p>

<p>Test262 is the official ECMAScript Test Suite and exists to provide conformance tests for the latest drafts of the Ecma specification. It is used for all engines, you can even run it in your <a href="https://bakkot.github.io/test262-web-runner/">browser</a>.<br>
Thanks to @Razican in v0.10 we now have a test harness that allows us to run it against Boa at any time.</p>

<p>This is a new crate inside the Boa repository that can parse through all of the tests (roughly 40,000 of them) in under 10 minutes and tell us how conformant we are.</p>

<p><img src="https://boa-dev.github.io/images/2020-10-02/test262-screenshot.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>Today Boa has <span>18</span>% conformity to the specification. We’ll be keeping an eye on this number over the releases. We expect to achieve around 30% by 0.11 due to some of the fixes we’re adding which should pass a few thousand tests.</p>

<p>These are run via Github Actions against PRs and for our master branch so that we can keep track of where we are and if there are regressions.</p>

<h2 id="built-ins">Built-ins</h2>

<p>We’ve added support for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date"><code>Date</code></a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map"><code>Map</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol">well-known symbols</a>. Supporting Well-known symbols unblocks a lot of work around adding <code>@@iterators</code> to some of our global objects which is coming up in the next release.<br>
Both <code>Math</code> and <code>Number</code> have had their remaining methods implemented.</p>

<h2 id="lexer">Lexer</h2>

<p>The lexer has been rebuilt from scratch. Just like the old parser it was a single file before looping through and becoming unmaintainable. Today we’ve reorganised it into separate modules which know how to lex certain areas. The new lexer <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/issues/294">now supports goal symbols</a> and can now tokenize with the correct context at any time.</p>

<h3 id="goal-symbols">Goal Symbols</h3>

<p>Our issue with goal symbols is explained by the V8 team:
<a href="https://v8.dev/blog/understanding-ecmascript-part-3#lexical-grammar">https://v8.dev/blog/understanding-ecmascript-part-3#lexical-grammar</a></p>

<p>Previously we weren’t distinguishing between the contexts where some input elements are permitted and some are not, so lexing <code>/</code> would yeild a <code>division</code> symbols when it should be a <code>RegularExpressionLiteral</code> for example. This change unblocked us being able to run Test262.</p>

<p>Performance wise it is much faster for larger files. The lexer is far more efficient at streaming tokens to the parser than previously so in some scenarios we have big gains.</p>

<p><em>You can see all the benchmarks <a href="https://boa-dev.github.io/boa/dev/bench/">here</a></em></p>

<h2 id="repl-syntax-highlighting">Repl syntax highlighting</h2>

<p>Syntax highlighting was added to the repl this release thanks to @HalidOdat<br>
Our repl is made possible due to the great work of <a href="https://github.com/kkawakam/rustyline">RustyLine</a></p>

<p><img src="https://boa-dev.github.io/images/2020-10-02/syntaxHighlighting.gif" alt="image"></p>

<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h2>

<p>There are plenty of fixes and performance changes still needed, we also hope to experiment with producing Bytecode from our AST in future. Test262 coverage will almost certainly increase, and we are polishing the public API for easier use when embedding into other Rust projects.</p>

<p>Thanks to all those who contributed to 0.10, you can see the names in the full changelog linked above.</p>

<p>You can checkout Boa via <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa">Github</a> or on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/Boa">crates.io</a></p>

<p>I’ve seen people quit programming because they don’t want to struggle with bugs. That’s like hating the gym because you don’t want workouts to hurt.</p>
<h2>Learn to see the struggle as the way.</h2>
<p>You don’t run from bugs; you train yourself to find them quicker. </p>
<p><strong>A proficient programmer is an efficient detective of bugs.</strong></p>
<p>If you’re feeling frustrated that things are not smooth, remember that this is how learning actually works. </p>
<p>Neuroscience research confirms that practice doesn’t simply make you perfect; it is deliberate practice to improve in a specific task that makes you better. And deliberate practice involves struggling.</p>
<p>So your mantra should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>You code. </li>
<li>You debug.</li>
<li>You struggle. </li>
<li>You overcome. </li>
<li>And you repeat.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve not struggled at all, you’re simply playing around. </p>
<p>If you struggle all the time, then the next section is for you.</p>
<h2>You’re not dumb, you’re learning at the wrong level.</h2>
<p>Let’s start with a little analogy. </p>
<p>Imagine learning the English language (the language of exceptions).</p>
<p>You start with a tutorial motivating you to learn to spell big words like <em>ELEPHANT</em>.</p>
<p>But it’s not working. After beating yourself for so long you decide to go to a lower tutorial and learn to spell smaller words like <em>ANT</em>.</p>
<p>But you still struggle.</p>
<p>So you conclude that you’re dumb because you lowered your tutorial level and still didn’t grasp anything.</p>
<p>But when a new teacher investigates why you’re struggling, they find out that you’ve been struggling because you actually don’t know the English alphabets.</p>
<p>Let’s bring this home to our coding world.</p>
<p>Some people jump into beginner tutorials to learn frameworks like <em>React (ELEPHANT)</em>. Then realize it makes no sense so they move on to learn <em>JavaScript (ANT)</em>. But that still makes no sense to them, so they quit.</p>
<p>But they’re simply working with something that’s too advanced.</p>
<p>Even introduction courses can be advanced because your thinking is not wired yet to programming in general. </p>
<p>There’s no shame in finding something lower than Intro courses and starting from there to build up to Intro courses. </p>
<p>I don’t see this recommended enough but if you’re struggling with intro courses, you should consider Intro to programming for kids. </p>
<p>Learn with tools like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alice </li>
<li>Scratch</li>
<li>Codewars.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since you’re older, you’ll go through them faster. But they’ll give you the much needed soft intro that makes sense and builds your appetite.</p>
<p>Again, this has nothing to do with ego. </p>
<p><strong>It’s your learning journey.</strong></p>
<p>If you learn the alphabets first, you’ll gain the confidence needed to start spelling <em>ANT</em>, <em>ELEPHANT</em>, and later constructing long-winded sentences. </p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what discipline or area of coding you jump into, this holds for <em>Intro to Python</em> as much as it holds for <em>Intro to Machine Learning</em>.</p>
<p>You’ll learn more efficiently if you learn at the right level. </p>
<h2>Elevate how you learn with spaced repetition.</h2>
<p>This technique is from research in Neuroscience. And I’ll summarize it short and quick.</p>
<h3>How it works:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You learn.</li>
<li>Recall in 48 hours.</li>
<li>Then review in 72 hours. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Doing this:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You’ll forget less.</li>
<li>Connect new ideas to old; and</li>
<li>Retain more in long term memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>I put 48 and 72 hours but you can expand that timeline to days and weeks. The most important takeaway is not to simply learn once. But to intentionally set aside time for you to come back and review. </p>
<p>The longer the delay between reviews, the more it gets buried in long-term memory.</p>
<ul>
<li>Duolingo uses it.</li>
<li>Quizlet adopted it.</li>
<li>You can also apply it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1 project &gt; 10 hello worlds</h2>
<p>Don’t get caught up in <code>hello worlds</code> forever.</p>
<p>I understand the thrill of completing simple exercises:</p>
<div>
      <pre><code># OMG - I can print all day
print “I am awesome”.
print “You’re cool”. 
print “Wait, are we cool?” </code></pre>
      </div>
<p>But I have to be honest with you, this won’t cut it.</p>
<p>Going back to our ANT analogy, no matter how many ways you rearrange the words ANT, you’ll never arrive at ELEPHANT. </p>
<p>No matter how many Intro tutorials you learn, you’ll never really get past the basics unless you push yourself beyond that. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>But I don’t know what projects to start as a beginner.</em>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No worries. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Random Password Generator: Creating a program that intakes some words from the user and then generates a random password using those words. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currency converter: Create a program that converts currencies from one unit to another, for example, converting Indian rupee into dollars, pound to euros, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you find these boring, here are <a href="https://www.upgrad.com/blog/python-projects-ideas-topics-beginners/">40 other ideas to choose from.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And if all of them seem too difficult, <a href="https://twitter.com/LifeTechPsych">DM me on Twitter</a> and I’ll create something specifically for you to start with. Remember, this is not about ego; it’s about your learning level and growth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Motivation is like taking a hot shower.</h2>
<p>Taking a hot shower feels good - you should do it.</p>
<p>But if your hot water is out for 2 weeks, would you not shower?</p>
<p>The question sounds ridiculous but in the same way, you really shouldn’t base your learning on only days when you’re motivated. </p>
<p>There are lots of exciting days in coding; but there will also be dark, unmotivating days. </p>
<p>Honestly, this is not just with coding. It’s with life and embarking on any new adventure. But you have to train yourself to show up not only when you’re feeling hyper inspirational but also on low, boring days.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean forget motivation.
Far from it - on days when you feel super motivated, use your motivation to quickly commit yourself to something big that will keep you accountable when the motivation goes dry.</p>
<h4>How? Join an accountability movement like:</h4>
<ul>
<li>30daysofcode</li>
<li>100DaysOfCode</li>
<li>30DaysOfCodingChallenge</li>
</ul>
<p>Something. Anything. To keep you accountable on slow days. </p>
<p>In Behavioral Psychology, this is known as pre-commitment. You use moments when you’re optimistic to commit yourself in the future for when you have zero optimism.</p>
<h2>The journey of learning is never-ending.</h2>
<p>No one teaches you how to learn. </p>
<p>But it’s crucial in going far.</p>
<p>You may have started with the idea of simply learning to code or to one day become a developer. But there’s more.</p>

<p>When you come out on the other side, you’ll come out not just a coder.</p>
<p>But as a renewed person because you’ve picked up a new way of learning and approaching things.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. This isn’t easy peasy lemon squeezy – you’ll work like hell. </p>
<p>But in the end, it’ll be worth it not just because of coding but because of the joy of transforming yourself.</p>
<p>Remember, the ball’s always in your court…</p>
<h2>Thanks for reading.</h2>
<p>If you enjoyed this and you’re on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/LifeTechPsych/status/1311338563884257280">like and retweet this</a> to help spread the word. I know it sounds trivial but it actually really helps.</p>
<p>I’m trying out a new initiative to help new coders and junior devs feel less overwhelmed, manage imposter syndrome and learn smarter. </p>
<p>To be honest, I’m not sure what the entire process looks like yet. But I’m going with the flow and putting together resources and write-ups based on what people need the most help with.</p>

											<h2>Master the Elements of Grammar</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Japanese Particles are what make Japanese unique as a language. When we study Japanese (or Korean for that matter) having a solid understanding of how particles are incorporated and used to reflect and express states of the mind is crucial.</p>
										<p>Japanese Complete focuses on a "Particles First" approach that teaches all the grammatical particles first. This unconventional technique actually enables the most accelerated learning in Japanese ever, because by frequency, particles are the most frequent glyphs of the language.</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Master Japanese Swiftly.</li>
											<li>Retain What you Learn.</li>
											<li>Go All The Way.™</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Multi-factor authentication adds another requirement for users to access their accounts. People are <a href="https://press.avast.com/83-of-americans-are-using-weak-passwords">terrible</a> at choosing a secure password, but they are excellent to spot when a physical thing is missing. MFA builds on this strength by requiring <em>something you have</em> (a phone or a device) as well as <em>something you know</em> (the password).</p> <p>You can use MFA throughout the AWS account. You can add a device to the root account as well as to individual IAM users. As an administrator, you can monitor that users have their devices enabled, as well as enforce their usage to access protected resources in an account.</p> <p>This article discusses what are the options for MFA in AWS, how to check and enforce its usage across the users, and how to handle a lost device.</p> <h2 id="mfa-setup">MFA setup</h2> <p>In AWS, each IAM user and the root user can have an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/features/mfa/">MFA device</a>. When there is one associated with the user, <strong>signing in to the Console requires using it</strong>.</p> <p>MFA devices can be TOTP-based and U2F. They are fundamentally different, so let’s see each of them!</p>  <h3 id="totp-based-mfa">TOTP-based MFA</h3> <p>TOTP is short for Time-based One-time Password, which is a device or an app that shows a 6-digit number every 30 seconds. When you log in, you need to input the numbers you see in addition to the password.</p> <p><img alt="Authy screenshot" integrity="sha256-XTQmf2FbGIcDLt3lJ8xlrETPY5U4BXcoe018NJn98f0=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/aws_mfa/authy-5d34267f615b1887032edde527cc65ac44cf6395380577287b4d7c3499fdf1fd.png"></p> <p>(Image from <a href="https://authy.com/blog/authy-onetouch-simply-strong-security/">https://authy.com/blog/authy-onetouch-simply-strong-security/</a>)</p> <p>It works by having <strong>a secret key shared between the device and the server</strong>, and a synchronized clock. The digits you see on the device are the hash of the shared secret and the current value of the clock rounded to 30 seconds. Since both of these data are present on both sides the server can verify the digits.</p> <p>When you add an MFA device to an AWS account, you need to get the secret key to both sides. It is more apparent when adding a virtual device:</p> <p><img alt="TOTP secret" integrity="sha256-cwtJZARvIQds2tmfUkXtACQ3KylOqOWP1+LwXZvkrOY=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/aws_mfa/totp_add-730b4964046f21076cdad99f5245ed0024372b294ea8e58fd7e2f05d9be4ace6.png"></p> <p>Note the <em>secret key</em> at the bottom. The QR code is just a convenient way to transfer this to the phone as many apps allow reading these codes.</p> <p>Authentication works by using this secret and the clock:</p> <p><svg

<h4 id="virtual-totp">Virtual TOTP</h4> <p>The easiest way to start using MFA is to use a virtual token, which is usually an app that runs on your phone. After synchronizing the secret to the app it generates the digits you can use to log in. <strong>The second factor is your phone</strong> in this case.</p> <p>There are several apps to choose from. <a href="https://github.com/google/google-authenticator">Google Authenticator</a> is probably the best-known, but there is <a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a>, <a href="https://lastpass.com/auth/">LastPass Authenticator</a>, <a href="https://github.com/andOTP/andOTP">andOTP</a>, and even web-based ones, such as <a href="https://totp.app/">totp.app</a>.</p> <p>Note that technically it is still something you know, the shared secret, and <strong>it can be recovered from your phone</strong>. This has advantages, such as the ability to <strong>backup the codes to another device or the cloud</strong>, but comes with a slight compromise on the security. If an attacker has access to your phone he can extract the codes and later use them to sign in to your account.</p> <h4 id="hardware-totp">Hardware TOTP</h4> <p>To make sure a TOTP secret can not be copied you can buy dedicated hardware. This is <strong>manufactured with the secret included</strong> so there is no need to transfer it to the device. All you need to do is to type the serial number and two codes, and the device is associated with your account.</p> <p><img alt="Hardware TOTP token" integrity="sha256-PVjHUa5IZgJB29OngpmaObZxKnnC1f2Ddy7PSb6IcHg=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/21a4f0-43d76d16ab82923359e3b51bff2264219587e78fe09b1257573ca69987609624.png"></p> <p>(Image from <a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/access-management/authenticators/safenet-otp-110">https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/access-management/authenticators/safenet-otp-110</a>)</p> <p>These devices are <strong>tamper-proof</strong> to some extent but also <strong>tamper-evident</strong>, meaning it’s hard to extract the secret but you’ll also notice that someone tried to do it. But because of this, contrary to virtual devices, <strong>there is no way to backup it</strong>. If you lose it or break it, it’s gone for good.</p> <p>Notice that these devices come with a battery and <strong>they are <em>not</em> internet-connected</strong>. The secret is preloaded and they have a clock and their only connection with the outside world is through their LCD screen. Sometimes their clocks can drift, meaning the timestamp is different on the device than the server. You can <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_sync.html">resynchronize the device</a> in that case. Reading the comments, it’s a surprisingly common problem.</p> <p>While every virtual TOTP works with every service supporting TOTP, it’s not true for hardware tokens. Since the secret is stored on the manufacturer’s servers, the service needs to contact them to check the token. <strong>Make sure to check which models AWS supports before you buy the tokens</strong>.</p> <h3 id="u2f-mfa">U2F MFA</h3> <p>U2F is based on a challenge-response authentication using private and public keys generated on the device. Because of this, <strong>an active connection is needed between the device and the server</strong>.</p> <p><img alt="U2F MFA flow" integrity="sha256-1tiNqZ7pU45MpitXSv9IcY7INw55Khpoc4m3cOUoFOM=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/a1b37d-0180191b4f80f8261b056e9a6e704c80f07247224ef5ac1ef494d994bfc7f7c2.png"></p> <p>(Image from <a href="https://www.yubico.com/blog/yubicos-u2f-key-wrapping/">https://www.yubico.com/blog/yubicos-u2f-key-wrapping/</a>)</p> <p>From a technical perspective, this is a superior solution to the TOTP tokens. But there is no way to backup it, and it needs a connection and that always makes things <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/u2f-ecdsa-vulnerability">more complicated</a>.</p> <p>Using it is straightforward, just press the button. It even comes <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2019/11/using-built-in-fido-authenticator-on.html">integrated into some laptops</a>. U2F is universal, so every token work with every service.</p> <p>One AWS-specific downside is that you <strong>can not use it with the CLI</strong>, only to sign in to the Console.</p> <h2 id="check-mfa-usage">Check MFA usage</h2> <p>When it comes to administering IAM users you can look at the IAM console to see if they have MFA enabled:</p> <p><img alt="The type of the MFA device is shown on the IAM Console" integrity="sha256-/mKsTQr7z3TriaOPAmNFQz89ss6JNKpOYGKzJiOvE20=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/aws_mfa/mfa_type-fe62ac4d0afbcf74eb89a38f026345433f3db2ce8934aa4e6062b32623af136d.png"></p> <p>This list also shows whether they are using virtual or hardware tokens.</p> <p>The Credential report that you can download also contains MFA usage, but only in a true/false way.</p> <h2 id="enforce-mfa">Enforce MFA</h2> <p>You can enforce the usage of MFA with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_configure-api-require.html">IAM policies</a>.

<p>Knowing Javascript inside and out or all the programming languages in the world won’t be enough to help you land a great job that pays incredibly well or secure those amazing opportunities that are hard to come by.</p>



<p>If you want to truly advance your career and succeed as a developer, you need to market yourself. Sure, coding is your passion and you’d rather bury yourself in it, but how would anyone know that you’re good at what you do or even discover you unless you put yourself out there?</p>



<p>When screening for developer positions, many companies pay attention to candidates who have active <a href="https://blog.codersrank.io/profile-2-0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">programmer profiles</a>—a blog, podcast, open-source contributions, YouTube channel, or a history of speaking at tech events—that speaks to their abilities. They view developers with these achievements and experiences as more likely to be talented because their reputation suggests it.</p>



<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/the-office-michael-scott-5B6PQ4lDOlbB6">via GIPHY</a></p>



<p>A little marketing can help you shine brightly in the eyes of potential employers. The last thing you want is to be just another candidate or resume when applying for a job. You need to find a way to stand out from the other stack of papers so that companies are pushed to invite you for an interview or make you an offer.</p>



<p>With effective marketing, you may not even have to go job hunting, opportunities will come knocking at your door. When you share your goals, skills, experiences, and knowledge about your field publicly, it helps to establish you as an expert. As such, companies will be happy to pay you a premium salary rather than hiring one of your seemingly less qualified counterparts.</p>



<p>Now that you understand how important marketing is and how it can enhance your reputation and turn you into a job magnet, we’re going to walk you through actionable steps you can take to successfully market yourself as a developer, stand out from the competition, get on recruiters’ radars, and bag the job offer of your dreams.</p>



<p>We have ranked these steps according to how useful and important they can be in helping you market yourself and your skills effectively.</p>







<ol><li><a href="#portfolio">Build your portfolio</a></li><li><a href="#brand">Build a personal brand</a></li><li><a href="#codersrank">Register a profile on CodersRank</a></li><li><a href="#network">Network with fellow tech professionals</a></li><li><a href="#linkedin">Tidy up your LinkedIn profile</a></li></ol>



<p>Following these steps will help you enlarge your horizons and place your best foot forward so life-changing opportunities can find you. While other developers are scrambling to submit resumes and nail their technical interviews, you’ll already be far ahead.</p>



<p>Let’s take an in-depth look into each of these steps and how you can use them to enhance your career as a software developer and go from chasing after the prize to becoming the prize.</p>



<h2 id="portfolio" data-amp-original-style="color:#50b0ba"><strong>1. Build your portfolio</strong></h2>



<p>As a developer, you know that you need to keep practicing and refining your skills. What you might not know is that you can use the assignments and projects you do to create a portfolio that showcases your expertise.</p>



<p>If you don’t already have a GitHub profile, start by creating one and start pushing code to it regularly, and make your experiments public. This is non-negotiable. GitHub is your <a href="https://blog.codersrank.io/the-evolution-of-the-most-popular-repositories-since-2012/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">code repository</a> and it should be used to display all the code you’ve written, projects you’ve worked on, and other interesting code-related activities you’ve been involved in.</p>



<p>Your GitHub account is basically your developer resume because it serves as proof of how well you can code. It says more about your skills than any CV or interview can. Contribute to as many open source libraries as you can. The more open source contributions you have the greater the value prospective employers will see in hiring you.</p>



<p>If you’d like to make valuable contributions to open source libraries, but you’re not sure how to go about submitting one, finding projects to contribute to, or even what kind of contributions you can make, check out these resources:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to contribute to open source</a></li><li><a href="https://auth0.com/blog/a-first-timers-guide-to-an-open-source-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A first timer’s guide to an open source project</a></li><li><a href="https://rubygarage.org/blog/how-contribute-to-open-source-projects" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to contribute to open source projects</a></li></ul>



<p>It’s also important to have a portfolio website where potential employers can go to learn more about you, the work you’ve done, and how your skills and experience can benefit their organization.</p>



<p>When building your portfolio, here are the things you’ll want to pay attention to:</p>



<h3>Set up a professional site</h3>



<p>It makes sense for your domain to be in your name since this is a personal portfolio and people should be able to find it by simply entering your name into a search engine. Make sure you purchase the domain so that you can have full control over it and be able to migrate to a different web platform.</p>



<p>You cannot expect employers to take you seriously if you proclaim yourself to be a talented developer, but your website looks shabby and amateurish. You want anyone who stumbles on your site to be immediately impressed by the layout and design even before they go through any of your pages.</p>



<figure><amp-img src="https://file.mockplus.com/image/2019/07/75f1f76e-eeb4-4166-8cf1-3500d6256538.png" alt="" object-fit="contain" width="1170" height="400" layout="intrinsic" i-amphtml-layout="intrinsic"><img src="https://file.mockplus.com/image/2019/07/75f1f76e-eeb4-4166-8cf1-3500d6256538.png" alt="" width="1170" height="400" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyBoZWlnaHQ9JzQwMCcgd2lkdGg9JzExNzAnIHhtbG5zPSdodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZycgdmVyc2lvbj0nMS4xJy8+"></amp-img><figcaption><a href="https://www.mockplus.com/blog/post/web-developer-portfolio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Source</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Your site should be easy to navigate and visually pleasing. You can decide to code your website from scratch and display it as one of the projects in your portfolio or create one using your preferred web platform. Whatever you choose, remember to keep it simple.</p>



<p>Include a well-designed logo that communicates your values and serves as an accurate representation of who you are and what you do.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that a <strong>personal website is going to mean different things to a back end developer and a front end developer</strong> since they’re different fields. Whichever faction you belong to, you just need to find an approach to your website design and presentation that best represents who you are and what you do.</p>



<p>If you’re a newbie developer, this <a href="https://mikkegoes.com/portfolio-site-on-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detailed step-by-step guide</a> will help you build a great-looking portfolio website from scratch to showcase your skills and value to potential employers and help you get hired faster. It covers everything from registering a domain name to choosing a reliable website, creating eye-catching home and about me pages, building contact forms, and more.</p>



<p>Check out these <a href="https://www.springboard.com/blog/programmer-portfolio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 best practices for creating a programming portfolio website</a> that stands out. The article also contains tips on mistakes to avoid when building your website and what recruiters look for in a developer portfolio, as well as stunning website examples that are sure to get your creativity flowing.</p>



<h3>Showcase your work</h3>



<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/kodewithklossy-coding-karlie-kloss-kwk-ZG719ozZxGuThHBckn">via GIPHY</a></p>



<p>The point of having an online portfolio is to highlight the work you’ve done in the past and the accomplishments you’re proud of. If you don’t have any concrete work experience yet, you can start by creating a single web page and adding links to other online profiles you have like your social media and GitHub account.</p>



<p>When you write articles, host webinars, give talks, contribute to open source libraries, create tutorial videos, or work on anything interesting, update your site accordingly. Explain what each project is about, why it’s important, and when it was done.</p>



<p>Don’t just go on and on about the agile methodologies, frameworks, and programming languages that you know. Display that project you built using Javascript, PHP, CSS, or whatever tech stacks you say you’re familiar with. </p>



<p>Let visitors see the skills you possess in action and how you can use these skills to grow their business. This will establish your expertise, credibility, and trustworthiness.</p>



<h3>Share your story</h3>



<p>Don’t be shy about being yourself. Let your personality shine through. Describe yourself as honestly as you can. What is it that makes you special? What struggles, failures, or challenges have you encountered over the course of your career? Employers don’t want to hire mindless code monkeys, but people they can relate to.</p>



<h3>Include your contact details</h3>



<p>Give visitors and potential employers a way to reach you. Add your email address and phone number or create a simple contact form they can fill out. If they have to jump through hoops to find your contact information, you might miss out on many good opportunities.</p>



<h2 id="brand" data-amp-original-style="color:#50b0ba"><strong>2. Build a personal brand</strong></h2>



<p>Personal branding is simply a way of making yourself known for something. As a programmer, you not only want to be competent in your field, you also want people to see you that way. Thanks to the internet, it’s easier than ever to create a brand around yourself.</p>



<p>Ask yourself what you want to be known for? Who are you and what do you want to represent? What is your core message? What do you want people to think of when they see or hear your name? Once you have this figured out, start putting this message out there and making sure it’s reflected in everything you do.</p>



<p>Here are some of the ways you can create a strong personal brand and actively promote yourself:</p>



<h3>Clean up assets related to communication</h3>



<p>Come up with a logo for your brand if you don’t already have one. It should be something simple, eye-catching, and an accurate representation of who you are and what you’re about. Don’t go changing your logo every week or so. Find one that works for you and use it everywhere.</p>



<p>Get professional headshots taken to use as cover images for your online profiles. Go through your social media accounts and public forums and delete any inappropriate messages or comments that don’t align with the image you want to project or reflect badly on you as a person.</p>



<h3>Start a blog</h3>



<p>A blog can be a wonderful way to showcase your skills as a developer, become well-known in your industry, and attract potential clients or employers.</p>



<p>Your blog doesn’t have to have tens of thousands of readers, but you do need to build a decent audience. You can do this by sharing useful information that adds some kind of value to your readers’ lives. Talk about your professional journey, the challenges you’ve faced along the way, and how you overcame them.</p>



<p>Teach people how to solve problems. Show examples of work you’ve done in the past to help junior developers find their way and build themselves up. Think of something you’ve struggled with that you found a solution …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Blockchain technology is primarily associated with cryptocurrency. However, it can be used in many ways. It became noticeable since the Ethereum-based smart contracts appeared. Before you find out how to create a Blockchain-based project, you need to understand what this technology is.</p></div>
<h2 id="what-is-blockchain">What is Blockchain</h2>
<div><p>Blockchain is a kind of database that every participant can access. System users can store, view, and add new data to the system. The blocks with information appear in the network only after the majority of participants confirm them. All records that were previously put into the Blockchain cannot be changed or deleted. And for this reason, this technology primarily was used to create currency. Thanks to the Blockchain properties, the cryptocurrency can’t be counterfeited or stolen, if only the owner of the wallet monitors the personal data security. However, electronic currency is not the only way to realize the Blockchain capabilities. Let's take a closer look at other areas where people can apply this technology.</p></div>
<h2 id="areas-to-apply-the-blockchain">Areas to Apply the Blockchain</h2>
<p>Here we list the areas where one can create and develop a small Blockchain project. Skipping the taxation topic, the creation of e-government, medical databases, aviation, and other fields in which Blockchain can be applied at the state level.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>E-commerce</strong><br>There are many online stores and e-auctions where cryptocurrencies and smart contracts are used to exchange assets and acquire them.</li>
<li><strong>DeFi projects</strong><br>This is the fastest-growing segment of the crypto industry. DeFi is a whole range of services that are an alternative to banking: loans, mortgages, investments, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Media libraries</strong><br>Distribution of media files, copyright protection. This is a fairly new field. On the Blockchain basis, Blockchain allows creating a platform where a person can store intellectual property. The copyright will be secured forever since all information is stored in one place.</li>
</ol>
<br>

<h2 id="blockchain-project-creation">Blockchain Project Creation</h2>
<p>The easiest way to create a Blockchain-based project is to develop Ethereum-based applications and services. The platform has its coding language, Solidity, which helps to create Blockchain applications. Two more platforms provide similar functionality in addition to Ethereum:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hyperledger Fabric</strong> is created with the IBM support. The project doesn’t have its cryptocurrency now, however, the platform provides lots of opportunities to create Blockchain projects using Go, Java, and JavaScript.</li>
<li><strong>Cardano</strong> is similar to Ethereum and has its cryptocurrency. The Cardano infrastructure includes two compute layers. The first one works with a project token (ADA). And the second one allows us to create smart contract-based projects using Haskell.</li>
</ol>
<br>

<h2 id="blockchain-from-scratch">Blockchain from Scratch</h2>
<div><p>Building a Blockchain infrastructure from scratch requires skills in creating cryptographic algorithms and programming in C, C ++, C #, Java, and Python. To implement such a project, you need to assemble a team of developers with experience in working with Blockchain.</p><p>You'll spend much more time developing with this approach, but you won’t pay a commission for using the platform resources and adjust to its limitations.</p></div>

<p>In the UK, FinTech apps should be handled in a way similar to banking institutions, both from the legal and technological point of view. It obviously imposes a lot of responsibility and work to ensure the system is 100% secure, so users can trust it with their money. But what does it mean in practice? Let’s take a deeper look at the <strong>FinTech security standards</strong> you’ll need to deal with in order to abide by the rules, while still being able to offer the most to your customers.</p>



<h2>FinTech security requirements: legal perspective&nbsp;</h2>



<p>No matter if there’s more <em>fin </em>or more <em>tech</em> in a FinTech app, there is no way to escape the regulations. Since there are no special laws regarding this type of products, they are all subject to the existing body of UK financial regulatory perimeter. This fact places FinTechs among institutions providing consumer credits, insurance services, crowdfunding and banking, and, as a result, ensures that the final customer can actually feel safe.</p>



<p>Moreover, there is a plethora of <strong>cyber security rules</strong>, which in the UK are mostly <a href="https://iclg.com/practice-areas/fintech-laws-and-regulations/united-kingdom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">compatible with their counterparts in the EU</a>. Top 3 are:</p>



<ul><li>personal data protection (including breach notification)</li><li>mandatory security measures (their absence can cause the FCA to take action)</li><li>the Computer Misuse Act 1990 (amended in 2015, as a part of the EU Cybercrime Directive)</li></ul>



<p>The major difference between the UK and EU in terms of legal regulations regarding FinTech is that the UK’s Network and Information Systems Regulations 2018 don’t apply to banks and financial institutions (although they should, according to the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eudr/2016/1148/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Network and Information Systems Directive, (EU) 2016/1148</a>). However, the reason for excluding the finance sector from this law is that <b>it was considered sufficiently regulated in the first place.</b></p>



<h2><strong>FinTech security standards: technology perspective</strong></h2>



<p>Besides the binding law, cyber security is a number one priority for every business in the financial sector for a number of reasons. And while minimizing the risk of losing funds to hackers is a must, maintaining a good reputation, is almost as important. In fact, information about security breaches going public often end up as stock market disasters. Probably the worst one happened in 2016, when Yahoo was sold in, what the media called, “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2016/07/25/yahoo-sells-to-verizon-for-5-billion-marissa-mayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the saddest $5 billion deal in tech history</a>.”</p>



<h2>Basic FinTech security solutions&nbsp;</h2>



<p>In order to make sure your business is as safe and responsible as possible, you should start with five essentials:</p>



<h3>1. Dedicated cyber security team</h3>



<p>Internal or obtained via <a href="https://codeandpepper.com/services/#services-team-augmentation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">team augmentation</a>, cyber security experts are necessary on every step of the Software/System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in order to create an app that is free of vulnerabilities from the very beginning. Later on, when the product is already on the market, your security team is still vital to work on updates and monitor the hacking world for potential threats.</p>



<p>Pro tip: a lot of work in this area can be automated with a <strong>security information and event management system</strong> (SIEM), which monitors data in real time to prevent any suspicious activity.</p>



<h3>2. ISO 27001</h3>



<p>In order to be regarded as a trustworthy partner, you need to be 100% certain that your product meets all<strong> </strong>FinTech data security standards. The best way to do it, is to get the <strong>ISO 27001 certification</strong>, which focuses on ISMS (information security management system). There are quite a few steps to meet this standard but they all boil down to conducting proper risk assessment, identifying and fixing flaws, implementing security controls and keeping them reviewed regularly.</p>



<h3>3. Penetration testing</h3>



<p>Penetration testing is basically a simulation of a hacker’s attack performed by a skilled specialist (an <em>ethical hacker</em>, also called a <em>white hat</em>). What’s important, such experts have access to a full array of weaponry that real criminals use to breach security, so they can identify the flaws in the system before the actual villains use them to harm your business and your customers. However, pentesters (short for penetration testers) are usually external experts only hired for one job and have no deep insight into the systems they work with. They simply cannot replace an internal cyber security team.</p>



<p>Thanks to regular reports from ethical hackers, you can <strong>keep your FinTech data security first-class</strong> at all times, maintain the ISO 20071 certification and boost your brand’s credibility.</p>



<h3>4. Cautious employees</h3>



<p>It may seem odd, but many hacking attacks happen without actually breaching any technological barriers. Remember how celebrities promised free Bitcoins on Twitter in July? In fact, Twitter’s cyber security wasn’t breached due to infrastructure vulnerabilities. On the contrary, the attack was possible, because some employees hadn’t followed the procedures carefully enough. Or maybe the problem was the procedures themselves? However we describe it,<b> hackers managed to access the firm’s internal systems and tools by manipulating the staff with high-level access</b>.</p>



<p>The company called the incident a “<a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/16/twitter-blames-coordinated-social-engineering-attack-for-hack/">coordinated social engineering attack</a>”. Most probably, it could have been avoided if the organization had hired an ethical social engineering hacker to verify its internal procedures and had&nbsp;raised staff awareness on a regular basis.</p>



<h3>5. Swift reaction</h3>



<p>When it comes to the worst and your company falls victim to a hacker’s attack, you’ll need to keep a stiff upper lip. There are three <b>basic rules every organization needs to follow in order to react properly after discovering a security breach</b>:</p>



<ul><li>Inform your customers and business partners about the situation. Spare no details and make sure to state exactly what data was compromised. Also, advise your users to <strong>block their credit cards and change their passwords</strong> as soon as possible.</li><li>Always cooperate closely with the local information commissioner. In the UK it’s the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Information Commissioner’s Office</a> and each EU country has its own equivalent body (they’re all listed by the <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en">European Data Protection Board</a>.)</li><li>Conduct a security audit to understand the attack’s background and make sure you implement better security measures to avoid a similar situation in the future.</li></ul>



<h2>What happens if FinTech security is breached? Finastra attack case study</h2>



<p>In FinTech apps development, security and regulatory compliance are essential and any mistake can lead to a disaster. Even the largest financial services providers can get punished by the FCA or fall prey to hackers, just like <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cshub.com/attacks/articles/incident-of-the-week-finastras-ransomware-attack">Finastra did in March</a>. What’s the most unsettling in this case, is the fact that Finastra works with dozens of leading banks and the company’s problems can affect millions of customers.</p>



<h3>One update too late</h3>



<p>Seemingly minor human errors are one of the most common causes of attacks. In the case of Finastra, somebody <b>forgot to check whether the VPN (Pulse Secure VPN) had been patched to the latest version.</b> Hackers made use of a vulnerability discovered back in 2019 (known as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11510">CVE-2019-11510</a>) to trigger a further chain of events and, eventually, breach the security system and write arbitrary files to the host.</p>



<h3>Aftermath</h3>



<p>As a result, the FinTech giant, which employs over 10,000 people and reported $2 billion in revenues for 2019, had to disconnect all its systems from the Internet to perform a thorough investigation. Moreover, vital data about top banks from over 40 countries might have been stolen. And all Finastra had to do was stick to the basic FinTech security solutions…</p>



<h3>Cheer up!</h3>



<p>Is creating a FinTech app that can operate in a legal and secure way – while still being user-friendly – a challenge? Sure it is, but there’s no need to feel overwhelmed. <b>Success might be a matter of <a href="https://codeandpepper.com/2020/01/31/reliability-choosing-technology-partner/">choosing the right technology partner</a>, </b>who will make sure your app meets the key <strong>FinTech security standards</strong> and works like a charm at all times. </p>

		<p>I will eat twice a day, breakfast and lunch four hours later.<br>
Me, I am afraid of insulin. Alzheimer is diabetes type 3. After four hours of no eating there be no insulin in the blood and my mitocondrias switches over to use stored fat for fuel. That’s the food strategy.<br>
Some people say, “Thats not much of a variation”<br>
I say, “Cows only eat grass and wolfs only eat meat”<br>
Modern society is so boring and there is so much food that we have to be stimulated by spices and chefs and different foods to eat. At sea in a small boat its different. Life itself out there is so interesting that I do not need stimulants.<br>
My breakfast consists of one can of sardines, one slice of dense dark rye bread and muesli.<br>
One meal of muesli contains:<br>
Almond flour 25 grams<br>
Dried grinded blueberries 15 grams<br>
Whole milk powder 30 grams<br>
Oats flakes 60 grams<br>
Raisins 20 grams<br>
Walnuts 20 grams<br>
Total 170 grams of muesli for each meal<br>
My lunch is the same as breakfast but no sardines.<br>
I hope to make the voyage in about 300 days, but 2018 may turn out to be a bad year weather vise. To have a margin I will load Exlex with food for 400 days. The weight of that food is 240 kilos. It breaks down into:<br>
136 kilos muesli, 64 kilos sardines and 40 kilos bread.<br>
My water capacity is 56 liters. There are two rain catchers. Hopefully there will be some rain otherwise I have to beg.<br>
A big job is to vacuum pack the muesli and the bread and store it safely in Exlex.<br>
I will also have plenty of multivitamin/mineral supplements.<br>
I look forward to be out on the deep, wet, endless, eternal ocean eating muesli and sardines.<br>
To be continued…<br>
Regards Yrvind.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
		<p>At Bearer, we are a polyglot engineering team. Both in spoken languages and programming languages. Our stack is made up of services written in Node.js, Ruby, Elixir, and a handful of others in addition to all the languages our agent library supports. Like most teams, we balance using the right tool for the job with using the right tool for the time. Recently, we reached a limitation in one of our services that led us to transition that service from Node.js to Rust. This post goes into some of the details that caused the need to change languages, as well as some of the decisions we made along the way.</p><h2 id="a-bit-of-context"><strong>A bit of context</strong></h2><p>We are building a solution to help developers monitor their APIs. Every time a customer’s application calls an API, a log gets sent to us where we monitor and analyze it.</p><p>At the time of the issue, we were processing an average of 30k API calls per minute. That's a lot of API calls made across all our customers. We split the process into two key parts: Log ingestion and log processing.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/Log-ingestion-service---node.jpg" alt="Original architecture with Node.js" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Log-ingestion-service---node.jpg 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/Log-ingestion-service---node.jpg 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/Log-ingestion-service---node.jpg 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/Log-ingestion-service---node.jpg 2400w"></figure><p>We originally built the ingestion service in Node.js. It would receive the logs, communicate with an elixir service to check customer access rights, check rate limits using Redis, and then send the log to CloudWatch. There, it would trigger an event to tell our processing worker to take over.</p><p>We capture information about the API call, including the payloads (both the request and response) of every call sent from a user's application. These are currently limited to 1MB, but that is still a large amount of data to process. We send and process everything asynchronously and the goal is to make the information available to the end-user as fast as possible.</p><p>We hosted everything on AWS Fargate, a serverless management solution for Elastic Container Service (ECS), and set it to autoscale after 4000 req/min. Everything was great! Then, the invoice came 😱.</p><p>AWS invoices based on CloudWatch storage. The more you store, the more you pay.</p><p>Fortunately, we had a backup plan.</p><h2 id="kinesis-to-the-rescue"><strong>Kinesis to the rescue?</strong></h2><p>Instead of sending the logs to CloudWatch, we would use<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/"> Kinesis Firehose</a>. Kinesis Firehose is basically a Kafka equivalent provided by AWS. It allows us to deliver a data stream in a reliable way to several destinations. With very few updates to our log processing worker, we were able to ingest logs from both CloudWatch and Kinesis Firehose. With this change, daily costs would drop to about 0.6% of what they were before.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/Log-ingestion---node_kinesis.jpg" alt="Architecture after adding Kenesis" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Log-ingestion---node_kinesis.jpg 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/Log-ingestion---node_kinesis.jpg 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/Log-ingestion---node_kinesis.jpg 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/Log-ingestion---node_kinesis.jpg 2400w"></figure><p>The updated service now passed the log data through Kinesis and into s3 which triggers the worker to take over with the processing task. We rolled the change out and everything was back to normal... or we thought. Soon after, we started to notice some anomalies on our monitoring dashboard.</p><p><strong>We were Garbage Collecting</strong>, a lot. Garbage collection (GC) is a way for some languages to automatically free up memory that is no longer in use. When that happens, the program pauses. This is known as a <em>GC pause</em>. The more writes you make to memory, the more garbage collection needs to happen and as a result, the pause time increases. For our service, these pauses were growing high enough that they caused the servers to restart and put stress on the CPU. When this happens, it can look like the server is down—because it temporarily is—and our customers started to see 5xx errors for roughly 6% of the logs our agent was trying to ingest.</p><p>Below we can see the pause time and pause frequency of the garbage collection:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/gc-pause.jpg" alt="GC pause and frequency charts" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/gc-pause.jpg 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/gc-pause.jpg 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/gc-pause.jpg 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/gc-pause.jpg 2400w"></figure><p>In some instances, the pause time breached <strong>4 seconds</strong> (as shown on the left), with up to <strong>400 pauses per minute</strong> (as shown on the right) across our instances.</p><p>After some more research, we appeared to be another victim of a<a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/issues/329"> memory leak in the AWS Javascript SDK</a>. We tried increasing the resource allocations to extreme amounts, like autoscaling after 1000 req/min, but nothing worked.</p><h2 id="possible-solutions"><strong>Possible solutions</strong></h2><p>With our backup plan no longer an option, we moved on to new solutions. First, we looked at those with the easiest transition path.</p><h3 id="elixir"><strong>Elixir</strong></h3><p>As mentioned earlier, we are checking the customer access rights using an Elixir service. This service is private and only accessible from within our Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). We have never experienced any scalability issues with this service and most of the logic was already there. We could simply send the logs to Kinesis from within this service and skip over the Node.js service layer. We decided it was worth a try.</p><p>We developed the missing parts and tested it. It was better, but still not great. Our benchmarks showed that there were still high levels of Garbage Collecting, and we were still returning 5xx to our users when consuming the logs. At this point, the heavy load triggered a <a href="https://github.com/benoitc/hackney/issues/594">(now resolved) issue</a> with one of our elixir dependencies.</p><h3 id="go"><strong>Go</strong></h3><p>We considered Golang as well. It would have been a good candidate, but in the end, it is another Garbage Collected Language. While likely more efficient than our previous implementation, as we scale there is a high chance we'd run into similar problems. With these limitations in mind, we needed a better option.</p><h2 id="re-architecting-with-rust-at-the-core"><strong>Re-architecting with Rust at the core</strong></h2><p>In both our original implementation and our backup, the core issue remained the same: garbage collection. The solution was to move to a language with better memory management and no garbage collection. Enter Rust.</p><p>Rust isn't a garbage-collected language. Instead, it relies on a concept called <em>ownership</em>.</p><blockquote>Ownership is Rust’s most unique feature, and it enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector. <br>— <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html">The Rust Book</a></blockquote><p>Ownership is the concept that often makes Rust difficult to learn and write, but also what makes it so well suited for situations like ours. Each value in Rust has a single owner variable and as a result a single point of allocation in memory. Once that variable goes out of scope the memory is immediately returned.</p><p>Since the code required to ingest the logs is quite small, we decided to give it a try. To test this we addressed the very thing that we had issues with—sending large amounts of data to Kinesis.</p><p>Our first benchmarks proved to be very successful.</p><p>From that point, we were pretty confident that Rust could be the answer and we decided to flesh out the prototype into a production-ready application.</p><p>Over the course of these experiments, rather than directly replacing the original Node.js service with Rust, we restructured much of the architecture surrounding log ingestion. The core of the new service is an <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/">Envoy</a> proxy with the Rust application as a sidecar.</p><p>Now, when the Bearer Agent in a user's application sends log data to Bearer, it goes into the Envoy proxy. Envoy looks at the request and communicates with Redis to check things like rate limits, authorization details, and usage quotas. Next, the Rust application running alongside Envoy prepares the log data and passes it through Kinesis into an s3 bucket for storage. S3 then triggers our worker to fetch and process the data so Elastic Search can index it. At this point, our users can access the data in our dashboard.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/Log-ingestion---rust.jpg" alt="Diagram of new rust service" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Log-ingestion---rust.jpg 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/Log-ingestion---rust.jpg 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/Log-ingestion---rust.jpg 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/Log-ingestion---rust.jpg 2400w"></figure><p>What we found was that with fewer—and smaller—servers, we are able to process even more data without any of the earlier issues.</p><p>If we look at the latency numbers for the Node.js service, we can see peaks with an average response time nearing 1700ms.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/before-latency.png" alt="Latency with original Node.js service" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/before-latency.png 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/before-latency.png 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/before-latency.png 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/before-latency.png 2400w"></figure><p>With the Rust service implementation, the latency dropped to below 90ms, even at its highest peak, keeping the average response time below 40ms.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/after-latency.png" alt="Latency after re-architecture" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/after-latency.png 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/after-latency.png 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/after-latency.png 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/after-latency.png 2400w"></figure><p>The original Node.js application used about 1.5GB of memory at any given time, while the CPUs ran at around 150% load. The new Rust service used about 100MB of memory and only 2.5% of CPU load.</p><h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>As with most startups, we move fast. Sometimes the best solution at the time isn't the best solution forever. This was the case with Node.js. It allowed us to move forward, but as we grew we also outgrew it. As we started to handle more and more requests, we needed to make our infrastructure evolve to address the new requirements. While this process started with a fix that merely replaced Node.js with Rust, it led to a rethinking of our log ingestion service as a whole.</p><p>We still use a variety of languages throughout our stack, including Node.js, but will now consider Rust for new services where it makes sense.<br></p>

<p><em>At first, I didn’t know how it happened. How a dorky kid with no fashion sense was able to ditch the ugly sweater and wear a shirt and a tie on major events – sometimes even for breakfast. Was I suddenly obsessed by a fashion spirit or the covers of the modern magazines subconsciously recorded in my memory when I was walking past them on the street? It turns out, it wasn’t any of those things. I simply managed to settle in a glamorous looking crew of folks who shopped for new clothes as often as they checked their Instagram stories. Eventually, their fashion taste and erratic spending habits were quickly adopted by me.</em></p>



<p>Imagine a blank slate. That’s how the brain of a newborn looks like. Some scientists argue that there are certain traits embedded in our genes influencing our behavior, others claim that such nonsense does not exist.</p>



<p>What both groups agree with is the following: We’re all heavily influenced by the surrounding people.</p>



<p>It’s actually our biggest advantage over all other living organisms. Our development is based on imitation. Our ability to observe others, evaluate, and copy their moves is a vital skill that helps us survive and advance.</p>



<p>Yet, this same copying mechanism is also the reason we’re feeling worthless in the age of abundance. Our tendency to imitate what others are doing – and thinking – is the reason we’re carelessly spending our hard earn cash. Therefore, the more we obey the norms of the social circle we’re in, the more we become incapable of escaping the <a href="https://durmonski.com/well-being/internet-rabbit-holes/" target="_blank" aria-label="never-ending depths (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">never-ending depths</a> of the online world. A world full of comparison and erratic behavior.</p>



<p>The mere existence of the Other, as we’ll observe below, is both a blessing and a curse.</p>







<h2>Why Other People Are Both Good and Bad For Us?</h2>



<p>Let’s start with the good things.</p>



<p>You emerge from your mother’s womb. You cry. You crawl. You get up. You start to run. Eventually, at some point, you start to talk. Respectfully, if you’re born in Germany, you’ll call you dad “vader”. If you’re residing in the US, you’ll call him “father”. If you happen to appear in France, you’ll use the word “père”.</p>



<p>Same meaning, different words.</p>



<p>Obviously, you get why we use different words for the word father – because we’re exposed to different languages. If your parents are speaking English, the first language you’ll learn will be, unsurprisingly, English.</p>



<p>This is simple. We get that.</p>



<p>But what we often fail to realize is that we also adopt everything else our parents do. Every little act. Every little glimpse of emotion. We accumulate everything the surrounding people do, filter the stuff that are not relevant, and create a set of beliefs for ourselves that we’ll eventually use for (sometimes) the rest of our lives.</p>



<p>But it’s not only our parents. It’s everyone around us.</p>

That’s why, eventually, we wind up desiring the very same things.</figcaption></figure>







<p>The horde of people you expose yourself to is calibrating your persona and shaping it based on what you observe.</p>



<p>The gains here are clear: thanks to our ability to mimic the behavior of others we’re able to learn new skills, tactics, tricks, set of instructions that are essentially helping us live another day.</p>



<p>What about the downsides?</p>



<p>There are plenty.</p>



<p>But before we talk about how corrupting the influence of others is, we first need to explain the mimetic theory.</p>







<h2>How The Mimetic Theory is Influencing our Lives?</h2>



<p>René Girard, a French historian and polymath, is the father of this theory – <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/rene-girards-mimetic-theory/" target="_blank" aria-label="the mimetic theory (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the mimetic theory</a>. The goal of this concept is to explain our human behavior and from where our desires originate.</p>



<p>According to his views, our desires are a direct consequence of the desires of the surrounding people. Both people who we regularly see, in person, and such we highly admire.</p>



<p>As we concluded above, our behavior is based on imitation. But we’re not only imitating the moves and the actions of others. We also adopt the motives, the aspirations, the dreams of other people.</p>



<p>You might think that you want to go on an exotic vacation because you think that you are a free spirit and because you want to take a break from the world. In reality, though, according to the mimetic theory, you’re simply imitating what everyone else is doing. </p>



<p>Probably a celebrity you follow online is regularly posting pictures of her drinking cocktails on the beach. If that’s so, this behavior transports in your brain and you suddenly want to do the same thing.</p>



<p>This model of desire takes a triangular shape.</p>



<p>And it kind of looks like this:</p>



<figure><img width="1024" height="512" src="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-1024x512.jpg" alt="mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire" srcset="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-300x150.jpg 300w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-770x385.jpg 770w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-566x283.jpg 566w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-1151x575.jpg 1151w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-1481x740.jpg 1481w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-274x137.jpg 274w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-751x376.jpg 751w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-1381x691.jpg 1381w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20512'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-300x150.jpg 300w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-770x385.jpg 770w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-566x283.jpg 566w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-1151x575.jpg 1151w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-1481x740.jpg 1481w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-274x137.jpg 274w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-751x376.jpg 751w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-1381x691.jpg 1381w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire.jpg 2000w" data-lazy-src="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-1024x512.jpg"><figcaption>There is always a triangular relationship between the subject, the model, and the object. Through the object, the person feels that he’s getting closer to the model, whom Girard calls the mediator.</figcaption></figure>







<p>On the top, there is an ideal we strive towards. René Girard calls them mediators. On the right, are our actions, the things we want to obtain, that are always somehow related to this goal – the top. On the left is where we are currently.</p>



<p>Or to put it differently, our goals, ambitions, and longings are never truly our own. They are a mere reflection of what we see in the world around us and who we want to imitate.</p>



<p>Actually, if we dig even deeper into the mimetic theory, we can see that we never really know what we actually want. We always adopt the desires of others:</p>



<blockquote><p>Human desire is not based on the spontaneity of the subject’s desire, but rather the desires that surround the subject. He argues that humans do not themselves know what to desire; as a result, they imitate the desires of others.” Wolfgang Palaver from <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/rene-girards-mimetic-theory/" target="_blank" aria-label="René Girard’s Mimetic Theory (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">René Girard’s Mimetic Theory</a></p></blockquote>



<p>“This is not so bad,” you say. “What’s wrong with going to a distant island and taking a break? What’s wrong with wanting what others want?”</p>



<p>Not that traveling 10,000 miles and spending 10,000 USD is necessarily a bad thing to do.</p>



<p>But the point is different.</p>



<p>If you don’t take a step back to identify your own desires, the things <em>you </em>want to do, without considering what others want from you, you’ll always feel miserable. You’ll simply respond to what everyone else is doing and never find your genuine, true self – as banal as it might sound.</p>



<p>A person who is always imitating someone else is unable to trust his own judgment. That’s why, he desires only objects desired by others. And also, he always follows and never leads.</p>







<h2>The Bad Influence Of The Other</h2>



<p>Amongst many, a common “perk” that comes from imitating others is your longing to earn their approval.</p>



<p>As we observed, we strive to reach an ideal that is shaped by taking into account what everyone around us is wanting. But we don’t do it only because this will move us closer to a potentially god-like existence. We also do it because we want other people to approve of us.</p>



<p>This tear us from the inside.</p>



<p>Part of us wants to express our true nature while the other part wants to win the approval of others.</p>



<p>This forms the following inner conflict:</p>



<p>“To be myself or to be what others will accept me to be?”</p>



<p>If you focus on being your genuine, true self, without considering others and caring about their opinion – which is still influenced by other people in your life in some way – you will fail to gain their recognition. After all, your actions will be different from what is “accepted” as right in the group.</p>



<p>For example, if you’re mostly hanging around people who smoke and visit nightclubs, your reluctance to smoke and say yes to heavy drinking during the night will be badly perceived. After all, since everyone is doing it, and you’re not, you can’t expect their approval of you. Actually, your disobedience will cause them to question their own actions – something nobody wants. “Why don’t you go out with us? What do you think you are, better than us or what?”</p>



<p>Eventually, you’ll be left out of the group or you won’t enjoy a lot of attention from them.</p>



<p>The second scenario, if you decide to go along with the group and focus on “being someone who they will adore” – which is kind of sad if you decide to go in that direction – is still not going to be that easy. At least, if you have any will left.</p>



<p>For example, if you’re a bookworm, an introvert, an anime fanatic, and you start partying only because you want others to approve of you, you’ll be torn between your true self (the person <em>you </em>want to be) and the socially accepted self (the person you strive to become because others will like more).</p>



<p>Striving towards the socially accepted self, in the book <a aria-label="René Girard’s Mimetic Theory (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/rene-girards-mimetic-theory/" target="_blank">René Girard’s Mimetic Theory</a>, is called “bad faith”.</p>



<p>Your efforts to appear as this cool kid, which you’re not, at least still not, will put you out of your skin and make you look like an amateur, an imposture at first. When observed under a loop, your actions won’t look natural. After all, you’re pretending to be someone you’re not.<span id="easy-footnote-1-11482"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-11482" title="The person who coined the phrase &amp;#8220;bad faith&amp;#8221; is Jean-Paul Sartre.

It’s an in-between state of existence – you’re neither the person you really are nor the one you want to be.</figcaption></figure>







<p>You’re simply following a plan, a project, to be this cool kid. Therefore, you’re being someone you’re actually not. If you give yourself enough time, you’ll eventually become good at doing the things everyone else is doing. And eventually, the circles will collide. During the transition period, though, you’ll be a stranger to yourself.</p>







<h2>Our Consumption and our Media Habits are Greatly Influencing our Behavior</h2>



<p>So far, we’ve looked at how others shape our behavior and saw what we do to fit in a group – we’re essentially betraying ourselves.</p>



<p>But our desires are not formed only by our offline habits.</p>



<p>The mimetic theory emerged when <a href="https://durmonski.com/life-advice/why-i-quit-social-media/" target="_blank" aria-label="social media (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media</a> and the current modern media outlets were still not that influential. </p>



<p>Nowadays, what we become is also greatly influenced by what we consume online.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This article gives an argument on why services in microservices architecture should always be idempotent.
It might be obvious, but I don't see this mentioned often.
Key takeaway is that we need idempotence for retry logic.</p>
<h2 id="Byzantine-faults">Byzantine faults<a href="#Byzantine-faults" aria-label="Byzantine faults permalink"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 4 24 16"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a></h2>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault">Byzantine fault</a> is a condition of a system, where components may fail and there is unreliable information if a component has failed.
If a system is able to overcome these faults and continue to operate, it has <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/byzantine-fault-tolerance-explained">Byzantine fault tolerance</a> property.
An example of such a system is Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Specialized Byzantine problem is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Generals%27_Problem">Two Generals' Problem</a>, which shows impossibility of reaching consensus between two generals with finite number of messages.
Arbitrary communication failures may cause messages and corresponding acknowledgments to be dropped.
Solving it would require exchanging potentially infinite number of messages, which is impractical.
This also explains why exactly-once semantics is not possible.</p>
<h2 id="Inter-service-communication">Inter-service communication<a href="#Inter-service-communication" aria-label="Inter service communication permalink"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 4 24 16"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a></h2>
<p>Within microservices architecture, remote procedure calls and event handlers may fail due to connection issues.
Such failures are called <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/transient-faults">transient faults</a> and include the momentary loss of network connectivity to components and services, the temporary unavailability of a service, or timeouts that arise when a service is busy.</p>
<p>To increase availability of our system we should define a retry mechanism.
Retrying remote calls can be achieved by leveraging service mesh tools such as <a href="https://linkerd.io/">Linkerd</a> or <a href="https://istio.io/">Istio</a>.
Processing events is already retryable when using message brokers or data streaming tools that guarantee at-least-once delivery.</p>
<h2 id="Idempotence">Idempotence<a href="#Idempotence" aria-label="Idempotence permalink"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 4 24 16"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a></h2>
<p>Because retries can happen, services should always be idempotent—that is <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(x)=f(f(x))</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
Idempotence is required to prevent any unwanted side effects.
It also allows us to replay any request for debugging purposes.</p>
<p>Queries usually don't change the state of a system, so they're already idempotent.</p>
<p>Some operations, such as marking a blog post as draft, are naturally idempotent.
Setting a post's state can be repeated multiple times to the same result and without side effects.</p>
<p>Other operations need to be refactored to support retries, either naturally or explicitly.
Explicit idempotence can be provided for any operation by using "request id" to check if operation has already been executed.
A great example are Stripe's <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api/idempotent_requests">Idempotent Requests</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Considerations">Considerations<a href="#Considerations" aria-label="Considerations permalink"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 4 24 16"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a></h2>
<p>Errors need to be correctly classified as violations of business rules or transient faults.
If request fails due to rule violation, it doesn't make sense to retry it.</p>
<p>Observability is important.
Whether we're using centralized logging or tracing, logs should be interpreted with retries in mind.
Log lines are correlated by using a unique request ID.
Retries can propagate through upstream services and cause duplicate logs within a single request—and consequently harder to parse.</p>
<p>Similarly, analytics and metrics can contain duplicate records.
Retries should be properly considered for all pieces of infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#Conclusion" aria-label="Conclusion permalink"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 4 24 16"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a></h2>
<p>Basically, everything should be idempotent.
Retries should not have side effects.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><p>TLDR; Hopsworks provides support for machine learning (ML) experiments. That is, it can automatically track the artifacts, graphs, performance, logs, metadata, and dependencies of your ML programs.Many of you already know about platforms like <a href="https://mlflow.org/">MLflow</a>, so why should you read about Hopsworks Experiments?&nbsp; Because you do not have to rewrite your TensorFlow/PyTorch/Scikit-learn programs to get <strong>tracking and distributed ML for free</strong>, and TensorBoard comes built-in. We discuss how Hopsworks uniquely supports implicit provenance to transparently create metadata and how it is combined with the oblivious training function to make your training distribution transparent.&nbsp;</p><h2>Hopsworks Introduction</h2><p>Hopsworks is a single platform for both data science and data engineering that is available as both an <a href="http://github.com/logicalclocks/hopsworks">open-source platform</a> and a <a href="http://www.hopsworks.ai/">SaaS platform</a>, including a built-in <a href="https://www.logicalclocks.com/hopsworks-featurestore">feature store</a>. You can train models on GPUs at scale, easily install any Python libraries you want using pip/conda, run Jupyter notebooks as jobs, put those jobs in Airflow pipelines, and even write (Py)Spark or Flink applications that run at scale.&nbsp;</p><p>As a development environment, Hopsworks provides a central, collaborative development environment that enables machine learning teams to easily share results and experiments with teammates or generate reports for project stakeholders. All resources have strong security, data governance, backup and high availability support in Hopsworks, while assets are stored in a single distributed file system (with data stored on S3 in the cloud).<br></p><figure id="w-node-a0d33d55738e-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f74366329e691163a9537f8_mT5Xl3PGQNailTwXRoPhMMlEZePoa3PjlnagKaWj7mJxckcqP1SfcSbkOS3P-adIEnIq7kURxZ-TJ4ypWTt7yw94d_vqkB9o2FMTUrosMB8Pnxz0pPYkehYlOoJySGBdjPuDNQ7I.gif" alt=""></p><figcaption>A Hopsworks ML experiment stores information about your ML training run: logs, images, metrics of interest (accuracy, loss), the program used to train the model, its input training data, and the conda dependencies used.

The TensorBoard HParams plugin is also available to drill down further on the trials.</figcaption></figure><p>When you run a Python or PySpark application on the Hopsworks platform, it can create an<strong> experiment</strong> that includes both the traditional information a program generates (results, logs, errors) as well as ML-specific information to help track, debug, and reproduce your program and its inputs and outputs:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>hyperparameters</strong>: parameters for training runs that are not updated by the ML programs themselves;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>metrics</strong>: the loss or accuracy of the model(s) trained in this experiment;</li><li><strong>program artifacts</strong>: <em>python/pyspark/airflow</em> <em>programs, </em>and their <em>conda environments</em>;</li><li><strong>model artifacts</strong>: serialized <em>model objects,</em> <em>model schemas</em>, and <em>model checkpoints</em>;</li><li><strong>executions</strong>: information to be able to re-execute the experiment, including parameters, versioned features for input, output files,&nbsp; etc;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>versioned features</strong>: to be able to reproduce an experiment, we need the exact training/test data from the run and how it was created from the feature store;</li><li><strong>visualizations</strong>: images generated during training and score.

</p><p>Platforms that support experiment tracking require the user to refactor their training code in a function or some explicit scope (such as “with … as xx:” in MLFlow, see Appendix A) to identify when an experiment begins and when an experiment ends. In Hopsworks, we require the developer to write their training code inside a function.&nbsp;</p><p>We call this Python function an <em>oblivious training function</em> because the function is oblivious of whether it is being run on a Python kernel in a Jupyter notebook or on many workers in a cluster, see our <a href="https://www.logicalclocks.com/blog/unifying-single-host-and-distributed-machine-learning-with-maggy">blog </a>and <a href="https://www.logicalclocks.com/blog/unifying-single-host-and-distributed-machine-learning-with-maggy">Spark/AI summit talk</a> for details. That is, you write your training code once and reuse the same function when training a small model on your laptop or when performing hyperparameter tuning or distributed training on a large cluster of GPUs or CPUs.</p><p>We double down on this “wrapper” Python function by also using it to start/stop experiment tracking. Experiment tracking and distribution transparency in a single function, nice!&nbsp;</p><p>In Hopsworks, the <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/maggy">Maggy</a> library runs experiments, see code snippet above. As you can see, the only code changes a user needed compared to a best-practice TensorFlow program are:&nbsp;<br></p><ol role="list"><li>factor the training code in a user-defined function (<strong>def train(..):</strong>);</li><li>return a Python dict containing the results, images, and files that the user wants to be tracked for the experiment and accessible later in the Experiments UI; and</li><li>invoke the training function using the <em>experiment.lagom</em> function.<br></li></ol><p>The hyperparameters can be fixed for a single execution run, or as shown in the last 4 lines of the code snippet, you can execute the <em>train function </em>as a distributed hyperparameter tuning job across many workers in parallel (with GPUs, if needed).&nbsp;</p><p>Hopsworks will automatically:</p><ul role="list"><li>track all parameters of the train function as hyperparameters for this experiment,&nbsp;</li><li>auto-log using Keras callbacks in model.fit;</li><li>create a versioned directory in HopsFS, where a copy of the program, its conda environment, and all logs from all workers are aggregated;</li><li>track all provenance information for this application - input data from HopsFS used in this experiment (train/test datasets from the Feature Store), and all output artifacts (models, model checkpoints, application logs);</li><li>redirect all print statements executed in workers to the Jupyter notebook cell for easier debugging (see GIF below - each print statement is prefixed by the worker ID).<br></li></ul><figure id="w-node-756fb7ca0b23-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f74366291399a79d18af461_4BATblXBajOTlBXREg6utXoqcRgymvySZx03Hh_JeYvjJ7YLGzxYpnUgMwCvHaNxMFgj_XepZ23xJh3QFnfhHsAetRlt24IkRw4BI8R4Wo5gaQLkVuuIRRbE8CK7swOEJaa-Lm-k.gif" alt=""></p><figcaption>In Hopsworks, logs from workers can be printed in your Jupyter notebook during training. Take that Databricks!</figcaption></figure><h2>TensorBoard support</h2><p>
    -- CODE language-bash --
    
    def train():
    from maggy import tensorboard
    ...
    model.fit(.., callbacks=[TensorBoard(log_dir=tensorboard.logdir(),..)], ...)
</p><p>TensorBoard is arguably the most common and powerful tool used to visualize, profile and debug machine learning experiments. Hopsworks Experiments integrates seamlessly with TensorBoard. Inside the training function, the data scientist can simply import the <em>tensorboard</em> python<em> </em>module and get the folder location to write all the TensorBoard files. The content of the folder is then collected from each Executor and placed in the experiment directory in HopsFS. As TensorBoard supports showing multiple experiment runs in the same graph, visualizing and comparing multiple hyperparameter combinations becomes as simple as starting the TensorBoard integrated in the Experiments service. By default, Tensorboard is configured with useful plugins such as HParam, Profiler, and Debugging.&nbsp;</p><h3>Profiling and debugging</h3><p>Hopsworks 1.4.0 comes with TensorFlow 2.3, which includes the TensorFlow profiler. A new long-awaited feature that finally allows users to profile model training to identify bottlenecks in the training process such as slow data loading or poor operation placement in CPU + GPU configurations.&nbsp;</p><p>TensorFlow 2.3 also includes Debugger V2, making it easy to find model issues such as NaN which are non-trivial to find the root cause of in complex models.<br></p><figure id="w-node-821b5c19e74e-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f743661e73aacd6dc310040_Rywm-fmUfHouqW1zVdYsZ88LvtAYDvCZPpze3hHJeENCBjPVPkkpy_J-2bescj5Z-Xlb7A7DNpmNws1H4lsmUsuOpLROLO_S16jFM_CI-6JdACYY5Rp3Q3yYVMfkecV7aK7ECsf_.png" alt=""></p></figure><figure id="w-node-fc6081bc518f-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f743662849afea39f14cb69_S0v-cuc6N5MT4gsC3KUBFa3dQi7ZZBEaF9w684FzTrmXH4FPHkDEFCaMy2ThIpmSHDHSY-vmXCvXyDVrMVS_FYy3vnODkL8uXcHrm4uIlNjhNHHhsxoMghDrFfX_Yn_eVe1eYBbE.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Model Registry</h2><figure id="w-node-6cad6e721c68-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f743662ec097905b0778b6b_KcTuR12rSnRVQSSDh-eLxqM0ad3eAXSGCkehOJ8ik2BPfnohgCfudLLx7HkUIk3DKfTTxz-DzRwlJ7OAYU0eafq0bwSN2tYy7dt_rnOeth550yYPqa-esKRO6uGREvB1C4iNjk3l.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>In the training code models may be exported and saved to HopsFS. Using the <em>model </em>python module in the <a href="https://hops-py.logicalclocks.com/">hops library</a>, it is easy to version and attach meaningful metadata to models to reflect the performance of a given model version.&nbsp;</p><p>The Hopsworks Model Registry, is a service where all models are listed in addition to useful information such as which user created the model, different versions, time of creation and evaluation metrics such as accuracy.&nbsp;</p><p>The Model Registry provides functionality to filter based on the model name, version number and the user that exported the model. Furthermore the evaluation metrics of model versions can be sorted in the UI to find the best version for a given model.&nbsp;</p><p>In the Model Registry UI, you can also navigate to the experiment used to train the model, and from there to the train/test data used to train the model, and from there to the features in the feature store used to create the train/test data. Thanks, provenance!<br></p><h3>Exporting a model</h3><p>A model can be exported programmatically by using the <em>export</em> function in the <em>model</em> module. Prior to exporting the model, the experiment needs to have written a model to a folder or to a path on HopsFS. Then that path is supplied to the function along with the name of the model and the evaluation metrics that should be attached. The <em>export</em> call will upload the contents of the folder to your Models dataset and it will also appear in the Model Registry with an incrementing version number for each export.</p><p>
    -- CODE language-bash --
    from hops import model

# local path to directory containing model (e.g. .pb or .pk) 
path = os.getcwd() + “/model_dir”

# uploads path to the model repository, metadata is a dict of metrics</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

a playtester when the time comes.</p><p>For the past few months I’ve been writing my first ever indie game (in Rust).
It’s a 2D <span>puzzle-platformer</span> that I’m super
happy with so far. I think it’s pretty unique and I’m excited to see where it
goes. I’m quite stubborn and like things done a particular way so I’m not using
an off-the-shelf engine like Unity and I’m writing almost everything myself
except for some of the low-level libraries. It’s challenging and fun.</p><p>Anyway, some friends suggested I share what I’ve been doing. Until now, I’ve
been reluctant to because I already have heaps to do but I think it would be a
shame if this knowledge is lost (because I’ll inevitably forget). Therefore,
I’m going to try and write occasional gamedev notes and publish them here. I
don’t guarantee they’ll all make sense without extra context. I’m hoping to
refer back to them later, e.g. if I turn them into YouTube videos or something.</p><p>Most recently (the last few days) I’ve been working on adding water and
swimming to the game. Currently the player character is land-based and I wanted
to expand that out to add variety and a new set of constraints for the player
to grapple with. There are story reasons as well, but I won’t spoil it. Before
diving(!) in, here’s a quick demo of what I made this week:</p><figure><a href="https://tuzz.tech/videos/swimming-high-res.mp4" target="_blank"><video muted="" autoplay="" playsinline="" loop=""><source src="https://tuzz.tech/videos/swimming-low-res.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a><figcaption><span>▲</span><span>Demo of swimming in my game (click for a higher resolution)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It probably doesn’t look much compared to AAA games but I added a few niceties
to make it visually interesting and fun to navigate. The first thing I worked
on was a new component called <code><span><span>Liquid</span></span></code> that I can attach to a game entity. I
decided to use the more general term ‘liquid’ rather than ‘water’ because I
already use the term ‘solid’ and it seemed to fit better with the language of
my engine.</p><a href="#liquids"><h2 id="liquids">Liquids</h2></a><p>Here are the properties I can currently set on a liquid:</p><div><pre><code><span><span>Liquid </span><span>{</span><span></span></span><span><span>    direction_of_flow</span><span>:</span><span> Vector2f</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>0.2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span></span></span><span><span>    default_buoyancy</span><span>:</span><span> Buoyancy </span><span>{</span><span></span></span><span><span>      upthrust</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1.0</span><span>,</span><span></span></span><span><span>      drag_coefficients</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>0.15</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>.</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span></span></span><span><span>      jump_scale_factor</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0.4</span><span>,</span><span></span></span><span><span>      waterline</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0.3</span><span>,</span><span></span></span><span><span>      settle_rate</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0.01</span><span>,</span><span></span></span><span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></span><span><span></span><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Before I can do anything interesting with these properties, I first need to
know which entities are ‘submerged’ in the liquid. I created a resource called
<code><span><span>SubmergedEntities</span></span></code> that tracks this and a system that incrementally keeps this
resource up to date based on which entities have moved since the last update. I
consider an entity ‘submerged’ if its bounding box overlaps with the liquid,
even slightly. In other parts of the code I need to distinguish ‘partially’
versus ‘fully’ submerged, but I check this as needed.</p><p>With that out of the way, I wrote a <code><span><span>LiquidPhysics</span></span></code> system that applies these
properties to submerged entities. I made it so this only applies to those that
have a <code><span><span>Mass</span></span></code> component so that static geometry (e.g. the floor) isn’t
affected. I initially tried to make <code><span><span>LiquidPhysics</span></span></code> work in harmony with my
existing <code><span><span>GravityPhysics</span></span></code> system but that turned out to be really fiddly so I
abandoned that. Instead, it’s one or the other: if an entity is submerged,
<code><span><span>LiquidPhysics</span></span></code> handles it. If it is not, <code><span><span>GravityPhysics</span></span></code> does.</p><p>Here’s a quick summary of what each properties does:</p><ul><li><strong>direction_of_flow:</strong> controls the direction/speed entities move in the liquid</li><li><strong>upthrust:</strong> the same as above but only for the y-direction</li><li><strong>drag_coefficients:</strong> controls how rapidly an entity reaches the flow velocity when it’s not moving at that velocity, e.g. if the player jumps into some water, they will initially be travelling much faster than it</li><li><strong>jump_scale_factor:</strong> when an entity is ‘walking underwater’, i.e. it is standing on the ground in liquid, this parameter reduces the velocity applied when it jumps</li><li><strong>waterline:</strong> when an entity is floating at the top of the liquid, this parameter controls how high it naturally sits above the liquid, as a fraction of height</li><li><strong>settle rate:</strong> when an entity isn’t sitting at its waterline, this parameter controls how quickly it converges to it</li></ul><p>There’s quite a lot going on here but <code><span><span>LiquidPhysics</span></span></code> didn’t turn out too
complicated, only 100 lines or so. I did a bunch of reading about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_velocity" target="_blank">terminal
velocity</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics)" target="_blank">drag</a> before writing it which
helped. The reason most of the properties are nested in a <code><span><span>default_buoyancy</span></span></code>
field is so I can override them on a per-entity basis. For example, I might
want something to float on the surface while everything else sinks or to set a
lower waterline for a pirate ship.</p><a href="#swimming"><h2 id="swimming">Swimming</h2></a><p>I probably spent most of my time working on the swimming controls. I watched a
few videos of how swimming is typically handled in 2D games. In <a href="https://youtu.be/1wR8x5b_ExM?t=298" target="_blank">Super
Mario</a>, the swimming is a bit like jumping.
The player constantly sinks and swims up by jumping. They stay upright at all
times. I eventually got a nostalgia trip watching how swimming works in <a href="https://youtu.be/lSbLrWRLWl4?t=51" target="_blank">Ecco
the Dolphin</a>. I never really understood what
to do in that game but I remember it being fun to play. I like that the
character rotates to face the direction they’re heading. The boost is fun, too.</p><p>Currently, the on-land controls of my game are very responsive - you can
immediately switch directions. I figured it would be a nice change to introduce
some delay in water so you first have to turn to face the direction you want to
go, perhaps bumping into a wall along the way. You effectively always move in
the direction your head is pointing and turn at some arbitrary rate I can
control. Most people are better on land than in water so this fits well with
reality. Another minor reason for choosing this was that my engine works with
arbitrary transforms - it’s richer than a tile-based engine, which many 2D
games are built on, so I figured I may as well make use of this capability. If
I add analogue controller support, I can see it working well with that, too.</p><p>The way this works is by mapping the direction you’re pressing to one of the
eight intercardinal directions. I use the nautical term
‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Course_(navigation)" target="_blank">course</a>’ for this. I then
get the angle the player is current facing which I call its
‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heading_(navigation)" target="_blank">heading</a>’ and figure out
which direction to turn to get there soonest. This is a bit fiddly because
angles wrap around and are usually in the range -PI to PI (from the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atan2" target="_blank"><code><span><span>atan2</span></span></code></a> function). Rust has a
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f32.html#method.rem_euclid" target="_blank"><code><span><span>rem_euclid</span></span></code></a>
function that helps with this. In the case when the player switches to the
opposite direction (e.g. left to right), either direction works. I decided to
arbitrarily* turn counter-clockwise.</p><p>Some things I added later were ‘hold space to boost’ (inspired by Ecco) and
automatic uprighting. If the player is idle, it seemed a bit weird to just
leave them hanging upside down in water so after a couple of seconds, I rotate
them back to their upright position. I quite liked the possibility of using
this for some tricky puzzle later in the game. Maybe there’s a spike-ridden
section that requires very fine turns and requires you to rotate back to your
upright position, rather than holding up and turning in a wider arc. That’s
pretty contrived, though.</p><p>One thing that caused me a headache was what to do at the surface of the water.
What was basically happening was the player was swimming past the waterline and
out of the liquid. They were then falling back down again when <code><span><span>GravityPhysics</span></span></code>
kicked in, flipping between the two. It was very glitchy. My solution to this
was to introduce some logic for
‘<a href="https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/95478/bobbing-in-the-water" target="_blank">bobbing</a>’
on the water. I tried a few variations but eventually settled on a simple
approach that allowed the player to keep swimming up for a small amount of time
above their waterline but at a greatly reduced speed. After which, they’d drop
down (at the same speed) until below the waterline where they could ‘bob up’
again.</p><p>To control the swim speed and rate they turn in water, I added <code><span><span>swim_speed</span></span></code> and
<code><span><span>turn_rate</span></span></code> to my pre-existing <code><span><span>Agility</span></span></code> component that controls things like
the player’s foot speed and width of their jump arc.</p><a href="#walking-underwater"><h2 id="walking-underwater">Walking underwater</h2></a><p>I decided I wanted the player to be able to walk at the bottom of the liquid.
That’s kind of how it works in reality and it didn’t <em>seem</em> like it would be
hard to add. I basically distinguish between being ‘suspended’ in the liquid
and not (e.g. when walking at the bottom). When you’re not suspended, the
player controls fall through to the already existing walking/jumping controls
but with a few changes, mostly just slowing the player down and reducing their
jump velocity (using the <code><span><span>jump_scale_factor</span></span></code> I mentioned earlier). You also
can’t boost to go faster.</p><p>The slight difficulty here is that normally, gravity is pushing down on you,
which keeps you on the ground. If you swim down to the ground but then stop
pressing down, it doesn’t know you’re still ‘touching’ the ground because
there’s nothing pushing you into it each update (unless the liquid has negative
flow in the y-direction). Maybe this isn’t a problem for better engines than
mine, but my fix was to basically constantly apply a negative velocity of the
player’s swim speed to keep them anchored on the ground after reaching it. I
like this solution because it means if the liquid has a lot of upthrust - more
than the player’s swim speed - they won’t be able to ‘cheat’ and stick to the
ground when they shouldn’t be able to. Similarly, my solution for bobbing on
the water has a similar property. Once you’re pushed under the water, its flow
takes over and out-paces your swim speed.</p><p>A problem I ran into at this point was with accidentally killing the player.
When walking on the ground, i first reset the player’s rotation so they’re
upright, but if they’re too close to the ground (swimming parallel to it), this
can sometimes place the player entity inside the ground. I have some code that
tries to detect if the player has been crushed based on the magnitude of
collision response. This can sometimes trip and kill the player. Not good!</p><p>My solution (read: hack) for this is to give the player a ‘free pass’ from the
grim reaper for a single frame - the exact moment their rotation is reset. I
also re-position the player slightly to reduce the size of this collision and
hopefully prevent any …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>Common C++ guidelines are to initialize variables on use and to make variables <code>const</code> whenever possible.
But sometimes a variable is unchanged once initialized and the initialization is complex, like involving a loop.
Then an <a href="https://www.bfilipek.com/2016/11/iife-for-complex-initialization.html">IIFE</a> – immediately-invoked function expression – can be used: the variable is initialized by a lambda that computes the value, which is then immediately invoked to produce the value.
Then the variable is initialized on use and can also be made <code>const</code>.</p>
<p>I’ve been recently working on a meta-programming library where I found IIFEs useful in a slightly different context – computing type information.</p>
<p>TL;DR: <code>decltype([] { ... } ())</code>!</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="the-challenge-value_type_of">The Challenge: <code>value_type_of</code></h2>
<p>For the sake of this blog post, let’s suppose we want to implement a type trait that given a container computes the value type of the container.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> <span>Container</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>using</span> <span>value_type_of</span> <span>=</span> <span>…</span><span>;</span> <span>// TBD
</span><span></span>
<span>value_type_of</span><span>&lt;</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>i</span><span>;</span> <span>// int
</span><span></span><span>value_type_of</span><span>&lt;</span><span>float</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span> <span>// float
</span></code></pre></div><blockquote>
<p>I really dislike the standard library convention of having either <code>typename trait::type</code> or <code>trait_t</code> – type aliases make it unnecessary.
Let’s not copy that mistake here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the behavior of <code>value_type_of</code> that I want:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the type has a <code>::value_type</code> member (like standard library containers), return that.</li>
<li>If the type is an array, return the element type of the array.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the type trait is ill-formed.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>For simplicity, let’s not worry about oddities like <code>const Container</code> or arrays without size <code>T[]</code>.
Even so, this specification is somewhat vague about an edge case; can you see it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can make an immediate observation: as the type trait should be ill-formed if we pass it something that is neither an array nor has <code>::value_type</code>,
we don’t need to do the compile-time – and (pre C++20) syntactical – expensive check for <code>::value_type</code>.
We can just handle arrays in one way and use <code>::value_type</code> for everything else.
If the type doesn’t have <code>::value_type</code>, the trait is ill-formed automatically.</p>
<h2 id="first-attempt">First Attempt</h2>
<p>This is a very straightforward implementation of <code>value_type_of</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> <span>Container</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>value_type_of_impl</span> <span>// default, non-array
</span><span></span><span>{</span>
    <span>using</span> <span>type</span> <span>=</span> <span>typename</span> <span>Container</span><span>::</span><span>value_type</span><span>;</span> 
<span>};</span>

<span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> <span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>size_t</span> <span>N</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>value_type_of_impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>[</span><span>N</span><span>]</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>// arrays
</span><span></span><span>{</span>
    <span>using</span> <span>type</span> <span>=</span> <span>T</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> <span>Container</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>using</span> <span>value_type_of</span> <span>=</span> <span>typename</span> <span>value_type_of_impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Container</span><span>&gt;::</span><span>type</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>As we don’t have <code>if</code> for types, we need specialization to distinguish between arrays and non-arrays.
And as we can’t specialize type aliases, we need to introduce a helper class template.</p>
<p>It works, but is verbose.
Let’s try something better.</p>
<h2 id="second-attempt">Second Attempt</h2>
<p>While we don’t have <code>if</code> for types, we do have <code>std::conditional</code>(<code>_t</code>…).
It takes a <code>bool</code> and two types and selects either the first one or the second, depending on the <code>bool</code>.
Look at that, this is what we want!</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> <span>Container</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>using</span> <span>value_type_of</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>conditional_t</span><span>&lt;</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>is_array_v</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Container</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>// if
</span><span></span>                  <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>remove_extent_t</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Container</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>// then
</span><span></span>                  <span>typename</span> <span>Container</span><span>::</span><span>value_type</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span> <span>// else
</span></code></pre></div><p>We’re checking whether the container is an array using <code>std::is_array</code>(<code>_v</code>…).
If so, we’re using <code>std::remove_extent</code>(<code>_t</code>…) to get the element type, otherwise, we’re taking <code>Container::value_type</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The choice of using <code>std::remove_extent</code> here and the specialization for <code>T[N]</code> above answer the edge case I’ve hinted at earlier.
What is <code>value_type_of&lt;int[2][2]&gt;</code>? <code>int[2]</code> or <code>int</code>?
My implementation says <code>int[2]</code>;
if you want <code>int</code> you need more specializations in the first attempt and <code>std::remove_all_extents</code>(<code>_t</code>…) in the second attempt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is more concise than the first attempt, but ugly.</p>
<p>More importantly, it doesn’t work!</p>
<p>Consider what happens when we write <code>value_type_of&lt;float[3]&gt;</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>conditional_t</span><span>&lt;</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>is_array_v</span><span>&lt;</span><span>float</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>// true
</span><span></span>                <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>remove_extent_t</span><span>&lt;</span><span>float</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>// float
</span><span></span>                <span>typename</span> <span>float</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span><span>::</span><span>value_type</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span> <span>// error! 
</span></code></pre></div><p>Even though the second argument to <code>std::conditional_t</code> doesn’t matter, it is still there!
And <code>typename float[3]::value_type</code> is ill-formed, because a <code>float</code> array doesn’t have <code>::value_type</code>.</p>
<p>So we need to do better.</p>
<h2 id="third-attempt">Third Attempt</h2>
<p>What we need is some sort of <code>if constexpr</code> based version of <code>std::conditional_t</code>.
While something like that <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/34282462">is possible</a>, let’s <em>finally</em> use IIFE which allows the actual <code>if constexpr</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> <span>Container</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>using</span> <span>value_type_of</span> <span>=</span> <span>decltype</span><span>([]{</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>constexpr</span> <span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>is_array_v</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Container</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span>
          <span>return</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>remove_extent_t</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Container</span><span>&gt;</span><span>{};</span>
      <span>else</span>
          <span>return</span> <span>typename</span> <span>Container</span><span>::</span><span>value_type</span><span>{};</span>
  <span>}());</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Just like in the traditional use case of IIFE, we initialize the alias with a lambda that we’re immediately invoking to get the value.
But here we need a <em>type</em>, not a <em>value</em>, so we need to surround the whole thing with <code>decltype()</code>.
The advantage of this syntactic noise is that we can have the full power of the language - in this case <code>if constexpr</code> to implement the type trait.</p>
<p>Alas, we’re not quite done.
Note that we need to return a <em>value</em> of the appropriate type, as that’s what the language rules require.
Here, we’re just returning a default constructed object, which doesn’t work if the type does not have a default constructor.</p>
<h2 id="final-solution">Final Solution</h2>
<p>As the lambda isn’t actually executed – it is only there to compute a return type – it doesn’t really matter <em>how</em> we’ve obtained the value we return.
This is what <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/declval"><code>std::declval</code></a> was designed for: to obtain a value in a context where the value isn’t actually used, only its type.
Unfortunately, the value is used <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5cnqqM">“too much”</a> for <code>std::declval</code>; we need our own:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Using lambdas to compute types is definitely less verbose and can allow for clearer code than the classical TMP way of using specializations.
The downside is some syntactic noise around the definition – although you’re definitely skipping it after a while if you’re getting used to the pattern.
It’s also a bit verbose to return the type information, because C++ functions can’t return <code>typename</code> (yet).</p>
<p>I should point out that using lambdas in <code>decltype()</code> is a C++20 feature; if you need to support older versions you need a regular named function with <code>auto</code> return type:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> <span>Container</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>auto</span> <span>value_type_of_</span><span>()</span>

October 2, 2020 | http://stratus3d.com/blog/2020/09/30/performance-of-elixirs-system-get-env-function/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://stratus3d.com/blog/2020/09/30/performance-of-elixirs-system-get-env-function/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At work I was debugging a performance issue in one of our Elixir applications and stumbled across the strange implementation of Elixir’s <code>System.get_env/0</code> function. In this blog post I’ll show how it caused performance issues for the application I was debugging and I’ll also propose a better implementation of the function. I’ll conclude by explaining why the better implementation is not used yet.</p>
<div>
<h2 id="_background">Background</h2>
<div>
<p>The response times for the application I was debugging had suddenly gotten slower and nobody was sure why. Some configuration changes had recently been made, but none of the changes should have degraded the performance as much as they did. Response times from the HTTP API were 2-3 times slower than they were prior to the configuration change. I ran <a href="http://stratus3d.com/blog/2020/08/17/elixir-flame-graphs/">eflame on the Elixir request handling code</a> and found the culprit - all of our time was spent in calls to <code>System.get_env/0</code>. The flame graph revealed that we were calling <code>System.get_env/0</code> <strong>several dozen times per request</strong>. While odd, it was an easy thing to fix. I changed the code so that <code>System.get_env/0</code> was invoked once at startup, and the values we needed were stored in the application environment and were then retrieved by the code that originally called <code>System.get_env/0</code>. The environment variables are never changed while this application is running so caching the values was safe to do.</p>
<p>After the fix was made response times were about 3 times faster than they had ever been for this particular HTTP API. While I knew the dozens of calls to <code>System.get_env/0</code> were the problem I began to wonder why this particular function call was so slow. The request handling code did lots of things when handling these requests. Why did <code>System.get_env/0</code> become the bottleneck?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_the-peculiar-implementation-of-system-get_env0">The Peculiar Implementation of <code>System.get_env/0</code></h2>
<div>
<p>Here is the implementation of <code>System.get_env/0</code> for <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/blob/v1.10.3/lib/elixir/lib/system.ex#L438">Elixir 1.9</a>:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="system.ex">@spec get_env() :: %{optional(String.t()) =&gt; String.t()}
def get_env do
  Enum.into(:os.getenv(), %{}, fn var -&gt;
    var = IO.chardata_to_string(var)
    [k, v] = String.split(var, "=", parts: 2)
    {k, v}
  end)
end</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The implementation is fairly simple but it is surprising to see the code splitting the binary on the <code>=</code> character. It is not clear why this is needed. Let us look at Erlang’s <code>:os.getenv/0</code> <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/667ce1a7b2c1b5a84593be3726654a095af374b1/lib/kernel/src/os.erl#L118">function</a>:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="erlang"><span>-</span><span>spec</span> <span>getenv</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>env_var_name_value</span><span>()].</span>
<span>getenv</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>[</span><span>lists</span><span>:</span><span>flatten</span><span>([</span><span>Key</span><span>,</span> <span>$=</span><span>,</span> <span>Value</span><span>])</span> <span>||</span> <span>{</span><span>Key</span><span>,</span> <span>Value</span><span>}</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>os</span><span>:</span><span>list_env_vars</span><span>()</span> <span>].</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here we can see that <code>:os.getenv/0</code> combines the environment variable name and value with the equals sign used as the delimiter between them. <code>os:list_env_vars()</code> fetches the environment variables and returns a keyword list (or proplist as they are called in Erlang). So Erlang’s <code>os:getenv/0</code> combines the variable name and value and then Elixir’s <code>System.get_env/0</code> turns around and splits them apart again! The Elixir function undoes all the work that Erlang’s <code>os:getenv/0</code> function does! This extra work makes this code slower than it needs to be, and because these operations are performed for each variable, the performance of the function is tied inversely to the number of environment variables present.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_a-better-implementation">A Better Implementation</h2>
<div>
<p>With what we know about the <code>System.get_env/0</code> code we can easily create a better implementation. A simpler solution would be to use <code>os:list_env_vars/0</code> directly:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="system.ex">@spec get_env() :: %{optional(String.t()) =&gt; String.t()}
def get_env do
  Enum.into(:os.list_env_vars(), %{})
end</code></pre>
</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_performance-comparison">Performance Comparison</h2>
<div>
<p>Comparing the performance of both implementations using Benchee reveals that the improved version is indeed faster, although both implementations are probably fast enough for most uses:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code>Operating System: Linux

</div>
</div>
<p>This was run on my laptop with 90 environment variables set.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<div>

<p>Until new versions of Erlang and Elixir are released with the improved implementation it is best to assume <code>System.get_env/0</code> calls are going to be slow. If you need faster performance it is probably best to cache the results of the first <code>System.get_env/0</code> in application config like I did. Of course you’ll need to make sure the environment variables aren’t going to change if you go this route.</p>

<p><span><span>2</span>Jul/16</span><span><a href="http://blog.kevmod.com/2016/07/why-is-python-slow/#comments">7</a></span></p>

<p>In case you missed it, Marius recently wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.pyston.org/2016/06/30/baseline-jit-and-inline-caches/">a post on the Pyston blog</a>&nbsp;about our baseline JIT tier. &nbsp;Our baseline JIT sits between our interpreter tier and our LLVM JIT tier, providing better speed than the interpreter tier but lower startup overhead than the LLVM tier.</p>
<p>There's been some discussion over on&nbsp;<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12010244">Hacker News</a>, and the discussion turned to a commonly mentioned question: if LuaJIT can have a fast interpreter, why can't we use their ideas and make Python fast? &nbsp;This is related to a number of other questions, such as "why can't Python be as fast as JavaScript or Lua", or "why don't you just run Python on a preexisting VM such as the JVM or the CLR". &nbsp;Since these questions are pretty common I thought I'd try to write a blog post about it.</p>
<p>The fundamental issue is:</p>
<h3>Python&nbsp;spends almost all of its time in the C runtime</h3>
<p>This means that&nbsp;it doesn't really matter how quickly you execute the "Python" part of Python. &nbsp;Another way of saying this is that Python opcodes are very complex, and the cost of executing them dwarfs the cost of dispatching them. &nbsp;Another analogy I give is that executing Python is more similar to rendering HTML than it is to executing JS -- it's more of a description of what the runtime should do rather than an explicit step-by-step account of how to do it.</p>
<p>Pyston's performance improvements come from speeding up the C code, not the Python code. &nbsp;When people say "why doesn't Pyston use [insert favorite JIT technique here]", my question is whether that technique would help speed up C code. &nbsp;I think this is the most fundamental misconception about Python performance: we spend our energy trying to JIT C code, not Python code. &nbsp;This is also why I am not very interested in running Python on pre-existing VMs, since that will only exacerbate the problem in order to fix something that isn't really broken.</p>

<p>I think another thing to consider is that a lot of people have invested a lot of time into reducing Python interpretation overhead. &nbsp;If it really was as simple as "just porting LuaJIT to Python", we would have done that by now.</p>
<p>I gave a talk on this recently, and you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10j9T4odf67mBSIJ7IDFAtBMKP-DpxPCKWppzoIfmbfQ/edit?usp=sharing">find the slides here</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/691243/">a LWN writeup here</a> (no video, unfortunately). &nbsp;In the talk I gave some evidence for my argument that interpretation overhead is quite small, and some motivating examples of C-runtime slowness (such as a slow for loop that doesn't involve any Python bytecodes).</p>
<p>One of the questions from the audience was "are there actually any people that think that Python performance is about interpreter overhead?". &nbsp;They seem to not read HN :)</p>

<h3>Update: why is the Python C runtime slow?</h3>
<p>Here's the example I gave in my talk illustrating the slowness of the C runtime. &nbsp;This is a for loop written in Python, but that doesn't execute any Python bytecodes:</p>
<pre>import itertools
sum(itertools.repeat(1.0, 100000000))</pre>
<p>The amazing thing about this is that if you write the equivalent loop in native JS, V8 can run it <strong>6x faster</strong> than CPython. &nbsp;In the talk I mistakenly attributed this to boxing overhead, but Raymond Hettinger kindly pointed out that CPython's sum() has an optimization to avoid boxing when the summands are all floats (or ints). &nbsp;So it's not boxing overhead, and it's not dispatching on tp_as_number-&gt;tp_add to figure out how to add the arguments together.</p>
<p>My current best explanation is that it's not so much that the C runtime is slow at any given thing it does, but it just has to do a lot. &nbsp;In this itertools example, about 50% of the time is dedicated to catching floating point exceptions. &nbsp;The other 50% is spent figuring out how to iterate the itertools.repeat object, and checking whether the return value is a float or not. &nbsp;All of these checks are fast and well optimized, but they are done every loop iteration so they add up. &nbsp;A back-of-the-envelope calculation says that CPython takes about 30 CPU cycles per iteration of the loop, which is not very many, but is proportionally much more than V8's 5.</p>

<p>I thought I'd try to respond to a couple other points that were brought up on HN (always a risky proposition):</p>
<p><strong>If JS/Lua can be fast why don't the Python folks&nbsp;get their act together and be fast?</strong></p>
<p>Python is a much, much more dynamic language that even JS. &nbsp;Fully talking about that probably would take another blog post, but I would say that the increase in dynamicism from JS-&gt;Python is larger than the increase going from Java-&gt;JS. &nbsp;I don't know enough about Lua to compare but it sounds&nbsp;closer to JS than to Java or Python.</p>
<p><strong>Why don't we rewrite the C runtime in Python and then JIT it?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, I think this is a good idea in that it's tackling what I think is actually the issue with Python performance. &nbsp;I have my worries about it as a specific implementation plan, which is why Pyston has chosen to go a different direction.</p>
<p>If you're going to rewrite the runtime into another language, I don't think Python would be a very good choice. &nbsp;There are just too many warts/features in the language, so even if you could somehow get rid of 100% of the dynamic overhead I don't think you'd end up ahead.</p>
<p>There's also the practical consideration of how much C code there is in the C runtime and how long it would take to rewrite (CPython is &gt;400kLOC, most of which is the runtime). &nbsp;And there are a ton of extension modules out there written in C that we would like to be able to run, and ideally some day be able to speed up as well. &nbsp;There's certainly disagreement in the Python community about the C-extension ecosystem, but my opinion is that that is as much a part of the Python language as the syntax is (you need to support it to be considered a Python implementation).</p>

October 2, 2020 | https://deislabs.io/posts/a-fistful-of-states/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://deislabs.io/posts/a-fistful-of-states/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

<p>Earlier this year, DeisLabs released Krustlet, a project to implement Kubelet
in Rust. <sup id="fnref:Fisher"><a href="#fn:Fisher">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:Squillace"><a href="#fn:Squillace">2</a></sup> Kubelet is the component of Kubernetes that
runs on each node which is assigned Pods by the control plane and runs them on
its node. Krustlet defines a flexible API in the <code>kubelet</code> crate, which allows
developers to build Kubelets to run new types of workloads. The project
includes two such examples, which can run Web Assembly workloads on WASI or
waSCC runtimes. <sup id="fnref:wasmtime"><a href="#fn:wasmtime">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:waSCC"><a href="#fn:waSCC">4</a></sup> Beyond this, I have been working to
develop a Rust Kubelet for traditional Linux containers using the Container
Runtime Interface (CRI). <sup id="fnref:krustlet-cri"><a href="#fn:krustlet-cri">5</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:CRI"><a href="#fn:CRI">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Over the last few releases, Krustlet has focused on expanding the functionality
of these Web Assembly Kubelets, such as adding support for init containers,
fixing small bugs, and log streaming. This, in turn, has built quite a bit of
interest in alternative workloads and node architectures on Kubernetes, as well
as demonstrated the many strengths of Rust for development of these types of
applications.</p>

<p>For the <code>v0.5.0</code> release, we turned our attention to the internal architecture
of Krustlet, in particular how Pods move through their lifecycle, how
developers write this logic, and how updates to the Kubernetes control plane
are handled. <sup id="fnref:Pod-Lifecycle"><a href="#fn:Pod-Lifecycle">7</a></sup> We settled upon a state machine implementation
which should result in fewer bugs and greater fault tolerance. This refactoring
resulted in substantial changes for consumers of our API; however we believe
this will result in code that is much easier to reason about and maintain. For
an excellent summary of these changes, and description of how you can migrate
code that depends on the <code>kubelet</code> crate, please see Taylor Thomas’ excellent
<a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet/releases/tag/v0.5.0">Release Notes</a>.
In this post I will share a deep dive into our new architecture and the
development journey which led to it.</p>

<h2 id="the-trailhead">The Trailhead</h2>

<p>Before <code>v0.5.0</code>, developers wishing to implement a Kubelet using Krustlet
primarily needed to implement the <code>Provider</code> trait, which allowed them to write
methods for handling events like <code>add</code>, <code>delete</code>, and <code>logs</code> for Pods scheduled
to that node. This offered a lot of flexibility, but was a very low-level API.
We identified a number of issues with this architecture:</p>

<ul>
<li>The entire lifecycle of a Pod was defined in 1 or 2 monolithic methods of the
<code>Provider</code> trait. This resulted in messy code and a very poor understanding
of error handling in the many phases of a Pod’s lifecycle.</li>
<li>Pod and Container status patches to the Kubernetes control plane were
scattered throughout the codebase, both in the <code>kubelet</code> crate and the
<code>Provider</code> implementations. This made it very difficult to reason about what
was actually reported back to the user and when, and involved lot of repeated
code.</li>
<li>Unlike the Go Kubelet, if Krustlet encountered an error it would report the
error back to Kubernetes and then (most of the time) end execution of the
Pod. There was no built-in notion of the reconciliation loop that one expects
from Kubernetes.</li>
<li>We recognized that a lot of these issues were left to each developer to
solve, but were things that any Kubelet would need to handle. We wanted to
move this kind of logic into the <code>kubelet</code> crate, so that each provider did
not have to reinvent things.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h2>

<p>At its core, Kubernetes relies on declarative (mostly immutable) manifests, and
controllers which run reconciliation loops to drive cluster state to match this
configuration. Kubelet is no exception to this, with its focus being
indivisible units of work, or Pods. Kubelet simply monitors for changes to Pods
that have been assigned to it by <code>kube-scheduler</code>, and runs a loop to attempt
to run this work on its node. In fact, I would describe Kubelet as no different
from any other Kubernetes controller, except that it has the additional
first-class capability for streaming logs and exec sessions. However these
capabilities, as they are implemented in Krustlet, are orthogonal to this
discussion.</p>

<p>Our goal with this rewrite was to ensure that Krustlet would mirror the official
Kubelet’s behavior as closely as possible. We found that many details about
this behavior are undocumented, and spent considerable time running the
application to infer its behavior and inspecting the Go source code. Our
understanding is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Kubelet watches for Events on Pods that have been scheduled to it by
<code>kube-scheduler</code>.</li>
<li>When a Pod is added, the Kubelet enters a control loop to attempt to run the
Pod which only exits when the Pod is <code>Completed</code> (all containers
exit successfully) or <code>Terminated</code> (Pod is marked for deletion via the
control plane and execution is interrupted).</li>
<li>Within the control loop, there are various steps such as <code>Image Pull</code>,
<code>Starting</code>, etc., as well as back-off steps which wait some time before
retrying the Pod. At each of these steps, the Kubelet updates the control
plane.</li>
</ul>

<p>We recognized this pretty quickly as a finite-state machine design pattern,
which consists of infallible state handlers and valid state transitions. This
allows us to address the issues mentioned above:</p>

<ul>
<li>Break up the <code>Provider</code> trait methods for running the Pod into short,
single-focus state handler methods.</li>
<li>Consolidate status patch code to where a Pod enters a given state.</li>
<li>Include error and back-off states in the state graph, and only stop
attempting to execute a Pod on <code>Terminated</code> or <code>Complete</code>.</li>
<li>Move as much of this logic into <code>kubelet</code> as possible so that providers need
only focus on implementing the state handlers.
<br></li>
</ul>

<p>With this architecture it becomes very easy to understand the behavior of the
application, and strengthens our confidence that the application will not enter
undefined behavior. In addition, we felt that Rust would allow us to achieve
our goals while presenting an elegant API to developers, and with full
compile-time enforcement of our state machine rules.</p>

<h2 id="our-animal-guide">Our Animal Guide</h2>

<p>When first discussing the requirements of our state machine, and the daunting
task of integrating it with the existing Krustlet codebase, we recalled an
excellent blog post,
<a href="https://hoverbear.org/blog/rust-state-machine-pattern/">Pretty State Machine Patterns in Rust</a>,
by Ana Hobden (hoverbear), which I think has inspired a lot of Rust developers.
The post explores patterns in Rust for implementing state machines which
satisfy a number of constraints and leverage Rust’s type system. I encourage
you to read the original post, but for the sake of this discussion I will
paraphrase the final design pattern here:</p>

<pre><code>struct StateMachine&lt;S&gt; {
    state: S,
}

struct StateA;

impl StateMachine&lt;StateA&gt; {
    fn new() -&gt; Self {
        StateMachine {
            state: StateA
        }
    }
}

struct StateB;

impl From&lt;StateMachine&lt;StateA&gt;&gt; for StateMachine&lt;StateB&gt; {
    fn from(val: StateMachine&lt;StateA&gt;) -&gt; StateMachine&lt;StateB&gt; {
        StateMachine {
            state: StateB 
        }
    }
}

struct StateC;

impl From&lt;StateMachine&lt;StateB&gt;&gt; for StateMachine&lt;StateC&gt; {
    fn from(val: StateMachine&lt;StateB&gt;) -&gt; StateMachine&lt;StateC&gt; {
        StateMachine {
            state: StateC 
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let in_state_a = StateMachine::new();

    // Does not compile because `StateC` is not `From&lt;StateMachine&lt;StateB&gt;&gt;`.
    // let in_state_c = StateMachine::&lt;StateC&gt;::from(in_state_a);

    let in_state_b = StateMachine::&lt;StateB&gt;::from(in_state_a);

    // Does not compile because `in_state_a` was moved in the line above.
    // let in_state_b_again = StateMachine::&lt;StateB&gt;::from(in_state_a);

    let in_state_c = StateMachine::&lt;StateC&gt;::from(in_state_b);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ana introduces a number of requirements for a good state machine
implementation, and achieves them with concise and easily interpretable code.
In particular, these requirements (some based on the definition of a state
machine, and some on ergonomics) were a high priority for us:</p>

<ul>
<li>One state at a time.</li>
<li>Capability for shared state.</li>
<li>Only explicitly defined transitions should be permitted.</li>
<li>Any error messages should be easy to understand.</li>
<li>As many errors as possible should be identified at <strong>compile-time</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the next section I will discuss some additional requirements that we
introduced and how these impacted the solution. In particular, we relaxed some
of Ana’s goals in exchange for greater flexibility, while satisfying those
listed above.</p>

<h2 id="tribulation">Tribulation</h2>

<p>We were off to a great start, but it was time to consider how we want
downstream developers to interact with our new state machine API. In
particular, while the Kubelets we are familiar with all follow roughly the same
Pod lifecycle, we wanted developers to be able to implement arbitrary state
machines for their Kubelet. For example, some workloads or architectures may
need to have additional provisioning states for infrastructure or data, or
to introduce post-run states for proper garbage collection of resources.
Additionally, it felt like an anti-pattern to have a parent method (<code>main</code> in
the example above) which defines the logic for progressing through the states,
as this felt like having two sources of truth and was not something we could
implement on behalf of our downstream developers for arbitrary state machines.
Ana had discussed how to hold the state machine in a parent structure using an
<code>enum</code>, but it felt clunky to introduce large match statements which could
introduce runtime errors.</p>

<p>We knew that to allow arbitrary state machines we would need a <code>State</code> trait to
mark types as valid states. We felt that it would be possible for this trait to
have a <code>next()</code> method which runs the state and then returns the next <code>State</code>
to transition to, and we wanted our code to be able to simply call <code>next()</code>
repeatedly to drive the machine to completion. This pattern, we soon found,
introduced a number of challenges.</p>

<pre><code>/// Rough pseudocode of our plan.

trait State {
    /// Do work for this state and return next state.
    async fn next(self) -&gt; impl State;
}

fn drive_state_machine(mut state: impl State) {
    loop {
        state = state.next().await;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="what-does-next-return">What does <code>next()</code> return?</h3>

<p>Within our loop, we are repeatedly overwriting a local variable with
<em>different</em> types that all implement <code>State</code>. …</p></div></div>

<p><em>In case you are coming from Hacker News and are confused about some comments, be aware that I updated the essay to deal with some criticism</em>.</p>



<p>The title is not hyperbole. I do think that privacy is the most important concept of our time. Let me tell you why:</p>



<ul><li><strong>internet is not a virtual world anymore</strong>, it is a dimension that permeates our lives; we work, socialize and get informed through the internet</li><li><strong>our society is more diverse</strong>; we have some things in common with our neighbors and some with separate communities</li><li><strong>privacy is integral to separate the</strong> <strong>different parts of our lives</strong>; once the separation could be just physical and accidental (i.e., you live here and work there), now it must be built intentionally because there are no natural barriers in information spreading</li></ul>



<p>In short, internet has made sharing information easier and complexity has made information more dangerous. We need to evolve our understanding of rules and norms to deal with this new situation. </p>



<p>I have always believed in the importance of privacy, but I felt that common definitions (e.g., <em>the right to be left alone</em>) were lacking. In fact, I think that the whole conceptualization of privacy as simply a right of an individual and regarding private information as partial and limiting.</p>



<p>Think about this: the government can send policemen to surveil you and everybody they deem interesting. However, it can do this only for few people. <strong>This limitation is due to physical constraints, not legal ones</strong>. There is a limited number of policemen and you would notice if there was a police car in front of each house of the neighborhood. <strong>This is not true for internet communications: the government can spy everyone at once and you would never notice</strong>. As many whistleblowers have revealed, this is what the NSA has actually done.</p>



<p>So, the changes in society affect privacy directly but may also affect all our rights indirectly. Privacy is the fundamental principle that must respond to these changes.</p>



<p>You might say that then, maybe, I am not really thinking about privacy, but rather something else. That might be true, so let’s not talk about privacy, instead let’s talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_fascism#Umberto_Eco">Ur-Privacy</a>, the principles of any possible concept of privacy. Take this essay as the opinion of a random guy that cares about the issue.</p>



<div><h2>What is Ur-Privacy</h2><p><em>A few principles for privacy</em></p></div>







<p><strong>Privacy is not just something we need to separate our private live from our public live. It is necessary to separate our private live, the communities we belong to and the public sphere from each other.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Privacy is about boundaries.</strong> It is not about hiding something but allowing to create a space with rules decided by its members. I like to compare it to borders. Some people say that borders are a restriction, something that limit freedom of movement and we do not need in the contemporary world. As if they were arbitrary obstacles put there by petty people. It almost makes sense if you do not think about them, after all you are actually stopped at a border.</p>



<p>However, that is not true, that is not why they exist. Borders delimit the area that a certain state control, an area where a specific set of rules and laws applies. There was a time before borders, in fact most of human history did not have clear borders. It was not a time of freedom, but anarchy, where bands of barbarians could roam into your home and pillage everything.</p>



<p>In this context is also important to remember that before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia">Peace of Westphalia</a> modern European states were plagued by continual wars. The short version is that this was due to the combination of two facts:</p>



<ul><li>modernity begets differences, different kings choose different religions<sup><a id="link_1" href="#note_1" data-type="internal" data-id="#note_1">1</a></sup> and separated societies</li><li>however, the legitimacy of kings was still based on shared medieval ideals, like the concept of divine rule</li></ul>



<p>In short, the issue was not that <strong>leaders wanted to make war all the time, they needed to do so</strong> because the legitimacy of their power depended, at least on some level, to what the rest of the European world was doing. If you claim to be a divine king there better be agreement on what the divine is, otherwise a guy that picks a different religion can also pick a different king. And, according to some, he could be a legitimate king. To change the situation this peace treaty established the principle that the internal affairs of a state are the exclusive interest of said state.</p>



<p>The connection with privacy is this: without clear rules on what is private and what is public, nobody knows which stuff belongs to whom. This means chaos and often that all belong to the strongest. Somebody might say that what you do in private, it is not private at all but political. It concerns the society at large. Therefore, it must be regulated according to their rules.</p>



<p><strong>Privacy does not imply hiding the truth.</strong> <strong>Meaning depends on context, therefore everything should be considered within its context.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Privacy is about control</strong>. Without privacy we cannot decide for ourselves how to live our lives. If there is no privacy, all become public. Whoever has more power and an interest can affect your life according to their own rules. Then, I have to care about what other people think, otherwise they will control how I can behave. As before the peace of Westphalia, the issue is not that other people are bad, <em>they have to do it</em>. When everything is subject to public scrutiny, you either control the rules and judge others or you are judged and controlled by others.</p>



<p>Think about this way: we say a lot of things in our private lives that are not meant to be taken literally. In private we say something and then we add: <em>you know what I mean</em>. And that is actually true. We can do that because the people we talk to in private know us; they understand the context in which our words must be understood. And even more importantly: they care about us; they do not want to intentionally misunderstand us.</p>



<p>When I was a child I would sometimes say and think that I wanted to kill my brother. I did not mean it literally and everybody knew it. If I said the same thing now, in public, to somebody that does not know me, the phrase would be different. It would be a threat.</p>



<p>Why is that? They are the exact same words. You know why, of course. I am different and the context is different. The real meaning of something, whether an action or a word, is not absolute, in most cases it is relative. When we speak in public, we share a different context, therefore our words have a different meaning. </p>



<p>So even if I say something as a hyperbole, or something that can be construed as an implicit threat (e.g., <em>they must be stopped at all costs</em>!), they might protest. You might say that they are overreacting, that it was just a joke, but how can they be sure of it? <strong>They do not know me.</strong> It is true that acts of violence are prepared by violent words. Even if you are unsure if something is really violent, you have to take a stand. You have to make clear that any attack against you is not permissible. Otherwise, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch_mosque_shootings" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch_mosque_shootings">somebody, maybe a crazy guy, might think that it is permissible and the right course of action</a>. Somebody might feel legitimated to take your land and kingdom.</p>



<p><strong>Privacy is not just needed to protect us from the government or exceptional situations. It is about understanding the rules that applies to every aspect of our life so that they can be fair for everybody.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Privacy is about everyday life</strong>. The issue is not simply that something we say can be considered a threat. When you are communicating with someone you need to be able to understand them. Communication requires a shared understanding at some level.</p>



<p>The easiest example to understand this are work discussions. When we talk with people that work in our field, we can communicate more easily the impact of a choice. This goes beyond the ability to use technical terminology: we know which are the main things to care about. The same discussion with our bosses would be different. Even making them understand the basic strengths and weaknesses is more challenging.</p>



<p>Now imagine being forced to communicate everything you do in the most general terms, to people that do not care about you, because <strong>everybody can see you</strong>. So, they can use any piece of information for their own needs. This could mean a policeman investigating you. It could also mean a company making you pay more for a pair sneakers, because they know how much disposable income you have and that you really love sneakers.</p>



<p>We need privacy to be aware of what is happening to us. It is too much to demand we know how other people interpret what we say. However, it is not excessive to ask that we can control what is shared about us.</p>



<div><h2>Privacy Affects Everything</h2><p><em>Defending privacy would require all-around changes</em></p></div>







<p><strong>Privacy is the most important concept of our time, because it influences everything else. Without privacy we do not know what rules applies. Our lives will be judged according to the rules of somebody else</strong> <strong>in ways we cannot even imagine.</strong></p>



<p>We cannot discuss all of the possible implications of privacy on other rights, so let’s see just the example of <em>freedom of speech</em>. Of course, sometimes you can also be judged for who you are: your religion or lack thereof, political opinion or sexual orientation.</p>



<blockquote><p>Give me six lines written by the most honest man, and there I will find something to hang him.</p><cite>Cardinal Richelieu</cite></blockquote>



<p>People lost jobs and had their lives ruined, because the mob judged something they said in private in a different way from what they expected. And they paid a price. You might say: that was fair. We might judge ourselves by our intentions, but others by their actions, which are real and objective.</p>







<p>I, for once, disagree with XKCD and this view. There are a couple of different issues here:</p>



<ul><li>how we should react to speech we disagree with</li><li>what was meant to be shared among friends was taken out of context and made public</li></ul>



<p>This complicates the …</p></div></div></article></div>

<p>Two years ago I <a href="https://flatkill.org/">wrote</a> about then heavily-pushed Flatpak, self-proclaimed "Future of Apps on Linux". The article criticized the following three major flows in Flatpak:</p><ul>
<li>Most of the apps have full access to the host system but users are misled to believe the apps are sandboxed
</li><li>The flatpak runtimes and apps do not get security updates
</li><li>Flatpak breaks many aspects of desktop integration
</li></ul>

<!-- <p>A lot has changed in the 2 years (the company behind Flatpak is now just another IBM's brand for one thing) so let's see how Flatpak developers addressed these fundamental issues.</p> -->
<p>So let's see how Flatpak developers addressed these fundamental issues.</p>

<h2>The sandbox is STILL a lie</h2>

<p>Almost all popular apps on Flathub still come with <span>filesystem=host</span> or <span>filesystem=home</span> permissions, in other words, <b>write access to the user home directory</b> (and more) so all it takes to escape the sandbox is trivial <span>echo download_and_execute_evil &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc</span>. That's it.</p>


<p>The most popular applications on Flathub still suffer from this - Gimp, VSCodium, PyCharm, Octave, Inkscape, Audacity, VLC are still not sandboxed.</p>

<p>And, indeed, users are still mislead by the reassuring blue "sandboxed" icon. Two years is not enough to add a warning that an application is <b>not</b> sandboxed if it comes with dangerous permissions (like full access to your home directory)? Seriously?</p>

<img src="https://www.flatkill.org/2020/sandboxlie.png" alt="sandboxlie">

<h2>Flatpak apps and runtimes STILL contain long known security holes</h2>
<p>It took me about 20 minutes to find the first vulnerability in a Flathub application with full host access and I didn't even bother to use a vulnerability scanner.</p>

A perfect example is <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-17498">CVE-2019-17498</a> with public exploit <a href="https://github.com/github/securitylab/tree/main/SecurityExploits/libssh2/out_of_bounds_read_disconnect_CVE-2019-17498">available</a> for some 8 months. The first app on Flathub I find to use libssh2 library is Gitg and, indeed, it does ship with unpatched libssh2.

<p>But is it just this one application? Let's look at the <b>official runtimes</b> at the heart of Flatpak (org.freedesktop.Platform and org.gnome.Platform <b>3.36</b> - as of time of writing used by most of the applications on Flathub). The first unpatched vulnerable dependency I found in the offical runtime is ffmpeg in version 4.2.1 with no security patches backported, <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2020-12284">CVE-2020-12284</a>.</p><p>Recently I stumbled upon an article from 2011 which started what is today known as flatpak, <a href="https://people.gnome.org/~alexl/glick2">in the words of the project founder:</a></p>

<p><a href="https://people.gnome.org/~alexl/glick2"><b><i>"Another problem is with security (or bugfix) updates in bundled libraries. With bundled libraries its much harder to upgrade a single library, as you need to find and upgrade each app that uses it. Better tooling and upgrader support can lessen the impact of this, but not completely eliminate it."</i></b></a></p>

<p>After reading that it comes as no surprise flatpak still suffers from the same security issues as 2 years ago because flatpak developers knew about these problems from the beginning.</p>

<h2>Local root exploits are NOT considered a minor issue anymore!</h2>
<p>Great! Two years ago I wrote about a trivial local root exploit using flatpak to install suid binaries (<a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-9780/">CVE-2017-9780</a>) and how it was downplayed by Flatpak developers as a minor security issue <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/releases/tag/0.8.7">here</a>. I am happy to see at least the attitude to local root exploits has changed and today <a href="https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap/security/advisories/GHSA-j2qp-rvxj-43vj">local root exploits</a> are considered high severity.

</p><h2>Desktop integration</h2>
<p>System and user fonts are now available to flatpak applications and basic font rendering settings are respected as well, however do not expect your changes in /etc/fonts, typically setting a proper fallback font for CJK characters, to work with flatpak.  KDE applications in flatpak are still ignoring themes, fonts and icon settings (tested with Qt5ct). Applications installed from the distribution sources do not have these problems, of course. <a href="https://www.flatkill.org/2020/desktopbrokenation.mp4">A quick screen capture to demonstrate</a>.</p>

<p>More importantly, fcitx, <i>the</i> IME for Chinese is still broken - it has been 2 years. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/2031">issue</a> I linked 2 years ago - especially of interest is <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/2031#issuecomment-655134889">the following comment</a> directly from fcitx developer:

</p><p><i>"Because fcitx im module in flatpak is from 4.2.97 and using a different dbus object path. <b>It need to be the same version of fcitx on your host</b>."</i></p>

So I need to run multiple fcitx daemons on my desktop and switch between them as I switch flatpak apps depending on which fcitx libraries are bundled with that app or maybe in the future of linux apps it's not possible to type chinese anymore and it's fine?

<p>While the "bundle everything" approach has proven very useful on servers it clearly does not work for desktop applications, let's keep linking system libraries in desktop applications (and use the bundled libraries as a fallback only) to avoid introducing all these problems to Linux desktop.</p>

SVG <code>path</code> elements are powerful tools that create shapes from lines, curves, and arcs and can be stroked and filled just like <code>circle</code> and <code>rect</code>.</p><p>Our initial use of path is relatively simple and consists of simple straight line segments using the <code>L</code> command to join up the 8 coordinates of our camera, marked below with black circles.</p><figure><img src="https://images.datalanguage.com/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-07-24-17.36.52.png" alt="" srcset="https://images.datalanguage.com/size/w600/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-07-24-17.36.52.png 600w, https://images.datalanguage.com/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-07-24-17.36.52.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>We’ll make it easy on ourselves by using single digits of a 4x4 square, so our path is easy to create. The path element takes its path data in a <code>d</code> attribute <code>&lt;path d={``}/&gt;</code>.</p><p>We begin by telling it to “move” to the coordinate of the first black circle at (0,0), then proceed to draw lines to each of the other absolute coordinates. The final segment is drawn automatically when we “close” the path with <code>Z</code>.</p><pre><code>&lt;path 
  d={`M0,0 L4,0 L3,1 L4,1 L4,4 L0,4 L0,1 L1,1 Z`}
  fill="black"
/&gt;</code></pre><h3 id="relatively-simple">Relatively Simple</h3><p>Path commands such as <code>L</code> can be absolute or relative, designated by upper or lower case respectively, so an alternative way to write the same camera path is to use relative coordinates, like so:</p><pre><code>&lt;path
  d={`M0,0 l4,0 l-1,1 l1,0 l0,3 l-4,0 l0,-3 l1,0 Z`}
  fill="black"
/&gt;</code></pre><p>Alternatively, a convenient shortcut when drawing lines which are perfectly vertical or horizontal is to use <code>V</code> or <code>H</code> with absolute coords, or <code>v</code> and <code>h</code> with relative coords, yielding yet another alternative way of drawing the same path:</p><pre><code>&lt;path
  d={`M0,0 h4 l-1,1 h1 v3 h-4 v-3 h1 Z`}
  fill="black"
/&gt;</code></pre><h2 id="everything-in-its-place">Everything in its place</h2><p>That’s great, we have a nice camera shape, but there’s a problem: we’ve drawn it with the top corner of the camera at the origin of our user-space. How can we place it at a specific location in our user-space? And what if we want to draw more than one Camera at different locations?</p><p>One simple option might be to use string interpolation to set the initial position <code>Mx,y</code> to something other than <code>0,0</code>.</p><pre><code>const Camera = ({x, y}) =&gt; (
  &lt;path
    d={`M${x},${y} h4 l-1,1 h1 v3 h-4 v-3 h1 Z`}
    fill="black"
  /&gt;
);</code></pre><p>OK, that works, but the camera is not positioned <em>quite</em> where we want it — we probably meant that x,y is the centre of the camera, so we need to offset it by -50% on each axis. We know that the camera is 4 user-space units wide and 4 units high, so the maths is easy:</p><pre><code>const Camera = ({x, y}) =&gt; (
  &lt;path
    d={`M${x-2},${y-2} h4 l-1,1 h1 v3 h-4 v-3 h1 Z`}
    fill="black"
  /&gt;
);</code></pre><p>This is reasonably straight-forward, and because we used relative coords to define the path we only had to do any math for the initial move <code>M</code> operation. However, there’s an alternative way of positioning things without tinkering with the path, which also opens up some exciting new opportunities…</p><h3 id="simply-transformational">Simply Transformational</h3><p>Shifting the camera to centre it on the given coordinates involved a reasonably simple change to the path, but things would rapidly get out of hand if we want to, say, rotate the camera by 45 degrees using this approach.</p><p>Instead, what if we could design our camera for the simple case of being drawn at the origin and pointing straight upwards, and then apply transformations to position and rotate it as required, avoiding any complicated maths?</p><p>In fact we can do just that using the <code>transform</code> attribute, which takes a list of transformation operations and applies them in order. Valid transform operations are:</p><ul><li><code>translate</code> — move horizontally and vertically</li><li><code>rotate</code></li><li><code>scale</code></li><li>skew (<code>skewX</code> and <code>skewY</code>)</li><li><code>matrix</code> (a mathematical expression that consolidates all of the above)</li></ul><p>We can specify a list of these operations in a single transform string like this:</p><pre><code>transform="translate(20,30) rotate(45) scale(10)"</code></pre><p>Recall from part 1 that the initial “user-space” specified by the viewBox is the coordinate system in which our SVG primitives are drawn.</p><p>By providing a transform attribute with a transform list we are creating a <em>new, nested user-space</em> — a new coordinate system in which the attributed element is drawn.</p><p>When applied to a simple element such as a <code>circle</code>, <code>rect</code>, <code>path</code>, etc., the new user-space only applies to that element. However, we can also set a transform on a group <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> element, in which case all elements nested within that group are also drawn in the user-space of the transformed <code>g</code> element.</p><p>With this in mind, we can now declare our Camera component such that it can be easily positioned and rotated:</p><pre><code>const Camera = ({ x, y, angle }) =&gt; (
  &lt;g transform={`translate(${x}, ${y}) rotate(${angle})`}&gt;
    &lt;path
      transform="translate(-2, -2)"
      d="M0,0 h4 l-1,1 h1 v3 h-4 v-3 h1 Z"
      fill="#000"
    /&gt;
  &lt;/g&gt;
);</code></pre><p>This is great — the code that describes the camera’s shape is now entirely static and distinct from the code that positions and orients the camera. We can make this more explicit by extracting a component for drawing the camera body:</p><pre><code>const CameraBody = () =&gt; (  
  &lt;path
    transform="translate(-2, -2)"
    d="M0,0 h4 l-1,1 h1 v3 h-4 v-3 h1 Z"
    fill="#000"
  /&gt;
);

const Camera = ({ x, y, angle }) =&gt; (
  &lt;g transform={`translate(${x}, ${y}) rotate(${angle})`}&gt;
    &lt;CameraBody /&gt;
  &lt;/g&gt;
);</code></pre><h3 id="adding-contrast">Adding Contrast</h3><p>The camera is quite a dark shape against the dark blue background of our floor-plan, so to increase contrast lets give it a semi-transparent circular “enclosure” that lightens the background.</p><p>Because this enclosure is nested inside our camera’s group <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> element it exists within the camera’s user-space, which means we can simply draw it at the origin and it will move and rotate with the camera — result!</p><p>Note that we draw the enclosure first, before drawing the camera body, so that the camera body appears on top of the enclosure (on the z axis) and does not get lightened by it.</p><pre><code>const CameraEnclosure = () =&gt; (
  &lt;circle
    cx="0"
    cy="0"
    r="3.5"
    fill="rgba(255,255,255,0.25)"
    stroke="#fff"
    strokeWidth={0.25}
  /&gt;
);

const Camera = ({ x, y, angle }) =&gt; (
  &lt;g transform={`translate(${x}, ${y}) rotate(${angle})`}&gt;      
    &lt;CameraEnclosure /&gt;
    &lt;CameraBody /&gt;
  &lt;/g&gt;
);</code></pre><p>And now we can render multiple cameras in different positions and orientations and see them clearly on our blueprint backdrop:</p><pre><code>{  
  Array.from({ length: 6 }).map((_, i) =&gt; (    
    &lt;Camera
      key={`camera_${i}`}
      x={Math.round(Math.random() * 5000)}
      y={Math.round(Math.random() * 3000)}
      angle={Math.random() * 360}
    /&gt;  
  ))
}</code></pre><figure><img src="https://images.datalanguage.com/2020/10/multiple-cameras.png" alt="" srcset="https://images.datalanguage.com/size/w600/2020/10/multiple-cameras.png 600w, https://images.datalanguage.com/size/w1000/2020/10/multiple-cameras.png 1000w, https://images.datalanguage.com/2020/10/multiple-cameras.png 1286w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Many instances of Camera rotated to different angles</figcaption></figure><h3 id="field-of-view">Field of View</h3><p>Before we add the cameras to our floor plan, let’s look at showing the camera’s field of view as a segment of a circle centred at the camera origin, looking like this:</p><figure><img src="https://images.datalanguage.com/2020/10/Screenshot-from-2020-09-17-16-00-04.png" alt="" srcset="https://images.datalanguage.com/size/w600/2020/10/Screenshot-from-2020-09-17-16-00-04.png 600w, https://images.datalanguage.com/size/w1000/2020/10/Screenshot-from-2020-09-17-16-00-04.png 1000w, https://images.datalanguage.com/size/w1600/2020/10/Screenshot-from-2020-09-17-16-00-04.png 1600w, https://images.datalanguage.com/2020/10/Screenshot-from-2020-09-17-16-00-04.png 1625w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Camera with 40 degree Field-of-View</figcaption></figure><p>We’re not really trying to model the real world here, just keeping things reasonably simple by defining the field of view as an angle describing the arc, and a distance or range that describes how far the camera can “see”. The API for the <code>FieldOfView</code> component could then just be:</p><pre><code>&lt;FieldOfView angle={40} range={500} /&gt;</code></pre><p>Note that we don’t need to specify a position for <code>FieldOfView</code> because it will be nested inside the <code>Camera</code>’s group <code>g</code> element, and therefore drawn in the user-space of the <code>Camera</code>.</p><p>We can get a feel for how the props relate to the rendered field of view from the diagram below. Remember that the camera is drawn pointing upwards, so the mid-point of the field of view needs to be directly &nbsp;up the y-axis from the origin.</p><figure><img src="https://images.datalanguage.com/2020/10/Screenshot-from-2020-09-30-12-25-41.png" alt="" srcset="https://images.datalanguage.com/size/w600/2020/10/Screenshot-from-2020-09-30-12-25-41.png 600w, https://images.datalanguage.com/2020/10/Screenshot-from-2020-09-30-12-25-41.png 793w"><figcaption>How the range and angle props relate to the rendered field of view</figcaption></figure><p>A quick and dirty approximation of the field of view would be a triangle connecting the dots A, B, and C along the dashed lines in the above diagram. We already know the position of A (the origin of our <code>Camera</code>’s user-space), so we just need to work out the positions of B and C, then this approximated path is super-easy to write.</p><p>To do that we need to put our math hats on again for some basic trigonometry, but I want to take a little diversion (<em>or a tangent, ahahaha</em>) and talk a little bit about coordinate systems.</p><p>If — unlike me — you are a bit of a math whiz, you might already be familiar with Euclidean spaces and coordinate systems, in which case feel free to skim the next section.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>I recently found about a piece of GNU software called Stow<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It lets you manage your dotfiles in a really simple way, meaning you can put them in git and have them easily transferable between machines.</p>
<p>What it will do is let you move all your dotfiles into a directory, and then symlink them back into your home directory with a simple command.</p>
<p>From the man page<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stow is a symlink farm manager which takes distinct sets of software and/or data located in separate
directories on the filesystem, and makes them all appear to be installed in a single directory tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="set-up">Set up</h2>
<p>First you’ll need to install <code>Stow</code> using your package manager of choice. I use a Mac so it’s just:</p>
<p>Then you’ll need to create a directory in which to store your dotfiles, and directories within it to keep them separate.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">mkdir ~/dotfiles;
mkdir ~/dotfiles/git;
mkdir ~/dotfiles/zsh;
</code></pre></div><p>Move your dotfiles into the relevant directories:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">mv ~/.gitconfig ~/dotfiles/git;
mv ~/.zshrc ~/dotfiles/zsh;
mv ~/.zshenv ~/dotfiles/zsh;
</code></pre></div><h2 id="the-magic-part">The magic part</h2>
<p>Now here’s where <code>stow</code> comes in. Stow will, given a source directory and a destination directory, create symlinks in the destination directory to all the files in the source directory.</p>
<p>From within <code>~/dotfiles</code></p>
<p>Here’s an explanation of what that command is doing:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>-R</code> means “restow”. This will overwrite your symlinks, say if you’ve updated your dotfiles on another machine and want to sync them to your current machine From the manpage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Restow packages (first unstow, then stow again). This is useful for pruning obsolete symlinks
from the target tree after updating the software in a package.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-t ~</code> is the target directory. This is where the symlinks will be created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The final argument is the directory containing the files to be symlinked to.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Putting it all together, running <code>stow -R -t ~ git</code> will create a symlink in your home directory to <code>~/dotfiles/git/.gitconfig</code>.</p>
<p>And it’s that simple.</p>
<p>Now you can <code>git init</code> inside your <code>~/dotfiles</code> directory, push them up to your remote and have them immediately available on all your machines.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple bit of bash that will stow all the dotfiles in your home directory from your <code>~/dotfiles</code> repo:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span>for</span> d in */ ; <span>do</span>
    stow -R -t ~ <span>"</span>$d<span>"</span>
<span>done</span>
</code></pre></div><p>For reference, <a href="https://github.com/mathieuhendey/dotfiles">here are my dotfiles on GitHub</a>.</p>

	<div>
		<p>This blog post is part two of a four part series</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://coaxion.net/blog/2020/09/porting-ebu-r128-audio-loudness-analysis-from-c-to-rust/">Overview, summary and motivation</a></li>
<li><strong>Porting approach with various details, examples and problems I ran into along the way</strong></li>
<li>Performance optimizations</li>
<li>Building Rust code into a C library as drop-in replacement</li>
</ol>
<p>In this part I’ll go through the actual porting process of the <a href="https://github.com/jiixyj/libebur128">libebur128</a> C code to <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, the approach I’ve chosen with various examples and a few problems I was running into.</p>
<p>It will be rather technical. I won’t explain details about how the C code works but will only focus on the aspects that are relevant for porting to Rust, otherwise this blog post would become even longer than it already is.</p>


<h2>Porting</h2>
<p>With the warnings out of the way, let’s get started. As a reminder, the code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/sdroege/ebur128/">GitHub</a> and you can also follow along the actual chronological porting process by going through the git history there. It’s not very different to what will follow here but just in case you prefer looking at diffs instead.</p>
<h3><span id="Approach">Approach</span></h3>
<p>The approach I’ve taken is basically the same that <a href="https://people.gnome.org/~federico/blog/librsvg-posts.html">Federico</a> took for <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg">librsvg</a> or <a href="https://jneem.github.io/nnnoiseless/">Joe Neeman’s</a> took for <code>nnnoiseless</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with the C code and safe Rust bindings around the C API</li>
<li>Look for a function or component very low in the call graph without dependencies on (too much) other C code</li>
<li>Rewrite that code in Rust and add an internal C API for it</li>
<li>Call the new internal C API for that new Rust code from the C code and get rid of the C implementation of the component</li>
<li>Make sure the tests are still passing</li>
<li>Go to 2. and repeat</li>
</ol>
<p>Compared to what I did when <a href="https://coaxion.net/blog/2020/07/live-loudness-normalization-in-gstreamer-experiences-with-porting-a-c-audio-filter-to-rust/">porting</a> the FFmpeg loudness normalization filter this has the advantage that at every step there is a working version of the code and you don’t only notice at the very end that somewhere along the way you made a mistake. At each step you can validate that what you did was correct and the amount of code to debug if something went wrong is limited.</p>
<p>Thanks to Rust having a good <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/ffi.html">FFI</a> story for interoperability with C in either direction, writing the parts of the code that are called from C or calling into C is not that much of a headache and not worse than actually writing C.</p>
<h3><span id="Rust_Bindings_around_C_Library">Rust Bindings around C Library</span></h3>
<p>This step could’ve been skipped if all I cared about was having a C API for the ported code later, or if I wanted to work with the tests of the C library for validation and worry about calling it from Rust at a later point. In this case I had already done safe Rust bindings around the C library before, and having a Rust API made it much easier to write tests that could be used during the porting and that could be automatically run at each step.</p>
<h4><span id="EJS28"> <code data-enlighter-language="raw">bindgen</code><br>
</span></h4>
<p>As a first step for creating the Rust bindings there needs to be a way to actually call into the C code. In C there are the header files with the type definitions and function declarations, but Rust can’t directly work from those. The solution to this was in this case <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen"><code>bindgen</code></a>, which basically converts the C header files into something that Rust can understand. The resulting API is completely unsafe still but can be used in a next step to write safe Rust bindings around it.</p>
<p>I would recommend using <code data-enlighter-language="raw">bindgen</code> for any non-trivial C API for which there is no better translation tool available, or for which there is no machine-readable description of the API that could be used instead by another tool. Parsing C headers is no fun and there is very little information available in C for generating safe bindings. For example for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GObject"><code>GObject</code></a>-based libraries, using <a href="https://github.com/gtk-rs/gir/"><code>gir</code></a> would be a better idea as it works from a rich XML description of the API that contains information about e.g. ownership transfer and allows to autogenerate safe Rust bindings in many cases.</p>
<p>Also the dependency on <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/"><code>clang</code></a> makes it hard to run <code data-enlighter-language="raw">bindgen</code> as part of every build, so instead I’ve made sure that the code generated by <code data-enlighter-language="raw">bindgen</code> is platform independent and included it inside the repository. If you use <code>bindgen</code>, please try to do the same. Requiring <code data-enlighter-language="raw">clang</code> for building your crate makes everything more complicated for your users, especially if they’re unfortunate enough to use Windows.</p>
<p>But back to the topic. What <code data-enlighter-language="raw">bindgen</code> <a href="https://github.com/sdroege/ebur128/blob/0.1.1/src/ffi.rs">generates</a> is basically a translation of the C header into Rust: type definitions and function declarations. This looks for example as follows</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="rust">\#[repr(C)]
\#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone)]
pub struct ebur128_state {
    pub mode: ::std::os::raw::c_int,
    pub channels: ::std::os::raw::c_uint,
    pub samplerate: ::std::os::raw::c_ulong,
    pub d: *mut ebur128_state_internal,
}

extern "C" {
    pub fn ebur128_init(
        channels: ::std::os::raw::c_uint,
        samplerate: ::std::os::raw::c_ulong,
        mode: ::std::os::raw::c_int,
    ) -&gt; *mut ebur128_state;

    pub fn ebur128_destroy(st: *mut *mut ebur128_state);

    pub fn ebur128_add_frames_int(
        st: *mut ebur128_state,
        src: *const ::std::os::raw::c_int,
        frames: usize,
    ) -&gt; ::std::os::raw::c_int;
}
</pre>
<p>Based on this it is possible to call the C functions directly from <code data-enlighter-language="raw">unsafe</code> Rust code and access the members of all the structs. It requires working with raw pointers and ensuring that everything is done correctly at any point to not cause memory corruption or worse. It’s just like using the API from C with a slightly different syntax.</p>
<h4><span id="Build_System">Build System</span></h4>
<p>To be able to call into the C API its implementation somehow has to be linked into your crate. As the C code later also has to be modified to call into the already ported Rust functions instead of the original C code, it makes most sense to build it as part of the crate instead of linking to an external version of it.</p>
<p>This can be done with the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cc"><code>cc</code></a> crate. It is called into from <code>cargo</code>‘s <code data-enlighter-language="raw">build.rs</code> for configuring it, for example for configuring which C files to compile and how. Once done it is possible to call any exported C function from the Rust code. The <a href="https://github.com/sdroege/ebur128/blob/0.1.1/build.rs"><code>build.rs</code></a> is not really complicated in this case</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="rust">fn main() {
    cc::Build::new()
        .file("src/c/ebur128.c")
        .compile("ebur128");
}
</pre>
<h4><span id="Safe_Rust_API">Safe Rust API</span></h4>
<p>With all that in place a safe Rust API around the unsafe C functions can be written now. How this looks in practice differs from API to API and might require some more thought in case of a more complex API to ensure everything is still safe and sound from a Rust point of view. In this case it was fortunately rather simple.</p>
<p>For example the struct definition, the constructor and the destructor (<code>Drop</code> impl) <a href="https://github.com/sdroege/ebur128/blob/0.1.1/src/ebur128.rs">looks as follows</a> based on what <code data-enlighter-language="raw">bindgen</code> generated above</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="rust">pub struct EbuR128(ptr::NonNull&lt;ffi::ebur128_state&gt;);
</pre>
<p>The struct is a simple wrapper around <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ptr/struct.NonNull.html"><code>std::ptr::NonNull</code></a>, which itself is a zero-cost wrapper around raw pointers that additionally ensures that the stored pointer is never <code data-enlighter-language="raw">NULL</code> and allows additional optimizations to take place based on that.</p>
<p>In other words: the Rust struct is just a raw pointer but with additional safety guarantees.</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="rust">impl EbuR128 {
    pub fn new(channels: u32, samplerate: u32, mode: Mode) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, Error&gt; {
        static ONCE: std::sync::Once = std::sync::Once::new();

        ONCE.call_once(|| unsafe { ffi::ebur128_libinit() });

        unsafe {
            let ptr = ffi::ebur128_init(channels, samplerate as _, mode.bits() as i32);
            let ptr = ptr::NonNull::new(ptr).ok_or(Error::NoMem)?;
            Ok(EbuR128(ptr))
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>The constructor is slightly more complicated as it also has to ensure that the one-time initialization function is called, once. This requires using <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Once.html"><code>std::sync::Once</code></a> as above.</p>
<p>After that it calls the C constructor with the given parameters. This can return <code data-enlighter-language="raw">NULL</code> in various cases when not enough memory could be allocated as described in the documentation of the C library. This needs to be handled gracefully here and instead of panicking an error is returned to the caller. <code data-enlighter-language="raw">ptr::NonNull::new()</code> is returning an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html"><code>Option</code></a> and if <code data-enlighter-language="raw">NULL</code> is passed it would return <code>None</code>. If this happens it is transformed into an error together with an early return via the <code data-enlighter-language="raw">?</code> operator.</p>
<p>In the end the pointer then only has to be wrapped in the struct and be returned.</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="rust">impl Drop for EbuR128 {
    fn drop(&amp;mut self) {
        unsafe {
            let mut state = self.0.as_ptr();
            ffi::ebur128_destroy(&amp;mut state);
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html"><code>Drop</code></a> trait is used for defining what should happen if a value of the struct goes out of scope and what should be done to clean up after it. In this case this means calling the destroy function of the C library. It takes a pointer to a pointer to its state, which is then set to <code>NULL</code>. As such it is necessary to store the raw pointer in a local variable and pass a mutable reference to it. Otherwise the <code data-enlighter-language="raw">ptr::NonNull</code> would end up with a <code data-enlighter-language="raw">NULL</code> pointer inside it, which would result in undefined behaviour.</p>
<p>The last function that I want to mention here is the one that takes a slice of audio samples for processing</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="rust">    pub fn add_frames_i32(&amp;mut self, frames: &amp;[i32]) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt; {
        unsafe {
            if frames.len() % self.0.as_ref().channels != 0 {
                return Err(Error::NoMem);
            }

            let res = ffi::ebur128_add_frames_int(
                self.0.as_ptr(),
                frames.as_ptr(),
                frames.len() / self.0.as_ref().channels,
            );
            Error::from_ffi(res as ffi::error, || ())
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>Apart from calling the C function it is again necessary to check various pre-conditions before doing so. The C function will cause out of bounds reads if passed a slice that doesn’t contain a sample for each channel, so this must be checked beforehand or otherwise the caller (safe Rust code!) could cause out of bounds memory accesses.</p>
<p>In the end after calling the function its return value is converted into a <code>Result</code>, converting any errors into the crate’s own <code data-enlighter-language="raw">Error</code> enum.</p>
<p>As can be seen here, writing safe Rust bindings around the C API requires reading of the documentation of the C code and keeping all the safety guarantees of Rust in mind to ensure that it is impossible to violate those safety guarantees, no matter what the …</p></div></article></div>

<p>Multiple NodeJS packages laden with malicious code have been spotted on npm registry.</p>



<p>These “typosquatting” packages served no purpose other than collecting data from the user’s device and broadcasting it on public GitHub pages.</p>



<p>The findings were spotted by Sonatype’s <a href="https://blog.sonatype.com/sonatype-spots-malicious-npm-packages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">automated malware detection systems</a> and further investigated by the company’s Security Research team which includes me. </p>



<p>The packages previously present on the open source npm registry included:</p>



<ol><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/electorn" target="_blank">electorn</a> (intentional misspelling of a legitimate package “electron”)</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/loadyaml" target="_blank">loadyaml</a> </li><li>loadyml</li><li>lodashs (intentional misspelling of a legitimate package “lodash”)</li></ol>



<p>All four packages were published by the same user “simplelive12” and have now been removed, with the first two having been taken down by npm as of October 1, 2020. The previous two packages were unpublished by the author themselves.</p>



<p>Once installed, <code>electorn</code> ran a script in the background <strong>every</strong> <strong>hour</strong> which collected the logged-in user’s IP, geolocation data, username, path to home directory, and CPU model information.</p>

<p>This information, part of which constitutes the device “fingerprint” was uploaded and published on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20201001065601/https://github.com/h4ppyl1ve/collect/issues/4" target="_blank">GitHub</a> in real-time.</p>



<p>Some of the information being published is base64-encoded but this can be trivially decoded by anyone who has access to it:</p>

<p>Sonatype’s Security Research team has accounted for these malicious packages into their products, and had notified both npm and GitHub teams of the malicious activity stemming from the components. This led to the takedown of these malicious packages. </p>



<p>To this date, all 4 packages have scored a little over <strong>400</strong> total downloads.</p>



<p>It is not exactly clear what was the purpose of collecting this data and why was it being published on the web for the world to see, however, incidents like these highlight the potential of typosquatting attacks on the open-source ecosystem.</p>



<p>We can only imagine what the next possible version of these packages could have been capable of – possibly carrying out even more sinister activities. </p>



<p>By tricking an unsuspecting developer into mistakenly installing a misspelled package, attackers can push their malicious code “downstream” into any other open-source projects that use the misspelled malicious component as a transitive dependency.</p>



<p>Adopting DevSecOps best practices and building security early on into your software development lifecycle can prevent “counterfeit components” such as electorn and loadyaml from entering, and thriving in your software supply chains.</p>



<p>The complete research findings are available on the <a href="https://blog.sonatype.com/sonatype-spots-malicious-npm-packages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sonatype blog</a>.</p>

When asked to analyze the experiences of black people in the United Kingdom, we now talk with an American accent.</p><p>Take a look, for instance, at a meme that has been circulating among some of my white friends on Facebook and Instagram:</p><blockquote><p>I have privilege as a White person because I can do all of these things without thinking twice about it … I can go jogging (#AmaudArbery). I can relax in the comfort of my own home (#BothemSean and #AtatianaJefferson). I can ask for help after being in a car crash (#Jonathan Ferrell and #RenishaMcBride). I can have a cellphone (#StephonClark). I can leave a party to get to safety (#JordanEdwards). I can play loud music (#JordanDavis). I can sell CDs (#AltonSterling). I can sleep (#AiyanaJones). I can walk from the corner store (#MikeBrown).</p></blockquote><p>The post goes on and on, like an interminable spoken-word poem. All the individuals listed are American, but most of the people who have shared this on my timeline are British. In trying to express their solidarity with black Britons, they are affirming a supposedly transcendental truth: to be black is to live in perpetual terror of being murdered by the state. </p><p>But Britain is not America. And importing American race discourse into the United Kingdom not only prevents us from recognizing the specific ways in which racial injustice manifests in this country—it cloaks the reality of black British lives behind an abstraction that flattens our humanity. </p><p>Britain has a long and painful history of anti-black racism. In the twentieth century alone, the growing black presence led to a long catalogue of abuses: the 1919 race riots in Liverpool, Cardiff and London; the 1958 race riots in Nottingham and Notting Hill; the 1969 police murder of David Oluwale, a Nigerian immigrant who was tortured, pissed on and finally drowned in a river in Leeds. I could list other examples. It is not hard to see why the horrific killing of George Floyd has evoked such strong feelings in this country as well.</p><p>But for all of the country’s flaws, Britain is not America. Trying to understand its racial dynamics through the lens of another country’s does more to obscure than to illuminate the situation that black Britons like myself actually face.</p><p>The average black American in the United States can trace his ancestry further back than the average white American. Most black Americans are descended from enslaved Africans. Their forebears suffered through the segregation and racial terror of the Jim Crow era. The majority of black people in the United Kingdom, by contrast, are immigrants or the children of immigrants. Though many of them have certainly had harrowing experiences with injustice or discrimination, they do not have the same history of racist disadvantage.</p><p>To understand the experience of black Britons, it is not only necessary to grasp how different their history is from that of black Americans: we need to understand the diversity captured by the label “black British.” For example, around two out of every three students with Congolese or Somali origins get free school meals, a standard indicator that their parents are poor. Among students with Nigerian or Ghanaian origins, only one in five do. It is also noteworthy that black Caribbean students are twice as likely to be excluded from school as black African students. </p><p>The discrepancy in educational attainment is just as stark. On average, 58% of black African students graduate from middle school at grade level (defined as achieving A* to C grades at GCSE)—about the same number as white students. But black Caribbean students are significantly less likely to do so—while those whose parents hail from Nigeria actually outperform their white peers by a considerable margin. </p><p>None of this is to disavow the label “black British.” But we need to invest it with the nuance consonant with its reality—and to cast doubt on the idea that every discrepancy in representation must be explained by structural injustice or white supremacy.</p><p>There has, for example, been a lot of concern about the underrepresentation of black Britons in professions like the arts and publishing. But why would you choose to go into theater or journalism—rather than law, medicine or finance—if you are a talented child of ambitious but not well off immigrants? </p><p>This is not a flippant question. While representation can be important, anybody who actually wants to improve the condition of black Britons should at least be a little curious about why they are overrepresented in some prestigious professions and underrepresented in others. In a country in which black people make up only three percent of the population, for example, six percent of junior doctors are black. Would the country—or the black community—really benefit if more black Britons chose to ditch medicine for the theater? The debate is worth having. But in the place of that debate, there have only been pious paeans to diversity.</p><p>The stereotype of the West African parent who wants their child to study law or medicine bears some relation to reality; but the widespread view of black people as perennial victims devoid of agency is a defamatory abstraction. The black person in Britain, like Ralph Ellison’s iconic protagonist, is “invisible because no one wants to see him.”</p><p>So much of the British reaction to the death of George Floyd has constituted a failure of nerve. Desperately seeking to assuage their feelings of guilt, to do <em>something</em>, many Britons have sacrificed their critical faculties to a narrative that does not actually help black people—a narrative that, by reducing us to passive abstractions, only makes us more invisible.</p><p>Racists assume that black people are all the same. Ironically, anti-racists sometimes do so too. But anybody who is truly committed to racial equality needs to recognize that this kind of simplification neither serves justice nor reflects the truth.</p><p><strong>Tomiwa Owolade is a writer who lives in London.</strong></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                            <div>
                                                                            
                                                                         <p>Feeling down lately?</p>
<p>But you don’t know why?</p>
<p>This quick test helps you to figure it out and gives you tips on getting up again.</p>
<h2>Quick Test</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you sleep 7-8 hours a night for most of the last 7 days?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sleep is essential, and we should not skip on that. While we sleep, our brain processes the day and also cleans itself of toxic waste (<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/deep-sleep-gives-your-brain-a-deep-clean1/#:~:text=Why%20sleep%20has%20restorative%E2%80%94or,is%20hugely%20improved%20during%20sleep.">see</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you drink less than 10 drinks of alcohol in the last 7 days?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is nothing to say against a drink or two. But if you take it too far, you start to feel down, groggy and more. Moreover, alcohol can be addictive, and you don’t want to become an alcoholic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you drink too much caffeine in the last 7 days? (Coffee, black tea, energy drinks, etc.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Caffeine is a short energy booster, but it comes with downsides too. It blocks the body’s desire to rest for a short time, but then your body is twice as tired, wanting to rest.</p>
<p>Now, if you drink caffeine again, you start a vicious cycle. You’ll only feel productive when you got your dose of caffeine. Otherwise, you feel tired again.</p>
<p>Over time you need to consume more and more caffeine to even get the effect.</p>
<p>Rest. Your body needs rest, and you should give it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you think you’re eating healthy in the last 7 days?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your body needs proper nutrition to function.</p>
<p>A diet of chips, chocolate bars, ice cream, or fast food is not the right thing to fuel your body the energy it needs.</p>
<p>Once in a while, it is fine but don’t thrive on it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you gone outside in the last 7 days?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pandemic here, pandemic there. But even without it, many of us don’t go outside enough—especially people working from home.</p>
<p>But we need movement and fresh air. So, enjoy a long walk in nature, or a park or forest near you. Or just stroll through your city.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you exercised in the last 7 days?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Move your ass. Doesn’t matter what kind of exercise you like, do it. Movement is king.</p>
<p>Not only will it lift your mood. It will also help you to think fresh and clear again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you meditated in the last 7 days? Or journaled, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meditation is a great tool to clear your thoughts and calming down. But you don’t need to sit still.</p>
<p>You can do <a href="https://mindfuldevmag.com/issues/issue-3-mindfulness-for-skeptics/walking-meditation">walking meditations</a> or journaling or other kinds of activities that help you to focus and clear your mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you done anything to actively relax?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This can be taking massages, doing yoga, taking a hot bath, sauna, or anything else that helps you relax.</p>
<p>Take your time and do it on purpose.</p>
<p>Btw watching tv might feel like relaxation, but it mostly is not. Our brain’s on alert mode.</p>
<p>Can’t decide on one?</p>
<p>Go for a walk in the next park.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you talked to other people or met with your friends? Preferably IRL</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even the most introverted of us love to talk to somebody. Sure, I can go without days of talking to somebody except my family. But even that has its limit.</p>
<p>Talk or, better yet, meet your friends, and have a great time. None handy at the moment? Talk to your neighbor, cashiers, or anybody else you can have interactions with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you’re in a relationship, are you with the right person?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If your relationship sucks, your mood will drop too. But if it is a loveable and stable one, it can lift you up and help through darker times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you helped someone in the last days with something you’re good at?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Believe it or not. It’s humans to help others and feel good about it at the same time. It’s totally refreshing and re-energizing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you made any new experiences in the last month?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doing the same old from day to day, week to week, and month to month can drag you down. It feels like a rut. Being stuck.</p>
<p>Energize your life and go for new experiences. Go for a hike, visit a new city, test a new restaurant. Whatever it is, pick something new.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you working on stuff that’s meaningful to you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does your job or the things you work on in your spare time give you enough meaning? Or does it feel like working for the devil?</p>
<p>Does it fulfill you?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does your current situation allow you to do what you really want to do in life?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If not, think about what you could start to change? What are thing top 3 things holding you back?</p>
<p>How could you remove them?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you create anything in the last week?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does not matter what it is. Maybe you draw comics or paint art, make music, build websites, or whatever.</p>
<p>Let your creativity go wild, and your mood will go up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are your working on too many things at the same time?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pursuing multiple things at the same time makes you feel like nothing moves forward. Often paired with getting frustrated and then feeling down.</p>
<p>Set your focus on one thing for now and work on that. The down feelings will fade.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you have the feeling that you accomplished something?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes we hustle and hustle but have the feeling we got nowhere. Just being tired and running towards a burnout.</p>
<p>Think about what small things you could add that make you feel to have accomplished something? Must not be work-related. It could also be private things you pushed for years in front of you.</p>
<h2>All Positive But Still Feeling Down?</h2>
<p>If you answered all questions positively and are still feeling down, it might be time to visit a therapist. There is no shame in that. We all need help sometimes.</p>
<p>Find someone near you or use an online service like <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/">talkspace</a> or more on this <a href="https://www.e-counseling.com/online-therapy/">list of online therapy services</a>.</p>
                                     
                                     <hr>

		<p>After spending part of the last 12 months <a href="https://blog.luap.info/travelling-with-24-monitors.html">travelling in Europe</a> I'm now settling down around Paris and I need to adapt my multi-screens setup.</p>
<p>You probably have seen an ads for <a href="https://altwork.com/">the altwork desk</a> <em>a $7000 desk that let you work laying down</em>. Spending a big part of my day in front of a computer I want to have the most comfortable position as possible, but well $7000 + $1000 for the delivery seems so expensive. There is also <a href="http://www.ergoquest.com/">this company</a> but this is still about $4000 all included. Let's be creative and build it myself.</p>
<p>Here is the result</p>
<p><img alt="complete desk" src="https://blog.luap.info/static/desk/complete.jpg"> </p>
<p>The things I have to take into account are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I have three monitors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have no diy tools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want a laying down position</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This should be easy to use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This should be light and not take too much space</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have only a bike to move the parts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I haven't found anyone who has done something similar and so don't really have examples</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So instead of doing the waterfall way I decided to go the agile way and to not do any plans, I didn't know what to expect, so let's do it step by step and see how it goes</p>
<h2>Take care of the chair</h2>
<p>There are several options:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Built a chair from scratch including the 'mattress' part</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a reclined chair</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adapt a chair</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The issue with the first option is that I will not be sure of the result, is it going to be comfortable ? How I'm going to wash the seat covers ? I have no idea of the things to take into account for building a comfortable chair.</p>
<p>Reclined chairs are great but they are very heavy (except the garden ones but not very comfortable) and expensive. So again let's be creative, I got inspired by <a href="https://www.ikeahackers.net/2017/04/poang-gravity-recliner.html">this</a> and <a href="https://www.ikeahackers.net/2020/04/remove-poang-arms.html">this</a> ikea hacks which use a IKEA POANG chair and transform it into a reclined chair.</p>
<p>Here is the result :</p>
<p><img alt="ikea poang adaptation" src="https://blog.luap.info/static/desk/chair.jpg"></p>
<p>The chair is 69 euro, I had to buy three cushions to extend it</p>
<p>The most complex part was to do 7km with the chair on a bike. I do not recommend doing the same, particularly because I have done it on a rainy day but well a bit of challenge in my life is always welcome!</p>
<p><img alt="ikea bike" src="https://blog.luap.info/static/desk/ikea_bike.jpg"></p>
<p>Great, the chair is comfortable, let's do something for the desk part.</p>
<h2>What structure for the desk</h2>
<p>The biggest issue you are going to have with the lay down position, is that the desk is going to be on your legs and you cant 'enter' or 'leave' the desk if you can't move the desk. So you need the 'desk' part to be dynamic from the 'chair' part.</p>
<p>I had two ideas for that, either the Altwork way, the structure goes above your head and can incline, or the the base is on the side and the desk can move somewhere (writing that, having the desk in front of me, I wonder if having the base where the foot are is not an even better solution ? Damn, too late). Having the base on the side seems better because it would be smaller and lighter and also you can balance the weight much better. But the structure also needs to be more rigid and I need to find a way to incline the desk, anyway I haven't found a way to do it :(, after a night of thinking I went the altwork way.</p>
<p>There are two parts to design:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The base + the incline system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The desk + the screen supports</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Base + incline system</h3>
<p>The base is pretty standard, you need something strong enough so that it can suppot the whole thing. At that point I still didn't know the weight of the complete platform so I didn't know how strong it should be. After a few failing choices, I ended up with a main pole of 7cm x 7cm.</p>
<p>Now the complex part, how to design the rotation part ? How heavy is going to be the rest of desk ? How much does the desk need to move so that I can 'enter' the desk ? So many questions I didnt have an answer for.</p>
<p>So let's try something and see how it goes, I bought an <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B00H8SZ87W">gaz actuator on Amazon</a> which can support 70kg with a range of 31cm, it is built for cars and pretty cheap, 19euro. Actually 70kg is a lot. So at least I have a some freedom on the weight of the structure.</p>
<p>I had two issues with the actuator:</p>
<ul>
<li>70kg IS A LOT, it is so much that when I was fixing it on the wood of the base, it was breaking the wood. The best would be to have an iron piece that I can fix to the wood but I didnt have the tools for that so I used stronger woods but this is still fragile. </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="fixation verrin" src="https://blog.luap.info/static/desk/fixation_verrin.jpg"></p>
<ul>
<li>The desk follows a circular trajectory when you move it up and down. As a result the barycenter of the structure changes depending on the Y position of the 'desk part' and so there is more strength applied on the actuator when it is up than when it is down. So basically the desk will not stay by itself when in the up position.  I need to find a way to get the desk in the up position.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not really proud of the way I've done it, but it somewhat works. I've built a piece of wood that inserts itself in the area between the two poles where the actuator is. There is a counterweight which drags the piece into the zone when in up position, and when I want to release it, I just need to pull on the rope. (I think I will replace the actuator with a real electric actuator when the current system breaks so that I can control the movement, it is about 120euro)</p>
<p><img alt="system block" src="https://blog.luap.info/static/desk/blocking_system.jpg"></p>
<h3>2. Desk + screens support</h3>
<p>I bought a chipboard plate of 80cm x 120cm, and cut some space for my body</p>
<p><img alt="plaque bois" src="https://blog.luap.info/static/desk/agglo.jpg"> </p>
<p>This is pretty solid, so I can directly screw this plate to the pole and we have a desk surface</p>
<p><img alt="plaque bureau" src="https://blog.luap.info/static/desk/bureau_with_plaque.jpg"></p>
<p>For holding the monitors I did something pretty basic, I created a box for each screen. Then comes the position of the screen, how to know the position of each screen ? I didnt know how to know it beforehand, so I just created dynamic arms and adjusted them while in front of the screens</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>This is only a few days old so I can't really make a feedback but there are already a few things that I need to fix</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I can't use a mouse anymore, as the mouse would fall down, I'm probably going to replace it by a trackball</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I need to invest in an ergonomic keyboard to get really comfortable, probably going to buy the kenesis advantage 2, but this is expensive !</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a video of the complete desk:</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>When you want to build this kind of structure, I'm not sure you can plan everything beforehand, there are always things that will happen that you didn't expect, like when you code: if you want to modify the actuator when the 60kg setup is mounted how do you do ? (I have done it 6 times) When your base can't support the weight because it lacks one screw and you need to unmount everything what do you do ? ...</p>
<p>I'm really annoyed by the actuator part, I hope I will find something more reliable</p>
<p>Overall it cost me :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>45 euro for tools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>130 euro for wood pieces, screws, joins, ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>110 euro for the IKEA chair + cushions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and I spent 26 hours working, excluding the transport and the time shopping for pieces</p>
<p>Don't forget when you do woodworking to clean afterwards  :)</p>
<p><img alt="dirty" src="https://blog.luap.info/static/desk/dirty_floor.jpg"></p>
<p>If you have done something similar and know a few advice, please send me an email</p>
<p>PS: If you wonder whether you can do that or not, everyone can do it, basic woodworking is not complex, you need to know how to cut wood, how to join wood, how to screw and a little bit of imagination, you dont even need a car to transport parts, I transported everything: pole of 2m40, big plate ... on a bike</p>

    <div>
<p>In Flancia the internet is truly open: they managed to get rid of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform">walled gardens</a>. How they did it is an interesting&nbsp;story.</p>
<h2>Status&nbsp;quo</h2>
<p>Let’s take just one example; it should suffice to represent the general approach they took. In Flancia they had a social network — well, they had many of course, same as we do, but one in particular had grown into dominance. People had sort of liked it at some point, then eventually didn’t anymore, but they were stuck with it by then; it had developed at just the right time in internet history, and it had done enough things right in the beginning to take over from contenders and really soar in&nbsp;usage. </p>
<p>As it often was the case in those days, this network was fully controlled by a single corporation, and although at the beginning there were some provisions in place that made it look like a relatively healthy platform eventually the company had chosen to consolidate their dominion; namely close down APIs and turn it into a walled garden. By then network effects had taken over and de facto locked people in, too: the company had gotten users to build up an expansive social graph for them and had succeeding in retaining control over it. They proceeded to use this virtual monopoly on many users’ social capital and attention to make billions selling ads — and gained the ability to significantly steer public opinion in the process, too. Many people recognized problems with this approach, but users at large mostly kept using it. It was that or being locked out of a significant portion of social activity online and&nbsp;offline. </p>
<h2>X marks the&nbsp;spot</h2>
<p>One of the obstacles that Flancians faced when trying to improve on this status quo was that there was no single clearly better platform of choice available; in areas where there were some alternatives there were often too many, so the competitive landscape was fragmented, and that played to the company’s advantage. The company also used their ad-fueled wealth to buy most promising contenders and offer them as relatively empty alternatives to their main network, while effectively gaining access to more social data and expanding their influence. After a while network effects and inertia were so strong that competitors all but stopped trying; social networks are known to be hard to decamp from, as most of their value is in the social graph that users build on them; and the oh-so-valuable graph was kept very deep within the company’s walled&nbsp;garden. </p>
<p>Flancians didn’t have much when facing this dire state of affairs, but they had one thing, and it was an important one: they had <a href="https://flancia.org/agora/">a machine for solving coordination problems</a>. So they used it. First they sketched out a declaration of intents flowing naturally from their publicly espoused&nbsp;values.</p>
<ul>
<li>Useful internet platforms should be&nbsp;open.</li>
<li><span>‘</span>Open’ means that no single monolithic entity can fully control them and that their inner workings are transparent to interested parties and appropriately&nbsp;malleable.</li>
<li><span>‘</span>Open’ is desirable because otherwise monolithic egotistical entities can gain control of the network and extort value out of its users, or mislead&nbsp;them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then they proceeded to write a plan together. The first version was remarkably simple; a sketch to get the real discussion started. It said essentially as&nbsp;follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>For each useful internet platform X that is not&nbsp;open:</li>
<li>Let X’ be its open&nbsp;replica.</li>
<li>Write down a plan to reimplement its core functionality, F(X’) ≈&nbsp;F(X).</li>
<li>Write down a plan to reproduce its critical data set, D(X’) ≈&nbsp;D(X).</li>
<li>Add X’ to the <a href="https://anagora.org/wiki/Missing_Devices">Catalog of Missing Devices</a> in the Agora. This both marks it as a canonical replica of X and announces it as a priority for&nbsp;Flancians.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once this bootstrap process was complete, the standard Agora algorithms took over; Flancians would best-effort iterate, improving on plans and resource estimates and executing actions as available to them, until failure or&nbsp;convergence.</p>
<p>Social networks were useful internet platforms; the Agora, after all, was in many ways a social network (a focused, goal-oriented one). So Flancians set out to replicate the company’s social network. They named that particular X’ <em>Flanbook</em> — after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Sand">The Book of Sand</a>, of course. It was fitting because the task of replicating it seemed at that point in time infinite in&nbsp;scope.</p>
<h2>I(X’)</h2>
<p>Looking around, it turned out that Flancians were relatively lucky. Most of the tools and libraries needed to build an open replica of the social network were available off-the-shelf. From all its algorithms, its ranking algorithms were perhaps the most sophisticated; but Flancians intended to replace those anyways, thinking the community could do better, so that was not an issue. The road to I(X’) was not trivial by any means, but it wasn’t very interesting for the purpose of telling this particular&nbsp;story.</p>
<h2>D(X’)</h2>
<p>In the case of social networks, then, it followed that most of their value was in their data; and, from all their data, none was more valuable than their social graph. Here Flancians had an ideological advantage, albeit perhaps not strictly a legal one to begin with, as they were known to often burst into chant in unison in barely appropriate&nbsp;occasions:</p>
<p><em>This, which is our data,<br>
will always be our data.<br>
A Flancian and their data<br>
shall never come apart.</em><br></p>
<p>This somewhat awkward ritual came handy sometimes, though. Flancians strongly believed that any information they produced and maintained was theirs; they believed this almost as much as they believed in the Agora. To a Flancian, the idea of their part of the social graph (the piece they had contributed a node and edges to) being out of their reach, locked down somewhere deep in a walled garden, just didn’t make sense. They refused to take it. So they just agreed to take their data&nbsp;back.</p>
<p>To perform this kind of task in a scalable way, they built special devices called <em>syphons</em>. The simplest came in the form of browser extensions. Whenever a Flancian used a targeted service X, the syphon redirected relevant data in the background to the replica X’. This allowed building up D(X’) incrementally so it could eventually function as a drop-in replacement. Flancians agreed to use these devices any time they could in platforms being replicated, even when they were not otherwise directly involved in the replication&nbsp;project.</p>
<p>Now, Flancians are an altogether friendly group, and they have the added advantage of knowing how to use an Agora; but they still do sometimes come into disagreements. Here Flancians disagreed with each other in how to define <em>relevant</em> in the above paragraph. Some Flancians, believing closed platforms to be actively dangerous to society, took the position that <em>all</em> data could be considered relevant in the noble pursuit of replicating such platforms, and consequently took a relatively aggressive stance and built and used syphons that actively sought to crawl and extract the largest portion of D(X) possible as fast as possible, regardless of provenance of data. Other Flancians, mostly aligned with the Middle Way, built syphons that only extracted data that they could strongly claim to be <em>theirs</em> to begin with, according to a shared and public&nbsp;definition:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the user of the syphon added the node or edge, it is considered&nbsp;relevant.</li>
<li>If a non-Flancian added the node or edge, and they give explicit consent to extraction, it is&nbsp;relevant.</li>
<li>If a Flancian added the node or edge, it is relevant (Flancians consent by default to the rational constructive actions of other&nbsp;Flancians).</li>
</ul>
<p>The second approach introduced the additional problem of identifying users across platforms and tracking consent. The syphons offered cross-platform validation as a feature; otherwise it could be manually accomplished by cross-posting tokens and declarations of intent publicly in the relevant&nbsp;networks.</p>
<p>Once this system was in place, it would presumably make D(X’) converge into a usable&nbsp;dataset.</p>
<p>The company, of course, put up a battle. They correctly identified X’ as an existential risk, and sought to attack syphons and their users. This started an arms race. Both groups of Flancians were affected differently, with those subscribing to the Middle Way being on more solid legal footing. The fact that Flancians had enough resources and a platform to organize a united resistance (the Agora) helped them tremendously; also helpful was the fact that relatively small but dense parts of D(X’) were sufficient to bootstrap smaller social networks within the&nbsp;network.</p>
<p>It would be perhaps unwise of me to say at this point which group fared better in the end, and precisely when and how the first replication project was brought to effective completion. Suffice it to say that Flanbook was a success, at least for a while, and it remains somewhat popular among the more old school Flancians. I, myself, am more partial to&nbsp;Instaflan.</p>

<p>Now, the latest Chrome is stopping to send the URL path as HTTP Referer on cross-domain access.</p>

<p>If you analyze access to your web site, you can not know which article leads the user to your site.</p>

<h2>Beginning</h2>

<p>We have a blog as our own media to lead to our web service.
And, we are monitoring the reference URLs to our web service.</p>

<p>We happen to nice that the more and more reference is from the blog top page, and less and less reference from each article URLs.</p>

<h2>Chrome 85</h2>

<p>From our access logs, it looks like the change happens only on Chrome.</p>

<p>And, we noticed that the default "Referrer Policy" is changed from <strong>no-referrer-when-downgrade</strong> to <strong>strict-origin-when-cross-origin</strong> on Chrome85.</p>

<p>For example, the reference URL "<a href="https://paiza.hatenablog.com/entry/2020/10/01/140612">https://paiza.hatenablog.com/entry/2020/10/01/140612</a>" is stripped to "<a href="https://paiza.hatenablog.com/">https://paiza.hatenablog.com/</a>" .</p>

<p><cite><a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/6251880185331712">www.chromestatus.com</a></cite></p>

<p>But, actually, when I test on Chrome85 my machine, the setting was  "no-referrer-when-downgrade", yet.
It looks that the setting is changing gradually.</p>

<h2>How to see the Referrer Policy</h2>

<p>We can see that what URL is sent as Referer on the cross-domain link.</p>

<p><a href="https://webdbg.com/test/refer/">https://webdbg.com/test/refer/</a></p>

<p>If the first green box has a URL with the path, your Chrome has "no-referrer-when-downgrade" as the Referrer Policy.</p>

<figure title="ãƒ‘ã‚¹å��ã�Œã�‚ã‚‹å&nbsp;´å�ˆ"><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Photograph"><img src="https://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/p/paiza/20201002/20201002143005.png" alt="f:id:paiza:20201002143005p:plain" title="f:id:paiza:20201002143005p:plain" itemprop="image"></span><figcaption>URL with path(no-referrer-when-downgrade)</figcaption></figure>

<p>If the first green box has a URL without the path like below, your Chrome has the new "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" settings like below.</p>

<figure title="ãƒ‘ã‚¹å��ã�Œã�ªã�„å&nbsp;´å�ˆ"><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Photograph"><img src="https://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/p/paiza/20201002/20201002142849.png" alt="f:id:paiza:20201002142849p:plain" title="f:id:paiza:20201002142849p:plain" itemprop="image"></span><figcaption>URL without path(strict-origin-when-cross-origin)</figcaption></figure>

<p>You can also see the Referrer-Policy on Chrome developer tool, network tab.</p>

<p><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Photograph"><img src="https://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/p/paiza/20201002/20201002143238.png" alt="f:id:paiza:20201002143238p:plain" title="f:id:paiza:20201002143238p:plain" itemprop="image"></span></p>

<h2>Why is the "Referrer Policy" changed ?</h2>

<p>The Referrer Policy is changed because of privacy and security concerns.</p>

<p>The Referer URL may contain search keywords, account ID, e-mail address, or other IDs, and the information may be sent to the linked site as "Referer".</p>

<p><cite><a href="https://web.dev/referrer-best-practices/">web.dev</a></cite></p>

<figure title="(https://web.dev/referrer-best-practices/ ã‚ˆã‚Š)"><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Photograph"><img src="https://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/p/paiza/20201002/20201002143341.png" alt="f:id:paiza:20201002143341p:plain" title="f:id:paiza:20201002143341p:plain" itemprop="image"></span><figcaption>(from <a href="https://web.dev/referrer-best-practices/)">https://web.dev/referrer-best-practices/)</a></figcaption></figure>

<p>Nowadays, security and privacy are getting more critical than before. So, other browsers may change the settings as Chrome does.</p>

<h2>Current Referrer Policy deployment status</h2>

<p>How many Chrome85 have new "strict-origin-when-cross-origin", at now ?</p>

<p>At first, I created a poll at Slack. It looks more than half have the new settings.</p>

<p><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Photograph"><img src="https://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/p/paiza/20201002/20201002143535.png" alt="f:id:paiza:20201002143535p:plain" title="f:id:paiza:20201002143535p:plain" itemprop="image"></span></p>

<p>Also, from the access logs to our web sites, the percentage of Referer from the top page is growing from less than 10% to around 20% on  8th/Sep, and more than 50% on 29th/Sep or later.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>If you can change the HTTP header or the HTML meta tag, you can change the Policy Referrer settings.</p>

<h3>HTTP header(Policy-Referrer) settings</h3>

<p>You can change Policy-Referrer HTTP response header field.
On nginx, you can change the configuration file like below.</p>

<pre data-lang="" data-unlink="">add_header 'Referrer-Policy' 'no-referrer-when-downgrade';</pre>


<h3>meta tag(name=referer) settings</h3>

<p>You can also change using the HTML meta tag like below.</p>

<pre data-lang="html" data-unlink=""><span>&lt;</span><span>meta</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>=</span><span>"referrer"</span><span> </span><span>content</span><span>=</span><span>"no-referrer-when-downgrade"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
</pre>


<h3>Chrome settings</h3>

<p>You can also change on Chrome settings by putting "chrome://flags/#reduced-referrer-granularity" on the URL bar for testing.
By enabling the settings, Chrome does not send pathname on the URL.
By disabling the settings, Chrome sends pathname on the URL.</p>

<p><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Photograph"><img src="https://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/p/paiza/20201002/20201002153758.png" alt="f:id:paiza:20201002153758p:plain" title="f:id:paiza:20201002153758p:plain" itemprop="image"></span></p>



<p>On Safari 13 introducing ITP2.3, the access from the domain classified as tracker does not contain the path on Referer.</p>

<p><cite><a href="https://webkit.org/blog/9521/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-3/">webkit.org</a></cite></p>



<p>The new Chrome85 is gradually stopping to send a URL path on Referer on cross-domain link, and it can cause huge impact on your web marketing.
I recommend checking your settings on web sites, access logs, or analysis tools.</p>

<p>The current theme of this blog is to show how the oil parser works.  But let's
make sure we understand an important concept first: <strong>parse-time errors</strong> vs.
<strong>runtime errors</strong>.</p>
<p>The way I write conditions in shell is like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>if</span> <span>test</span> -d /tmp<span>;</span> <span>then</span>
  <span>echo</span> <span>"/tmp is a dir"</span>
<span>fi</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This is the same thing:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>if</span> <span>[</span> -d /tmp <span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
  <span>echo</span> <span>"/tmp is a dir"</span>
<span>fi</span>
</pre></div>
<p>But yet another construct for conditional expressions is <code>[[</code>.  The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html#google-style-guide">Google
Shell Style Guide</a> recommends using it, reasoning that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[[ ... ]] reduces errors as no pathname expansion or word splitting takes
place between [[ and ]].</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[[ ... ]] allows for regular expression matching where [ ... ] does not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, consider the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>x</span><span>=</span><span>'name with space.sh'</span>
<span>[</span> <span>$x</span> <span>==</span> *.sh <span>]</span>
<span>[[</span> <span>$x</span> <span>==</span> *.sh <span>]]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>On the <code>[</code> line, <code>$x</code> will be split into 3 arguments.  The glob <code>*.sh</code> is also
expanded into multiple arguments, depending on what's in the current directory.
Both of these things cause the wrong number of arguments to appear on each side
of <code>==</code>.  In contrast, the <code>[[</code> expression will have exactly one argument on
the left and right of <code>==</code>.  (It tests if <code>$x</code> matches the pattern <code>*.sh</code>,
which is true.)</p>
<p>What I didn't realize before implementing the oil parser is that this doesn't
quite capture the difference between <code>[[</code> and <code>[</code>.  The more important
difference is that <code>[[</code> is <strong>part of the shell language</strong>, while <code>[</code> is a
<strong>builtin</strong>.</p>
<p>This means that an expression inside <code>[[ ... ]]</code> is <strong>parsed up front</strong>, before
any code is executed.  In contrast, the arguments to <code>[</code> are parsed by the
builtin itself at <strong>runtime</strong>.</p>
<p>(In terms of parsing arguments, shell builtins behave like external commands.
The fact that they happen to live inside the <code>/bin/sh</code> binary doesn't change
anything.)</p>
<p>The bash help doesn't capture this difference either: see <code>help [</code> and <code>help [[</code>.  The parse-time vs. runtime distinction isn't mentioned.</p>
<p>Let's write some code to show this difference.  First we create syntax errors
by leaving off the right hand side of an equality test:</p>
<pre><span>$ <span></span><span>[</span> <span>a</span> <span>==</span> <span>]</span>
</span><span>/bin/bash: line 1: [: a: unary operator expected</span>
</pre>
<pre><span>$ <span></span><span>[[</span> <span>a</span> <span>==</span> <span>]]</span>
</span><span>/bin/bash: line 1: unexpected argument `]]' to conditional binary operator
/bin/bash: line 1: syntax error near `]]'
/bin/bash: line 1: `[[ a == ]]'</span>
</pre>
<p>On the face of it, these errors look similar.  Now let's use the general
technique of wrapping them in <code>if false</code>:</p>
<pre><span>$ <span></span><span>if</span> false<span>;</span> <span>then</span> <span>[</span> <span>a</span> <span>==</span> <span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>else</span> <span>echo</span> <span>'NOT PARSED'</span><span>;</span> <span>fi</span>
</span><span>NOT PARSED</span>
</pre>
<pre><span>$ <span></span><span>if</span> false<span>;</span> <span>then</span> <span>[[</span> <span>a</span> <span>==</span> <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>else</span> <span>echo</span> <span>'NOT PARSED'</span><span>;</span> <span>fi</span>
</span><span>/bin/bash: line 1: unexpected argument `]]' to conditional binary operator
/bin/bash: line 1: syntax error near `;'
/bin/bash: line 1: `if false; then [[ a == ]]; else echo 'NOT PARSED'; fi'</span>
</pre>
<p><code>bash</code> parsed the first statement without issue, and executed the <code>else</code>
clause.  The stuff inside <code>[</code> is just an opaque list of strings.  We never
executed it and never parsed it.</p>
<p>In contrast, it emitted a parse error for the second statement, and didn't
execute any code.  This is because <code>[[</code> is actually part of the language.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we will use the same <code>if false</code> technique to compare the oil parser
with popular shell parsers.  We will see which errors they can catch at parse
time, and which errors have to wait until runtime.</p>
<p>oil has the philosophy that catching errors earlier is better.  You don't want
run a 4 hour script and get a syntax error after 3 hours.</p>

<p>This year’s global pandemic has forced the fast adjustment for many organizations from in-office normality to a remote working setup at whiplash speed. The rapid adoption of remote working is not easy though—even without the pressure of COVID.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Challenges are abundant for both those with remote working experience and those without. Managers and team leaders are struggling to keep their teams motivated and efficient. Remote teams are often seen as more difficult to manage, but the tips discussed in this article can help you overcome these challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Empower Remote Team Members</h2>



<p>Before digging deeper into time and task management, there are actually several basic steps that you need to complete in order to make remote teams effective. The first thing you want to do is making sure that team members can communicate easily and effectively, and that means establishing a way of communicating that everyone is comfortable with.</p>



<p>Most teams turn to <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slack</a>, but Slack is not always the best tool for the job. If your team puts emphasis on project management, for instance, using digital Kanban tools with built-in chat feature can be more effective and other communication tools such as Google Mail with Google Chat and Meet integrations are helpful. Microsoft has a similar suite of tools if you’re inclined to that choice of software.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To further empower team members, integrate a good task management platform. There is no way to keep track of everything when team members have to organize their tasks individually. The easier way to establish a baseline for remote working is by using a project or task management tool that turns tasks into blocks waiting to be managed such as <a href="https://trello.com/en" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trello,</a> <a href="https://asana.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asana</a> or <a href="https://basecamp.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Basecamp</a>.</p>



<p>Lastly, encourage team members to create a productive environment that works for them. Some startups and corporations are starting to provide team members with aids to help them set up a more comfortable and functional home office. This is the kind of initiative that puts team members in the right mindset for effective remote working.</p>



<h2>Meetings and Discussions</h2>



<p>The next thing to tackle is how meetings are set up. Even when working in the office, meetings are very distracting when they are not planned properly. Too many meetings will prevent team members from completing their tasks. Too few meetings could result in the team not having clear⁠—and mutual⁠—directions and common objectives.</p>



<p>With remote working, however, limiting the number of ad-hoc, on-demand meetings is highly recommended. Meetings need to be scheduled beforehand and team members must utilize the provided communications channels⁠—such as groups in Google Chat⁠—to discuss other work-related matters.</p>



<p>Scheduling daily standups that are not too long at the beginning of every day is also a good idea. The daily standup doesn’t just function as an opportunity for everyone to stay up to date with what the rest of the team is doing, but also as an opportunity to provide moral support for each other. As mentioned before, working remotely is not easy for everyone.</p>



<p>Set aside one or two days during which team members can focus entirely on the tasks in hand. For instance, you can have Thursday and Friday free of meetings and other distractions. This will allow all team members to prepare for Thursday-Friday sprints of their own since they already know what tasks they need to finish and can plan for the two days better.</p>



<p>Speaking of planning, it is also recommended to have a predetermined timeframe for sprints. Anything shorter than six weeks⁠—but longer than two⁠—is usually ideal, but ask your team for feedback on how to compose it to determine the best way to organize sprints that work for you all. Don’t hesitate to collaborate on best practices for remote working with team members to facilitate a solution that works for everyone involved. It’s a great way to get buy in at every level.</p>



<h2>Boost Engagement</h2>



<p>That last part is important on its own. When working remotely, employee engagement becomes a crucial component. You cannot have the progress of the team hindered by one or two disengaged team members. This is where some adjustments to how you (and other members of the team) communicate become very important.</p>



<p>For starters, forget about tracking time. Switch to a result-oriented approach and let team members worry about managing their own time. At the same time, provide team members with resources that will help them manage their time better, such as the digital Kanban board mentioned earlier. Anything that helps organize tasks in a transparent way helps.</p>



<p>Next, throw micromanagement out the window. There is no way you can micro-manage team members when everyone is working remotely. Trying to do so will only disrupt the internal flow and reduce the effectiveness of the team. Instead, allow everyone to be more involved in the tasks that they are interested in the most.</p>



<p>Transparency of workloads will encourage team members to also be even more engaged. With tasks and workloads monitored closely, team members are more likely to offer help to others when their own tasks are finished. There will be a growing awareness of the mutual objectives that the team is trying to achieve.</p>



<h2>Manage Time</h2>



<p>Of course, remote working relies heavily on the ability of every team member to manage time, and there are several things you can do to encourage good time management. You can start by supporting team members to prioritize the tasks in hand accordingly. Motivation and acknowledgment are key components in the procesto.</p>



<p>More importantly, encourage team members to embrace a work-life balance. Working remotely doesn’t mean working all the time; and trying to push team members to do so will only reduce their productivity. By encouraging the team to have fun and focusing more on the results they deliver, you can facilitate time management improvement in a more positive way.</p>



<p>That’s it! Remote working is a challenge for some teams, but the tips we discussed in this article will help you transition into a remote-first organization in time.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>I've been using JavaScript daily for 7 years, and I'm not able to remember the syntax of a JavaScript for loop.</p>
<p>Despite this fact, I'm a rather successful freelance developer. Recently I even had the awesome opportunity to work for Facebook, as the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/2336">Docusaurus lead maintainer</a>, writing the code for the framework that powers the documentation sites of Babel, Prettier, Jest, ReactNative...</p>
<p>I'll explain why I'm not able to remember such syntax, and why it does not matter much.</p>
<hr>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: I'm a functional programmer</p>
<p>I've really started programming at the beginning of my engineer degree, around 2004 (before that, I was only able to hack some scripts for Counter-Strike console or IRC).</p>
<p>Most of our school teaching was based on Java, but we also saw a bit of C, C++, OCaml. </p>
<p>The first loop syntax I learned probably looked like this one:</p>
<pre><code>List&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = Lists.newArrayList(<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>);

<span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; numbers.length; i++) {
   System.out.println(numbers.get(i));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Before I came out of school, Java 6 brought some new, simpler syntax:</p>
<pre><code>List&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = Lists.newArrayList(<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>);

<span>for</span> (Integer number : numbers) {
   System.out.println(number);
}
</code></pre>
<p>At my first job, the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/google/guava">Google Guava</a> lib brought some new verbose functional syntax to Java, and I was able to do weird things with it 😅.</p>
<pre><code>List&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = Lists.newArrayList(<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>);

Lists.newArrayList(Collections2.transform(numbers, <span>new</span> Function&lt;Integer,Void&gt;() {
  <span>@Override</span>
  <span><span>public</span> Void <span>apply</span><span>(Integer number)</span> </span>{
    System.out.println(number);
    <span>return</span> <span>null</span>;
  }
}));
</code></pre>
<p>This Guava lib got me intrigued by functional programming, and lead me to become a Scala developer since 2012, and I was finally able to use functional programming concepts (loops, but not only) without the ugly Java/Guava syntax.</p>
<pre><code>val numbers = List(1, 2, 3)
numbers.foreach(println)
</code></pre>
<p>In 2013, <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2013/06/05/why-react.html">ReactJS came out</a>, and this totally changed my career path. At this time, I didn't like JavaScript much and was only able to hack some inline JQuery things in server-rendered pages. But as a startup CTO, I saw my team struggle with architecture, BackboneJS and RequireJS, and thought I had to become better at frontend to lead them.</p>
<p>AngularJS looked like the safer choice at this time, but a Scala developer colleague really pushed for React, which looked fancy and risky. All things made sense with the visionary post of David Nolen (<a target="_blank" href="https://swannodette.github.io/2013/12/17/the-future-of-javascript-mvcs/">The Future of JavaScript MVC Frameworks</a>), and we finally adopted React in January 2014, as it seemed we would be able to use our functional programming knowledge to the frontend app as well, and make the UI more predictable.</p>
<p>Fast forward, it wasn't easy to be a React early-adopter for our critical app. All companies were building their own state management solution, trying to figure things out, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stample/atom-react">and so we did</a>, based on the ideas of David Nolen to hold a single immutable state in an atom (I was able to get a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxN8FYYBcrI">hacky time-travel working</a> before Redux). </p>
<p>Since then both the JavaScript language and the ReactJS ecosystem have progressed a lot, and it's very common to use functional programming principles nowadays.</p>

<p>As a long-time functional programmer, <strong>I simply don't write for loops</strong> very often. </p>
<p>Like anything you don't use regularly, you end up forgetting the syntax.</p>
<p>Today, many of us use ES5+ syntax (or Lodash/Ramda...) and some functional constructs. Using <code>map</code>, <code>forEach</code>, <code>filter</code> are the most illustrated examples in the JS community.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> numbers = [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>]
numbers.forEach(<span><span>number</span> =&gt;</span> <span>console</span>.log(number));
</code></pre>
<p>But we can go much further than that once we are more experienced with functional programming, and almost never write any for loops anymore. </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, it's not necessarily a goal to not write for loops anymore, and I'm not telling you that you should remove all for loops of your production codebase.</p>
<p>Very often there's an alternative syntax possible for your loops that might be more expressive and easier to understand. After a while, you end up seeing a for loop as an implementation detail of a more elegant functional abstraction.</p>
<p>This more expressive syntax is not only for loops, and you can as well see a functional abstraction being an implementation detail of another higher-level abstraction.</p>
<p>Let's consider we want to increment the age of 2 brothers.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> brothers = {
  <span>id1</span>: {<span>name</span>: <span>"Sébastien"</span>, <span>age</span>: <span>34</span>},
  <span>id2</span>: {<span>name</span>: <span>"Antoine"</span>, <span>age</span>: <span>23</span>}
};
</code></pre>
<p>I very often see the <code>array.reduce()</code> operator used when a more expressive alternative was possible.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>incrementBrothersAges</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  <span>return</span> <span>Object</span>.entries(brothers)
    .reduce(<span>(<span>acc,[id,brother]</span>) =&gt;</span> {
      acc[id] = {...brother, <span>age</span>: brother.age + <span>1</span>};
      <span>return</span> acc;  
    },{})
}
</code></pre>
<p>You know what? <strong>I really struggled to write this code</strong>. </p>
<p>My first attempt was not working at all (TypeScript would have helped).</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>incrementBrothersAges</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  <span>return</span> <span>Object</span>.entries(brothers)
      
      .reduce(<span>(<span>[id,brother],  acc</span>) =&gt;</span> {
        acc[id] = {...brother, <span>age</span>: brother.age + <span>1</span>};
        
      },{});
}
</code></pre>
<p>Yet, writing this kind of transform is idiomatic for me, using higher-level functional programming abstractions, such as <code>mapValues</code> (included in lodash).</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>incrementBrothersAges</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  <span>return</span> mapValues(
    brothers, 
    <span><span>brother</span> =&gt;</span> ({...brother, <span>age</span>: brother.age + <span>1</span>})
  );
}
</code></pre>
<p>And I think nobody would argue that this is harder to read and maintain right? If junior developers are not familiar with functional programming, they'll catch up fast and get used to it. This might even be harder to learn <code>reduce</code>.</p>

<p>I don't write for loops (or <code>reduce</code>), but I know the concepts. I know that these loops exist in different syntaxes, that can be useful for different use cases, and how to make a choice with a good tradeoff (performance, readability...).</p>
<p>I'll illustrate this with a concrete example from my daily work that actually led me to write this article.</p>
<p>I had this async function that performs some long task for a given country.</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>runCountryTask</span>(<span>country</span>) </span>{

  
  <span>const</span> taskDuration = <span>1000</span> + <span>Math</span>.random() * <span>4000</span>;
  <span>await</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span>(<span><span>resolve</span> =&gt;</span> <span>setTimeout</span>(resolve, taskDuration));

  <span>console</span>.log(<span>`Task completed for <span>${country}</span>`</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This task had to be run for many countries, but the tasks should be run sequentially, not in parallel.</p>
<p>As I know the concepts, and I knew that the following would not work, as <code>Promise.all</code> would run all tasks in parallel.</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>runAllCountryTasks</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  <span>const</span> countries = [<span>"FR"</span>, <span>"EN"</span>, <span>"US"</span>, <span>"DE"</span>, <span>"UK"</span>, <span>"IT"</span>];

  
  <span>await</span> <span>Promise</span>.all(countries.map(runCountryTask))
}
</code></pre>
<p>I also knew that there were multiple possible solutions to solve this problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>use a third-party dependency exposing the higher-level async primitive I need</li>
<li>use <code>Promise.then()</code> recursively</li>
<li>use async/await, using a for loop syntax to iterate over a fixed-size array</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn't want to introduce a new third party dependency just for a tiny utility function. </p>
<p>I also knew that using <code>Promise.then()</code> recursively could be harder to read, write, and maintain. There are many ways to write such a recursion, one of them could be:</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>forEachAsyncSequential</span>(<span>array, asyncFn</span>) </span>{
  <span>await</span> array.reduce(<span>(<span>acc, item</span>) =&gt;</span> {
    <span>return</span> acc.then(<span>() =&gt;</span> asyncFn(item))
  }, <span>Promise</span>.resolve());
}
</code></pre>
<p>So I opted for a basic for loop, as it seemed the right tradeoff. </p>
<p>As I'm totally unable to remember the syntax (<code>in</code> vs <code>of</code>, can I actually use <code>const</code>?), I had to actually google it, and it didn't take me long to be able to write the TypeScript code that will be shipped in production.</p>
<pre><code><span>export</span> <span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>forEachAsyncSequencial</span>&lt;<span>T</span>&gt;(<span>
  array: T[],
  asyncFn: (t: T) =&gt; <span>Promise</span>&lt;<span>void</span>&gt;,
</span>): <span>Promise</span>&lt;<span>void</span>&gt; </span>{
  <span>for</span> (<span>const</span> item <span>of</span> array) {
    <span>await</span> asyncFn(item);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>runAllCountryTasks</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  <span>const</span> countries = [<span>"FR"</span>, <span>"EN"</span>, <span>"US"</span>, <span>"DE"</span>, <span>"UK"</span>, <span>"IT"</span>];

  
  <span>await</span> forEachAsyncSequencial(countries, runCountryTask);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Believe me or not, but I think It's the only for loop I actually wrote in JavaScript this year. And once it's written, I won't need to write it ever again (at least for this project), as it's now part of my functional programming abstractions, that I can reuse anywhere I need.</p>

<hr>

<p>It's not very important to remember every syntax details to be productive in your daily work, particularly when you don't use them often (on purpose), as you prefer to work with more expressive, higher-level abstractions. </p>
<p>I had to google many things to write this article:</p>
<ul>
<li>Syntax for declaring a Java list</li>
<li>Syntax for iterating a Java list</li>
<li>Does <code>System.out.println</code> accept an Integer?</li>
<li>Syntax for Scala string interpolation</li>
<li>Is there a <code>forEach</code> in Guava (actually found <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38251257/guava-iterators-for-nested-foreach">my own StackOverflow question</a>)</li>
<li>What are the possible syntaxes for iterating over a JavaScript array</li>
<li>Signature of <code>array.reduce()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Not remembering all this does not matter much, as long as I know what to look for.</p>
<p>In the same way, I don't know much about many other JavaScript things:</p>
<ul>
<li>prototypes: I think I never hard to use them directly in my entire life, and I'm fine</li>
<li>classes: used them temporarily when I really had to in React</li>
<li>JavaScript quirks: I know some of them, but simply avoid the others by using ESLint, <code>===</code>, TypeScript... it's not worth knowing all of them</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>The knowledge and concepts you learn are more easily transposable from one language to another. I was able to learn React and contribute to its ecosystem quickly, thanks to my functional programming background. </p>
<p>I would argue that knowing how to do a recursive algorithm is more important than knowing the syntax of a for loop of a particular language. You will likely write many recursive algorithms in your career: the concept of recursion is not going anywhere anytime soon. But it's way more likely that you switch from one language to another from time to time. </p>
<p>Hopefully, writing this post will help me remember the syntax for a while until I forget it again 🤪.</p>

October 2, 2020 | https://blog.darrien.dev/posts/flicker-free-fireworks/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.darrien.dev/posts/flicker-free-fireworks/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
        <p>In <a href="https://blog.darrien.dev/posts/fireworks-for-your-terminal/">my last post</a> I talked about
how I made a enjoyable little display of
<a href="https://gitlab.com/darrieng/term-fireworks">fireworks</a> for the terminal. It was
fun to make and it’s fun to watch when meetings get boring (always).</p>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/DarrienG/term-fireworks">Fireworks can be found here.</a></p>
<p>However after running my fireworks for a while, I started noticing some funky
details. The fireworks could be a little flickery at times. And not in a good
way.</p>
<p>Well we couldn’t have that! So it was time to investigate.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-the-flickers-mean-mason">What do the flickers mean Mason?<a href="#what-do-the-flickers-mean-mason" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>The first thing I noticed was this wasn’t a problem on Linux, it only happened
on macOS.</p>
<p>I do most of my development on a beefy Linux machine with 6 real cores (12 total
threads) and figured perhaps this was just a specs thing, so I fired up my 7
year old ThinkPad running CentOS and still didn’t have flickering. Compared to
my 2019 work MacBook, it was smooth as butter. Could this be a Mac only bug?</p>
<p>On a whim I remembered how iTerm is not the fastest terminal in the world and
decided to try my fireworks on the slowest terminal I could think of. The WSL
terminal.</p>
<p>I broke out my old Windows machine and after a half an hour, got WSL and
fireworks up and running. The result:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.darrien.dev/flicker-free-fireworks/flicker.webp" alt="flickering in action"></p>
<p>The Windows terminal running WSL exhibited the same behaviors as on macOS, but
much more frequently and much more consistently. This lead me to believe that
the problem was in drawing. I must not be doing it efficiently. Other terminal
applications can run flicker free in Windows terminal, so why not me too?</p>
<h2 id="the-old-firework-rendering-pipeline">The old firework rendering pipeline<a href="#the-old-firework-rendering-pipeline" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>The old rendering pipeline was very simple. It used two total threads, one for
input, and one for all rendering work. This is a simple approximation of it:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.darrien.dev/flicker-free-fireworks/renderer-v1.png" alt="renderer-v1"></p>
<p>If you look at this for long enough, you’re going to see some low hanging fruit
to optimize away.</p>
<ul>
<li>we’re making fireworks on the same thread we draw points</li>
<li>we’re clearing way more points than we need to</li>
<li>we’re drawing way more points than we need to</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s dig into each one individually.</p>
<h3 id="were-making-fireworks-on-the-same-thread-we-draw-points">we’re making fireworks on the same thread we draw points<a href="#were-making-fireworks-on-the-same-thread-we-draw-points" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>The <em>maybe generate new firework</em> and <em>advance fireworks one step</em> happens
before drawing every single time. In order to keep a consistent framerate, this
would have to be completed in a fraction of a fraction of a second. I’ve done my
best to optimize this as much as possible, but especially with the more exciting
fireworks I plan on adding later, this won’t be possible in the future.</p>
<p>Firework generation and advancing should happen on another thread.</p>
<h3 id="were-clearingdrawing-more-points-than-we-need-to">we’re [clearing|drawing] more points than we need to<a href="#were-clearingdrawing-more-points-than-we-need-to" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>The painting implementation is dumb as rocks, and simply:</p>
<ul>
<li>creates a list of every single point to be drawn</li>
<li>creates a list of every single point to be cleared</li>
</ul>
<p>This means on each loop, we draw points that were already on the screen, and
clear points just to have them repainted shortly after.</p>
<p>Drawing is easily the slowest part of the application, so that’s not good at
all.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-deal-with-this">How do we deal with this?<a href="#how-do-we-deal-with-this" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Given our two problems, I felt it would make the most sense to move as much of
the actual firework building work to another thread. While overkill for how
we’re currently figuring out the points we need to draw fireworks, if we move
the work to another thread we’ll have time for all of the set logic required to
only draw and clear the points that have changed.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-architecture">The new architecture<a href="#the-new-architecture" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>The new architecture revamps a few things, but mostly just moves them around
with the addition of a new compositor component.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.darrien.dev/flicker-free-fireworks/renderer-v2.png" alt="renderer-v2"></p>
<p>The compositor runs in a separate thread and sets up all the points required for
all of the fireworks ahead of time.</p>
<p>Originally when planning up this v2 architecture I was only going to prep one
frame of fireworks at a time, but then I figured, why do just one? Why not get
a few ready ahead of time?</p>
<p>Rust has
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/fn.sync_channel.html">sync_channel</a>s
which easily lets you do this. Set the max buffer size and it won’t insert more
than that. For my Java folks out there, it’s conceptually similar to a
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/LinkedBlockingQueue.html">LinkedBlockingQueue</a>
for sharing data across threads.</p>
<h2 id="its-just-a-regen-buffer">It’s just a regen buffer<a href="#its-just-a-regen-buffer" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>At this point I was thinking myself very clever for coming up with such a new
innovative idea. Imagine what others will think when I tell them about this cool
new concept of async rendering!</p>
<p>I put my head down and tried to think of all of the other applications that
might find this technique useful, only to realize… a lot of other applications
already did something like this.</p>
<p>Distraught but still hopeful I had “really done something” I Google’d around
only for my hope to meet its demise on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framebuffer">framebuffer wikipedia
page</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In computing, a screen buffer is a part of computer memory used by a computer
application for the representation of the content to be shown on the computer
display. The screen buffer may also be called the video buffer, the
regeneration buffer, or regen buffer for short. Screen buffers should be
distinguished from video memory. To this end, the term off-screen buffer is also
used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well so much for that.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation<a href="#implementation" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>This post would be no fun without a bit of discussing how it was made. We can
spend all day in the ivory tower talking about architecture, but entering the
trenches and actually writing the code is a little different.</p>
<h3 id="channel-setup">Channel setup<a href="#channel-setup" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>If you look at the <a href="https://blog.darrien.dev/posts/flicker-free-fireworks/#the-new-architecture">v2 architecture diagram</a> you’ll
see there are 3 components now. I wanted to give them all a chance to shut down
completely, so the component accepting input now takes a list of senders it will
send <em>request to kill signals</em> to.</p>
<p>Likewise, we need to set up the buffer for which we can send fireworks to the
renderer. This is all done like so:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
  <span>let</span> (input_sender_1, input_receiver_1): (Sender<span>&lt;</span><span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span>, Receiver<span>&lt;</span><span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span>) <span>=</span> mpsc::channel();
  <span>let</span> (input_sender_2, input_receiver_2): (Sender<span>&lt;</span><span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span>, Receiver<span>&lt;</span><span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span>) <span>=</span> mpsc::channel();

  <span>let</span> (regen_buffer_filler, regen_buffer): (SyncSender<span>&lt;</span>Drawables<span>&gt;</span>, Receiver<span>&lt;</span>Drawables<span>&gt;</span>) <span>=</span>
    mpsc::sync_channel(<span>5</span>);

  <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> stdout <span>=</span> stdout()
    .into_raw_mode()
    .expect(<span>"Unable to capture stdout. Exiting."</span>);

  <span>// all internal modules in fireworks
</span><span></span>  input::capture(vec<span>!</span>[input_sender_1, input_sender_2]);
  compositor::start(seed, regen_buffer_filler, input_receiver_2);
  renderer::start(<span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> stdout, regen_buffer, input_receiver_1);
}
</code></pre></div><p>A design decision I made here was to not have the compositor be spawned by the
renderer. I didn’t want the renderer to know anything about the compositor, just
that it will receive <code>Drawables</code> from some magic buffer. Who knows what’s
filling it!</p>
<h3 id="input-capturer">Input capturer<a href="#input-capturer" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>This barely changes and isn’t really isn’t worth talking about. <a href="https://gitlab.com/DarrienG/term-fireworks/-/blob/168c80689612cee5442e92b4f30b2b5a5bfabe78/src/input.rs">It has now been
upgraded from an 18 line file to a 20 line
file.</a></p>
<p>Poor input capturer; perhaps you’ll get a longer section in the future.</p>
<h3 id="renderer">Renderer<a href="#renderer" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>The
<a href="https://gitlab.com/DarrienG/term-fireworks/-/blob/168c80689612cee5442e92b4f30b2b5a5bfabe78/src/renderer.rs">renderer</a>
changes in a few exciting ways, the most exciting in that it is gutted. No
longer does it spin up a firework state machine to get Drawables, now it just
waits at a channel, lonely and blocking until it gets some input.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> to_draw <span>=</span> regen_buffer.recv().expect(<span>"Compositor unexpectedly died!"</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>Otherwise the renderer is the same. The goal of the renderer is to be as dumb as
possible and it is certainly achieving that.</p>
<h3 id="compositor">Compositor<a href="#compositor" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>Finally the compositor, which is 30 or so lines that really come down to:
ticking the state machine and sending the points it made somewhere.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>compositor_loop</span>(
  seed: <span>u64</span>,
  regen_buffer_filler: <span>SyncSender</span><span>&lt;</span>Drawables<span>&gt;</span>,
  end_signal: <span>Receiver</span><span>&lt;</span><span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span>,
) {
  <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> state_machine <span>=</span> state_machine::StateMachine::new(seed, terminal_width());

  <span>loop</span> {
    <span>let</span> drawables <span>=</span> state_machine.tick(terminal_width());
    <span>if</span> regen_buffer_filler.send(drawables).is_err() {
      panic<span>!</span>(<span>"Renderer unexpectedly died!"</span>);
    }
    <span>if</span> <span>let</span> Ok(v) <span>=</span> end_signal.try_recv() {
      <span>if</span> v {
        <span>return</span>;
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>And that’s it for the new architecture components!</p>
<h3 id="so-then-where-are-all-the-code-changes">So then where are all the code changes??<a href="#so-then-where-are-all-the-code-changes" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>There are only a few. Really, the bulk of the work was in architectural changes.</p>
<p>The final changes, the ones that affect drawing are in the firework itself. We
can do a whole lot more work now that we can work in a separate thread, and so
the Drawable trait we worked with in the previous post goes from:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl</span> Drawable <span>for</span> TailPoints {
  <span>fn</span> <span>draw</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; <span>&amp;</span>[Point] {
    <span>&amp;</span>self.tail
  }
  <span>fn</span> <span>clear</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; <span>&amp;</span>[Point] {
    <span>&amp;</span>self.old_tail
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>to:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl</span> Drawable <span>for</span> TailPoints {
  <span>fn</span> <span>draw</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; Vec<span>&lt;</span>Point<span>&gt;</span> {
    difference(<span>&amp;</span>self.tail, <span>&amp;</span>self.old_tail)
  }
  <span>fn</span> <span>clear</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; Vec<span>&lt;</span>Point<span>&gt;</span> {
    difference(<span>&amp;</span>self.old_tail, <span>&amp;</span>self.tail)
  }
}


<span>fn</span> <span>difference</span>(points_1: <span>&amp;</span>[Point], points_2: <span>&amp;</span>[Point]) -&gt; Vec<span>&lt;</span>Point<span>&gt;</span> {
  <span>let</span> set_1 <span>=</span> points_1.iter().cloned().collect::<span>&lt;</span>HashSet<span>&lt;</span>Point<span>&gt;&gt;</span>();

  <span>let</span> set_2 <span>=</span> points_2.iter().cloned().collect::<span>&lt;</span>HashSet<span>&lt;</span>Point<span>&gt;&gt;</span>();
  set_1.difference(<span>&amp;</span>set_2).cloned().collect()
}
</code></pre></div><p>Looking at the two, you’ll see the first is infinitely faster and also does
infinitely fewer allocations. And that’s how it was meant to be! As Drawables
had to be ready in real time, the implementation had to be fast as lightning.
But now they can take a little longer and do a lot more work. With async
rendering, they can do (roughly) as much work as they like and still be real
time!</p>
<p>All this extra work affords us some really slick optimizations. Post work we:</p>
<ul>
<li>paint exactly what has changed and nothing else</li>
<li>clear exactly what needs to disappear and nothing else</li>
</ul>
<p>These two things optimizations vastly increase the speed of drawing fireworks.</p>
<h2 id="downsides">Downsides<a href="#downsides" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Well there is one, and if a point is ever drawn over and then cleared, it will
never be redrawn, meaning there can occasionally be small holes in the
fireworks. Something like this happens when two fireworks collide.</p>
<p>Solving this wouldn’t be too hard, but the fireworks still look pretty nice and
I think the asymmetrical nature of ones with little holes gives them some
character.</p>
<h2 id="so-was-it-all-worth-it">So was it all worth it?<a href="#so-was-it-all-worth-it" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Well I’ll let the results speak for themself.</p>

October 2, 2020 | https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2020/09/28/miri.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2020/09/28/miri.html">archive.org</a>

<p>A lot has happened in Miri over the last year and a half, and I figured it would be a good idea to advertise all this progress a bit more widely, so here we go.
We also recently performed a breaking change that affects some CI configurations, so this post serves as an announcement for you to update your CI configuration if needed.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/">Miri</a> is an interpreter that runs your Rust code and checks if it triggers any <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html">Undefined Behavior</a>.
You can think of it a as very thorough (and very slow) version of valgrind: Miri will detect when your program uses uninitialized memory incorrectly, performs out-of-bounds memory accesses or pointer arithmetic, violates key language invariants, does not ensure proper pointer alignment, or causes incorrect aliasing.
As such, it is most helpful when writing unsafe code, as it aids in ensuring that you follow all the rules required for unsafe code to be correct and safe.
Miri also detects memory leaks, i.e., it informs you at the end of program execution if there is any memory that was not deallocated properly.</p>

<!-- MORE -->

<p>However, being an interpreter, Miri is limited in the kinds of code it can execute – everything that would usually involve interacting with C libraries or the operating system needs to be specifically supported, as C code cannot be interpreted by Miri.
Miri also lacks support for some Rust features that are hard to interpret, but we are slowly closing these gaps.</p>

<h2 id="recent-and-past-progress-in-miri">Recent and past progress in Miri</h2>

<p>During the last 1.5 years, thanks to a series of excellent contributors, we made a lot of progress towards supporting more and more Rust code to run in Miri.
I am going to list some highlights below.</p>

<p>If you want to learn how to use Miri yourself, scroll down to the end of this post.
If you are using Miri already, maybe you are still passing flags like <code>--exclude-should-panic</code> or disabling tests that require concurrency; you should be able to update those flags now.
Also note the breaking change in how <code>cargo miri</code> interprets CLI arguments below!</p>

<h3 id="randomness-and-hashmap">Randomness and <code>HashMap</code></h3>

<p>The Rust <code>HashMap</code> picks a new random seed for each execution.
This seed in obtained from the operating system, an operation which Miri did not support until @Aaron1011 implemented <code>getrandom</code> (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/pull/683">#683</a>).
To ensure the same programs behaves the same way each time it is run by Miri, Miri internally uses a deterministic RNG (seeded with <code>0</code>, but that can be changed via <code>-Zmiri-seed</code>) to implement getrandom.
This PR also enabled Miri to be used with projects that use the <code>rand</code> crate for randomness.</p>

<p>However, this also means randomness in Miri is actually not random, so <em>do not use Miri to perform any important cryptographic operations</em>.</p>

<h3 id="unwinding">Unwinding</h3>

<p>Miri used to just abort program execution in case of a panic.
To better match the behavior of real Rust programs, @Aaron1011 implement proper unwinding support in Miri (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/pull/693">#693</a>).
He even implemented catching panics again, which required aligning quite a few pieces across rustc, the standard library, and Miri itself.
This means Miri can finally also execute <code>#[should_panic]</code> tests.
Since recently, this is supported even for Windows targets.</p>

<h3 id="pointer-integer-casts">Pointer-integer casts</h3>

<p>Thanks to @christianpoveda, Miri now properly supports casting arbitrary pointers to integers and back (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/pull/779">#779</a>).</p>

<p>Recently, I also adjusted the alignment check to fully take this information into account, so that Miri can now run code that performs its own alignment logic (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/pull/1513">#1513</a>).
Notice however that this can lead to code that just happens to work by pure chance; to properly test such code, the test should be run at least 10 times.</p>

<h3 id="file-system-access">File system access</h3>

<p>@christianpoveda went on to implement file system access (this series of PRs started with <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/pull/962">#962</a>).
Later, @divergentdave improved that support with directory listing and some related operations (starting with <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/pull/1152">#1152</a>).
This means programs running in Miri can now read from and write to files on the host computer.
This is the first form of communication that we support between the interpreted program and the outside world.
Communication needs to be explicitly requested via <code>-Zmiri-disable-isolation</code>; by default, Miri isolates the program to ensure that each execution is perfectly reproducible.</p>

<p>File system access is only supported on Linux and macOS targets, but due to cross-interpretation this is not a problem even for Windows users – see the next point.</p>

<h3 id="cross-interpretation">Cross-interpretation</h3>

<p>Based on earlier work by @Aaron1011 who made Miri use check-only builds both for the standard library and the interpreted crate itself (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/pull/1136">#1136</a>),
I made Miri support “cross-interpretation” (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/pull/1249">#1249</a>).
This means even when you are on a Windows host, you can pass <code>--target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</code> so Miri will interpret the program <em>as if</em> it was running on Linux, in particular using all the Linux parts of the standard library for the interaction with the operating system.
Sine Miri supports the Linux APIs for file system access, it can interpret these programs even when running on a Windows host.</p>

<p>This is particularly useful when testing target features that differ from the host platform: for example, even on a 64bit macOS host, you can run programs for the 32bit Linux target (<code>--target i686-unknown-linux-gnu</code>), making sure your logic works for different pointer sizes.
Miri also supports big-endian targets like <code>--target mips64-unknown-linux-gnuabi64</code>, so if your code is endianess-sensitive, you can test if it behaves correctly on big-endian systems.
And finally cross-interpretation was enormously helpful for developing Miri itself; for example, I relied on this when fixing up our panic and unwinding support for Windows targets.</p>

<h3 id="concurrency">Concurrency</h3>

<p>Earlier this year, @vakaras surprised me by suddenly showing up with a series of patches that equip Miri with support for concurrency (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/pull/1284">#1284</a>).
This is work he did during an internship with Amazon, so also thank you to Amazon for sponsoring this work!
Now Miri programs can spawn threads and interact via locks or atomics.
There are some caveats though: Miri does not detect data races, so programs with incorrect synchronization can cause Undefined Behavior through data races without Miri noticing.
Also Miri’s scheduler is rather crude, so programs can be stuck in infinite loops under some circumstances.</p>

<h3 id="better-cargo-compatibility-breaking-change">Better <code>cargo</code> compatibility (breaking change!)</h3>

<p>Recently, I mostly re-wrote the main entry point for users to execute programs in Miri, <code>cargo miri</code> (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/pull/1540">#1540</a>).
It is now more compatible with cargo itself: <code>cargo test</code> and <code>cargo miri test</code> support the exact same flags, and likewise for <code>cargo run</code> and <code>cargo miri run</code>.</p>

<p>However, this required a breaking change: previously, the way to pass flags to Miri itself and the program when executing the test suite was <code>cargo miri test -- &lt;miri flags&gt; -- &lt;test suite flags&gt;</code>.
Now flags are passed via <code>cargo miri test -- &lt;test suite flags&gt;</code> like they are with <code>cargo test</code>; if you need to pass flags to Miri, you can set the <code>MIRIFLAGS</code> variable which works like <code>RUSTFLAGS</code>.
I also removed support for <code>cargo miri</code> without further arguments, which used to be an alias for <code>cargo miri run</code>.
The reason is that (a) <code>cargo miri test</code> is actually used much more frequently and (b) disambiguating these options while also supporting arbitrary flags is tricky.</p>

<p>If you have set up your CI to run tests in Miri, please make sure to adjust your configuration to the new format.
For now, Miri still supports the old style (and emits an appropriate warning), but the intention is to remove that support code eventually.
If your project is hosted on GitHub and is affected by the change, you should have already received a notification from me, but I might have missed some projects and of course not everything is on GitHub.
While at it, you can also remove <code>cargo miri setup</code> from your CI script; that is no longer needed as thanks to @dtolnay Miri automatically detects when it runs on CI and goes into non-interactive mode.</p>

<h3 id="-and-more">… and more</h3>

<p>This list is by far not exhaustive.
Many small functions, from trigonometry to environment variable access to timekeeping, have been implemented over the last months, ever growing the range of programs that Miri can execute.
Thank you to @Aaron1011, @christianpoveda, @divergentdave, @JOE1994, and @samrat!
I hope I did not miss anyone…</p>

<h2 id="using-miri">Using Miri</h2>

<p>If this post made you curious and you want to give Miri a try, here’s how to do that.
Assuming you have a crate with some unsafe code, and you already have a test suite (you are testing your unsafe code, right?), you can just install Miri (<code>rustup +nightly component add miri</code>) and then run <code>cargo +nightly miri test</code> to execute all tests in Miri (except for doctests, which are not supported yet).
Note that this requires the nightly toolchain as Miri is still an experimental tool.</p>

<p>Miri is very slow, so it is likely that some tests will take way too long to be feasible.
You can adjust iteration counts in Miri without affecting non-Miri testing as follows:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> <span>limit</span> <span>=</span> <span>if</span> <span>cfg!</span><span>(</span><span>miri</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>10</span> <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span> <span>10_000</span> <span>};</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If your test suite needs to access OS facilities such as timers or the file system, set <code>MIRIFLAGS=-Zmiri-disable-isolation</code> to enable those.
(Miri will tell you when that is necessary.)
If your test suite runs into an unsupported operation, please <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/issues">report an issue</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to add Miri to your CI to ensure your test suite keeps working in Miri, please consult our <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/#running-miri-on-ci">README</a>.
That document is also a great starting point for any other questions you might have.</p>

<p>Miri is also integrated into the <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/">Rust Playground</a>: you can select Miri in the “Tools” menu to check the code for Undefined Behavior.</p>

<p>If Miri complains about your code and you do not understand why, I am happy to help!
The best places to ask probably are Zulip (the #general stream seems fine), and the Miri issue tracker.
Asking publicly is strongly encouraged so other people can help answer the question, and everyone can learn from the responses.
Questions are much easier to answer if you manage to reproduce the problem in a small self-contained bit of example …</p></article></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift">Rustc_codegen_cranelift</a> (cg_clif) is an alternative backend for rustc that I have been working on for the past two years. It uses the Cranelift code generator. Unlike LLVM which is optimized for output quality at the cost of compilation speed even when optimizations are disabled, Cranelift is optimized for compilation speed while producing executables that are almost as fast as LLVM with optimizations disabled. This has the potential to reduce the compilation times of rustc in debug mode.</p>

<p>I recently looked back at the <a href="https://hackmd.io/VnVX5bEHR268SDH4R7izLw">notes</a> for the <a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/topic/design.20meeting.202020-04-03.20compiler-team.23257/near/192806450">design meeting</a> (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/257">meeting proposal</a>) about integrating cg_clif into rustc. I noticed that several of the challenges that needed to be solved have since been solved. Because of this I decided to give an overview of the achievements in the past six months and what the current challenges are.</p>

</h4>

<p>Fixing an ABI incompatibility for proc-macros (see next section) combined with several small fixes to the 128bit support made it possible to compile rustc using cg_clif.</p>

<ul>
  <li>issue <a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift/issues/743">#743</a>: Compile rustc using cg_clif</li>
  <li>commit <a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift/commit/cd684e39e0d27513d21f15e7cc65273ec5883e1b">cd684e3</a>: Fix saturated_* intrinsics for 128bit ints</li>
  <li>commit <a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift/commit/ef4186a85b4c9bd94d258e3280cb239f26b8436e">ef4186a</a>: Use Cranelift legalization for icmp.i128</li>

  <li>commit <a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift/commit/e87651c3f23e6ad63cc1ee359115ad72e50d3ba9">e87651c</a>: Add test for SwitchInt on 128bit integers</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="abi-compatibility">ABI compatibility</h4>

<p>Proc-macro support has been implemented by fixing an ABI incompatibility.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift/pull/1068">#1068</a>: Pass ByRef values at fixed stack offset for extern “C”</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1559">wasmtime#1559</a>: SystemV struct arguments</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="inline-assembly">Inline assembly</h4>

<p>The new style <code>asm!</code> inline assembly and <code>global_asm!</code> have been implemented on Linux by compiling a separate object file using an assembler and linking the main object file for the codegen unit and the assembly object file together. On macOS linking both object files together gives a linker error. Linking both object files together is necessary as rustc expects a single object file for each codegen unit.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift/pull/1062">#1062</a>: Implement global_asm! using an external assembler</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift/pull/1064">#1064</a>: Basic inline asm support</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="simd">SIMD</h4>

<p>The cpuid x86 instruction is now emulated using code that pretends the current CPU is an Intel cpu with SSE and SSE2 support. This fixes ppv-lite86 and by extension c2-chacha and rand. It is not yet possible to use the inline assembly support as corearch uses <code>llvm_asm!</code> for the cpuid invocation. I didn’t implement this as it is currently being replaced with <code>asm!</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift/pull/1070">#1070</a>: Emulate cpuid</li>
</ul>

<p>Stdarch has been changed to use constify on all x86 intrinsics that use <code>rustc_args_required_const</code>. This was necessary to support <code>simd_insert</code> and <code>simd_extract</code> based intrinsics.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/stdarch/pull/876">stdarch#876</a>: Constify all x86 rustc_args_required_const intrinsics</li>
  <li>issue <a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift/issues/669">#669</a>: Support simd_insert platform intrinsic</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="fixing-linking-with-lld-and-sysroot-and-executable-size">Fixing linking with lld and sysroot and executable size</h4>

<p>I assumed the sysroot and executables are much bigger for cg_clif than cg_llvm because of missing optimizations. While fixing linking with lld I discovered that for executables most of this is caused by per function sections not being used by cg_clif. Using this does significantly reduce the size of executables at the cost of significantly slowing down the linker. For this reason I put it behind the <code>CG_CLIF_FUNCTION_SECTIONS</code> env var.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift/pull/1083">#1083</a>: Fix lld</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2212">wasmtime#2212</a>: Fix relocated readonly data in custom sections</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2218">wasmtime#2218</a>: cranelift-object: Support per function sections</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="unsized-locals">Unsized locals</h4>

<p>rust#77170 changed the MIR of <code>&lt;Box&lt;F&gt; as FnOnce&gt;::call_once</code> such that it doesn’t need an alloca anymore. 27a46ff removed the hack to workaround the missing alloca support for this.</p>

<ul>
  <li>commit <a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift/commit/27a46ff765c26eab7b1e1f7d419cec8f5051df00">27a46ff</a>: Rustup to rustc 1.44.0-nightly (45d050cde 2020-04-21)</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71170">rust#71170</a>: Make <code>Box&lt;dyn FnOnce&gt;</code> respect self alignment</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="rust-test-suite">Rust test suite</h4>

<p>There has been significant improvements on the amount of passing rustc tests with the previously mentioned #1068 fixing 82 tests. Except for abi incompatibilities all miscompilations seem to be fixed. There are some unimplemented features, but those are not very important for most use cases.</p>

<ul>
  <li>issue <a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift/issues/381">#381</a>: Make rustc test suite pass</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="simd-1">SIMD</h2>

<p>Many intrinsics remain unimplemented.</p>

<ul>
  <li>issue <a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift/issues/171">#171</a>: std::arch SIMD intrinsics</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="abi-compatibility-1">ABI compatibility</h4>

<p>There are many remaining ABI incomptibilities. I will need to rework cg_clif to reuse <code>rustc_target::abi::call::FnAbi</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift/issues/10">#10</a>: C abi compatability</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="cleanup-during-stack-unwinding-on-panics">Cleanup during stack unwinding on panics</h4>

<p>Cranelift currently doesn’t have support for cleanup during stack unwinding.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/1677">wasmtime#1677</a>: Support cleanup during unwinding</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="atomics">Atomics</h4>

<p>Atomic instructions are currently emulated using a global lock. This is very inefficient and only works when pthreads is available. The new style backend for Cranelift support native atomic instructions. There are several missing features before I can switch cg_clif to use the new style backends.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2077">wasmtime#2077</a>: Implement Wasm Atomics for Cranelift/newBE/aarch64.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2149">wasmtime#2149</a>: This patch fills in the missing pieces needed to support wasm atomics…</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="windows-support">Windows support</h4>

<p>Various issues</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift/issues/977">#997</a>: Windows support</li>
  <li>branch <a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift/compare/wip_windows_support">wip_windows_support</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="git-subtree"><code>git subtree</code></h4>

<p>The plan for integration with rustc was to use <code>git subtree</code>. This git command currently has a bug for which a fix has not yet been upstreamed. It would be nice if for example <code>git submodule</code> could be used for the time being instead.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/5565">rust-clippy#5565</a>: git subtree crashes: can’t sync rustc clippy changes into rust-lang/rust-clippy</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/270">compiler-team#270</a>: Integration of the Cranelift backend with rustc</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h4>

<p>While there have been several PR’s by other people like @osa1, @vi, @spastorino and @CohenArthur, I am the only person who has contributed more than a few changes to cg_clif.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+-author%3Aapp%2Fdependabot-preview">https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+-author%3Aapp%2Fdependabot-preview</a></li>
</ul>



<p>The easiest way to help is by trying to compile and run any project and reporting any issues. You could also try to fix one of the above issues or any other issues in the issue tracker. They are not easy though. Contributing to Cranelift will also help with cg_clif.</p>



<p>I would like to thank each and every person that has supported me while working on cg_clif for the past 2 years. Whether by contributing, donating or simply mentioning cg_clif.</p>

<p>I would also like to thank @eddyb and @cfallin for reviewing a draft of this post.</p>

    <p>The Rust programming language provides memory[1] and thread[2] safety
guarantees via its ownership[3], references and borrowing[4], and slice
types[5] features. However, Unsafe Rust[6] introduces unsafe blocks, unsafe
functions and methods, unsafe traits, and new types that are not subject to
the borrowing rules.</p>

<p>Parts of the Rust standard library are implemented as safe abstractions over
unsafe code (and historically have been vulnerable to memory corruption[7]).
Furthermore, the Rust code and documentation encourage creating safe
abstractions over unsafe code. This can cause a false sense of security if
unsafe code is not properly reviewed and tested.</p>

<p>Unsafe Rust introduces features that do not provide the same memory and
thread safety guarantees. This causes programs or libraries to be
susceptible to memory corruption (CWE-119)[8] and concurrency issues
(CWE-557)[9]. Modern C and C++ compilers provide exploit mitigations to
increase the difficulty to exploit vulnerabilities resulting from these
issues. Therefore, the Rust compiler must also support these exploit
mitigations in order to mitigate vulnerabilities resulting from the use of
Unsafe Rust. This post is going to document these exploit mitigations and
how they apply to Rust.</p>

<h2 id="exploit-mitigations">Exploit mitigations</h2>

<p>This section documents the exploit mitigations applicable to the Rust
compiler when building programs for the Linux operating system on the AMD64
architecture and equivalent.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> All examples in this section were
built using the Rust compiler version 1.40.0 (2019-12-19) on Debian testing
(Bullseye).</p>

<p>The Rust Programming Language currently has no specification. The Rust
compiler (i.e., rustc) is the language reference implementation. All
references to “the Rust compiler” in this post refer to the language
reference implementation.</p>

for a list of targets and their default options. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>

<h3 id="position-independent-executable">Position-independent executable</h3>

<p>Position-independent executable increases the difficulty of the use of code
reuse exploitation techniques, such as return-oriented programming (ROP) and
variants, by generating position-independent code for the executable, and
instructing the dynamic linker to load it similarly to a shared object at a
random load address, thus also benefiting from address-space layout
randomization (ASLR). This is also referred to as “full ASLR”.</p>

<p>The Rust compiler supports position-independent executable, and enables it
by default since version 0.12.0 (2014-10-09)[10]–[13].</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ readelf -h target/release/hello-rust | grep Type:
  Type:                              DYN (Shared object file)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Fig. 1. Checking if an executable is a position-independent executable.</p>

<p>An executable with an object type of <code>ET_DYN</code> (i.e., shared object) and not
<code>ET_EXEC</code> (i.e., executable) is a position-independent executable (see Fig.
1).</p>

<h3 id="integer-overflow-checks">Integer overflow checks</h3>

<p>Integer overflow checks protects programs from undefined and unintended
behavior (which may cause vulnerabilities) by checking for results of signed
and unsigned integer computations that cannot be represented in their type,
resulting in an overflow or wraparound.</p>

<p>The Rust compiler supports integer overflow checks, and enables it when
debug assertions are enabled since version 1.0.0 (2015-05-15)[14]–[17], but
support for it was not completed until version 1.1.0 (2015-06-25)[16]. An
option to control integer overflow checks was later stabilized in version
1.17.0 (2017-04-27)[18]–[20].</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"u: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>u</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Fig. 4. Build and execution of hello-rust-integer with debug assertions
disabled.</p>

<p>Integer overflow checks are enabled when debug assertions are enabled (see
Fig. 3), and disabled when debug assertions are disabled (see Fig. 4). To
enable integer overflow checks independently, use the option to control
integer overflow checks, scoped attributes, or explicit checking methods
such as <code>checked_add</code><sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>It is recommended that explicit wrapping methods such as <code>wrapping_add</code> be
used when wrapping semantics are intended, and that explicit checking and
wrapping methods always be used when using Unsafe Rust.</p>

<p id="fn:2">2. See <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.u32.html">https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.u32.html</a> for more
information on the checked, overflowing, saturating, and wrapping methods
(using u32 as an example). <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>

<h3 id="non-executable-memory-regions">Non-executable memory regions</h3>

<p>Non-executable memory regions increase the difficulty of exploitation by
limiting the memory regions that can be used to execute arbitrary code. Most
modern processors provide support for the operating system to mark memory
regions as non executable, but it was previously emulated by software, such
as in grsecurity/PaX’s
<a href="https://pax.grsecurity.net/docs/pageexec.txt">PAGEEXEC</a> and
<a href="https://pax.grsecurity.net/docs/segmexec.txt">SEGMEXEC</a>, on processors that
did not provide support for it. This is also known as “No Execute (NX) Bit”,
“Execute Disable (XD) Bit”, “Execute Never (XN) Bit”, and others.</p>

<p>The Rust compiler supports non-executable memory regions, and enables it by
default since its initial release, version 0.1 (2012-01-20)[21], [22], but
has regressed since then[23]–[25], and enforced by default since version
1.8.0 (2016-04-14)[25].</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ readelf -l target/release/hello-rust | grep -A 1 GNU_STACK

                 0x0000000000000000 0x0000000000000000  RW     0x10
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Fig. 5. Checking if non-executable memory regions are enabled for a given
binary.</p>

<p>The presence of an element of type <code>PT_GNU_STACK</code> in the program header
table with the <code>PF_X</code> (i.e., executable) flag unset indicates non-executable
memory regions<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> are enabled for a given binary (see Fig. 5).
Conversely, the presence of an element of type <code>PT_GNU_STACK</code> in the program
header table with the <code>PF_X</code> flag set or the absence of an element of type
<code>PT_GNU_STACK</code> in the program header table indicates non-executable memory
regions are not enabled for a given binary.</p>

<p id="fn:3">3. See the Appendix section for more information on why it affects other
memory regions besides the stack. <a href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>

<h3 id="stack-clashing-protection">Stack clashing protection</h3>

<p>Stack clashing protection protects the stack from overlapping with another
memory region—allowing arbitrary data in both to be overwritten using each
other—by reading from the stack pages as the stack grows to cause a page
fault when attempting to read from the guard page/region. This is also
referred to as “stack probes” or “stack probing”.</p>

<p>The Rust compiler supports stack clashing protection via stack probing, and
enables it by default since version 1.20.0 (2017-08-31)[26]–[29].</p>

Fig. 8. Cross references to <code>__rust_probestack</code> in modified hello-rust.</p>

<p>To check if stack clashing protection is enabled for a given binary, search
for cross references to <code>__rust_probestack</code>. The <code>__rust_probestack</code> is
called in the prologue of functions whose stack size is larger than a page
size (see Fig. 6), and can be forced for illustration purposes by modifying
the hello-rust example as seen in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8.</p>

<h3 id="read-only-relocations-and-immediate-binding">Read-only relocations and immediate binding</h3>

<p><strong>Read-only relocations</strong> protect segments containing relocations and
relocation information (i.e., <code>.init_array</code>, <code>.fini_array</code>, <code>.dynamic</code>, and
<code>.got</code>) from being overwritten by marking these segments read only. This is
also referred to as “partial RELRO”.</p>

<p>The Rust compiler supports read-only relocations, and enables it by default
since version 1.21.0 (2017-10-12)[30], [31].</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ readelf -l target/release/hello-rust | grep GNU_RELRO
  GNU_RELRO      0x000000000002ee00 0x000000000002fe00 0x000000000002fe00
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Fig. 9. Checking if read-only relocations is enabled for a given binary.</p>

<p>The presence of an element of type <code>PT_GNU_RELRO</code> in the program header
table indicates read-only relocations are enabled for a given binary (see
Fig. 9). Conversely, the absence of an element of type <code>PT_GNU_RELRO</code> in the
program header table indicates read-only relocations are not enabled for a
given binary.</p>

<p><strong>Immediate binding</strong> protects additional segments containing relocations
(i.e., <code>.got.plt</code>) from being overwritten by instructing the dynamic linker
to perform all relocations before transferring control to the program during
startup, so all segments containing relocations can be marked …</p></div></div>

    </span>
(Map image by Daniel R. Strebe, licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0)</p><h2>1. The only projection that is important is Web Mercator</h2><p>While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator_projection">Web Mercator</a> is
probably the most popular projection that most people will run into, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albers_projection">Albers</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_cylindrical_equal-area_projection">Lambert</a>
equal-area projections are fairly common for when the projection needs to maintain
the area rather than the navigational direction (which is one of the main features
of the Mercator projection).</p><h2>2. All coordinates are latitude/longitude pairs</h2><p>In addition to latitude/longitude coordinates, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system">Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
coordinates</a>
are also fairly common. UTM splits the Earth into 60 zones, and then
further specifies northings and eastings in metres (as opposed to degrees, minutes and seconds).</p><p>The UTM notably omits the polar areas - which are covered by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_polar_stereographic_coordinate_system">Universal Polar Stereographic (UPS)
coordinate system</a>
instead.</p><h2>3. Latitude always comes before longitude in a coordinate pair</h2><p>While it is common to see items in (latitude,longitude) order, some formats
(e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON">GeoJSON</a>) dictate that coordinates
follow (longitude,latitude) order instead. This matches the typical way coordinates
are specified in a Cartesian coordinate system: (x,y).</p><h2>4. A degree of latitude or longitude always represents the same distance</h2><p>In the Mercator projection, the Earth - which, in reality, is an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spheroid#Oblate_spheroids">oblate spheroid</a> -
is projected as a simple cylinder. This means that "parallel" longitude lines
meet at the poles, so the distance between degrees of longitude are much shorter
as they get closer to the poles than they are at the equator (~111 km).</p><p>The variance in latitude is not as large - but it still varies by about 1km going
from the equator to the poles.</p><h2>5. The shortest path between two points is a straight line</h2><p>The Earth isn't flat - as such, although your map may be projected to be flat,
the distance between two points needs to follow the curvature of
the Earth and can usually be approximated by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula">Haversine formula</a>.</p><h2>6. Coordinates for a given landmark are always fixed</h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_drift">Movements of the Earth's tectonic plates</a>
mean that the land masses are moving slowly with the passage of time.
For example, Australia has shifted about 1.8 metres from where it
was in 1994 (about 7 centimetres per year). This also means that <a href="http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/positioning-navigation/geodesy/datums-projections/gda2020">geocentric
datums</a>
have to be updated to account for these changes every once in a while.</p><h2>7. Given a pair of coordinates, you can plot it on a map</h2><p>In addition to coordinates, we also need to know the datum, which is
the coordinate system and its specific set of reference points on the Earth.
While most coordinates often follow the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System">WGS84 datum</a>,
care should be taken to ensure that the map and the coordinates plotted
are using the same datum.</p><h2>8. There is one global ellipsoid to base coordinates on</h2><p>Most modern datums are based on the WGS84
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsoid">ellipsoid</a>
as the surveys are often completed using GPS as a reference, but notably
Russia and China still base their local datums on different reference ellipsoids.</p><p>As a result, conversions to and from datums based on different
ellipsoids may result in inaccuracies and deviations and may be of concern
if you have to deal with GPS, GLONASS, and BeiDou data at the same time.</p></div></div>]]>

<h3>(Partial) Transcript</h3>
<p><strong><em>[Most episode transcripts/scripts are reserved for my Patreon supporters (at least for the time being), but I like to give you at least a taster here — or in this case, the first half of the episode.]</em></strong></p><p><em>Welcome to the Life and Times of Video Games, an audio series about video games and the video game industry, as they were in the past and how they’ve come to be the way they are today. I'm Richard Moss, and this is episode 28, Transport Tycoon, or the tale of the great optimiser and his two greatest works.</em></p><p>We’ll get going in just a moment. </p><p>*pause for pre-roll ad/cross-promo slot*</p><p>***</p><p>You may have heard the expression that every overnight sensation is a decade in the making — a decade of hard work, toiling in obscurity…or <em>relative</em> obscurity, honing a talent, perfecting a craft, <em>optimising</em> a skill set and envisioning whatever it is that breaks through.</p><p>In reality the actual duration is rarely a decade — it’s five years or eight years or eighteen years, or however long it takes for the pieces to all fall into place: the talent, timing, and product. But the idea bears repeating: the greatest accolades, the greatest achievements, the greatest games are the product of hard work built atop years of invisible labour.</p><p>And such it was that Chris Sawyer, like John Romero, Carol Shaw, Gunpei Yokoi, and many others before and since — such it was that in 1994 Chris Sawyer suddenly shifted from a little-known (though well-respected) figure in the games industry, a programmer who converted Amiga games to the PC, to become an industry icon.</p><p>Nineteen-ninety-four was the year when his first original game was published, the year when big-name PC game publisher Microprose put his transportation-focused business simulation game Transport Tycoon, an incredible solo development effort, in a box and sold it in stores to widespread acclaim. </p><p><img alt="SCR1" src="https://lifeandtimes.games/episodes/files/scr1.jpg" width="866" height="362"><br><em>Transport Tycoon, the game that made Chris Sawyer into a games industry icon (</em><em><a href="https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=47&amp;t=29058" target="_blank">image source</a></em><em>)</em><br></p><div><p>The game itself had taken Chris just a year to develop, but the journey to making it had begun much earlier.</p><p>Chris had started programming as a teenager in 1981, largely out of curiosity, through trying to make things appear on the screen on a range of different computers he’d encountered. There was the Commodore PET at his high school, the Sinclair ZX81 demonstration unit in a W H Smiths store, and the Texas Instruments TI99/4A one of his neighbours owned, as well as the Commodore VIC-20 a different neighbour had. And eventually, after diligently saving up his pocket money, he’d become engrossed in a machine of his own, a Camputers Lynx, a now-forgotten, obscure-even-then 8-bit computer with fancier graphics and more horsepower than the leading systems of its day (the leading systems at the time being the Apple II, ZX Spectrum, and Commodore 64).</p><p>Here, in 1983, is where the journey really starts — where Chris set off towards the lands where he’d make his name. And I find it fascinating how serendipitous this was — for, you see, Chris’s two great successes, Transport Tycoon and RollerCoaster Tycoon, were both made possible by his phenomenal systems knowledge; by his immense capacity to hand-code complex interactions of data at low levels of abstraction.</p><p>And here is where he began to learn those skills, to internalise them to the point of becoming natural talents. He later told Arcade Attack in an interview that he’d not had access to an assembler for that Lynx computer, so when he’d wanted to move beyond coding in BASIC he’d needed to write his programs byte-by-byte in machine code — the lowest-level programming language, the numerical instructions that computers themselves use. And with scant resources available to teach him these skills, he mostly figured it out on his own, just trying different things until he got his ideas to work. Always chasing the next exhilarating breakthrough.</p><p>Chris continued to dabble in machine code, though somewhat less than before, when he upgraded to a similarly-obscure machine called the Memotech MTX500, which actually did come with a built-in assembler, which enabled him to write programs in the abbreviation-heavy Z80 assembly language. Programs that, beginning in 1984, he very often had published commercially.</p></div><p><img alt="Memotech_MTX500-wide" src="https://lifeandtimes.games/episodes/files/memotech_mtx500-wide.jpg" width="1020" height="584"><br><em>The Memotech MTX500 (</em><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Memotech_MTX500.jpg" target="_blank">Image source</a></em><em>)</em><br></p><div><p>Chris had sent Memotech cassette tapes of some games he’d made through copying the designs of popular titles, like Missile Kommand, which was the 1980 Atari arcade game converted to the capabilities of the MTX500, using a mix of BASIC and machine code, with the name intentionally misspelled (a ‘k’ rather than a ‘c’) as though that somehow made his unapologetic, blatant clone of another’s work okay. </p><p>But this was the wild west of the computer games business, and Memotech weren’t much concerned. Or at least their games guy Jim Wills wasn’t much concerned, neither at this point nor a few months later when he left to start a company called Megastar Games. Jim liked Chris’s work enough to publish it, for meagre royalties but invaluable experience. And so Chris was commercially published with his unlicensed MTX500 versions of Missile Command, Q*bert, Manic Miner, and a few others.</p><p>After high school he enrolled in a computer science and microprocessor systems degree, where he studied the fundamentals of both software and hardware design in computers — an experience he found invaluable, as it taught him how to push computers further by learning how their hardware worked. And it taught him the theories behind the sorts of nitty-gritty software-systems things he’d already been practising at home: optimisation, sorting, algorithms, and even more varieties of machine code.</p></div><p><img alt="escape-from-zarcos-memotech-mtx500" src="https://lifeandtimes.games/episodes/files/escape-from-zarcos-memotech-mtx500.png" width="1044" height="788"><em><br>Escape from Zarcos, Chris Sawyer clone of Manic Miner for the Memotech MTX500</em><br></p><div><p>At home, meanwhile, he’d shifted over to the Amstrad CPC, which technologically-speaking wasn’t hugely different to the Memotech system he’d been on before — but it was a modest upgrade, and unlike his previous computers it was actually a popular system. And for Chris it was a gateway to the PC, because in the course of studying at university and making computer games on the side he wound up getting an Amstrad-made IBM-PC clone.</p><p>Chris had during this period been getting his games published through Ariolasoft, a German company with a UK subsidiary that promised him a job programming games for them once he graduated. Except some promises can’t be kept, especially in an industry that moves as fast as computer games publishing.</p><p>The home computer business was by that point deep into its transition from 8-bit to 16-bit hardware, and that transition came with adjustments to the standard of game graphics and design required, and to the way marketing and sales worked, and the cost of publishing, and so on, and Ariolasoft wasn’t doing too well at managing the transition. </p><p>So Chris didn’t have a job waiting for him after all, and he’d missed out on all the great electronics engineering jobs his classmates applied for. (Oops!) But not to worry — he’d made enough connections and enough headway as a programmer that he could get himself a business agent, and that agent in turn connected him to the booming Amiga-to-PC games porting industry.</p><p>He later said he’d thought it a “stop-gap” measure, just “a bit of fun” while he looked for more permanent employment in the electronics industry. But Chris took to his new conversions work like a duck to water. The kid who’d had to get creative and remain patient to make anything work on his Camputers Lynx machine now excelled in an environment where he had to contend with the vast gap in multimedia capabilities between the Amiga and the PC.</p><p>PCs of the day were pathetically inept as games machines, compared to a system like the Amiga. Whereas the PC had just a CPU, and maybe, in a minority of machines, a dedicated sound card like the SoundBlaster 16, every Amiga came with a custom chipset that contained audio and video co-processors that could take some strain off the …</p></div></div></div>

<p>TL;DR</p>
<p>Do not enable <code>net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle</code>—it doesn’t even
exist anymore since Linux 4.12. Most of the time, <code>TIME-WAIT</code> sockets
are harmless. Otherwise, jump to <a href="#summary">summary</a> for the
recommended solutions.</p>
</div>
<p>The Linux kernel documentation is not very helpful about what
<code>net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle</code> and <code>net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse</code> do. This lack of
documentation opens the path to numerous tuning guides advising to set
both these settings to 1 to reduce the number of entries in the
<code>TIME-WAIT</code> state. However, as stated by the <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/buster/manpages/tcp.7.en.html" title="tcp - TCP protocol">tcp(7)</a> manual page,
the <code>net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle</code> option is quite problematic for
public-facing servers as it won’t handle connections from two
different computers behind the same <abbr title="Network Address Translation">NAT</abbr> device, which is a problem
hard to detect and waiting to bite you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enable fast recycling of <code>TIME-WAIT</code> sockets.  Enabling this option
is not recommended since this causes problems when working with <abbr title="Network Address Translation">NAT</abbr>
(Network Address Translation).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will provide here a more detailed explanation on how to properly
handle the <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state. Also, keep in mind we are looking at the
TCP stack of Linux. This is completely unrelated to <em>Netfilter</em>
connection tracking which may be tweaked in other ways.<sup id="fnref-netfilter"><a href="#fn-netfilter">1</a></sup></p>


<p>Let’s rewind a bit and have a close look at this <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state.
What is it? See the TCP state diagram below:<sup id="fnref-source"><a href="#fn-source">2</a></sup></p>
<figure><p><span><img alt="TCP state diagram" src="https://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/tcp/tcp-state-diagram-v2.svg" width="727" height="867" loading="lazy"></span></p><figcaption>TCP state diagram</figcaption></figure>
<p>Only the <strong>end closing the connection first</strong> will reach the
<code>TIME-WAIT</code> state. The other end will follow a path which usually
permits it to quickly get rid of the connection.</p>
<p>You can have a look at the current state of connections with <code>ss
-tan</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$</span> ss -tan <span>|</span> head -5
<span>LISTEN     0  511             *:80              *:*</span>
<span>SYN-RECV   0  0     192.0.2.145:80    203.0.113.5:35449</span>
<span>SYN-RECV   0  0     192.0.2.145:80   203.0.113.27:53599</span>
<span>ESTAB      0  0     192.0.2.145:80   203.0.113.27:33605</span>
<span>TIME-WAIT  0  0     192.0.2.145:80   203.0.113.47:50685</span>
</pre></div>

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose<a href="#purpose" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>There are two purposes for the <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state:</p>
<ul>
<li>The most known one is to <strong>prevent delayed segments</strong> from one
    connection being accepted by a later connection relying on the
    same quadruplet (source address, source port, destination address,
    destination port). The sequence number also needs to be in a
    certain range to be accepted. This narrows a bit the problem but
    it still exists, especially on fast connections with large receive
    windows. <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1337" title="RFC 1337: TIME-WAIT Assassination Hazards in TCP">RFC 1337</a> explains in details what happens when the
    <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state is deficient.<sup id="fnref-rfc1337"><a href="#fn-rfc1337">3</a></sup> Here is an example of
    what could be avoided if the <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state wasn’t shortened:</li>
</ul>
<figure><p><span><img alt="Duplicate segments accepted in another connection" src="https://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/tcp/duplicate-segment.svg" width="512" height="524" loading="lazy"></span></p><figcaption>Due to a shortened TIME-WAIT state, a delayed TCP segment has been accepted in an unrelated connection.</figcaption></figure>
<ul>
<li>The other purpose is to ensure <strong>the remote end has closed the
    connection</strong>. When the last <em>ACK</em> is lost, the remote end stays in
    the <code>LAST-ACK</code> state.<sup id="fnref-lastack"><a href="#fn-lastack">4</a></sup> Without the <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state, a
    connection could be reopened while the remote end still thinks the
    previous connection is valid. When it receives a <em>SYN</em> segment (and
    the sequence number matches), it will answer with a <em>RST</em> as it is
    not expecting such a segment. The new connection will be aborted
    with an error:</li>
</ul>
<figure><p><span><img alt="Last ACK lost" src="https://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/tcp/last-ack.svg" width="500" height="337" loading="lazy"></span></p><figcaption>If the remote end stays in LAST-ACK state because the last ACK was lost, opening a new connection with the same quadruplet will not work.</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793" title="RFC 793: Transmission Control Protocol">RFC 793</a> requires the <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state to last twice the time of the
<abbr title="Maximum Segment Lifetime">MSL</abbr>. On Linux, this duration is <strong>not</strong> tunable and is defined in
<code>include/net/tcp.h</code> as one minute:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#define TCP_TIMEWAIT_LEN (60*HZ) </span><span>/* how long to wait to destroy TIME-WAIT</span>
<span>                                  * state, about 60 seconds     */</span><span></span>
</pre></div>

<p>There have been
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/2014/http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.network/244411" title="[RFC PATCH net-next] tcp: introduce tcp_tw_interval to specify the time of TIME-WAIT">propositions to turn this into a tunable value</a> but
it has been refused on the ground the <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state is a good
thing.</p>
<h2 id="problems">Problems<a href="#problems" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Now, let’s see why this state can be annoying on a server handling a
lot of connections. There are three aspects of the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>the slot taken in the connection table preventing <strong>new
   connections</strong> of the same kind,</li>
<li>the <strong>memory</strong> occupied by the socket structure in the kernel, and</li>
<li>the additional <strong>CPU usage</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result of <code>ss -tan state time-wait | wc -l</code> is not a problem per
se!</p>
<h3 id="connection-table-slot">Connection table slot<a href="#connection-table-slot" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>A connection in the <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state is kept for one minute in the
connection table. This means, another connection with the same
<em>quadruplet</em> (source address, source port, destination address,
destination port) cannot exist.</p>
<p>For a web server, the destination address and the destination port are
likely to be constant. If your web server is behind an L7
load-balancer, the source address will also be constant. On Linux, the
client port is by default allocated in a port range of about 30,000
ports (this can be changed by tuning
<code>net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range</code>). This means that only 30,000
connections can be established between the web server and the
load-balancer every minute, so about <strong>500 connections per second</strong>.</p>
<p>If the <code>TIME-WAIT</code> sockets are on the client side, such a situation is
easy to detect. The call to <code>connect()</code> will return <code>EADDRNOTAVAIL</code>
and the application will log some error message about that. On the
server side, this is more complex as there is no log and no counter to
rely on. In doubt, you should just try to come with something sensible
to list the number of used quadruplets:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$</span> ss -tan <span>'sport = :80'</span> <span>|</span> awk <span>'{print $(NF)" "$(NF-1)}'</span> <span>|</span> <span>\</span>
      sed <span>'s/:[^ ]*//g'</span> <span>|</span> sort <span>|</span> uniq -c
<span>    696 10.24.2.30 10.33.1.64</span>
<span>   1881 10.24.2.30 10.33.1.65</span>
<span>   5314 10.24.2.30 10.33.1.66</span>
<span>   5293 10.24.2.30 10.33.1.67</span>
<span>   3387 10.24.2.30 10.33.1.68</span>
<span>   2663 10.24.2.30 10.33.1.69</span>
<span>   1129 10.24.2.30 10.33.1.70</span>
<span>  10536 10.24.2.30 10.33.1.73</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The solution is <strong>more quadruplets</strong>.<sup id="fnref-outgoing"><a href="#fn-outgoing">5</a></sup> This can be done in
several ways (in the order of difficulty to setup):</p>
<ul>
<li>use <strong>more client ports</strong> by setting <code>net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range</code> to
   a wider range,</li>
<li>use <strong>more server ports</strong> by asking the web server to listen to several
   additional ports (81, 82, 83, …),</li>
<li>use <strong>more client IP</strong> by configuring additional IP on the load
   balancer and use them in a round-robin fashion,<sup id="fnref-bind"><a href="#fn-bind">6</a></sup></li>
<li>use <strong>more server IP</strong> by configuring additional IP on the web
   server.<sup id="fnref-others"><a href="#fn-others">7</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>A last solution is to tweak <code>net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse</code> and
<code>net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle</code>. Don’t do that yet, we will cover these
settings later.</p>
<h3 id="memory">Memory<a href="#memory" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>With many connections to handle, leaving a socket open for one
additional minute may cost your server some memory. For example, if
you want to handle about 10,000 new connections per second, you will
have about 600,000 sockets in the <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state. How much memory
does it represent? Not that much!</p>
<p>First, from the application point of view, a <code>TIME-WAIT</code> socket does
not consume any memory: the socket has been closed. In the kernel, a
<code>TIME-WAIT</code> socket is present in three structures (for three different
purposes):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A <strong>hash table of connections</strong>, named the “TCP established hash
    table” (despite containing connections in other states) is used to
    locate an existing connection, for example when receiving a new
    segment.</p>
<p>Each bucket of this hash table contains both a list of connections
in the <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state and a list of regular active
connections. The size of the hash table depends on the system
memory and is printed at boot:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$</span> dmesg <span>|</span> grep <span>"TCP established hash table"</span>
<span>[    0.169348] TCP established hash table entries: 65536 (order: 8, 1048576 bytes)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>It is possible to override it by specifying the number of entries
on the kernel command line with the <code>thash_entries</code> parameter.</p>
<p>Each element of the list of connections in the <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state
is a <code>struct tcp_timewait_sock</code>, while the type for other
states is <code>struct tcp_sock</code>:<sup id="fnref-tcptimewaitsock"><a href="#fn-tcptimewaitsock">8</a></sup></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>struct</span> <span>tcp_timewait_sock</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>struct</span> <span>inet_timewait_sock</span> <span>tw_sk</span><span>;</span>

    <span>struct</span> <span>hlist_node</span>        <span>tw_death_node</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre></div>

</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>set of lists of connections</strong>, called the “death row”, is used
    to expire the connections in the <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state. They are
    ordered by how much time left before expiration.</p>
<p>It uses the same memory space as for the entries in the hash table
of connections. This is the <code>struct hlist_node tw_death_node</code>
member of <code>struct inet_timewait_sock</code>.<sup id="fnref-deathrow"><a href="#fn-deathrow">9</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>hash table of bound ports</strong>, holding the locally bound ports
    and the associated parameters, is used to determine if it is safe
    to listen to a given port or to find a free port in the case of
    dynamic bind. The size of this hash table is the same as the size
    of the hash table of connections:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$</span> dmesg <span>|</span> grep <span>"TCP bind hash table"</span>
<span>[    0.169962] TCP bind hash table entries: 65536 (order: 8, 1048576 bytes)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Each element is a <code>struct inet_bind_socket</code>. There is
one element for each locally bound port. A <code>TIME-WAIT</code> connection
to a web server is locally bound to the port 80 and shares the
same entry as its sibling <code>TIME-WAIT</code> connections. On the other
hand, a connection to a remote service is locally bound to some
random port and does not share its entry.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We are only concerned by the space occupied by <code>struct
tcp_timewait_sock</code> and <code>struct inet_bind_socket</code>. There is one <code>struct
tcp_timewait_sock</code> for each connection in the <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state,
inbound or outbound. There is one dedicated <code>struct inet_bind_socket</code>
for each outbound connection and none for an inbound connection.</p>
<p>A <code>struct tcp_timewait_sock</code> is only 168 bytes while a <code>struct
inet_bind_socket</code> is 48 bytes:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$</span> sudo apt-get install linux-image-<span>$(</span>uname -r<span>)</span>-dbg

October 1, 2020 | https://adamzerner.bearblog.dev/big-o-little-n/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://adamzerner.bearblog.dev/big-o-little-n/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div><p>I remember when I was first learning about hash tables. I thought I stumbled across an ingenious optimization for dealing with hash collisions. Before explaining my optimization, let me first briefly explain how hash tables work and what hash collisions are. I also made a video if you're interested.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9zhZB2KkM" title="Hash Tables"><img alt="" src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/pM9zhZB2KkM/0.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Say that we have a hash that maps someone's name to their age. <code>"adam"</code> is <code>27</code>, so we want to enter that into our hash.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.ibb.co/qWdjbhM/Slice.png"></p>
<p>Here's what happens:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>"adam"</code> gets put through a hash function.</li>
<li>The hash function spits out <code>7</code>.</li>
<li><code>7</code> is the index of the array where we are going to store <code>"adam"</code>'s value.</li>
<li>So we store <code>27</code> into <code>array[7]</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we run <code>hash.get("adam")</code> in the future and need to look up the value for <code>"adam"</code>, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run <code>"adam"</code> through the hash function.</li>
<li>Get <code>7</code> as the output.</li>
<li>This means we have to look at <code>array[7]</code> to get the value.</li>
<li>So we look at <code>array[7]</code> to get our value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully if we have a key of <code>"alice"</code> or <code>"bob"</code> it'll hash to a different index. But... what happens if it hashes to the same index? That's called a hash collision.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.ibb.co/sJbJKnD/Slice.png"></p>
<p>A common approach is that if there's a collision, you store the values in a linked list.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.ibb.co/VJsSW3T/Slice.png"></p>
<p>Fair enough. That makes sense.</p>
<p>But wait!!! It takes <code>O(n)</code> time to look up a value in a linked list. Can't we use a binary search tree to speed that up to <code>O(log n)</code>???</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.ibb.co/R3Vrc10/Slice.png"></p>
<p>Or... can't we take it a step further and use a <em>hash inside of a hash</em> to get the lookup time all the way down to <code>O(1)</code>?!</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.ibb.co/7CyYNWY/Slice.png"></p>
<p>I hate to say it, but however many years ago when I had these thoughts, there were a few moments where I thought I was a genius. Now when I look back at that former self, I facepalm.</p>
<p>It is true that going from a linked list to a BST to a hash takes you from <code>O(n)</code> to <code>O(logn)</code> to <code>O(1)</code> lookup time. However, since collisions are rare, <code>n</code> is going to be small. And when <code>n</code> is small, <code>O(n)</code> might be faster than <code>O(1)</code>.</p>
<p>To understand why that is, think back to what Big-O really means. I think it helps to think about it as a "math thing" instead of a "programming thing". Consider two functions:</p>
<pre><code>f(n) = 4n + 1000
g(n) = 2n^2 + 5
</code></pre>
<p>Big-O of <code>f</code> is <code>O(n)</code> and Big-O of <code>g</code> is <code>O(n^2)</code>. We just focus on the part that "really matters". When <code>n</code> gets really big, the fact that it's <code>4n</code> doesn't really matter. Nor does the <code>+ 1000</code>.</p>
<p>But what about when <code>n</code> is small? Well, let's look at happens when <code>n</code> is <code>5</code>:</p>
<pre><code>f(5) = 4(5) + 1000 = 20 + 1000 = 1020
g(5) = 2(5^2) + 5 = 2(25) + 5 = 50 + 5 = 55
</code></pre>
<p>Look at that! The <code>O(n^2)</code> function is almost 20 times faster than the <code>O(n)</code> function!</p>
<p>And <em>that</em> is basically why they use a linked list instead of a BST or hash to handle collisions. Since <code>n</code> is small, Big-O isn't the right question to ask.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here's another example. I just wrote the following code while prepping for an interview:</p>
<pre><code>const isVowel = (char) =&gt; ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"].includes(char);
</code></pre>
<p>Normally I wouldn't think twice about it, but since interviewers care so much about time complexity, I stopped to think about whether it could be improved.</p>
<p>And it hit me that it's actually <code>O(n)</code>(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24660824">caveat</a>), because we've got an array and have to iterate over every element to see if the element matches <code>char</code>. It's easy to overlook this because we're using <code>includes</code> and not writing the code ourselves.</p>
<p>So then I thought that maybe we could use a hash instead to get <code>O(1)</code> lookup. Something like this:</p>
<pre><code>const isVowel = (char) =&gt; {
  const vowels = {
    a: true,
    e: true,
    i: true,
    o: true,
    u: true,
  };

  return !!vowels[char];
};
</code></pre>
<p>But then I realized that this is the same mistake I made with the hash collision stuff however many years ago. <em><code>n</code> is small, so Big-O isn't the question we should be asking</em>. Here <code>n</code> is <code>5</code>.</p>
<p>I think that the array approach would actually be faster than the hash approach, even though it's <code>O(n)</code> instead of <code>O(1)</code>. The reason for this is called locality.</p>
<p>If you dive deep under the hood, when you look up an element in an array, the CPU actually grabs a bunch of adjacent elements as well as the one you wanted, and it stores the adjacent elements in a cache. So here when we look up <code>"a"</code> in the array, it'll probably grab <code>"a"</code>, <code>"e"</code>, <code>"i"</code>, <code>"o"</code>, and <code>"u"</code>. And so next time when we want to grab <code>"e"</code>, it can take it from the cache, which is a lot faster. This works because the elements in the array are close to each other in the physical memory. But with a hash, my understanding is that they wouldn't be so close, and thus we wouldn't benefit from this spatial locality effect.</p>
<p>I'm no low-level programming wiz so I'm not sure about any of this. That's ok, I think it's beside the point of this post. The real point of this post is that when you have a little <code>n</code>, Big-O doesn't matter.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You can learn the basics of JavaScript quickly. You don't need a engineering degree, or a front end bootcamp.</p><p>Learning the basics of JavaScript is enough to get started with modern frameworks like React.js. Once you know the basics, you can do some truly amazing things.</p><p>You can quickly spin up interactive prototypes.<br>You can use live data sets.<br>You can create web, mobile, and desktop apps.<br>You can define interfaces in high fidelity.<br>You can write scripts to automate daily tasks.<br>You can make plugins for design tools like Sketch and Figma.<br>You can build with modern frameworks like React.js.</p><p>You can't learn JavaScript in a day, but you can learn it quickly. The best way to learn is to build. This guide is meant to give you enough information to start building. </p><h2>Editor</h2><p><img src="https://react.design/assets/javascript/theme.png">
</p><p>Before we write any code, it's a good idea to get comfortable with your text editor. I'd recommend using a text editor like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>, or <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> as you write JavaScript. They're both free and support lots of plugins to make things easier. You can also find lots of nice themes. Here's a <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Framer.framer-syntax">theme</a> for VSCode that I like.</p><p>Learning keyboard shortcuts, and customizing the look of your editor will make for a much more enjoyable coding experience.</p><h2>Setup</h2><p>JavaScript is a scripting language that for our intents and purposes, will be executed by the browser.</p><p>There are multiple ways to include javascript inside your webpage. The way we will use javascript will be by including <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags right before the closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag. </p><pre><code><span>&lt;!</span><span>DOCTYPE</span><span> </span><span>html</span><span>&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;</span><span>
</span>    
<span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>// Javascript will go here</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello friend!"</span><span>)</span><span>

</span><span>  </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre><p>Weâ€™ll put our javascript inside here, but we could also reference an external file.
<code>console.log()</code> is a helpful tool for debugging. Here I'm writing "Hello Friend!" To the console. You an access the console in Chrome using the <code>CMD+Option+J</code> shortcut.</p><p><img src="https://react.design/assets/javascript/console.png">
</p><p>There are 5 core concepts in JavaScript that are important to understand.</p><p><strong>1. Variables</strong><br><strong>2. Data Structures</strong><br><strong>3. Loops</strong><br><strong>4. Conditionals</strong><br><strong>5. Functions</strong></p><h2>Variables</h2><p>Variables are containers that hold values. These values can take lots of different forms. If you wanted a variable to hold a number you could write it as <code>var num = 20;</code>. If I use <code>console.log(num)</code> it should show me the number twenty.</p><p>Variables can be referenced later. <code>var double = num * 2; // 40</code></p><p>Variables can hold lots of different data types. I want to discuss a few different common ways to hold data. There are primitive data types like numbers, which we used earlier, There are strings, which are just a way to store text, and booleans which are values that are either true or false.</p><pre><code><span>var</span><span> days </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>40</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>// Number</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>var</span><span> label </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"Hello"</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>// String</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>var</span><span> hidden </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>// Boolean</span></code></pre><h2>Data Structures</h2><p>In addition to primitive data types there are others that have more complex structures. Two of these important types are objects (sometimes called object literals) and arrays. </p><p>Objects can be defined using curly braces. 
<code>var obj = {}</code></p><p>What goes inside the curly braces are a collection of key value pairs. The key goes first, followed by a colon, and then the value. </p><pre><code><span>var</span><span> obj </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>  key</span><span>:</span><span> value
</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre><p>Keys are labels that help you find the data you want to store. Keys in a single object must be unique. Values can be any data type. Numbers, strings, arrays, and even other objects. 
Here's an example Object with multiple key value pairs in action:</p><pre><code><span>var</span><span> profile </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>	name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'Philip'</span><span>,</span><span> 
</span><span>	age</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>25</span><span>,</span><span> 
</span><span>	contact</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>		twitter</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'philipcdavis'</span><span>,</span><span> 
</span><span>		email</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'reactfordesigners@gmail.com'</span><span>
</span><span>	</span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre><p>Name, age, contact, twitter, and email are all different keys in this object. The values are all different and many have different value types. Some are strings, some are numbers, and some are other objects.</p><p>This nested structure is common and you will see it a lot when working with data sets.</p><p>There are two ways to access a value inside an object. The first way is sometimes called dot notation: <code>profile.name</code>. The second way is by using brackets <code>profile['name']</code>. Bracket notion is useful when your key name is dynamic.</p><p>The other data type thatâ€™s important to know about is the Array. You define an array with square brackets. </p><p><code>var myArr = [];</code></p><p>You can store any type of data inside these arrays and they don't need to all be the same type (though they usually are). An example array might look like this: </p><pre><code><span>var</span><span> teams </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>'lakers'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'nuggets'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'rockets'</span><span>]</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>Instead of using keys, arrays use a built in index to keep track of location. The index of arrays starts at 0. If we wanted to access the second value of this array (nuggets) we could do so by typing <code>teams[1];</code></p><p>If your data was as simple as this, using objects and arrays might seem unnecessary. They start to shine when you have data sets that are larger. To work with more data, we'll probably want to use a loop</p><h2>Loops</h2><p>Loops enable you to run a block of code multiple times. You can use a loop with objects and arrays to execute a block of code on each item in the structure. </p><p>To loop through each value in an array you can use a for loop that executes a block. </p><pre><code><span>for</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span> i</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span> i</span><span>&lt;</span><span>teams</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>;</span><span> i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>// Block to be executed</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre><p>What goes into the parenthesis determines how many times the block of code is executed. The first value is a counter variable. <code>i</code> is often used to refer to the fact that it's used as the index value of the array. We will start the counter at 0. </p><p>The next value is called the conditional. Once the conditional is false, the loop will end. We can set the value to be <code>i &lt; teams.length</code>. The <code>.length</code> is a helper value built into every array that will tell you how many items are in the array. Once the value of the counter is as great as the length of the array, we can stop looping. The last value <code>i++</code> is what we want to happen after our loop runs. We want our counter to increase in value by one every time the loop runs.</p><p>If we log a string, you can see that it will print out 4 times.
If we log the value i, you can see that it increments up. If you combine this incremented value i with our array, you can see how we can access each value in our array.</p><pre><code><span>for</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span> i</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span>i</span><span>&lt;</span><span>teams</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>;</span><span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> 
</span><span>	</span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>teams</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>There are other types of loops but they all are doing something pretty similar, running a block of code multiple times. Thatâ€™s the essential work of a loop.</p><h2>Conditionals</h2><p>Next up on our list is conditionals. The most common type of conditional is the if/else statement. </p><pre><code><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>conditional</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>	</span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'the conditional evaluated to true'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>else</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'the conditional evaluated to false'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre><p>If the <code>conditional</code> value in the parenthesis evaluates to true, the block inside the first set of curly brackets is run, otherwise the else block is run.</p><p>Letâ€™s use it in combination with our loop to log only the first two items in our array. Because we donâ€™t need the else here, we can remove it, and weâ€™ll get the same result.</p><pre><code><span>for</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span> i </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span> i</span><span>&lt;</span><span>teams</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>;</span><span> i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>	</span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>i </span><span>&lt;</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>	  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>teams</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span>	</span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre><p>Youâ€™ll use these conditionals to to control what gets executed when.</p><h2>Functions</h2><p>Functions allow you to create reusable and modular code.</p><p>Another way to say it is that they are blocks of code than can be executed whenever they are needed. </p><p>Here's what one looks like</p><pre><code><span>function</span><span> </span><span>add</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> b</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>	</span><span>var</span><span> total </span><span>=</span><span> a </span><span>+</span><span> b</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span>	</span><span>return</span><span> total</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span> </span></code></pre><p>Here we have a simple function that takes two input values, adds them together, and then returns the total. Weâ€™ll use generic names for our input arguments. You can name these pretty much whatever you want, but they will be used within our block so if your function is complex, itâ€™s good to have descriptive names. Because this is a pretty simple function we're using <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. </p><p>What we've created is a function declaration. In order to execute, or invoke our function we can call <code>add(2,50)</code>.
<code>console.log(add(2,50)) // 52</code></p><p><code>console.log</code> is itself a function. Functions can be stored in variables, objects, arrays, or even passed into other functions.</p><p>One other important thing to note about functions is how they affect variables inside them. If you define a variable within a function, the variable cannot be used outside the function. That's because javascript has a function based scope.</p><hr><p>Javascript is a really fun language to learn. If you feel comfortable with the material above you can do a lot! Most of JavaScript is just building on to these core concepts.</p><h2>Modern JavaScript</h2><p>In 2015 a set of new syntax and features were introduced that made writing JavaScript easier. Many of the following updates are meant to help you write code faster and cleaner. If you're using modern frameworks like React you'll often see them in examples.</p><h3>Const / Let</h3><p>This is just a new way to write variables. </p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> height </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>30</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>let</span><span> height </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>30</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p><code>const</code> values cannot be reassigned after the initial assignment. This is usually the default way of creating variables. </p><p><code>let</code> values can be reassigned but are scoped to conditionals, the same way all variables are scoped to functions. If you declare one inside an if/else statement it won't be available outside the statement.</p><h3>Arrow Functions</h3><p>This a shorthand for writing functions.
Instead of writing:</p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>add</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span>b</span><span>)</span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>return</span><span> a </span><span>+</span><span> b </span><span>}</span></code></pre><p>You can use an arrow function which looks like this:</p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>add</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span>b</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> a </span><span>+</span><span> b</span></code></pre><p>If your function takes a single parameter you can omit the parenthesis.</p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>getStyle</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> a</span><span>.</span><span>style</span></code></pre><h3>Template Literals</h3><p>Previously is you wanted dynamic strings, you would insert values using the following syntax.</p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> dynamicString </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"Hello my name is"</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> firstName </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>". Welcome!"</span></code></pre><p>Using template literals, you can use the backtick for strings, and <code>${}</code> to insert variables.</p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> dynamicString </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>Hello my name is </span><span>${</span><span>firstName</span><span>}</span><span>. Welcome!</span><span>`</span></code></pre><h3>Imports and Exports</h3><p>Instead of using large javascript files, you'll often want to break your code into smaller modules and export anything that other modules need to access.</p><pre><code><span>// Colors.js</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> colors </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

  <h3>automatic-differentiation-worked-examples</h3>
  
<p>– forwards and reverse</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This article demonstrates how to perform source transformations on a program to generate forward mode and reverse mode derivative programs (automatic differentiation, or “AD”). My aim is to write the shortest possible article that communicates all the essential features of a source-to-source AD system with a particular focus on making the reverse mode transformation clear.</p>
<p>The goal of brevity means that a lot of possible commentary has been omitted. If you find this makes some part of the article hard to understand then please <a href="http://web.jaguarpaw.co.uk/~tom/contact">contact me</a> and I’ll do my best to clarify. In particular this article contains hardly any mathematical content at all. I hope that the reader who is familiar with multivariate calculus will be able to obtain an intuitive understanding of how AD relates to mathematical techniques he or she is already familiar with. A more in-depth description of the relationship will have to wait for another article.</p>
<h2 id="the-program">The program</h2>
<p>Let’s consider the following pseudocode program that performs some elementary arithmetic through a sequence of assignment statements.</p>
<pre><code>p = 7 * x
r = 1 / y
q = p * x * 5
v = 2 * p * q + 3 * r</code></pre>
<p><code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are not defined in the program so I’m going to informally consider them to be “inputs”; <code>v</code> is not used anywhere so I’m going to consider it to be the “output”. (I won’t burden the article by formalising these notions here.)</p>
<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
<p>We’ll do a small amount of preparation to our original program which will preserve its behaviour and get it into a form in which it is straightforward to apply the automatic differentiation (AD) algorithms. It is possible to apply AD algorithms without doing these transformations first but then the AD algorithms would have to do equivalent operations implicitly. Doing these transformations first is a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">separation of concerns</a>.</p>
<h3 id="use-prefix-functions-with-exactly-one-argument">Use prefix functions with exactly one argument</h3>
<p>Let’s use prefix functions instead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation">infix operators</a>. Infix operators are more familiar for arithmetic but the AD algorithms will be clearer to present if we use prefix functions. Additionally I want every function to have exactly one argument (although that argument may be a tuple). Single-argument style will make the reverse mode transformation much clearer (although it does not make any difference for forward mode). For example, <code>x1 + x2</code> would become <code>add (x1, x2)</code>. Our program becomes</p>
<pre><code>p = mul (7, x)
r = div (1, y)
q = mul (mul (p, x), 5)
v = add (mul (mul (2, p), q), mul (3, r))</code></pre>
<h3 id="no-nested-subexpressions">No nested subexpressions</h3>
<p>Next let’s convert to a form where every function is applied to (tuples of) variables and constants only, i.e.&nbsp;where there are no nested sub-expressions (besides potentially nested tuples). We assign each nested sub-expression to an intermediate variable. For example</p>
<pre><code>a = add (add (b, c), d)</code></pre>
<p>would become</p>
<pre><code>i = add (b, c)
a = add (i, d)</code></pre>
<p>The choice of <code>i</code> is arbitrary; it just has to be a variable that’s not used elsewhere in our program. This form without nested subexpressions is a lot like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-normal_form">ANF</a> from the field of functional compiler construction. It’s also a lot like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form">SSA form</a> of assembly language. After removing nested subexpressions, our program becomes</p>
<pre><code>p = mul (7, x)
r = div (1, y)
i1 = mul (p, x)
q = mul (i1, 5)
i2 = mul (2, p)
i3 = mul (i2, q)
i4 = mul (3, r)
v = add (i3, i4)</code></pre>
<h2 id="differentiation-line-by-line">Differentiation line-by-line</h2>
<p>We have performed all the transformations needed to prepare our program and we are ready to proceed to differentiation. We will differentiate the program line-by-line, that is, both the forward mode and reverse mode differentiation algorithms will generate one line of derivative code for each line of input code. But what <em>is</em> the derivative of an assignment statement? For forward mode, the derivatives correspond quite closely to what you might be familiar with from a first multivariate calculus course..</p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<h4 id="addition">Addition</h4>
<p>If a line of our pseudocode program is</p>
<pre><code>y = add (x1, x2)</code></pre>
<p>then the derivative line is</p>
<pre><code>dy = add (dx1, dx2)</code></pre>
<h4 id="multiplication">Multiplication</h4>
<p>If a line of our pseudocode program is</p>
<pre><code>y = mul (x1, x2)</code></pre>
<p>then the derivative line is</p>
<pre><code>dy = add (mul (x2, dx1), mul (x1, dx2))</code></pre>
<h4 id="division">Division</h4>
<p>If a line of our pseudocode program is</p>
<pre><code>y = div (x1, x2)</code></pre>
<p>then the derivative line is</p>
<pre><code>dy = add (div (dx1, x2), negate (mul (div (x1, mul (x2, x2)), dx2)))</code></pre>
<h2 id="forward-mode">Forward mode</h2>
<p>The forward mode transformation applies the appropriate differentiation rule to each line in the input program (listed on the left) to obtain a derivative line (listed on the right). To each line we apply exactly one rule and the form of the rule does not depend on any of the other lines.</p>
<pre><code>p = mul (7, x)   | dp = mul (7, dx)
r = div (1, y)   | dr = negate (div (dy, mul (y, y)))
i1 = mul (p, x)  | di1 = add (mul (dp, x), mul (p, dx))
q = mul (i1, 5)  | dq = mul (di1, 5)
i2 = mul (2, p)  | di2 = mul (2, dp)
i3 = mul (i2, q) | di3 = add (mul (di2, q), mul (i2, dq))
i4 = mul (3, r)  | di4 = mul (3, dr)
v = add (i3, i4) | dv = add (di3, di4)</code></pre>
<p>If we form a new program consisting of the sequence of assignments on the left followed by the sequence of assignments on the right then we have a program that calculates the forward derivative! The “inputs” of this program are <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>dx</code> and <code>dy</code>. The “outputs” are <code>v</code> and <code>dv</code>.</p>
<p>(The derivatives of constants are zero and I’ve left terms that are zero out for simplicity.)</p>
<p>In fact we can be a little more clever. We can interleave the assignments, so an assignment from the left is immediately followed by its corresponding assignment from the right, that is</p>
<pre><code>p = mul (7, x)
dp = mul (7, dx)
r = div (1, y)
dr = negate (div (dy, mul (y, y)))
i1 = mul (p, x)
di1 = add (mul (dp, x), mul (p, dx))
q = mul (i1, 5)
dq = mul (di1, 5)
i2 = mul (2, p)
di2 = mul (2, dp)
i3 = mul (i2, q)
di3 = add (mul (di2, q), mul (i2, dq))
i4 = mul (3, r)
di4 = mul (3, dr)
v = add (i3, i4)
dv = add (di3, di4)</code></pre>
<p>This interleaving demonstrates an important property of the automatic derivative: that it uses space proportional to the space usage of the original program. Specifically, as soon as we no longer need a variable that was assigned in the original program we no longer need the corresponding <code>d</code> version either.</p>
<p>We can also see another important property of the forward derivative: it runs in time proportional to the run time of the original program (assuming that the derivative of every primitive runs in time proportional to the run time of the primitive itself).</p>
<h2 id="reverse-mode-requires-two-additional-ideas">Reverse mode requires two additional ideas</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve shown how to generate the forward mode derivative we can move on to the reverse mode derivative. Reverse mode requires two additional ideas:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We need to convert our original program to “explicit duplication” form: if a variable is used more than once then we make that explicit in the structure of the program. This is unusual but straightforward.</p></li>
<li><p>We need to use a form of the derivative that will be unfamiliar to most readers. It will appear quite bizarre when seeing it for the first time but it is crucial to implementing the reverse mode derivative.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="explicit-duplication-form">Explicit duplication form</h2>
<p>Before applying the reverse mode AD transformation we will convert to “explicit duplication” form. Again, the transformation is not strictly required but if we omit it then the differentiation pass will have to do it implicitly. We take the ANF form of the program and insert explicit duplications (<code>dup</code>) for any variable that is used more that once. Recall that after removing nested subexpressions our program was</p>
<pre><code>p = mul (7, x)
r = div (1, y)
i1 = mul (p, x)
q = mul (i1, 5)
i2 = mul (2, p)
i3 = mul (i2, q)
i4 = mul (3, r)
v = add (i3, i4)</code></pre>
<p>We can see that <code>x</code> and <code>p</code> appear on the right hand side (i.e.&nbsp;are consumed) twice each. Therefore, they will need explicit duplication, so that each variable in the resulting program is used only once. With explicit duplication the program looks like</p>
<pre><code>(x1, x2) = dup x
p = mul (7, x1)
(p1, p2) = dup p
r = div (1, y)
i1 = mul (p1, x2)
q = mul (i1, 5)
i2 = mul (2, p2)
i3 = mul (i2, q)
i4 = mul (3, r)
v = add (i3, i4)</code></pre>
<p>(If a variable were used <span><em>n</em></span> times then we would have to insert <span><em>n</em> − 1</span> <code>dup</code>s for it. In our example no variable is used more than twice.)</p>
<p>Notice that now not only is every variable defined exactly once, but every variable is also <em>used</em> exactly once (except the inputs and outputs, <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>v</code> – I won’t say more here about how exactly these seemingly special cases fit into the story). This property is important for a reason which will be explained when we come to generate the reverse mode program.</p>
<h2 id="differentiation-line-by-line-1">Differentiation line-by-line</h2>
<p>The line-by-line differentiation rules for generating the reverse mode need another article to explain thoroughly, but in this article I will hope to provide some basic intuition via examples and the informal notion that the reverse mode program calculates how sensitive the output is to different variables. For example, if the variable <code>y</code> appears in the original program then the variable <code>d_dy</code> will appear in the reverse mode program and measures “how sensitive the output is to small changes in <code>y</code>”. (I’ll abbreviate this to “<code>d_dy</code> is the sensitivity to <code>y</code>”.)</p>
<h3 id="examples-1">Examples</h3>
<h4 id="addition-1">Addition</h4>
<p>If a line of our pseudocode program is</p>
<pre><code>y = add (x1, x2)</code></pre>
<p>then the derivatives are</p>
<pre><code>d_dx1 = d_dy
d_dx2 = d_dy</code></pre>
<p>because the sensitivity to <code>x1</code> is the same as the sensitivity to <code>y</code> (and likewise for <code>x2</code>). This is written on a single line as</p>
<pre><code>(d_dx1, d_dx2) = dup (d_dy)</code></pre>
<h4 id="multiplication-1">Multiplication</h4>
<p>If a line of our program was</p>
<pre><code>y = mul (x1, x2)</code></pre>
<p>then the derivative line is</p>
<pre><code>(d_dx1, d_dx2) = (mul (x2, d_dy), mul (x1, d_dy))</code></pre>
<p>because the sensitivity to <code>x1</code> is <code>x2</code> times the sensitivity to <code>y</code> (and similarly for <code>x2</code>).</p>
<h4 id="duplication">Duplication</h4>
<p>If a line of our program was</p>
<pre><code>(x1, x2) = dup (x)</code></pre>
<p>then the derivative line is</p>
<pre><code>d_dx = add (d_dx1, d_dx2)</code></pre>
<p>because the sensitivity to <code>x</code> is the sensitivity to <code>x1</code> plus the sensitivity to <code>x2</code>.</p>
<h2 id="generating-reverse-mode-code">Generating reverse mode code</h2>
<p>Like forward mode before it, the reverse mode transformation applies the appropriate differentiation rule to each line in the input program (listed on the left) to obtain a …</p></div></div>

</p></figure>











<p>The Wayne YouTube Original was a Gen Z version of Bonnie and Clyde mixed with Deadpool’s rough humor. This golden egg was YouTube’s hope of breaking into the world of streaming originals. Long story short, their hopes died with the failure of this show. This failure marks a critical pivot in YouTube’s business model. They transitioned to a model that prioritizes an array of content that is not just ad-friendly, but ad optimized. Understanding this pivot helps creators align their business strategy with this new direction. To understand this new business model, we need to review YouTube’s history of growth and monetization.&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>A History of YouTube Monetization</strong></h2>







<p>Thirteen years ago, Neil Cicierega uploaded a 2-minute video called Harry Potter Puppet Pals to YouTube. Now that video has 192,913,827 views, and YouTube enthusiasts revere it as a culture-defining classic. This democratized unfiltered viral content was YouTube’s brand in the late 2000s. The exciting start-up revolutionized how people consumed digital content but lacked a robust monetization model. At the time, YouTube only approved a handful of creators for advertising through its partnership program.&nbsp;</p>







<p>YouTube changed this In <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2009-08-24/one-off-viral-videos-now-can-make-money-on-youtube">2009</a> when it updated its partnership program to include the monetization of individual videos. This move opened the door for small creators to generate revenue by making viral videos. Content like Harry Potter Puppet Pals now had a way to make money from its views.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<p>Then in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/13/2945243/youtube-partner-program-monetization">2012</a>, YouTube adjusted its partnership program again by opening monetization up to everyone. This created a new incentive structure that resulted in a production value boom. Videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yk7SLuNG5Nk">Gangnam Style</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avaSdC0QOUM">I’m on a Boat</a> replaced the Harry Potter Puppet Pals ascetic as YouTube’s new brand.&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>Hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute as of May 2019:</strong></h2>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/BJSwNSU5tIWygW07foEEPP9CbtROjW9W-M94HEcImnHgSZik8KO5ITInRxgN1UMo7HWmoCoUHWsZwsFIkgVVgZAxx_9fNbGXYnAy2FAYKHbT_G5CQu1p84ZhvhTUVtTj5eZ2V2HM" alt=""></figure>







<p>This era of YouTube was a gold rush for creators. The platform prioritized user-generated content and approved volumes for monetization without any question. This pattern changed in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/google-adverts-latest-youtube-extremist-videos-companies-pull-adverts-marks-spencer-companies-ku-klux-klan-isis-rape-apologists-a7638991.html">2017</a> when advertisers in the UK noticed their ads on extremist content like ISIS and KKK videos. This news hurt Google’s bottom line and forced YouTube to enforce stricter guidelines for ad-friendly content.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<p>Advertising wasn’t the only growth model YouTube was using, however. Their business model included an investment strategy in subscription-based streams of revenue. In 2010, they started a rental program, then in 2014, they created a subscription service for music called YouTube Red. YouTube was splitting their efforts between an SVOD (Subscription Video On Demand) and AVOD (Advertising Video On Demand) business model.&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>The Difference Between SVOD and AVOD.&nbsp;</strong></h2>







<p>An SVOD (Subscription Video On Demand) model is a video-on-demand service where users pay a flat rate each month to gain access to as much content as they wish. So with this model, content is created and funded with the primary purpose of attracting and retaining viewership. This objective saves SVOD’s time and hassle of curating and promoting ad-friendly content.&nbsp;</p>







<p>The AVOD (Advertising Video On Demand) model does not charge viewers for its content; it charges advertisers access to viewer’s data and attention. In this model, YouTube needs to attract and retain viewership while also curating and promoting ad-friendly content.&nbsp;</p>







<p>The AVOD model is more labor-intensive but less competitive. After addressing concerns over inappropriate content in 2017, YouTube also invested more in its SVOD model. They dropped their most controversial YouTuber, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/14/pewdiepies-youtube-red-series-gets-cancelled-after-vlogger-posts-anti-semitic-content/">Pewdiepie</a>, from YouTube Red and started investing in scripted shows. In <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/05/youtubes-revamped-music-subscription-service-launches-on-may-22/">2018</a> they updated their YouTube Red subscription service to YouTube Premium. So subscribers now had access to exclusive ad-free YouTube Originals like Wayne, and all of their favorite channels and music services.&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>Why YouTube Originals Failed</strong></h2>







<p>In 2016, YouTube had just over 1 billion total users, with only <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13498470/youtube-red-subscribers-video-content-music">1.5 million</a> monthly subscribers in YouTube Red. In 2018, YouTube believed that they could compete with Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon by attracting their 1 billion users to YouTube Premium. So they released the pilots of shows like Wayne on their central platform in a significant promotional effort.&nbsp;</p>







<p>The show was a massive success with the critics. It received a <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/08/step-up-wayne-canceled-youtube-pilot-dark-cargo-its-a-mans-wold-dead-seek-new-homes-scripted-programming-pullback-programming-shift-1202669457/">100% fresh rating on rotten tomatoes and 27 million people viewed the pilot.</a> Despite its success, Youtube couldn’t convince enough viewers to purchase a subscription to keep watching. Viewers had two reasons not to buy.</p>







<h2>Brand Conditioning and Opportunity Cost </h2>

<p>The first reason was that YouTube’s core brand was and still is user-generated content. It is in their name. Users are not likely to pay a subscription for content that isn’t associated with YouTube’s brand. So That subscription wasn’t a purchase of Wayne; it was an investment in future YouTube originals. This investment is hard to sell when it isn’t in the company’s brand.&nbsp;</p>







<p>YouTube conditions users to receive ads. The whole model facilitates the right ads and the right amount of ads while also retaining viewership. Since most viewers are already conditioned for this, they had minimal incentive to pay extra for zero ads.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Lastly, YouTube’s investment in scripted paywall content was an opportunity cost. YouTube’s ad-supported business generates billions of dollars in revenue a year. This cash cow couldn’t compete with the revenue from subscriptions. As a result, successful shows like Wayne were costing the company money by excluding them from the ads. &nbsp;</p>







<p>In <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/08/step-up-wayne-canceled-youtube-pilot-dark-cargo-its-a-mans-wold-dead-seek-new-homes-scripted-programming-pullback-programming-shift-1202669457/">2019</a>, YouTube publicly acknowledged that the SVOD model could no longer compete with the AVOD model. As a result, they dropped these scripted shows from the paywall and quietly stopped investing in scripted content. This decision provided more room for the two leading giants, Netflix and Amazon, to duke it out in the streaming wars. We may even see one of these streaming services purchase the rights to Originals like Wayne.&nbsp;</p>







<p>This change in strategy means that YouTube pivoted its growth model. Instead of moving into the SVOD space, they reinvested that time and money to grow their ad revenue. Most of their efforts have been in setting stricter enforcement of their ad policies and incentivizing more ad-optimized content.&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>The Difference Between Ad Friendly and Ad Optimized Content</strong></h2>







<p>Ad-friendly content is a list of topics that YouTube will not include in its monetization program. This policy extends to all parts of the content, including the video, thumbnail, metadata, description, and tags.&nbsp;</p>







<p>If the content on the platform includes any of the topics listed in the policy, it can potentially be demonetized. The only exception to this is informative or educational content.&nbsp;</p>







<p>The “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18287318/youtube-logan-paul-pewdiepie-demonetization-adpocalypse-premium-influencers-creators">adpocalypse</a>” is evidence of stricter enforcement of YouTube’s guidelines around ad-friendly content. Since the 2017 controversy, YouTube has been increasingly enforcing their policies through demonetizing creators who violate their guidelines. They have improved their algorithm’s ability to catch this kind of content, demonetize, and even suppress it. Now that their business strategy heavily invests in the AVOD model, this will only get better and stricter.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Suppressing content isn’t the only tool in their business strategy. YouTube’s algorithm can now prioritize content optimized for ads. They do this through a backdoor curation tool set by advertisers.&nbsp;</p>







<p>YouTube’s algorithm reviews every video to determine if any of these five categories apply:</p>







<ul><li>Tragedy and conflict</li><li>Sensitive social issues</li><li>Sexually suggestive content&nbsp;</li><li>Sensational and shocking</li><li>Profanity and rough language&nbsp;</li></ul>







<p>Now, advertisers can exclude any of these categories. This ability creates a tiered categorization of all content. As a result, YouTube is incentivized to prioritize high tiered content that makes more ad revenue.&nbsp;</p>







<p>This model is very different from the golden era of viral user-generated content. The algorithm isn’t just learning what viewers like; it is learning what advertisers want. This machine learning is why users see product review channels promoted right alongside music channels. The new incentive model is why videos like Harry Potter Puppet pals no longer appear on the front page of YouTube.&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>What this means for creators</strong></h2>







<p>YouTube’s prioritization has evolved from user-generated content to scripted shows to a mix of ad-optimized user and network-generated content. Creators shouldn’t see this as an obstacle. YouTube isn’t a gatekeeper; it is a business partner. Our <a href="https://look.law/how-strategic-alliances-increase-youtube-revenue-per-view/">last post </a>explains how creators could benefit from strategic business alliances with other channels. This alliance can increase YouTube revenue per view and provide leverage to smaller independent channels. The key to these alliances is in structuring a business strategy that benefits both parties. YouTubers in the partner program are already in a strategic partnership with YouTube, whether they realize it or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
