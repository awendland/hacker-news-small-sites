<p>Does your CMS leak drafts?</p>



<p>I don’t know about you but I’d be pretty concerned if I found out an unfinished work or report I was working on, was visible to the public. </p>



<p>It is a common feature of blogging platforms to let authors “export” drafts that can be shared with friends and peers to seek feedback.</p>



<p>Ideally, these would need the viewer to sign-in to the website, but not always.</p>



<p>Medium, dev.to, and other sites have similar features which let you “preview” and share draft versions of your blog posts.</p>



<p>But in the case of Hacker Noon, I came across an interesting finding.</p>



<p>Google is indexing these unpublished drafts and it is not clear why.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-09-at-9.00.26-am-1024x728.png" alt="" srcset="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-09-at-9.00.26-am-1024x728.png 1024w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-09-at-9.00.26-am-300x213.png 300w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-09-at-9.00.26-am-768x546.png 768w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-09-at-9.00.26-am.png 1502w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-srcset="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-09-at-9.00.26-am-1024x728.png 1024w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-09-at-9.00.26-am-300x213.png 300w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-09-at-9.00.26-am-768x546.png 768w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-09-at-9.00.26-am.png 1502w" data-src="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-09-at-9.00.26-am-1024x728.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption><strong>Google indexing Hacker Noon unpublished drafts</strong><br>Source: SecurityReport.com</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Moreover, unlike with Medium or dev.to, because of Hacker Noon’s predictable URL structure of drafts, anyone can simply run a search with the following string to see these:</p>



<pre>site:app.hackernoon.com/drafts/</pre>



<p>This shows various kinds of unfinished pieces which are still in progress, being edited live, were submitted, or rejected at some point. </p>

<h2>Indexed from public forums?</h2>



<p>My first hunch was, perhaps, these drafts are being indexed by Google from public forums.</p>



<p>It isn’t uncommon for Hacker Noon authors to publicly post their <em>finished</em> draft links in <a href="https://community.hackernoon.com/c/story-not-published" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forums</a>.</p>



<p>Typically authors do this to request editors to publish their drafts that have been sitting in the editorial queue for a while.</p>



<p>But in case of this particular article, for example, doing a search for its content yielded the one and only result: the unfinished draft.</p>



<figure><img src="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-04-at-8.50.55-am-1024x376.png" alt="" srcset="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-04-at-8.50.55-am-1024x376.png 1024w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-04-at-8.50.55-am-300x110.png 300w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-04-at-8.50.55-am-768x282.png 768w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-04-at-8.50.55-am-1536x564.png 1536w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-04-at-8.50.55-am.png 1650w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-srcset="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-04-at-8.50.55-am-1024x376.png 1024w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-04-at-8.50.55-am-300x110.png 300w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-04-at-8.50.55-am-768x282.png 768w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-04-at-8.50.55-am-1536x564.png 1536w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-04-at-8.50.55-am.png 1650w" data-src="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-04-at-8.50.55-am-1024x376.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>Further to my investigation, there’s no “robots.txt” file on the “app.hackernoon.com” subdomain which could potentially prevent this by simply telling search engines not to look beyond <em>“/drafts/</em>.”</p>



<p>The “robots.txt” existing on the main hackernoon.com domain doesn’t (and can’t) do much in preventing the automatic indexing.</p>

<h2>Finished pieces have ‘draft’ versions too</h2>



<p>I have also seen “draft” clones of already published, live stories too.</p>



<p>For example, this published article can be accessed at its <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-to-reset-password-with-nodejs-and-angular-part-2-6815t3z8v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live link</a> but also has its draft version available via search engines.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I was not able to overwrite any drafts. Altering the content and pressing “Save” or “Save and Publish” buttons would simply not bring about any updates—unless done by the rightful author of the story.</p>



<p>But the issue remains, why can I see unpublished drafts through Google?</p>



<p>And if the issue is with Hacker Noon, a popular “independent technology media site with 7,000+ contributing writers, 200,000+ daily readers and 8,000,000+ monthly pageviews,” how many other blogs may be impacted by flaws like these?</p>



<p>In the meantime, you may only want to put in Hacker Noon drafts what you’re okay with the world seeing.</p>



<p>Perhaps, use an offline word processor, and copy-paste your final content into Hacker Noon drafts just when you’re ready to submit. </p>



<p><strong>Disclosure note: </strong>I had reported this issue to the Hacker Noon team last week via both email and Twitter but haven’t heard back since. Given this is a low severity flaw (most drafts wouldn’t reveal anything overly sensitive) and that Google already shows up the drafts, I have disclosed this flaw here.</p>

			<h2>–ise or –ize?</h2>
			

                    <p>There is nothing like a good rant!&nbsp; It may not 
					<span lang="en-gb">improve </span>the world, and it may not 
					<span lang="en-gb">fix the issue that initiated the </span>rant, but it feels so <em>good </em>afterwards.</p>

                    <p>This rant is about the suggestion that the use of a
                    ‘z’ in words like nationalization is somehow
                    wrong, or American. It must be admitted that there are
                    words with a ‘z’ in them that are purely
                    American, like advertize, or maybe just wrong, like
                    surmize. Sometimes it is simply error — a word whose
                    spelling is not known, and whose correct spelling is not
                    sought, is arbitrarily given a ‘z’ in the
                    honest but mistaken belief it is correct. Sometimes words
                    with a z-form in American represent an older (perhaps
                    Elizabethan) form of English that made its way to the USA
                    before the language was standardized in England. More
                    likely, the American ‘z’ is one of Noah
                    Webster’s attempts to ‘standardize’ or
                    ‘improve’ American usage of English when he
                    produced his famous dictionary in 1828, in which his
                    decision to make deliberate and extensive revisions of
                    spelling was implemented — he has been described as a great
                    spelling reformer (I also had a go at reforming spelling
                    when I was at school but it wasn’t appreciated).
                    Webster evidently decided to use a ‘z’ wherever
                    he considered the pronunciation called for it. This was a 
					highly unusual example of a dictionary leading the written 
					language rather than attempting to reflect it.</p>

                    <p>This polemic is nothing to do with the Americans. If we
                    overlook the various words that the Americans deliberately
                    choose to spell differently, the majority of words that take a
                    ‘z’, or an ‘s’ that is pronounced
                    like a ‘z’, seem to fall very clearly into
                    those that must take an ‘s’ (like
                    <em>compromise</em>, where the derivation is
                    –misser), those that must take a ‘z’,
                    (like <em>prize</em>), and the rest, about which
                    controversy apparently rages (if only here).</p>

                    <p>I have been to a great deal of trouble to look into
                    this, looking not only at various text books and style manuals,
                    but also at a range of literature over the years to see
                    which spelling was preferred. I refer only to cases of the 
					third type given above where writers <span lang="en-gb">or 
					their publishers </span>have come to regard the 
					use of 's' as an acceptable alternative to the 'z' (we are 
					all agreed that misuse of the two other types would be an 
					error).</p>

                    <p>It seems to me that in books printed in England the use
                    of the ‘z’ overwhelmingly predominated until
                    the Second World War, though on a far smaller scale the
                    ‘s’ can be found used by some printing houses,
                    even in Victorian times. Textbooks set out the correctness
                    of using ‘z’, some of them setting out in
                    considerable detail the rationale for use of
                    ‘s’ or ‘z’ depending on origin.
                    After the Second World War the ‘s’ alternative
                    is more frequently offered as a possibility and some house
                    style manuals (though not Oxford’s) indicate a
                    preference for ‘s’ — not because of any
                    suggestion that ‘z’ is wrong, mark you, but
                    because ‘s’ had come to be tolerated and it avoided
                    having to remember which usage is which. Recent manuals and
                    dictionaries seem to have given up on the prescriptive use
                    of a ‘z’, though it is usually offered as an
                    alternative where correct.</p>

                    <p>It seems to me, summarizing, and using a ‘z’
                    correctly and non-Americanly, that:</p>
					

                    <p>For myself, I am very happy to keep using a
                    ‘z’ where it is appropriate, and I do try hard
                    to get it right but must admit to being inconsistent
                    sometimes. <span lang="en-gb">Using the ‘z’ form</span>, of course, invites people to pick me up on
                    it, whence I refer them to the Oxford English Dictionary
                    (the big one) and that generally ends the matter. On the 
					whole it is not a book to pick a fight with.</p>

                    <p>I suppose even after being presented with the facts
                    there will be people who will persist with the
                    ‘s’ option, and that’s up to them —
                    nothing more I can do. All I ask is that people determined
                    to use the ‘s’ do not regard those using the
                    ‘z’ as using Americanisms!!!</p>

                    <p>Many of the great publishing houses are happy with ‘
                    <em>-ize</em>’ etc endings, and large, influential
                    organizations such as London Transport invariably used the
                    ‘- <em>ize’ </em>form in posters and other public
                    communications, though their modern PC-originated material
                    leaves much to be desired.</p>

                    <p>I attach below <span lang="en-gb">(actually it is in the 
					next column) </span>various references that shed more light
                    on the matter. Note that some house style guidance which
                    has opted for the '- <em>ise</em>' form refers to
                    alleged controversy about the more correct spelling about
                    which 'the authorities differ'. House style guides
                    are not authorities of themselves, although they may rely
                    on them and refer to them. Of the ‘authorities’ I
                    have sought, they all indicate '- <em>ize</em>' as
                    etymologically correct and I have not yet found any
                    'authority' that explains how '-
                    <em>ise</em>' can be correct; if any reader knows of
                    one I'd be glad to hear of it and will be happy to
                    quote it below.</p>

                    <p>And do I feel better? Well as a matter of fact, I rather
                    think I do.</p>

                    <p><strong>-ize,</strong> the normal
                    suffix added to the stems of nouns in -ism (criticize),
                    -ization (civilize), -izer (appetize), -y (agonize), or to
                    a complete noun (canalize). Many common examples are given

                    <p>THE <em>-ize, not -ise,</em> ending
                    should be used where both spellings are in use. Generally,
                    <em>-ize</em> is a suffix applied to the stems of nouns
                    ending in <em>-ism, -ization, -izer,</em> -y, or to the
                    complete noun.</p>

                    <p><strong>Examples:</strong>
                    <br>
                    agony − agonize
                    <br>
                    civilization − civilize
                    <br>
                    appetizer − appetize
                    <br>
                    criticism − criticize
                    <br>
                    canal&nbsp;− canalize
                    <br>
                    transistor&nbsp;− transistorize</p>

                    <p>The ending -ise is correct when the
                    noun has <em>–is ­</em>as part of the stem, e.g.
                    in the syllables <em>-vis­</em> (seeing), -cis-
                    (cutting), <em>-mis-</em> (putting), and is also used for
                    those nouns which do not terminate in <em>-ism,
                    -ization,</em> etc. Exceptions are
                    aggrandize­ment/aggrandize, recognition/recognize, and
                    others noted in <em>C.O.D.</em> as `assimilated to verbs in
                    -ize'. Reference should be made to <em>C.O.D.</em> and
                    Collins, <em>Authors' and Printers'
                    Dictionary,</em> if there is any doubt. Some of the more
                    common <em>-ise</em> words <em>follow:</em></p>

August 9, 2020 | https://blog.visionappster.com/2020/08/06/overriding-virtual-functions-at-run-time/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.visionappster.com/2020/08/06/overriding-virtual-functions-at-run-time/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-orge37fcf2">
<p> The C++ standard does not specify how virtual functions should be implemented. In practice, however, compilers generate a virtual function table and place a pointer to it as the first member of a class. Multiple inheritance complicates things, but let’s not jump into that rabbit hole for now. Instead, consider the following C++ class: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>class</span> <span>A</span>
{
<span>public</span>:
  <span>virtual</span> ~<span>A</span>();
  <span>virtual</span> <span>int</span> <span>func</span>(<span>int</span>);
  <span>int</span> <span>member</span>;
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Since the structure of the virtual function table is not standardized, compilers may use different layouts. The layout used by the GCC compiler is this: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>struct</span> <span>A_vtable</span>
{
  <span>void</span>* <span>type_info</span>; <span>// </span><span>Pointer to type information</span>
  <span>void</span> (*<span>destructor</span>)(<span>A</span>*); <span>// </span><span>Function pointer</span>
  <span>int</span> (*<span>func</span>)(<span>A</span>*,<span>int</span>);    <span>// </span><span>Function pointer</span>
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Virtual function pointers are laid out in declaration order. The <code>A_vtable</code> structure reveals another C++ secret: member functions are just obfuscated versions of normal functions that get <code>this</code> as the first argument. That’s it. If you know Python, D or Nim, this won’t surprise you a bit. </p>
<p> The fact that C++ has a dedicated syntax for member functions leads to numerous problems which I’m not going to detail here. Fixes have been proposed since at least 2004, <a href="https://twitter.com/ericniebler/status/705855444049399808">to no avail</a>. The <code>std::function</code> class however had to do it the right way, so we ended up with a language that has one syntax as a language feature and another as a standard library feature. </p>
<p> OK, enough whining. Back to our original track. </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You write</span>
<span>int</span> <span>A</span>::<span>func</span>(<span>int</span> <span>param</span>)
{
  <span>return</span> param;
}

<span>// </span><span>The compiler actually generates</span>
<span>int</span> <span>A_func</span>(<span>A</span>* <span>this</span>, <span>int</span> <span>param</span>)
{
  <span>return</span> param;
}
</pre>
</div>
<p> Generated member function names are actually much more complicated due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling#C++">name mangling</a>. </p>
<p> There is one virtual table that is shared by all instances of <code>class A</code>, and the compiler will statically initialize it for you by placing the addresses of <code>A</code>‘s member functions and the generated type info into it. About like this: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>const</span> <span>A_vtable</span> <span>A_vtable_instance</span>
{
  &amp;A_type_info,  <span>// </span><span>We'll skip this now</span>
  &amp;A_destructor, <span>// </span><span>Pointer to an ordinary function</span>
  &amp;A_func        <span>// </span><span>Ditto</span>
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Now, whenever you create an instance of <code>class A</code>, you actually instantiate a structure like this: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>struct</span> <span>class_A</span>
{
  <span>A_vtable</span>* <span>vtable</span>;
  <span>int</span> <span>member</span>;
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> The compiler will initialize the <code>vtable</code> pointer for you. </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You write</span>
<span>A</span> <span>a</span>;

<span>// </span><span>What actually happens</span>
<span>class_A</span> <span>a</span>;
a.vtable = &amp;A_vtable_instance;
</pre>
</div>
<p> If you derive <code>B</code> from <code>A</code>, this is what happens (conceptually): </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You say</span>
<span>class</span> <span>B</span> : <span>public</span> <span>A</span>
{
<span>public</span>:
  <span>int</span> <span>func</span>(<span>int</span>) <span>override</span>;
  <span>virtual</span> <span>void</span> <span>func2</span>() <span>const</span>; <span>// </span><span>A new virtual function</span>
};

<span>int</span> <span>B</span>::<span>func</span>(<span>int</span>) {}

<span>void</span> <span>B</span>::<span>func2</span>() <span>const</span> {}

<span>// </span><span>The compiler generates</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>B_vtable</span>
{
  <span>void</span>* <span>type_info</span>;
  <span>void</span> (*<span>destructor</span>)(<span>B</span>*);
  <span>int</span> (*<span>func</span>)(<span>A</span>*,<span>int</span>);
  <span>void</span> (*<span>func2</span>)(<span>const</span> <span>B</span>*);
};

<span>// </span><span>Auto-generated default destructor.</span>
<span>void</span> <span>B_destructor</span>(<span>B</span>* <span>b</span>)
{
  A_destructor((<span>A</span>*)b);
}

<span>int</span> <span>B_func</span>(<span>B</span>*, <span>int</span>) {}

<span>// </span><span>Member function qualifiers are actually qualifiers</span>
<span>// </span><span>of the this pointer.</span>
<span>void</span> <span>B_func2</span>(<span>const</span> <span>B</span>*) {}

<span>// </span><span>Note that the first three members have the same</span>
<span>// </span><span>layout as A_vtable, which means we can safely access</span>
<span>// </span><span>a B_vtable pointer as an A_vtable pointer.</span>
<span>const</span> <span>B_vtable</span> <span>B_vtable_instance</span>
{
  &amp;B_type_info,
  &amp;B_destructor,
  &amp;B_func,
  &amp;B_func2
};

<span>struct</span> <span>class_B</span>
{
  <span>B_vtable</span>* <span>vtable</span>;
  <span>int</span> <span>member</span>;
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Whenever your code calls a virtual function in <code>A</code>, the compiler looks up the actual function to call through the virtual function table: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You say</span>
<span>B</span> <span>b</span>;
<span>A</span>* <span>a</span> = &amp;b;
a-&gt;func(1);

<span>// </span><span>You get</span>
<span>class_B</span> <span>b</span>;
b.vtable = &amp;B_vtable_instance;
<span>class_A</span>* <span>a</span> = &amp;b;
a-&gt;vtable-&gt;func(a, 1);
</pre>
</div>
</div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	
		
<p>In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to create a dashboard for your application’s structured logs in Kibana.</p>



<p>This is a follow-up to <a href="https://pmihaylov.com/go-structured-logs/">this article</a>, which covers how to instrument your Go application \w structured logging for use by Kibana (in this tutorial).</p>



<p>We’ll use Kibana v7.6 but any version you’re using should work. It’s just that your UI might look a bit different &amp; you’ll have to adjust.</p>



<p>Let’s jump straight in! We’ll stick to simple panels, which suite most of the use-cases you’d need.</p>



<h2>The Starting Point</h2>



<p>First, make sure you have <strong>docker</strong> and <strong>docker-compose</strong> installed.</p>



<p>For <strong>docker</strong>, follow the installation instructions for your platform <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">here</a>.<br>For <strong>docker-compose</strong>, follow the installation instructions <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">here</a>.</p>



<p>Afterwards, download this exercise’s repository on the <strong>kibana-dashboard-tutorial</strong> branch:</p>



<pre><code>git clone --branch kibana-dashboard-tutorial https://github.com/preslavmihaylov/tutorials</code></pre>



<p>What you already have is a Go application, which randomly produces logs for endpoints <strong>/payments/execute</strong>, <strong>/payments/list</strong>, <strong>/payments/authhold</strong>.</p>



<p>Starting from here, you will build a dashboard for effectively monitoring &amp; analysing incoming traffic.</p>



<p>In the following section, I will walk you through how to achieve this step by step.</p>



<h2>The Walkthrough</h2>



<h3>Boot up all containers</h3>



<p>Invoke this command to bring up all containers:</p>



<pre><code>docker-compose up</code></pre>



<p>For all following steps, make sure you never execute docker-compose down.</p>



<p>That command will not only stop all containers but delete them as well.</p>



<p>If you’re seeing some issues with booting up elasticsearch, here is a reference to some common issues &amp; how to handle them:</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/laradock/laradock/issues/1699">elasticsearch exit code 78</a><br><a href="https://github.com/10up/wp-local-docker/issues/6">elasticsearch exit code 137</a></p>



<h3>Setup your application’s baseline saved search</h3>



<p>Go to <a href="http://localhost:5601/app/kibana#/home">http://localhost:5601/app/kibana#/home</a> and open the <strong>Discover</strong> tab.</p>



<p>First, expand the tab names in the bottom-left as they are unfamiliar at first:</p>

<p>Then, find the <strong>Discover</strong> tab in the top-left:</p>

<p>Set the index pattern if you haven’t already:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/PigYRco-kctctYwF_Pm_WvojuunJ2WgexEEPr-noiquQ1AWE9DI-TGKVJQy0N8vox8bV8uOY1pvkU4oR8yLDvbzCKeqGSNDVtxgGwRGZ-ju1SqSnrinpAZvyoIwk4WmZvc0XAVfg" alt="Create index pattern"></figure>



<p>On the next step, choose <strong>@timestamp</strong> as a time filter:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/vqREV-Zx7s7Q3oT_iPwm4gnQ7lEPt31dncYn6JDymQsgOLR8xMRgt5PuO1FuMMZhy7zKH-PB-6UL_tTf71umcRAJmjudTPOsXujY4DxKiiIOztZMWSc63sUA3wAq4x9YQ77LbM7k" alt="Configure index pattern settings"></figure>



<p>Open the <strong>Discover</strong> tab again. This is what the initial view should look like:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2MMlqalb-uNDR-QrvALEq3F4uYNQsKDvMCK27JW5MuwOHTNWTKD-mGPmCxAb_73DBh7rPznvJZhBvUqcu_jw9sfcuAmvjRHVlkA87HPZfRXcBQhQcwnAo6AYXKjAmH6Qcug_BUQ6" alt="The discover tab"></figure>



<p>Currently, kibana shows all log lines from our application without any filtered fields. We can exclude all fields we don’t need:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Wb6ozBL95IghC5tObSqx09919GqDMrm6ecN0cvy4qj7i8vpp-MZv0z1qGpBFwVE9GQhI3jRKNPovPQa805muoW7CpPotC38vf7vNzb3bX_X3_F_BVra1Z_OIdXgrjBKRllrTqhv6" alt="Exclude unneeded fields" width="569" height="224"></figure>



<p>Next, select only the fields which make sense for our application.</p>



<p>Those are <strong>endpoint, method, countryISO2, userID, paymentMethod, userType, error, msg</strong>.</p>



<p>For each of them, click Add to add them to the selected fields in the visualised log:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/84_InyZ2LisDaJ9IMMeBm7z8p2A9tft4emi8HZHH4B1yUtCCrSjRqwtGXtuGk2sYxXHcZocCR-akkz5a4wK0tS_-Ti8CG3TI6crkPO_tLCutu0OIapeOlrRSHns8dLmFW0eqAJ3q" alt="Filtering the fields you need" width="366" height="532"></figure>



<p>In the end, this is what your <strong>Selected fields</strong> should be:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/L78RkT2keQToPjkGI7qvtsyjD_i8-iHeSnh-UuBr2BsGkHcj3eL_SlHONYS_w5sCLsZjYwDrVSH6MbdlWkwHcahyHwPb0Tgldn6vb4hShrZNynhdqdMv4Gb5Fc68TX5yeC35hzCU" alt="The final selected fields" width="318" height="312"></figure>



<p>If you did these steps properly, this is an example of what your logs should look like:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/qOgyrN0CfQqK1RCXsidLgywYZsE3NC2SaH-B0Zv0OG_KuuuOKkG1Sbpi5xxM0-Ds1NN0rc0uxos56RY30PR61VZeKAKu29ON2Dj80o93oeTuvOZyrE4jj-GpuNvgcvlh8xUvZILH" alt="Discover tab after filtering"></figure>



<p>We will use this saved search as a baseline view for our dashboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Click <strong>Save</strong> at the top-left to later reuse this view for our dashboard:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/gfsRAEnWZKcq2yW2xCVd2cd5ynVcTkvQM4xlwYfr-mGRvvrnv0cuHp8eOQcT6uE7C2-XuFIl0ZqHjvQGQvyc-qRDXJCOmhYuBI-Go9SYB8YRwofUigOjJOMMmLn6ei0qMWvgbF8M" alt="Saving your current view" width="448" height="271"></figure>



<p>This is one of the most useful views as it allows one to inspect the details of the events which happen in your application.</p>



<h3>Setting up your initial Kibana dashboard</h3>



<p>Open the <strong>Dashboard</strong> tab to create your first dashboard:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CZhCxyjk6NLXRnHFoZwUatYfdZ4BYYB3JF1PY_Ws9rSC0SlwavrsgTn8wbCv-t0Xs6LsPLJ_2YR9VHKC2k0HYPKHSv26KggKOzoYvXXwlJfM3zNmSuT0qsG_fbfzt2CTYvUI6DUa" alt="Your initial Kibana dashboard" width="343" height="318"></figure>



<p>Follow the instructions on-screen:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/UBxo4umfb5ZQJLrh-GeZOL37qVpfkjFbiWNs6dvd5a9pe8FxMghcxA7unUP0AB5VX7sI3OGfrLQyUpx2FoMp-24qmG6ftoQC6hUL71pmRReZy35z-g2-R1jpRqwZwk5awJX_A9wO" alt="Creating your first dashboard message"></figure>



<p>After this, you should see an empty dashboard which doesn’t show anything:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/nrNvqCZXWJaJd194VFJ31wIDFnlWbAl6-vUn04IJYorUrWhkwwB22l01J_o-WxSEGvS6cTxkvikTp3kHWG3-9GGjNS2u3A5PRfRwwAwrcKrysm1rsjmfOxoDbgEnAGwjOGCf_RBC" alt="Initial view of the empty Kibana dashboard"></figure>



<p>Click the <strong>Add</strong> button at the top-left to add a new visualisation:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2ITOX0ufcf7k4oxMFWsrbzX6znK1WKMbVICT_ND_mrUJE8Na4qTy0QoBGoTG9zQKxiVMrnSKvWyVV76NrL4ufXVt1bd01EUvg9-Q44QJHCkpcWn3q72cchXoBoL1xzLh5DYJfdy6" alt="Add a new element" width="457" height="189"></figure>



<p>You should see the name of the <strong>saved search</strong> you created in the previous step. Choose that:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/QRkAc6vPzbv6EVPqQKRr3O8QqlRNZyomKTV5lXkDQ4LSVkRAbkHimleDp9cuA6JyXqfKnFJoriZ_sbatRFn9Bk35rxuXUQzKpEY_E_v6LPKGJB4MALQfDeazZwV36DnzbET0_jXe" alt="Select a panel to add to"></figure>



<p>Next, resize it as you see fit and you should see the first panel in your dashboard:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/V0KPt4qbJEEqw00wz34Q3Vy74-a6k8Hz-CsjFJHHw9STU_YvQ7ALpS8q3lXrq1xqtrlmR3uw7XQzbShAtBcDn24SX_8W8GhU-c2_EjqWvVxcDDOUj8F6OoRaWlhCpK2LOGW8q7Ut" alt="Adding the saved search"></figure>



<p>This view is great for inspecting the details of all requests &amp; using it for additional filtering on a given property.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, we will need to add some more visualisations to be able to see aggregations of the data in our dashboard.</p>



<p>Save your new dashboard with a descriptive name and proceed to the next section:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Ro1XT4eK8OpXt04bx9p-iW-bGnY40exiPHMuv43rMEbqEiAJOjjoTrAnINrYGZ7MqPhoJnQ5RSKVhbXjUPCd5ArAK4WounbDc2EvxYVpiV-NMR7WctmZxqXX-9UVeKVX_Zl2EwoX" alt="Saving the Kibana dashboard" width="572" height="292"></figure>



<h3>Add a data table to monitor requests per endpoint</h3>



<p>In this step, we will create a <strong>data table</strong> which will show how many requests we get per endpoint.</p>



<p>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button at the top-left to edit the contents of the dashboard and select <strong>Add</strong> to create a new view.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the panel which pops up, create a new visualisation from the bottom-left:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/6Lm9lMxk027D2vlNr6EKco_7-YuU0trRDF4n36_RT-gzutB-JhJJmsSCO5bEe2hbL6yMq-VXnXNAwEmCQdl_dnmB4d-D4f8XMempHG3VBN3iI0w3rnnMEXo3wjf1_pbJlsjJwkG7" alt="Create a new visualization" width="232" height="169"></figure>



<p>Next, create a new data table:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/VU5aqUm8NHSNtjEauRaYk2fQuRQJufcTxDCt4ncttf3bLUTI1fixrr4vpleagwKLDnaN3rAmJAvVzohiBuCFqjsj7lhxBBcLbnfpjJdinBXlMFtCenCUwau1J9k6P63oNQHCsAv-" alt="Picking a visualization template"></figure>



<p>On the next screen, select your <strong>saved search</strong>’s name as the data source to use.</p>



<p>Afterwards, you should see a screen which simply shows the total count of requests in a table. This is because the table currently aggregates all requests &amp; shows the total count for them.</p>



<p>We will aggregate the data in the table by the <strong>endpoint</strong> keys. This will show the count of each request per endpoint.</p>



<p>To do this, add a new <strong>Bucket </strong>which splits rows:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Ea3DRqBlyXrF2T8AxMcpwZfaS4RHm1YjLN6FZblmzYYh33mjHtvuxFdAmv5GNvNsPvYUAN8iPwv_Gqg2YoHNsmBHJZN8IBqfs-S7eHKunWLhdD1cYUnu9ZNhyi64x-PVrsPAPCrq" alt="Split rows setting" width="305" height="213"></figure>



<p>As an aggregation, use <strong>Terms</strong>. This is a simple aggregation which simply groups the data by the unique values for the key we’ll choose:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OnjB7XL7F0DUbIpV5c4RseX8j8VTEpyLujiFsh8QZsB4DNJDesrRxmYn4FHRm5OSBhT86ninZhPu5F1AFaSPi9C7_xi_FqWQiu2rNHy3gJiDGYbLWD3mnZdphPLYCveI7lJ1j8kq" alt="Aggregating by Terms" width="315" height="335"></figure>



<p>Aggregate by the endpoint key and use the following configuration:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/vLSF0mZnVoe6r8I9YJ7AJkvmHNagHCFnfmKPPj3DcrvyAUaiF91CuH9XnHErDDK1UfhcDGEg4k0HR6uE2Z6O5p_bq5uhCFmzrC8xpD7hEpC7-nKi46YViQOebtU1sZxmsDF1znRN" alt="The aggregation settings" width="315" height="501"></figure>



<p>The Group other values in separate bucket will display all data which is too little and doesn’t fit in the table (the limit is 5 rows, which we specify) in a general <strong>“Other”</strong> bucket.</p>



<p>For example, if we had 7 different endpoint and five of them get 80% of the traffic, the 20% other values will be aggregated in a row called <strong>“Other”</strong>.</p>



<p>Now, click the Play button at the top of the window to see how your table looks. You should see the count of requests per endpoint:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/CAJmDkpnhc23grSBSFU9A7aGT0IQPt99JbO7nHxUwFoOdw85b216h4LZaJ7kPHathqxXzsow4wdV1WRfd-_cXOSi96rg0UHI6aVX_jqp0HLUMHtRX3c7R3lnRaFT5xtPQIA_Qjbw" alt="Initial view after aggregation"></figure>



<p>This view now looks quite useful. With it, we can track how much traffic we get per endpoint. Click the <strong>Save</strong> button at the top-left, give the new view a title (e.g. <strong>Calls by Endpoints</strong>) and rearrange your dashboard to look aesthetically pleasing:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/bM48fmgIUWuWRSDnCtfODM_C-dWyU759Fn_0X8IJ5d6IBili-hwx_5ir0UMP1SDY33opCN9y2UiMLzpN6ZWv-LoiAijEG-MsWcJNI77py6Al5r_Nq_n3RqZN4Ov0i7nuovbk0HZo" alt="Adding the new visualization"></figure>



<p>Let’s now do the same for the rest of our significant fields.</p>



<h3>Add a data table for all significant fields</h3>



<p>In this step, add a new table, following the same steps as the previous one, for <strong>method, countryISO2, userType </strong>and<strong> paymentMethod</strong>.</p>



<p>There is no need to include a view for <strong>userID</strong> as the granularity of that field is typically way too big to make a sensible dashboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, you can usually take that by making custom filters on some of the log lines in the saved search view.</p>



<p>After you go through this, here is what the dashboard should look like:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/0xWb_4KToEpnubYP_HCUZt_xA4SauxjOey0o5Rm5pIbp3M2_1JF62WOnYTAxcHpvMj0hskIho8t0Z309wC_Zn4Phw0iLqOCNXeFlLSAfns0yWmcamVFj07ae_l66eATgR16JPYj6" alt="Adding all data tables"></figure>



<p>Now, you can see aggregations for all significant data points you are interested in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you want to further inspect e.g. what payment methods one uses when calling the <strong>/payments/execute</strong> endpoint, you can “zoom in” on the data by filtering for that data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Try it out and explore for yourself:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EiwZazuFfHFDja9xHOlHFA4g6tq9QOmS-VasvNBFa8dAPKssp_HkoFRFrjxSlComlia2_hu27UjDJ-XKyU-exdy_2hHDBbQXIUYKwKQoCz3kOxrS_MTmdAUM9MuOg8jB8om43FNw" alt="Filtering by a given field"></figure>



<p>Here is a challenge for you, zoom in on the <strong>errors</strong> and identify which is the endpoint which has the most errors.</p>



<p>The scope of this exercise is creating the dashboard, but don’t worry. You will get to play with it in the following exercise.</p>



<p>Our dashboard already looks quite informative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there is one final touch it needs.</p>



<h3>Add a histogram for tracking success/error rate</h3>



<p>In this step, we will diverge from the good old data table and add a histogram to track the <strong>success-to-error</strong> ratio over time.</p>



<p>The rest of the views in the dashboard are typically used to find the root cause of an issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The view we’ll create now will enable us to quickly identify if there is an issue.</p>



<p>Create a new visualisation, but this time, select a <strong>Vertical Bar</strong>:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_8J7Rde6OK8aEqNkJqMjBBXQVv-usxg0Rw0WNvsL6s9MNq6z88SCs6JHGAARGnpDHTu94UUbnjpFYpJY7yb2DqS1FU_Fzo8ABWsICbRHwUaRDmF7xhAK6dMr3WxVwSKhCCQs3kuf" alt="Adding a histogram" width="614" height="482"></figure>



<p>In the beginning, you will simply see a single bar with the total count of requests in the given time period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For starters, add an X-Axis which will create time intervals for each of the lines in the histogram. This will allow us to see the tendency of events over time.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/B19Ck1BBahMGnlJ3YHe_5tcJjdhP_KcPv7rzgW_qplBVJtX8dfD-eXiTLk439QLpBCi9tbR8Oa5E0G0x9tZh5WH0zDWn81MTWSmCda860aTJ_GY4UQqV4d8MyCYdX7ymIO5GkQ3M" alt="Choosing the X-Axis"></figure>



<p>This time, the selected aggregation is Date histogram on the @timestamp field:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/TBUXiBsUAO0SZI2ivGataKkLHj_Q8l_oq2EOwgQ6S8QDAzwjszmlfqreRHYnpAwegSr1EU_5mbWaIX-1n8Eo80Qf5ryyvK3lyIwPNNFYTQEv-Fy6sCA4kSHatLicO8VJVm58MNje" alt="X-Axis settings" width="316" height="521"></figure>



<p>Click the <strong>Play</strong> button and see how the view changes to reflect the count of events over time:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qExMoMPhtNFolD4fVbY4t764bHmJiIEmcZp8GWwejRAzAua41mzIKSXmqz-jfs1nHvtTcy6nim-Tar4PCNEIEh-pU8DF1Tdbwj9jBeJ8VWWnLCzuEeD9iVG7yqIGwV2KiB6fSU8c" alt="Initial histogram"></figure>



<p>This is cool, but it would be useful if we could actually see how many of those requests are success and how many are errors.</p>



<p>To do this, let’s customize the existing Y-Axis to only aggregate successful requests.</p>



<p>First, change the Y-Axis aggregation from Count to <strong>Sum bucket</strong>.</p>



<p>Then, use <strong>Filters</strong> as the <strong>Bucket</strong> aggregation. This will allow us to use KQL (Kibana Query Language) to make any custom filter we like.</p>



<p>Add a filter which says select all messages which are not empty strings:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/AuHwKgmQA_Wzo56ryHueplQGmutENBR-TX4mF9Xo4xxXaKNE4nrVwSg_LxpR2s9y1LfqVmk40VgWaY0W5zhmvRybutXl4IjyEXcHS8G7lAPw9wnjjS3tdli9P3rH_0n_lKhdoBCW" alt="Setting up the Y-Axis" width="302" height="397"></figure>



<p>Next, add a custom label <strong>“Success”</strong> for this Y-Axis at the bottom of the panel.</p>



<p>Click the Play button to see the results. You should now see the number of successful requests every 30s. The default color, however, is a bit off, so change it at the top-right to green:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/S6bwh01v6y1l4dH7l_lmm80jUmNBkuwvt6jp7LzjeoDhJW0aZmoQoRqo1uKobvJgoUHY8Y6nwaY7dxKeXXj7Dq6rHMr6wk5mdKGgp6Xp095AhJpUCxugGBGvYLPX1pMcG_CvEKIY" alt="Choosing a histogram color" width="360" height="251"></figure>



<p>Now, it looks a lot better:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/y7CDOe4YE3xHDwRqIZIa7X7LZ-zIVanmC4Lva1kOdRVtwMtTeVYqQH4mVxFFr57agI-I7XMUfUS551BX0RZNwqNqwBo79-pW4XOBqL2kzxaz2cA8HMgkWWNnrQIjOSYuHQkWTVRs" alt="Result after changing color"></figure>



<p>We aren’t done yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s now time to stack the <strong>errors</strong> on this Y-Axis as well.</p>



<p>Collapse the current Y-Axis settings and add a new one:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/r51mHHvUWrY1v-9hVHInp8LDH_eotdD_QTuAxxjdBj_I6fQOgnhaxzS3EWev3T7un2R58KCm2l__AuaJy8lyHyZ5531N0LhpXi7Z9QCwoNJJWy70CBlM5x3tvjr5AmdUhg4DQQur" alt="Adding the Y-Axis metric" width="314" height="314"></figure>



<p>The setup for this Y-Axis is simpler.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Choose <strong>Sum bucket</strong> as an aggregation again and <strong>Terms</strong> as an aggregation for the bucket. Choose <strong>errors.keyword</strong> as the field to use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keep the rest of the settings as-is.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YR8U2O3MnC_7OuoKsouugdvgKOFX0t89bJqPQ64_aKyYowMK-jfJrQ1ZWEyZrgXFW9v2js-Y4sYBUKEjIHBce888TZL0irSgoIxeBr83VQkttxTVL9GLheRrsCM4wh-M6K6J-AX9" alt="Y-Axis metric setup" width="324" height="395"></figure>



<p>Add a custom label <strong>“Errors”</strong>, change the color to red and here’s what you get:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/0veByMCfwOGbMoc8g3KQ4eAUrb7qF63y5Wycud1lJ3WpWosPVqGmcbRdyr3GGEBa0wF61O2mvpW5SQFx1vRZE4y1xpcJ-Gu87AHVpDNsS_QdgJyfE-HSBUHLzK5VSSY9BvNv7UAL" alt="Success to error ratio"></figure>



<p>This is the success-to-error ratio, aggregated per 30s.</p>



<p>This view will now enable you to see the % of errors for all endpoints with a single glance.</p>



<p>You could also zoom in on the data again and see the % of errors per endpoint/payment method/userType/etc.</p>



<p>Save this view, add it to your dashboard, arrange it nicely at the top and gaze at your beautiful application dashboard:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ul1DY26Rc2lzZMT6um6-fKpJPiHj-8oJZ1zNSKFgh-6ry4qZgF3Q-rB1vOsb-BafHVsqXlo1n8BW-YgX6nPROxejdllPnai3cskLu_XNPpOsaMHUWI5idFsuBKw7EzTU8xUAx_vX" alt="Final dashboard"></figure>



<h2>Finale</h2>



<p>Congratulations. 👏👏👏</p>



<p>You’ve successfully completed the tutorial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You should now have a decent practice using Kibana to create basic dashboards for your application.</p>



<p>The final step of this exercise is to add such a dashboard for your real production application, buy a 146-inch monitor, attach it to the wall in your office, open your app’s dashboard, enter full-screen and enable <strong>Auto-refresh</strong>.</p>



<p>After you do this, all your colleagues from the other teams will stare at it enviously.</p>

But the thing is, the more spectacular knowledge graphs are, the more difficult they are to build. You actually need more than one way of building a feature like this: think of triples, relationships, integrating with other data sources and so on. </p><p>In this article I'm going to talk about a small subset of knowledge graph relationships: <em>type-of relationships </em>or <em>is-a relationships</em>, meaning we will try to build a small knowledge graph using Python, SpaCy and NLTK. The knowledge graph will tell us if a certain object is a subclass (a type) of another object. </p><blockquote><em>Interested in more?

For this we need to use various NLP tasks like:</p><ul><li><a href="https://programmerbackpack.com/machine-learning-project-series-building-a-personal-knowledge-management-system-part-1-named-entity-recognition/">Named Entity Recognition</a>: the task of understanding where and how entities such as people, organisations, events and so on are mentioned in a text</li><li>Named Entity Linking: understand how 2 or more entities are related to each other</li><li><a href="https://programmerbackpack.com/machine-learning-project-series-part-2-python-keywords-extraction/">Keywords extraction</a>: Extracting the most relevant words from a text. This can be done using <a href="https://programmerbackpack.com/automated-python-keywords-extraction-textrank-vs-rake/">multiple algorithms</a></li><li>Relations extraction using triples</li><li>Knowledge Graphs</li></ul><p>A knowledge graph is a particular representation of data and data relationships which is used to model which entities and concepts are present in a text corpus and how these entities relate to each other. </p><p>The concept of Knowledge Graphs borrows from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">Graph Theory</a>. In this particular representation we store data as:</p><figure><img src="https://programmerbackpack.com/content/images/2020/08/Python-Knowledge-Graphs---Knowledge-Graph-example.png" alt="Python Knowledge Graph - Knowledge Graph Relationship"><figcaption>Knowledge Graph relationship</figcaption></figure><p>Entity 1 and Entity 2 are called nodes and the Relationship is called an edge. Of course, in a real world knowledge graph there are lots of entities and relationships and there is more than one way to arrive at one entity starting from another. </p><p>Usually these type of graphs are modeled with <strong>triples</strong>, which are sets of three items like (subject, verb, object), with the verb being the relationship between the subject and the object - for example (London, is_capital, England).</p><p>In this article we are focusing on only one particular type of relationship, the "is-a" relationship. If we replace this in the image above we read it as "Entity 1 is a type of Entity 2", meaning Entity 2 is the broader type and Entity 1 is the narrower type - for example (Londin, is_a, City).</p><p>Knowledge Graphs have broad applications, out of which some have not even been succesfully built yet. If you need to better understand your data and the relationships between your data points, a knowledge graph is the way to go. But there are some particulary famous examples of uses of knowledge graphs used in real world use cases:</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph">Google Knowledge Graph</a> is particulary because they have made this term so popular in the latest years. They use knowledge graphs to enhance search results using some additional information that has been gathered from lots of sources on the internet. They also use it for the Instant Answers feature, where you get an info box answering a question you put in the Google search bar (try for example "Who is the godfather of Harry Potter?"</li><li><a href="https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/interest-taxonomy-a-knowledge-graph-management-system-for-content-understanding-at-pinterest-a6ae75c203fd">Pinterest is using knowledge graphs</a> to model interests of users on the platform. The Pinterest engineering blog is one of my favourites, feel free to read some of their posts.</li><li>Youtube is also using Knowledge Graph to understand what's behind a video and to recommend the videos to users (thus helping them solve the cold-start problem of their collaborative filtering algorithm).</li></ul><p>So we said we are going to use Python and SpaCy to build a knowledge graph containing "is-a" relationships. But before that (and I promise this is the last introductory section) we need to look into some theoretical aspects. </p><p>In more fancy linguistics terms, "is-a" relationships are named <strong>Hypernymy</strong> and <strong>Hyponymy </strong>relationships. So for example, if we say "Harry Potter is a book character", then "Harry Potter" is the hyponym (the narrow entity) of the relationship, while "book character" is the hypernym (the broad entity) of the relationship. </p><p>And because we are using only plain text to extract such information, we need to look at the structure of the sentences, take a look at what Part Of Speech each word represents and try to figure out relationships from there. That's why we say that we are analyzing <strong>semantic relationships</strong>.</p><p>Now, there are many techniques we can use to extract relationships from text: supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised techniques are rule-based techniques. And in this article we are going to take advantage of the fact that English is a well-structured language, so we can go with the rule-based techniques.</p><p>There has been a lot of research in this area but a popular piece of research is done by Marti Hearst [1] the results from this research are popularly known as the Hearst Patterns. She has identified a few patterns that can be used in English to extract hypernyms and hyponyms. In the following table hyponyms are represented by <em>h </em>and hypernyms by <em>H</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://programmerbackpack.com/content/images/2020/08/Python-Knowledge-Graph---Hearst-Patterns.png" alt="Python Knowledge Graph - Hearst Patterns"><figcaption>Hearst Patterns</figcaption></figure><p>We are going to use these patterns to try and figure out is-a relationships from plain text extracted from Wikipedia. It's now time to switch to the real action.</p><p>We are going to extract the text from 4 Wikipedia articles about 2 different subjects: London, Paris, WWI and WWII. We are going to use the Hearst Patterns to extract relationships from these 4 articles and add them to a graph. Then are going to display the graph and analyze of results. First let's install some dependencies.</p><pre><code>pip3 install spacy
pip3 install wikipedia
pip3 install nltk
pip3 install networkx
pip3 install matplotlib</code></pre><p>SpaCy is used for text processing, wikipedia is used for extracting the data. We are using NLTK just for a visualization of the relationships between words in a sentence. Networkx is used for building the graph and matplotlib is used for visualization.</p><p>Another command you should run in your terminal (especially if it's the first time you are using spaCy or if you are using a virtual environment is</p><pre><code>python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm</code></pre><p>This is used to download the spaCy pre-trained model for English that we are going to use in this project. This the the small model and another, larger one is available (en_core_web_lg) but that is not necessary for this project.</p><p>Let's take a quick peek at our project file structure.</p><figure><img src="https://programmerbackpack.com/content/images/2020/08/Python-Knowledge-Graph---Project-file-structure.png" alt="Python Knowledge Graph - Project file structure"><figcaption>Project file structure</figcaption></figure><p>There are quite a lot of file, but we are going to go through each other one by one and I'll provide simple explanations.</p><p>First let's get this out of our way: the <em>utils.py</em> file contains a small utility function that I've added to visualize the structure of a sentence. It uses the NLTK Tree and it is inspired by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/39104235">this StackOverflow answer</a>.</p><pre><code>from nltk import Tree

def buildTree(token):
    if token.n_lefts + token.n_rights &gt; 0:
        return Tree(token, [buildTree(child) for child in token.children])
    else:
        return buildTree(token)</code></pre><p>We are going to store relations in a <em>Relation </em>object and the code for this class is self-explanatory and located in <em>relation.py</em>.</p><pre><code>class Relation:

    __hypernym: str
    __hyponym: str

    def __init__(self, hypernym, hyponym):
        self.__hypernym = hypernym
        self.__hyponym = hyponym

    def getHypernym(self):
        return self.__hypernym

    def getHyponym(self):
        return self.__hyponym

</code></pre><p>I've also written another class to store all relations. The class is stored in <em>relation_provider.py</em> and, again, it is fairly simple.</p><pre><code>from relation import Relation

class RelationProvider:

    __relations: [Relation]

    def __init__(self, relations=[Relation]):
        self.__relations = relations

    def getRelations(self):
        return self.__relations
</code></pre><p>The first step is to extract the text from Wikipedia. We are using the <em>wikipedia </em>package to get that, and this functionality is found in <em>text_extractor.py</em>. We are first downloading the data and storing it in a local file. To get the text, we are reading that file and returing the entire text.</p><pre><code>import wikipedia


class TextExtractor:

    __pageTitle: str
    __pageId: str

    def __init__(self, pageTitle, pageId):
        self.__pageTitle = pageTitle
        self.__pageId = pageId

    def extract(self):
        page = wikipedia.page(title=self.__pageTitle, pageid=self.__pageId)
        f = open("./text/" + self.__pageTitle + …</code></pre></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>I am sure you have heard about <strong> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://discord.com/new">Discord</a></strong>, a real-time chatting tool that started as a <strong><em>Slack for Gamers</em></strong>. </p>
<p>Today, Discord is used as a community for designers, developers, artists, business managers, friends hangout zones, and more. It has become a reliable and welcoming place, no matter your interest or background. Features like video calling, audio calling and broadcasting make it a powerhouse. Surprisingly, these features work better in Discord than Slack and Microsoft Teams from my experience. </p>
<p>Here's an interesting video by Discord that shares its future goals and vision:</p>

<p>I am glad that at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hashnode.com/">Hashnode</a>, we switched from Slack to Discord for our team discussions and collaborations. It's been two years now, and we are thrilled with the experience so far. Recently, we opened up our Discord server for anyone to join and get help directly from the Hashnode team and community. We have exclusive channels for support, writing help, blog introductions, Hashnode challenges and more. More than 800 developers have joined us in just a few weeks. </p>

		<p><span>Have you ever wondered how attackers gain high-level access to a computer system and how they manage to steal personal and financial data, install additional malware, and hijack devices?</span></p>
<p><span>Well, often this happens with the help of a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_(computing)"><span>backdoor</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>In simple terms, to carry out such an attack, the attacker must inject the malware on your system and then open a communication channel that allows him to send commands and control the host remotely.</span></p>

<p><span>A hacker performing this attack manages to gain access similar to that of the application he attacked. If your application runs in </span><b>sudo</b><span> mode, then the attacker will gain superuser access (root-access).</span></p>

<p><span>Therefore, it is usually safe to run the application in a closed environment and give them as little access as possible.</span></p>

<p><span>Let’s see how this problem relates to NodeJS.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’ve chosen this language because it is one of the most widely used in web development and software development in general.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Even though it is still debatable, it is almost safe to say that JavaScript, due to its vast ecosystem, has become the language we refer to as </span><i><span>One language to rule them all</span></i><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>Nowadays,</span><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/"> <span>npm</span></a><span> which is, as I suppose everyone knows, the package manager for the JavaScript programming language, has reached over 1M public packages. According to</span><a href="https://jaxenter.com/npm-trivia-144846.html"> <span>this trivia</span></a><span>, it has approximately 8TB in size.</span></p>

<p><span>These conditions, plus some key problems related to the</span><a href="https://medium.com/@imior/10-things-i-regret-about-node-js-ryan-dahl-2ba71ff6b4dc"> <span>implicit issues that NodeJS has</span></a><span>, make this ecosystem the perfect choice for attackers.</span></p>

		<h2><b>How to code your own backdoor?</b></h2>

<p><span>The best way to understand this security issue is by creating your own backdoor in a system.</span></p>

<p><span>What we want to achieve is the ability to execute arbitrary commands on a foreign computer system.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>In the end, the entire hack will look like this:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>On the left is the hacker’s server, which acts as a receiver for the output of the commands.</span></li>
<li><span>On the right is the victim server.</span></li>
<li><span>In the middle is where the attack takes place.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>If things are clear, let’s build our own simple backdoor in a NodeJS application.</span></p>

<p><span>Because we don’t have a big legacy code to hide our vulnerability in, we’ll go with the second case and we’ll pretend that we have a popular npm package for logging messages.</span></p>

<p><span>The victim’s application is a simple express based web app that uses our package.</span></p>


<p><span>To get what we set out to do, we need to bind our backdoor to the request object. In this way, we can intercept all the incoming requests with our malware. Even just like this and we already have great leverage and we can find out all the user credential or all the secret tokens when they authenticate against an application which uses our package.</span></p>

<p><span>To bind to the request object, our backdoor needs to be part of a middleware. Therefore I’ve created an npm package called </span><b>logger </b><span>whose purpose is to prettyprint all the incoming requests.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>This way, everyone who will use our module will have to connect it to the server as a middleware.</span></p>



<p><span>This line of code will trigger our backdoor.</span></p>

<p><span>Now by default, these are the parameters:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>req – request is the incoming request to the server</span></li>
<li><span>res – is the response, but this is not interset for us</span></li>
<li><span>next – will call the next middleware in the chain (aka callback)</span></li>
</ul>


<p><b>console.log() –</b><span> is used as a decoy, because we said our package is used to prettyprint incoming requests, so it has to do something to look legit.</span></p>

<p><span>The workflow is the following: we send a request to the victim’s web server with a command and our backdoor will execute that command on the victim’s system.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>To do so, we’ll make use of the </span><b>exec </b><span>method from </span><b>child_process </b><span>which is a default module in NodeJS.</span></p>



<p><span>We’ll send the command we want to run on the foreign host as a query parameter along with a password. This way we protect our backdoor from other hackers and we’ll inform the script to omit this request and don’t print it. The developer will never see this attack coming.</span></p>

<p><span>To exploit this, we can send a get request formatted like this:</span></p>

<p><span>https://victim-url?pwd=secret-pwd&amp;cmd=ls</span></p>

<p><span>In this way, our password will be validated and the </span><b>ls </b><span>(list files) command will be executed against the host.</span></p>

<p><span>All we need to do now is to somehow capture the output of the command. There is </span><b>almost </b><span>no point to run a command without seeing the output of it.</span></p>

<p><span>To see the result of our hack, we’ll make a request to one of our personal servers with the output of the command.</span></p>

<p><span>Our personal server, which acts as a receiver, will have the following code:</span></p>



<p><span>And to complete our backdoor, we’ll send the output of the commands in the body of a POST request to our server:</span></p>



<p><span>There is one last problem: how do we know the address of a victim? To create an attack, we need to know the web address of the victim.</span></p>

<p><span>To do so, we add one more handler in our receiver:</span></p>



<p><span>Now in our backdoor, we send a request when a new application uses our library.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>To do so, complete the previous code with the following snippet:</span></p>




<p><span>This way, each time a foreign application uses your npm package and someone accesses that application for the first time, a request will be sent to our receiver which informs us about the URL of the target.</span></p>

<h2><b>How to protect yourself?</b></h2>

<p><span>You might be asking yourself, if it is so easy to do it, then why don’t we hear more about this type of attack?</span></p>

<p><span>As I said before, the hard part is to hide or in this case to inject the vulnerability. Most of the time, these packages are scanned for vulnerabilities using third-party applications or are manually verified.</span></p>
<p><span>To protect yourself against this type of attacks, try to do your best in the following aspects:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>encapsulate your code and give it as little access to the system as you can,</span></li>
<li><span>use well-known and maintained open source components,</span></li>
<li><span>use a good monitoring tool (preferably your own) to keep track of all the request are made to your server.</span></li>
</ul>

In this article, we will see how to open a webcam in chrome and how to capture the image and download it.</p><p>

So let's start,<br>
We will be using <b>Navigator.mediaDevices</b> which provides access to connected media input<br>
devices like cameras and microphones, as well as screen sharing.<br>
The <b>Navigator object</b> contains information about the browser.<br>
There is no public standard that applies to the navigator object, but all major browsers support it.</p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; clear.disabled = true;</p><p>
&nbsp; 
}</p><p>

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', init)</p></code>
<br>
So here, firstly init function is called as we have set an event listener for the 'DOMContentLoaded' event. Which check if browser support mediaDevices or not also we had store required element references.</p><p>

The <b>onCapture</b> method will ask permission for the camera to the user<br>
and once permission is given by the user will set stream to video elements in HTML.</p><p>

In <b>onScreenshot</b> method we have use canvas.toDataURL() which returns a data URI containing a representation of the image in the format specified by the type parameter (defaults to PNG).<br>
The returned image is in a resolution of 96 dpi. So this method sets the captured image to UI.</p><p>

In <b>onDownload</b> method we are just doing the download part as we are already storing data URL in <b>onScreenshot</b> method.</p><p>

That's it no external dependency required.</p><p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>For a long time, business software was clunky. Consumer software continued to radically innovate on user experience, staying ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>Palm to iPhone. Styluses to capacitive touch. Taxis to Ubers. Torrents to Netflix. MP3s to Spotify, etc. We’ve lived through this story of how innovation in consumer software radically improved our lives in the last decade.</p>
<p>At one point, business software had no choice but to stop being clunky and terrible to use, because nobody wanted to walk into work to use shitty software. And as teams got more power to pick the software they wanted, business software had no choice but to be simple enough for anyone to try and buy.</p>
<p>If a business application wasn’t easy to use, people just abandoned it and start trialing something else.&nbsp;Apps that had the best user experience started winning more often at work than the ones that didn’t.</p>
<p>Everyone called this trend ‘consumerization of business software/IT’. Dropbox, Google Drive, Docs and Sheets, etc led this era. But despite all efforts by business apps to keep things simple, consumer software continued to set the gold standard in user experience. Business software just followed the direction already set by consumer software products.</p>
<p>However, I think the scene is changing.</p>

<p>Look at Slack. Zoom. Typeform. They’ve gone above and beyond what we’d have expected of business software some years ago. They’re trendsetters in providing delightful user experiences, and they come out far ahead of similar consumer products in this space.</p>
<p>Can you think of another mainstream video calling software that’s as good as Zoom, for consumers? I can’t. About four weeks ago, my friends and I wanted to talk over WhatsApp but the app capped video call participants at 4. The quality of WhatsApp calls isn’t that great either (remember the “Reconnecting…” flashes?).</p>
<p><span> Zoom was top of mind for me because we use it at work every day. We switched to Zoom and everything worked just fine – there were no hiccups during the call, no onboarding problems, nothing at all. Seven people discovered Zoom that day, and all of them loved their first call.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I know several other folks who are defaulting to Zoom to stay in touch with their friends during this work-from-home season, despite WhatsApp, etc. being a tap away on their phones. That is saying <strong><em>a lot</em></strong> about how ahead of the pack Zoom is when it comes to group video/audio calling. Far ahead of consumer software in this space.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I’m going to unpack what’s happening here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zoom, <strong>a product that we use at work, nailed the calling experience.</strong> That’s a stark contrast from how sucky business software used to be, a decade ago.</li>
<li>Zoom enjoys <strong>fantastic brand recall</strong> – people spend hours on Zoom meetings every week (if not every day) so it’s on top of our minds when we’re thinking about calling our friends or family (ahead of consumer products that live in our phones.)</li>
<li>WhatsApp, <strong>a consumer product, didn’t impress us</strong> with the one job it was supposed to do (arbitrary limits be damned). Wasn’t consumer software supposed to be the gold standard in terms of user experience?</li>
<li>Seven of us <strong>switched to Zoom instantly</strong> and many of us went back to work to convince our closest teams to start using Zoom (network effects!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Business software like Zoom, etc. are so good that they’re winning against consumer software! If you said that to the person who had to deal with on-premise software and implementations ten or fifteen years ago, they’d certainly not believe it.</p>
<p>We’ve seen a lot of products go from consumer to enterprise – Skype, Facebook, WhatsApp, etc. launched versions for work after they succeeded in the consumer space. But with us relying on work apps day in and day out and realizing that they’re so delightfully built, we are naturally taking them outside of our work lives and introducing them to our friends and family.</p>
<p>This is a massive opportunity that I think organizations are slowly realizing they need to chase – Microsoft, for instance, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/03/30/introducing-new-microsoft-365-personal-family-subscriptions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just launched</a> personal and family subscriptions for Office 365. Lots of people <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/07/families-slack-asana/593584/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">already use</a> Asana (and even Slack!) to organize their personal lives.</p>
<p>Even if revenue from consumers doesn’t significantly add to the bottom line for companies like Zoom etc., getting regular users to vouch about your product is definitely going to help take the brand mainstream (think about how well Skype is recognized even today, only because it was available for consumers for so long!).</p>
<p>That’s only going to lead to a cycle of more people discovering these products back at work – helping improve adoption for the business version.</p>
<p>And that’s something nobody will refuse wanting!</p>

        <div id="post-body"><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h3 id="whatisahashmapandwhydoweneedit">What is a Hashmap and why do we need it?</h3>
<p>The Java hashmap is a data structure that allows efficient access and storage of elements in them. The elements are stored in a <code>&lt;key, value&gt;</code> format. It implements the <code>Map</code> interface and it is important to note that the <code>key</code> must be unique. This essentially means that if you insert <code>&lt;key = 5, value = 100&gt;</code> first and then insert <code>&lt;key = 5, value = 101&gt;</code> into the same hashmap, only the latter remains. This is illustrated in the code below. It allows us to access its elements in <code>O(1)</code> and should be used when the order of accessing elements is not important.</p>
<pre><code>package com.company;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; hashMap = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
        hashMap.put(1, 1001);
        hashMap.put(2, 1002);
        hashMap.put(3, 1003);
        hashMap.put(4, 1005);
        hashMap.put(5, 100);
		  // This gives output as 100
        System.out.println(hashMap.get(5));
		  hashMap.put(5, 101);
		  // This gives output as 101 because the previous entry is removed
        System.out.println(hashMap.get(5));
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="howareelementsinsertedintothehashmap">How are elements inserted into the HashMap?</h3>
<p>Let us understand a few keywords first to better understand the HashMap.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key</strong><br>
A key is an element in a hashmap that helps us uniquely identify entries in it. In the example above, <code>{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}</code> are the keys.</li>
<li><strong>Hash</strong><br>
As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function">Wikipedia</a> describes it, a <strong>hash function</strong> is a function that can be used to map keys of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. The values returned by a hash function are called <em>hash values</em>, <em>hash codes</em>, <em>digests</em>, or simply <em>hashes</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Values</strong><br>
Values are the elements that correspond to a key. In the example above, <code>{1001, 1002, 1003, 1005, 100, 101}</code> are the values.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we are done with these terms, let us dive into how inserting elements into a hashmap works. Hashmap entries are done inside a table which is nothing but an array of <code>Nodes</code>. A <code>Node</code> is made up of <code>Hash</code>, <code>Key</code>, <code>Value</code> and some other components. When an element has to be inserted into the Hashmap, the key’s <code>hash</code> is calculated which gives us the index of the table where the element has to be inserted.</p>
<p>By now you might have some questions in your mind! What if two keys have the same <code>hash</code> or in other words what if there is a collision in the map? What is the size of the table?</p>
<p>Let us first address the <strong>issue of collision</strong>! Whenever there is a collision due to hash values, the values are <strong>inserted in a linked list</strong>. However, when there are more than 8 elements in the linked list for a particular hash value, the list is <strong>refactored</strong> to a self balanced binary search tree or as we better know them, the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree">Red-Black trees</a></em>. This is done to avoid the linear search time in case of a lengthy linked list.</p>
<p>Now comes the size of the table. This part is pretty interesting! So why waste our time? Let us dive in right away!</p>
<p>The initial size of the table is 16 and the load factor is 0.75. The load factor is a parameter that will help us determine when we should increase the size of the table and recalculate the hash values. This happens when we reach the threshold value, which can be calculated by the equation,<br>
<code>Threshold = load factor * capacity</code></p>
<p>This threshold is set at 12 <code>(16 * 0.75)</code> initially. You can always change the load factor according to your needs but that won’t be necessary in most of the cases. The size of the table is doubled and the hashes are recalculate to populate the new table once the threshold capacity is reached.</p>
<h3 id="whywasthetablesizedoubledthough">Why was the table size doubled though?</h3>
<p>This question struck me when I was exploring the Hashmap and there is a pretty interesting reason for this decision. The hash function is <code>f(x) = key % table_capacity</code> and every time the table is resized, this tedious calculation must be done for each and every node. Now, the makers of the hashmap came up with a pretty neat bitwise hack; when we increase the <code>capacity</code> by a factor of 2, the hash value either remains the same or gets increased by the old value of <code>table_capacity</code> which can be done easily with bit manipulation rather than the costly operation of calculating the hash via the modulo operation. This stuff might seem a bit abstract at first but this code will clear your confusion.</p>
<pre><code>package com.company;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
		  // calculating hash for keys from 1 to 64
        for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 64; i++) {
			   // hash with table size 16 and 32 (16 * 2 = 32)
            System.out.println(i + " " + i % 16 + " " + i % 32);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Get and remove operations are quite trivial and you must have already understood them after reading this article! I am pretty sure you gained a good insight into the working of a hashmap :D</p>
<p>Now go, <em>get</em> them! :D</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-3377">

<div>
<p>If you were born mid-90’s or earlier, you probably remember being bored. We used to talk to ourselves, play “make believe”, taking walks, listening to records, etc. We learned to entertain ourselves, imagine, and create.</p>
<p>Today, my children and children born into the age of the virtual world have not experienced boredom, at least not in the same way. In a sense, those who grew up in the 24-hour news cycle, with social media have never and will never experience being alone. They’ve rarely experience the <a href="https://austingwalters.com/the-last-free-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sense of freedom</a> that comes from thinking to oneself.</p>
<p>A personal concern, is that children’s personalities appear to develop in the absence of technology. They play with toys and make their world come to life. My two year old believes, with all his heart, that his toys are sentient. That our Roomba has feelings and needs to be “fed”. He’s learning reason, learning to manipulate the world, talking to us, and so much more.</p>
<h2>Tools of Gods</h2>
<p>Throughout all human history technology has been an extension of ourselves. Part of childhood is learning to use and create tools. However, today we don’t need to build tools. With phones, we have near infinite information, entertainment, and communication at our finger tips, we can connect to anyone or anything – instantly. Capture audio, video and picture with a tap. Search our memories with a voice command. Calculate any/all the math equations we can think of, etc. Our technology makes us ever more godlike.</p>
<p>To provide this godlike device to a child is irresponsible. Arguably, even in hands of adults, our devices do more harm than good.</p>
<p>The difference between adults and children, is that children need to <em>learn-to-learn</em>. It’s the most important thing a child can learn. How well a child <em>learns-to-learn </em>will shape their entire life, their potential is defined by how well they can learn. There are several important lessons in learning how to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning to self-reflect</li>
<li>Nurturing curiosity</li>
<li>Defining ones goals</li>
<li>Indexing knowledge</li>
<li>Finding motivation</li>
</ul>
<p>There is probably more than goes into learning-to-learn, but that’s a good list for now.</p>
<p>For me, a defining moment was learning to sculpt my character in an effort to find motivation. I spent quite a bit of time reflecting on who I was and who I wanted to be. I defined myself and found the motivation I needed, with constant self-reflection to change. Without my time riding bikes, running, playing in the woods, soccer, walking alone, I wouldn’t be who I am today.</p>
<h2>Empathy is Derived from Self</h2>
<p>Having a godlike tool able solve most problems is a double edge sward. A phone is addictive by design. Mobile phones track us and companies learn everything about us, with that information being weaponized against us to maximize “screen time”. Is social media useful? Quite frankly, I’d argue no, social media has a net negative effect. Importantly, social media and games on your mobile device keep you constantly stimulated and often push others agenda(s)[<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>].</p>
<p>I question if most of the newer generations, born into their environment, have really learned to live in the physical world. Has the newer generation(s) learned to live with and identify themselves? Is there self-reflection and growth? Without an internal dialog, a lot of things break down: personality, autonomy, comfort with being alone, understanding alternative viewpoints… empathy.</p>
<p>Perhaps, [even more concerning] without an internal identity / dialog one doesn’t develop a “classic” ego. If a self-image is typically defined by an internal image and that internal image doesn’t develop, what guides us? Likes? Karma?</p>
<p>This would explain the rise in more extreme moral stances. Such as building a hierarchy based on gender, race, etc. Lack of empathy for others, at the same time garnering more karma, for karma is the value system people can hold themselves to. We no longer need to contemplate who we want to be, because we can receive instant feedback on our actions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I suspect this optimizes for short-term gain, but long-term loss to society.</p>
<p>We’ve seen the start of the incredibly destructive cycle, where contemplating or a nuanced opinion is simply not acceptable, because others can’t relate.</p>
<center><iframe data-lazy-type="iframe" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2cMYfxOFBBM?start=314" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>
<h2>Who are you?</h2>
<blockquote><p>I am free, no matter what rules surround me. If I find them tolerable, I tolerate them; if I find them too obnoxious, I break them. I am free because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything I do.</p>
<p>– Robert A. Heinlein</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m a firm believer that life is and should be tough. Growth comes from adaptation, confidence is derived from overcoming challenges. When life is tough, you have to create goals and blaze a trail to somewhere better. This is what it means to be “free”, free to have self-determination, which few embrace.</p>
<p>I wasn’t born to my current “class”. I would say, I was born “big-mac” rich, where you could buy a “big-mac” once a month without worrying about budget. My parents provided shelter, food and clothes, but I started mowing lawns at 12 and working a job by 14 to buy anything I needed beyond food and shelter. Yet today, (14 years &amp; a couple kids later), I’d call myself “iPhone” rich, I can buy something of equivalent cost monthly without worrying about it.</p>
<p>This doesn’t happen in a vacuum.</p>
<p>My wife and I regularly create two and five year plans. These goals provide motivation. We can ask ourselves,</p>
<blockquote><p>Does this activity help hit our five year objective?</p></blockquote>
<p>If the answer is no, then it’s probably not worth doing it. We work hard, we reflect regularly and we try to improve; always iterating towards something better.</p>
<p>To have self-determination, people need to think for themselves. They need to contemplate what they want from life. They need to talk to themselves. Self-determination requires goals, it also requires grappling (or ignoring) others and importantly saying “no” and “yes” based on <em>objectives</em> not <em>desires</em>. In the end, this will make people happier.</p>
<p>It all starts with talking to ones-self, spending time alone and deciding what <em>you</em> want.</p>
<h2>A Bleak Outlook</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the god-like tools we’ve all grown accustom to (especially, when given to kids), seem to disrupt the ability to talk to one-self. In a sense, our phones, media, and general virtual world has taken all our time; this leaves us without time for self-reflection, self-thought, self-actualization. In this stunted world, the AI which manipulates our news replaces the ego we once had.</p>
<p>Complex discussions, real empathy, motivation — are going to be something most of us lose. I’m not sure if society is ready for what we created. It’s a mob of people who’ve never experienced real hardship, who’ve learned a social system designed by virtue signaling (aka trying to game the “karma” systems) and not really learning to live in the real world. Then again, these people will be shaping the real world, for better or worse.</p>

<p><em>Speakers: Denny Vrandečić, Jans Aasman, Mikhail Galkin</em></p>
<p><strong>Denny</strong></p>
<p>Denny speaks about knowledge graphs (KGs) are used for web search, question answer systems, data integration systems.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hey! I'm working on a new product - Simple &amp; Affordable Intercom alternative tailored for SaaS businesses. You get live chat, email helpdesk, and event-driven emails &amp; in-app messages for $20/mo (free during beta). Interested? <a href="https://forms.gle/MZQZkjiSjLP8Acmb8" target="_blank">Drop your email here</a> and I'll invite you into the closed beta.<br></p></div><div><p>Most SaaS products have a freemium model that allows users to get a basic sense of how the product works and lets them see what additional benefits they gain by subscribing to the paid version of the product.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>However it can be tricky sometimes when users are not able to understand what the paid plan offers until they actually give their credit card information and subscribe to the paid plan.&nbsp;</p><p>Even if one has a system where the user can give their payment information but won’t be charged until the free trial is over, it would cause some users to churn because they are not even sure if they want the free trial without knowing what the product offers.</p><p>We faced a similar problem while building our <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/whatsapp-chat-button" target="_blank">product</a> which is a Shopify app, so we started looking at how other Shopify apps are doing this and we got to know that most of them trigger a paywall the moment you install the application without even letting you see what the UI looks like.</p><figure id="w-node-51e05250e74f-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f2f5d835b3d4ff0b3dc6efe_spe_2G5Bk_TIRiDy7KqmttAL8ldRog9DkCdPptgpMbXDSKt53h5Utr8RyhbVJL8iFBPHIrm9xKJHq1Vv4E4_ig-VmDXKTtM2zN2hG0yKP672A6rfYe-toDnoKxm1aghQY1v2PkJt.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Landing page of most Shopify apps</figcaption></figure><p>This did not seem right to us. We wanted every user to get onboarded into our product and let them see all the features that we have to offer and trigger the paywall only if they display an intent to use the product. We achieved this by following these methods:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Onboarding email: </strong>An automated email consisting of information about all the paid plans sent at the time of installation.</li><li><strong>Landing page after installation: </strong>A page with the option of continuing with free plan or subscribing to paid plan right after installation.</li><li><strong>Upgrade banner</strong>: Display a banner on top of all the pages within the product that belong to the paid version nudging the user to subscribe.</li><li><strong>Allow read operations &amp; block write operations</strong>: Letting the users navigate through the whole product and triggering a paywall only when they attempt to perform an action that would involve a write operation in the database.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Informative pricing page: </strong>A crips pricing page that lets the user know what they're getting in the free/paid plans.</li></ol><p><strong>Onboarding email</strong><br></p><p>It is common practice to send an email introducing a user to the product when they install it. We tried to tweak this email a bit further to inform the users about the paid plans that are available to them and what they can gain from them.</p><figure id="w-node-9138f456ece7-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f2f5d8373220b6ad0cd0ceb_6nLSWCmzBgHoKDR1ni8vF8z0e7BAgnEN_Ec9cxruCc_PgWP-IOvBTUSDUTn9g3FbzU_CSq1bsXGiboW-V9f93oIX2gLtz5kmYdrbqTGMX-DBUWrIN9X_4rehnMIl1ZkC_9AAI_3B.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Onboarding email</figcaption></figure><p>At the end of this email we include a link which takes the users to our pricing page from where they can upgrade to the paid plan.</p><p><strong>Landing page after installation</strong><br></p><p>While we were totally against triggering a paywall right in the landing page after a user installs the app, if your users know what they are looking for, sometimes it might be better to let them pick their plan upfront so as to skip the dance.&nbsp;</p><p>So it made sense to display a version of the pricing page right after installation where the user can either choose to continue with the free plan and not enter any payment information or upgrade to the paid plan right there.</p><p>The key thing here is to make sure that there is a sure shot way for the user to skip this step and go straight to the app but at the same time, it should not be too easy for them to do this.</p><figure id="w-node-d31983beeceb-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f2f5d830188e7707bf39723_ZTvOPQ3cP6fATI4I8it498ZWmuvAmTj4cwuDXiiOaGMSWbesIFpHQ_YLg6vGfNJBLFMwEJW3DrtEU2volg16TGN8yMjrCzpKUy9pn8ycoTcwjQpC2C8MwnZvc1t3-uJ2OYhFhOLc.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Landing page with plan information</figcaption></figure><div><p>Adding this additional step boosted our trials initiated by almost 50%.</p></div><p><strong>Upgrade banner</strong><br></p><p>Our product is segregated into pages where each page represents a particular feature of the product and each feature could either belong to the free plan or the paid plan. You can navigate to any page using a side navigation bar.</p><p>When the user navigates to a page with free plan features, they don’t see any visible change and can continue configuring and using the product, but when they navigate to a page with paid plan features, they see a banner on the top of the page that is not subtle but at the same time does not hamper user experience.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-e61ae37ea7c6-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f2f5d8373220bdb1ecd0cec_efZU0N2DhHNcJ4CZ4ljlqMAd6JqdA5hWfT2QHmaobX79Oa2QAv9nibFYKBJEibXgaBWBUbQOTi5kYWECeEHX9zauCcExP5MsZ1qFV7e2Nm-xO2aZVI3c3xR2y6CsPQvgPuo1rhXi.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Upgrade banner on every page</figcaption></figure><p>This banner contains a CTA button which takes the users to our pricing page where they can choose their plan and authorise payment. This banner disappears from all pages once they subscribe to the paid plan while the rest of the product remains as it is.</p><p><strong>Allow read operations and block write operations</strong><br></p><p>When the user is on a free plan there is no harm in letting them navigate to pages with paid features and let them see how it works. In fact you can let them use the product the same way a paid plan user would use it.&nbsp;</p><p>The only harm occurs when a free user tries to configure something which can only be done by paid plan users. This can be prevented by automatically redirecting them to the pricing page whenever they click on a button or perform any action that they are not supposed to.</p><p>In other words if any action within the product triggers a write operation in the backend, instead of allowing that to happen, send the users to the pricing page if they are on a free plan.</p><figure id="w-node-0a155a88de6e-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f2f5d8331574c63b95e64c6_W9t3RvJ-bhBfMhIQDQzfo87l3-3t4yi59p67g9mCh4Jva21PBV5zmiCv8lY54have7fychas2YKnbZVBNFJCuKUSxoABFQOzzNNPxCOQeVuohtkYbr58z6MCsCz5EpBmEE-gKXHM.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Clicking on actionable buttons redirects to pricing page</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Informative pricing page</strong></p><p>Since we are redirecting users to a page that is specifically designed for them to authorise a payment, we use this page to display all the features that are offered in the free version and paid version of the product.&nbsp;</p><p>At the moment we have only one paid plan but if there are multiple paid plans, the same page can be used to display all features of all the plans along with the pricing and any discount if applicable.

It is also one of the poorest, with an annual&nbsp;per capita income of $870 US (<a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNP.PCAP.PP.CD">at purchasing power parity</a>).</p>   <p>"When you are in Malawi and someone asks you, 'Where do you go to church?' and you say you don't pray, it's an awkward thing, like you're a weird person," says Teresa Chirwa, a journalist from Malawi who is spending an academic year at the University of Toronto.</p>   <p>The majority of Malawians belong to one of several Christian denominations (including Roman Catholic, Anglican, Baptist, Presbyterian and the African Independent Churches),&nbsp;while another 15 to 20 per cent are Muslim. Much of the population also practices traditional African religions.</p>   <p>In recent years, new Pentecostal churches have begun to take hold, and the younger generation has started making its own choices about which churches to attend&nbsp;— rather than following&nbsp; their parents' beliefs, said Chirwa.</p>   <p>"Kids are revolting," she said. "They are leaving the traditional churches and going to the new churches that are emerging."</p>   <p>The country now also has its&nbsp;first atheist organization, although so far, except for its leader, the names of all its members remain secret.</p>   <p>"They're being ridiculed by the society," said Chirwa. "They're being discriminated against for those beliefs."</p>  </div>  <p>Gregory Paul doesn't think it can. After constructing a "Successful Societies Scale" that compared 25 socioeconomic indicators against statistics on religious belief and practice in 17 developed nations, the Baltimore-based paleontologist concluded in a&nbsp;2009 study&nbsp;that "religion is most able to thrive in seriously dysfunctional societies."</p>  <p>Paul, who is a freelance researcher not affiliated with any institution, compiled data on everything from homicide rates and income inequality&nbsp;to infant mortality and teenage pregnancies and found that the societies that scored&nbsp;the best&nbsp;on socioeconomic indicators were also the most secular.</p>  <p>"The correlation between religiosity and successful societies is somewhere around 0.7. Zero&nbsp;is no correlation and&nbsp;one is a perfect correlation, so it's a really good correlation, and it's not just an accident," he told CBC News.</p>  <p>"There's no situation where you have a really highly religious nation that's highly successful socially."</p>  <p>Paul's intention in creating the scale was to&nbsp;challenge the idea that religion is universal and innate to the human condition, and to show that societies that don't believe in God are not doomed, as some religious conservatives would have people believe.</p>  <p>"Religion is highly variable, and therefore we need to ask why is it sometimes popular and why it isn't,"&nbsp;Paul said. "One thing we do know is that it's only popular in societies that&nbsp;… have enough rate of dysfunction that people are anxious about their daily lives, so they're looking to the gods for help in their daily lives.</p>  <p>"It's not fear of death that drives people to be religious, and it's not a God gene or a God module in the brain or some sort of connection with the gods; it's basically a psychological coping mechanism."</p>  <h3>Religion on decline in West</h3>  <p>Belief in God and participation in religious services have been on the decline in recent decades in most First World nations but have remained high in developing countries. Between 1947 and 2001, belief in God declined by 33.6 per cent in Sweden, 19.9 per cent in Australia and 7.2 per cent in Canada, according to an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/pnorris/Articles/Articles%20published%20in%20journals_files/ppr2006%20norris.pdf">analysis</a>&nbsp;of social science surveys done by Harvard sociologist Pippa Norris and University of Michigan political scientist Ronald Inglehart.</p>  <p>Data for&nbsp;developing countries does not go back as far, but recent&nbsp;opinion polls&nbsp;suggest religiosity has remained high. The 10 most religious countries on the&nbsp;2012 WIN-Gallup International Religiosity and Atheism Index&nbsp;all had 85 per cent or more of respondents identifying as "a religious person," and all were countries with a per capita income&nbsp;of less than &nbsp;$14,100 US.</p>    <p>When Norris and Inglehart&nbsp;pooled 20 years of results from the World Values Survey, which regularly polls dozens of countries on social science questions, they found that in agrarian societies, 44 per cent of people said they attended church at least once a week compared to 25 per cent in industrial and 20 per cent in postindustrial societies. They also found that nations&nbsp;that scored&nbsp;low on the&nbsp;<a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/">Human Development Index</a>, which measures health, education and living standards,&nbsp;tended to be those&nbsp;with the highest rates of participation in religious services and prayer.</p>  <div>   <h2>Religion, faith and belief</h2>   <p>This story launches a CBC News series looking at religion, faith and belief in our world.</p>  </div>  <p>More recent polls have found similar divisions between rich and poor nations. The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx">2009 Gallup Inc. religion survey</a>, which sampled about 1,000 people in each of 114 countries, found that among nations with a per capita income of less than $2,000, 95 per cent of respondents, in the median, answered "Yes" to the question: "Is religion an important part of your daily life?"</p>  <p>In countries with per capita income of more than $25,000, 47 per cent of respondents answered "Yes." In Canada, 42 per cent of respondents said religion was important.</p>  <p>Bangladesh, Niger, Malawi and Yemen had some of the strongest&nbsp;positive responses (99 per cent) while Sweden (17 per cent), Denmark (19 per cent), Japan (24 per cent) and Estonia (16 per cent)&nbsp;— where religion was suppressed under the former Soviet regime&nbsp;— had some of the weakest.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>People walk past the Great Mosque in the ancient desert city of Agadez, Niger.

Wealthier states like Vermont and Maine were more comparable to Switzerland and Canada, the poll found.</p>  </div>  <p>"As lives gradually become more comfortable and secure, people in more affluent societies usually grow increasingly indifferent to religious values, more skeptical of supernatural beliefs and less willing to become actively engaged in religious institutions."</p>  <p>In poor countries, religious institutions often provide essential services such as education and health care, and the social networks that faith communities provide can be crucial in times of crisis.</p>    <p>"In the richer countries, people are less likely to face existential threats … so they have more opportunity for fulfillment outside of religion," Crabtree said.</p>  <p>But it's more than just an accumulation of wealth that makes a country more secular, sociologists say.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"The United States is one of the wealthier societies, and yet, it's still quite religious," said Phil Zuckerman, a sociology professor at Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif., who has studied secularization in Scandinavian countries and wrote a book about it called <em>Society Without God</em>.</p>  <p>"I think it's when you have what we might call 'existential security'&nbsp;— so, wealth and prosperity are part of that, but by that we [also] mean the bulk of people in society have access to housing, health care, jobs. They live in a relatively stable, democratic society without much in the way of existential threats to their lives or their culture."</p>  <p>It's no accident, say some sociologists, that some of the world's least religious people live in nations …</p></span></p></div></div>

    <h2 id="title">2020-08-08: Where do argc and argv come from?</h2>
<p>Continuing on from <a href="https://briancallahan.net/blog/20200803.html">our tiny snake game</a>, let's explore more into how binaries work on Unix. Let's figure out how our programs come to obtain their argc and argv parameters.</p>
<p>You can grab the finished code for this write-up <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo">here on GitHub</a>.
</p><h4>The past: a no option world</h4>
<p>One thing we exploited with our snake game was the fact that it took no options. That was an easy way to keep the binary size down. If the user did happen to write things on the command line after the command invocation, our game would simply ignore it. Such behavior can be explained in the code that invokes the main function.</p>
<pre>main(void)
</pre>
<p>Our main function takes no arguments. But that's not the norm for Unix programs. It is more common that we see our main function take two parameters.</p>
<pre>main(int argc, char *argv[])
</pre>
<p>An integer telling us the number of arguments and a double pointer which gives us those arguments. But how does our program get those arguments? If we type them out on the command line, what is the mechanism that passes things to our program? Let's write a program that takes command line options. It doesn't have to do anything special. Just reading them in and printing them out would work for us. This is effectively the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/echo.1">echo(1)</a> utility we will recreate, though we will leave out the <code>-n</code> flag.</p>
<h4>Setting up our environment</h4>
<p>Let's copy over our <a href="https://github.com/ibara/snakeqr/blob/master/crt.s">crt.s file</a> from SnakeQR. Let's also split it up into three files: the .note.openbsd.ident section will remain in <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo/blob/master/crt.s">crt.s</a>, _start will go into a new <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo/blob/master/_start.s">_start.s</a> file and _syscall will go into a new <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo/blob/master/_syscall.s">_syscall.s</a> file. Let's write a simple <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo/blob/master/Makefile">Makefile</a> too while we're here. We will put our C code into an <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo/blob/master/echo.c">echo.c</a> file.</p>
<p>We are also going to improve our _start function. As we remember from SnakeQR, the equivalent C for our _start function is</p>
<pre>void
_start(void)
{

	main();

	_exit(0);
}
</pre>
<p>But we Unix people know that main is an int and can return different values. And we can use those values in other places (like shell scripts). Our current _start function doesn't cut it. We need something more like</p>
<pre>void
_start(void)
{
	int argc;
	char **argv;

	_exit(main(argc, argv));
}
</pre>
<p>In assembly, that looks something like</p>
<pre>	.text
	.p2align 2
	.globl	_start
_start:
	callq	main
	movl	%eax, %edi
	movl	$1, %eax
	syscall
	.size	_start,.-_start
</pre>
<p>Really similar to our previous version of _start but this time instead of clearing %edi we instead take the value of %eax after main exits and put it in %edi, which is the parameter for _exit. Why %eax? Because the return value of functions are put in %eax. We have to remember to move the return value to %edi right away because we need %eax again to provide the syscall number as we learned from SnakeQR. You'll notice that we don't handle argc or argv mostly because we don't know yet how to handle them. And maybe we don't have to. With this, we can write a very simple main function that returns the value of argc.</p>
<h4>Is it really that easy?</h4>
<p>Maybe it really is this easy; let's write that simple main function.</p>
<pre>int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{

	return argc;
}
</pre>
<p>If we run <code>echo one two three</code> we should get a return value of 4. Remember that the program name ends up counting in argc and lives in argv[0]. Run it, issue echo $? after and... 0. So no, it wasn't that easy. It was worth a shot.</p>
<p>But we know that argc and argv have to come from <i>somewhere</i> and if it's somewhere, chances are good it will show up in gdb. I'll be using <a href="https://github.com/openbsd/ports/tree/master/devel/gdb">egdb (aka gdb from ports)</a> since that's newer than the gdb in base. We can install it with a simple <code>doas pkg_add gdb</code>.
</p><h4>Running our program in gdb</h4>
<p>If you've never used gdb before, there are a lot of things you can do with it. But let's keep things simple. We can load our program into gdb like so</p>
<pre>$ egdb --args ./echo
</pre>
<p>This will allow us to put any number of command line options, though we're not using any right now. Our argc should be 1 so let's see if we can find a 1 somewhere in gdb.</p>
<p>The easiest thing to do in gdb is run the program. At the (gdb) prompt, type <code>r</code> and press Enter.</p>
<pre>(gdb) r
Starting program: /home/brian/echo/echo
/home/brian/echo/echo
[Inferior 1 (process 38559) exited normally]
</pre>
<p>That wasn't very interesting. It ran and exited without telling us anything.</p>
<h4>Breaking our program</h4>
<p>In order to do anything meaningful we should insert breakpoints. This tells gdb to pause execution at that memory location. All our functions can be used as locations to break. We can also break at offsets from our functions, but we don't need that functionality for today.</p>
<p>We only have two functions so far: _start and main. My hunch tells me that because _start is our entry point, if our hosted environment is giving us argc and argv, it will definitely be findable in _start, whereas we might lose it by the time we get to main. Let's set a breakpoint at _start.</p>
<pre>(gdb) b _start
Breakpoint 1 at 0x201170
</pre>
<p>OK. We're ready to go. Let's run the program now.</p>
<pre>(gdb) r
Starting program: /home/brian/echo/echo

Breakpoint 1, 0x0000000000201170 in _start ()
</pre>
<p>We are effectively at the point where our hosted environment hands off execution to the program. Now we can explore our program.</p>
<h4>Getting information</h4>
We can tell gdb to give us the contents of all our registers with the <code>info reg</code> command.
<pre>(gdb) info reg
rax            0x0      0
rbx            0x0      0
rcx            0x0      0
rdx            0x0      0
rsi            0x0      0
rdi            0x0      0
rbp            0x0      0x0
rsp            0x7f7ffffbe6e0   0x7f7ffffbe6e0
r8             0x0      0
r9             0x0      0
r10            0x0      0
r11            0x0      0
r12            0x0      0
r13            0x0      0
r14            0x0      0
r15            0x0      0
rip            0x201170 0x201170 &lt;_start&gt;
eflags         0x202    [ IF ]
cs             0x2b     43
ss             0x23     35
ds             0x23     35
es             0x23     35
fs             0x23     35
gs             0x23     35
</pre>
<p>We know that argc is going to be 1, so any register that is 0 we can ignore. Not what we're looking for. The %rip register holds our instruction pointer, and gdb helpfully tells us that memory location corresponds to the _start function. The eflags register is our status register, which contains information like the carry bit and the zero bit. We can't use that directly. And cs through gs are segment registers, which we are not going to look at today. That leaves us with %rsp as our candidate. It certainly holds something. It happens to be a location on the stack (%rsp = stack pointer). We can examine it with the <code>x/x $rsp</code> command. This is the x command. For us, we will use it in the form x/&lt;length&gt;&lt;format&gt;, where length is the number of format objects we want (if you leave it out, you want one) and format is our format specifier. An x for the format specifier means hexadecimal but there are others too, like f for floating point, i for instruction, and s for string.</p>
<pre>(gdb) x/x $rsp
0x7f7ffffbe6e0: 0x00000001
</pre>
<p>Hey! That's a 1! Let's quit out of gdb and rerun it as <code>egdb --args ./echo one</code> and see if we get a 2 next time.</p>
<pre>(gdb) x/x $rsp
0x7f7ffffcb900: 0x00000002
</pre>
We do!
<h4>Passing argc from our hosted environment to our program</h4>
<p>I think we've discovered that our hosted environment puts argc and argv on the stack and then jumps to _start so that _start also has access to argc and argv. Let's think back to our calling convention: the first argument goes in %rdi. We should be able to pop the top value off the stack and put it in %rdi and then our main function will return argc. Let's add this to _start.</p>
<pre>	.text
	.p2align 2
	.globl	_start
_start:
	popq	%rdi
	callq	main
	movl	%eax, %edi
	movl	$1, %eax
	syscall
	.size	_start,.-_start
</pre>
<p>All we did was add <code>popq %rdi</code> before the main call. Let's recompile and see what happens.</p>
<pre>/home/brian/echo $ ./echo        
/home/brian/echo $ echo $?       
1
/home/brian/echo $ ./echo one
/home/brian/echo $ echo $?    
2
/home/brian/echo $ ./echo one two
/home/brian/echo $ echo $?        
3
</pre>
<p>I think we can say we are successfully passing argc from our hosted environment to our program.</p>
<h4>Passing argv to our program, part 1</h4>
<p>Now we need to find and pass argv. Maybe it's as simple as the current top of the stack, now that argc has been popped off, is argv. Remember that %rsi is the second parameter according to our calling convention. If it's really that easy all we will need to do is add <code>movq %rsp, %rsi</code> after the <code>popq %rdi</code> we just added.</p>
<pre>	.text
	.p2align 2
	.globl	_start
_start:
	popq	%rdi
	movq	%rsp, %rsi
	callq	main
	movl	%eax, %edi
	movl	$1, %eax
	syscall
	.size	_start,.-_start
</pre>
<p>We should also write a proper echo function in C while we are here. The usual way it goes is skip argv[0], from argv[1] to argv[argc - 1], print the argument and if there is a next argument also print a space. Once we run out of arguments, print a newline. In C, this looks like
</p><pre>int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	int i;

	for (i = 1; i &lt; argc; i++) {
		write(1, argv[i], strlen(argv[i]));
		if (i + 1 != argc)
			write(1, " ", 1);
	}
	write(1, "\n", 1);

	return 0;
}
</pre>
<h4>strlen</h4>
<p>We don't actually know how long each argument will be, so we need some way to calculate that since our write function requires us to pass the number of characters to write as an argument. The <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/strlen.3">strlen(3)</a> function does that for us. But remember since we're building everything ourselves, let's take a moment to think about what strlen does and how we can recreate it.</p>
<p>The strlen function reads in a string and outputs the number of characters in that string. We can set up a second pointer that points to the first character of the string. Since we know strings in C must end with a NUL byte, we can check to see if our second pointer is the NUL byte and if not move to the next character of the string. When we hit the NUL byte, subtracting the original string location from the second string location will give us the length of the string. We can't …</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>There is a number of online “alternative lifestyle” movements that have been gaining steam among millennials. They are appealing in their leanness: do more with less. At first, they seem cute and liberating. Scores of Instagram influencers and bloggers romanticize these lifestyles, and their subreddits are buzzing with zealots. Key examples below:</p> <p><strong>FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early)</strong>: live frugally now to save money as quickly as possible, then buy a place in a low cost-of-living area and live (mostly) off your savings.</p> <p><strong>Van Life</strong>: Buy a van, trick it out with a beautiful bed and a kitchen. Live lightly, travel the world, work remotely.</p> <p><strong>Tiny Houses</strong>: Nobody needs 5,000 square feet. Why not play with constraints, and build a full house with the square feet of a studio?</p> <p><strong>Remote Work</strong>: work your high-paying-job from a low-cost-of-living area, save up money, and save on commuting.</p> <p>While these lifestyles are marketed as all about freedom, they come with major restrictions: they are overwhelmingly for the single and childless. Having children is very expensive, so it’s hard to make that work with FIRE. On the other hand, van life and tiny houses are logistically prohibitive to having children.

That’s usually a bad trade.</p> <p>Not only do these lifestyles constrain, they also reflect a severe already-existing capital constraint. Broadly, <em>all</em> of these movements are reactions to poverty. Living in a van, tiny house, or remotely all stem from one factor: real estate in your preferred area (perhaps the place you call “home”) is too expensive. You can’t afford to buy or rent a real place there, so you move into an Instagrammable shed, or you move away altogether. These lifestyles are solutions to problems of poverty – but in making those solutions fashionable, they hide the ugly reality underneath.</p> <p>Ultimately, these movements romanticize and hide the true <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials#In_the_United_States">generational poverty of millennials</a>. This is a generation of people who will never retire, who may never even buy real estate of their own. In terms of intergenerational wealth, these people are screwed. And I would like to see that point raised and addressed, instead of making do with solutions of desperation.</p> <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

<h2>ImageMagick Examples - Introductory Notes</h2>

<h3>What is ImageMagick?  A No-Holds-Barred Summary</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</a> is
designed for batch processing of images.  That is, it allow you to combine
image processing operations in a script (shell, DOS, Perl, PHP, etc.) so
the operations can be applied to many images, or as
a sub-system of some other tool, such as a Web application, video
processing tool, panorama generator, etc.  <i>It is not a GUI image
editor</i>. </p><p>

ImageMagick is, first of all, an image-to-image converter. That is what it was
originally designed to do.  That is, it will convert an image in just about
any image format (tell us if it can't) to any other image format.  </p><p>

But it is also a library of <i>image processing algorithms</i>.  These can be
access via the command line and shell/DOS scripts (which these example pages
demonstrate), or via a large number of programming languages, such as C, C++,
Perl, Ruby, PHP, etc.  See: <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/api.php">ImageMagick APIs</a>. </p><p>

Speed was never a major feature of IM, which places more emphasis on the
quality of the images it generates.  That is not to say that it can't
transform images in a reasonable amount of time. It's just not blindingly
fast.  Because of this, IM can be slow to perform certain processing
operations, especially when attempting to compress images into image formats
that have limited capabilities. </p><p>

ImageMagick concerns itself mainly with images in the form of a <i>rectangular
array of pixels</i>, commonly called a "raster."  It will handle "vector"
image formats like Postscript or PDF, but at the cost of converting those
images into a raster when loading them, and generating a vector image wrapper
around the raster when saving it.  As a result, vector images are often
processed badly when using the default settings.  However, specific options
can be used to improve this situation.  See: <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/formats/#vector">A word about vector image formats</a>.  </p>


<h3>About These Examples of ImageMagick Usage</h3><p>

These pages were developed from, and are a continuation of, my <a href="http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/anthony/info/graphics/imagemagick.hints">Collection of ImageMagick Hints and Tips</a> page I first started in 1993,
and placed on the new fangled world-wide-web making its appearance around the
same time.  Information on many aspects of IM, and notes not included in these
pages, are still present in that document.  However, while the present pages
were designed for you to look at, the hints and tips document was only for my
own edification.  So, it may be vague or chaotic in places.  You are welcome
to look at it, learn, and make comments on it.  </p><p>

Other examples were grabbed or developed from answers to users' questions on
he <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/forum_link.cgi?f=1">IM
Forums</a>, or contributed to me as solutions to various problems. </p><p>

I look forward to suggestions and e-mail from other IM users.  Such e-mail
generally results in improvements and expansions to these example pages.
</p>

<h3>Command Line Environments</h3><p>

All examples are written for use on UNIX, and specifically GNU/Linux systems,
using BASH scripting.  As a consequence, some examples use shell 'for-do'
loops. Most examples use a backslash '<code>\</code>' at the end of a line to
continue that command on the next line.  The longer commands are broken into
separate lines to try to further highlight the steps being applied. </p><p>

However, you can still use these examples from <b>PC Windows batch
scripts</b>, with some changes to the handling of certain characters.  With
some slight adaptation, the examples can also be run directly from
'<code>system</code>' calls in <b>PHP scripts</b>.  </p><p>

See <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/windows/">Windows Usage</a> and <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/api/index.html">APIs
and Scripting</a> for more information on using the ImageMagick commands in
these alternative environments. Contributions and test examples are welcome.
</p>


<h3>PerlMagick, and Other APIs</h3><p>

It should also be possible to adapt any of these examples to use the IM API
from languages such as Perl, C, C++, Ruby, PHP, and so on.  I recommend trying
things out on the command line first, until you get them right, and then
converting the operations to the specific API you are using. </p><p>

Although the situation has improved enormously with IM version 6, the command
line really only deals with a single image sequence at any one time. However,
APIs do not have this limitation, and allow you to manipulate multiple image
sequences, separately or together, to perform more complex operations.  This
ability makes it simpler to implement these examples using the IM API, and
removes the need to save images as temporary files, as many of the command
line examples require. When using an API, only permanent and semi-permanent
images need be saved to disk. </p><p>

Basically, let the example pages give you a start, to let you see what
is possible with ImageMagick.  Then, formulate what you want to do on
the command line, before coding the operations in scripts and API
code, where it is harder to make extensive changes. </p><p>

I also recommend that you comment your API code, <b>heavily</b>, adding the
command line equivalents to what you are trying to do, if possible. That way,
you can check and compare the results against those using the command line.
This lets you debug problems that you may come across later, especially as
improvements are made to image processing in the Core ImageMagick Library.
</p>

<h3>Downloading Input Images and Results</h3><p>

As much as possible, I try to use images built-into IM (such as
"<code>logo:</code>" or "<code>rose:</code>") as input images for IM example
commands, or to generate input images using IM commands.  I also often re-use
the output of previous commands in later examples.  Because of this, you
usually don't need to download any 'test' images in order to try out the
examples yourself. </p><p>

However, such generated or built-in images are not always convenient.  So,
when I do use an external image, I tend to re-use that input image, or the
results of previous examples, for later examples in that section. </p><p>

Sometimes the original source image will be displayed or for larger images
a link to the source image is provided. More commonly only the final resulting
image will be shown, as the input is well known or obvious. </p><p>

Almost all the IM example commands shown are executed in the same web
directory in which they appear.  That is, the command you see is the command
that was actually used to generate the image. Because of this you can modify
the page's URL to download or view the input image(s) used by an example.
Extra copies of the external source images have also been placed in the "<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/images/">images</a>" and "<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/img_photos/">img_photos</a>"
sub-directories.  See also the example of a <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/img_photos/INDEX.html">Fancy Photo Index</a> of those images. </p><p>


If text output or image information is produced by an example, it is saved to
a text file, and an image of it is generated for display on the Web page.
Selecting the text output image will link you to a copy of the actual text
output by the command.  </p><p>

In all these examples, selecting the output image should let you download the
image which was actually created by the example command. But be warned, not
all browsers understand all image formats used. </p>

<h3>External Image Sources</h3><p>

By the way, most of the source images used in these examples come from <a href="http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/anthony/icons/">Anthony's Icon
Library</a>, particularly the  <a href="http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/anthony/icons/desc/cl-bgnd/Icons.html">background tiles</a>, <a href="http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/anthony/icons/large/Icons.html">large
clip-art</a>, and <a href="http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/anthony/icons/dragons/Icons.html">dragons</a> sections of the library. (I like dragons!)  </p><p>

This library actually predates the WWW. I created it in 1991, due to the lack
of good, clean iconic images for use on the X Window System.  The advent of
the WWW has of course changed this, but my original library still exists and
remains available as a source of images, even though it is not actively
growing.  </p><p>

Some specific images, and larger images, are contributed by the authors of
specific examples.  The authors of such examples are listed in the contributed
section, or at the bottom of the page. </p><p>

If you are looking for a specific image, I recommend using <a href="http://images.google.com/imghp">Google Image Search</a> (or similar) to
find something appropriate. You can, of course, convert or resize such images
using IM for your own purposes.  However, you should be careful about
copyright if you plan to use such images commercially. </p>


<h3>PNG Images on Web Pages</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/images/test.png"><img src="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/images/test.png" width="150" height="100" alt="[IM Output]"></a>

In many examples, I use an image in PNG format, such as that shown to the
right of this text.  The PNG image format supports images with
semi-transparent pixels, a feature few other image formats provide.  It is
also a very well-understood image format and, as such, is usable by most of
today's image programs and Web browsers.  </p><p>

Some Web browsers, however, do NOT handle transparent PNG images correctly
(most notably Microsoft Internet Explorer v6).  Because of this, I generally
use the JPEG and GIF formats for images on the Web, and only use the PNG
format when generating images with semi-transparent pixels, or when exact
colors are needed for later examples. </p><p>

To allow IE v6 browsers to display PNG images, I use a special 'style sheet'
using complex JavaScript.  For information on this, see <a href="http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/anthony/wwwlab/pngtest/">PNG with
transparency for IE</a>. Technically, this is only problem with IE, not
ImageMagick. </p>

<table>
<tbody><tr><td>

<a name="display"></a>
<h3>Displaying Images on Your Screen</h3>

Display problems can also occur when displaying images on-screen.  Because of
this, I recommend using a command like the following to tile
a '<code>checkerboard</code>' pattern underneath the image, to highlight any
transparent or semi-transparent pixels in it.

<div><pre><code do_not_execute="">
    composite  -compose Dst_Over -tile pattern:checkerboard image.png x:
</code></pre></div>
</td><td>
   <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/test_undertile.jpg"><img src="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/test_undertile.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="[IM Output]"></a>
</td></tr></tbody></table><p>

The image displayed in the above example is a special PNG-format <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/images/test.png">test image</a>, which was generated using the shell
script "<code><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/scripts/generate_test">generate_test</a></code>".
Normally, the command would output the results to your display, not onto a Web
page like this.  </p><p>

If you look carefully, you can see the checkerboard pattern though the
semi-transparent colors. However, the image, as a whole, is fully opaque.  So,
this technique should work on all displays, Web browsers, and image viewers.
</p><p>

As of IM v6.0.2, the "<code>display</code>" program performs something like
this automatically.  However, it does not seem to handle images using color
tables (i.e., GIF) in this way. Using the "<code>x:</code>" output image format
(as above) causes an image to be displayed directly to the screen, without
having to save it.  See <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/files/#show">Show …</a></p></div></div>

I quickly went from feeling fairly nimble to hobbling around with limited mobility and an inability to sit at a desk. Argh!</p><p>Happily, I was prepared with some very comfortable and ergonomic<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> ways to use the computer while laying down (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supine_position">supine</a>). After about a week of doing this and phasing in some exercise, I could finally stand up straight again!</p><p>This post describes variations on supine computing – what's worked best for me so far.</p><h2 id="hammock-computing"><a href="#hammock-computing"></a>Hammock Computing!</h2><p>The best variety of supine computing is in a hammock! Here is a photo from summer of 2018:</p><p><img src="https://mgsloan.com/posts/supine-computing/images/back-yard-hammock.jpg" alt="Using a computer ergonomically in a hammock, via external split keyboard and computer suspended above head" width="1280" height="960"></p><p>This is highly ergonomic – most joints are in quite neutral positions. In particular, your neck can be fully relaxed because the screen is above your head.</p><p>In the photo above, the laptop is suspended via <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Releasable-cable-inch-50LBS-100pcs/dp/B00ANAWGM2?tag=mgsloan06-20">releasable zip ties</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup> threaded through a nice strap that came with some gymnastic rings. Ratchet straps are even better for this purpose, as they have a builtin way to tension them. In the photo below, a ratchet strap is tensioned from one end of the hammock stand to the other:</p><p><img src="https://mgsloan.com/posts/supine-computing/images/back-yard-hammock-strap.jpg" alt="strap tensioned across hammock stand" width="1280" height="1370"></p><p>In this case, zip ties are attaching to little wire loops wrapped around the laptop's hinges. Loops like this, or carabiners, are not necessary but they are a bit more convenient. With most ThinkPad laptops, and likely many other brands, its possible to thread the zip ties through between the body and screen or at the hinges. Here's a more recent picture showing this:</p><p><img src="https://mgsloan.com/posts/supine-computing/images/zip-tied-x1-carbon.jpg" alt="zip tie threaded through x1 carbon" width="1280" height="853"></p><p>I find that ThinkPads are more than sturdy enough to be suspended by their hinges. Sometimes I'll have the full weight on one hinge, while attaching the other. Please use your best judgment about what your laptop can handle<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p><h2 id="not-just-for-hammocks"><a href="#not-just-for-hammocks"></a>Not just for hammocks</h2><p>This is probably obvious, but supine computing is not just for hammocks! It's great for computing anywhere you can lay down. Since I also want to encourage computing outdoors and hammocking, all of the photos below will involve a <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Flowerhouse-FlyingSaucer-Hanging-Lounge-FHFSSVR-SET/dp/B07DB5LGNQ?tag=mgsloan06-20">"flying saucer" hammock</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup>.</p><h2 id="laziest-approach-pillows-but-poor-ergonomics"><a href="#laziest-approach-pillows-but-poor-ergonomics"></a>Laziest approach: pillows (but poor ergonomics)</h2><p>This approach can be quite convenient for short sessions:</p><p><img src="https://mgsloan.com/posts/supine-computing/images/supine-pillowing.jpg" alt="using pillow head support in circular hammock" width="1280" height="853"></p><p>Using a <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Kinesis-Advantage2-Ergonomic-Keyboard-KB600/dp/B07K1SMRGS?tag=mgsloan06-20">Kinesis Advantage 2</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup> keyboard works quite well in this posture, since there is a good amount of space between your hands. This might not be viable with other types of keyboards, but certainly worth a try.</p><p>The neck ergonomics are not ideal, though – doing extended sessions like this can cause neck soreness. So, please try to avoid that!</p><h2 id="much-better-screen-above-head--split-keyboard"><a href="#much-better-screen-above-head--split-keyboard"></a>Much better: screen above head + split keyboard</h2><p>Ideally, the screen would be above your head. Here, it's suspended via the same zip tie approach as above:</p><p><img src="https://mgsloan.com/posts/supine-computing/images/ergo-supine.jpg" alt="screen above head + split keyboard supine computing" width="1280" height="853"></p><p>Another improvement in this picture is using a split keyboard. In this case it's a <a href="https://keyboard.io/">keyboard.io</a>, but other split keyboards like the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">ErgoDox</a> can work great too. By placing the keyboard halves to either side, your arms can be in a more relaxed position.</p><p>This is much better than the prior supine posture. It doesn't seem to put much strain anywhere, and so is quite viable for extended computing sessions. It's also quite simple – split keyboard to either side, and screen above your head.</p><h2 id="other-suspension-methods"><a href="#other-suspension-methods"></a>Other suspension methods</h2><p>There are a huge variety of other ways to suspend a horizontal display above you. Pretty much any well anchored rope or strap will support the zip-ties-around-hinges approach. Here are a few more suspension ideas:</p><ul><li><p>Simply screw hooks into a strut in the ceiling.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B007VL3CB0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?tag=mgsloan06-20">Suction cups</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup> worked surprisingly well when I tried them, but only on smooth ceilings.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/s?tag=mgsloan06-20">3M Command Hooks</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup> work well on walls and slanted ceilings, but not well on flat ceilings, as they are not very strong perpendicular to the surface. It might be sufficient for lightweight laptops / tablets.</p></li><li><p>There are also a <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/s?tag=mgsloan06-20">variety of laptop stands</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup> intended for bed use. The only one I've personally used is the <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/MagicHold-Rotating-Adjusting-Compatible-13-15-6/dp/B07NXZNC88/ref=sr_1_7?tag=mgsloan06-20">MagicHold Laptop stand</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup>, which I mostly use for <a href="https://mgsloan.com/posts/deck-desk">reclined computing</a>. Like nearly all of these stands, their intended use does not involve the screen being entirely horizontal. For the MagicHold stand, the usual zip tie configuration can be used. I suspect for many of the stands, more direct attachment of the laptop could allow them to be used for fully horizontal supine computing.</p></li></ul><h2 id="other-supine-approaches"><a href="#other-supine-approaches"></a>Other supine approaches</h2><ul><li><p>I have a vague recollection from around ten years ago of <a href="https://timothy.hobbs.cz/">Timothy Hobbs</a> sharing a photo of supine computing on some freenode <abbr>IRC</abbr> channel, with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataHand">DataHand split keyboard</a> and a screen suspended above his head via a cardboard box. I googled for "timthelion data hands" and came across <a href="http://xirdalium.net/2008/02/10/laid-back/">a post from 2008</a> which ends with a more evolved version of his supine computing setup, which appears to be using a desk to support the monitor. It looks like more recently he's also had some interesting <a href="https://timothy.hobbs.cz/wearable-computing/adventures.html">adventures in outdoor wearable computing</a>.</p></li><li><p>After deciding to call this post "Supine Computing", I googled that phrase and came across a post by Justin Craig-Kuhn, titled <a href="https://medium.com/@jcraigk/healthy-hacking-diy-supine-workstation-cbaadcbbc2aa">"<abbr>DIY</abbr> Supine Workstation"</a>. He kindly gave me permission to reuse his photo here:</p><p><img src="https://mgsloan.com/posts/supine-computing/images/supine-jcg.jpg" alt="Justin Craig-Kuhn's supine setup" width="1280" height="916"></p><p>Cool stuff!! A couple notes on this:</p><ul><li><p>He's using an ipad as a screen along with a gooseneck tablet mount. This has nice adjustability, and is more elegant than putting a full laptop there. However, as he points out, using an IPad as a display adds some lag, about 20ms.</p></li><li><p>The keyboard position may well be better than mine, because each half is oriented vertically. This allows forearm rotation to be in the middle of its range rather than near its limit. I don't feel strain there, though, so I don't feel the need to do this.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>There are a variety of expensive solutions for reclined / supine computing workstations. For example, the offerings from <a href="https://altwork.com/">AltWork</a> and <a href="http://www.ergoquest.com/">ErgoQuest</a> are quite visually dramatic:</p><p><img src="https://mgsloan.com/posts/supine-computing/images/stations.jpg" alt="Expensive reclining workstations from AltWork and ErgoQuest" width="1280" height="480"></p><p>While I find these workstations quite cool, right now I can't justify the expense and non-portability. I prefer approaches which are inexpensive, portable, and use commonly found materials, such that they are more easily shared.</p></li></ul><h2 id="getting-weird-upside-down-belay-glasses"><a href="#getting-weird-upside-down-belay-glasses"></a>Getting weird: upside down belay glasses</h2><p>Alternatively, belay glasses can be used to allow your neck to be in a neutral position:</p><p><img src="https://mgsloan.com/posts/supine-computing/images/belay-glasses.jpg" alt="supine computing with belay glasses" width="1280" height="853"></p><p>Specifically, these are <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N1EYI37?tag=mgsloan06-20">clip on belay glasses</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup>, which can be used while belaying someone rock climbing, to allow you to watch the climber without craning your neck. In this case, they are flipped upside down such that your vision is downwards. This actually works fairly well, but certainly looks quite strange.</p><p>I haven't found myself doing this much, likely due to the following reasons:</p><ul><li><p>It can be a little finicky, though possible, to get the prisms oriented such that the screen is visible for both eyes. It's unpleasant for parts of the screen to be occluded for one eye.</p></li><li><p>When used outside, glare from the sky above can be more of a problem.</p></li><li><p>They induce some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration">chromatic aberration</a>, which can make text harder to read. This might be avoided by using a prism material with a lower refractive index.</p></li></ul><h2 id="downsides-of-supine-computing"><a href="#downsides-of-supine-computing"></a>Downsides of supine computing</h2><ul><li><p>Can be way too comfortable and relaxing, causing drowsiness. The best way to deal with this is to do a bit of exercise. A really good cycle is switching between a treadmill desk, standing, and supine computing.</p></li><li><p>You may find yourself using your computer in bed more frequently. I've read in a number of reputable places that it's good sleep hygiene to only use your bed for sleep and sex. So, if possible, please try to make your supine computing habit somewhere other than where you sleep.</p></li></ul><h2 id="upsides-of-supine-computing"><a href="#upsides-of-supine-computing"></a>Upsides of supine computing</h2><ul><li><p>Can allow you to comfortably use the computer when an injury might otherwise prevent it.</p></li><li><p>Is a great posture to include in a rotation of postures<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. For example, I don't find it practical to stand or walk (on a treadmill desk) for the entire day. Mixing in some supine computing makes it entirely viable to avoid all sitting.</p></li><li><p>It's a great way to do some physical resting while still getting things done. Sometimes it's better to take a proper nap, but other times I find that I'm physically tired but mentally active – this is a great posture for those times.</p></li></ul><h2 id="thanks-for-reading"><a href="#thanks-for-reading"></a>Thanks for reading!</h2><p>Thanks for reading this post, I hope some of you are inspired to try out supine computing, perhaps even outside! If you're dealing with back pain – argh – that sucks :( !

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Since around 2015, I’ve been <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/investing/dollar-cost-averaging-pays/">dollar-cost averaging</a>
cryptocurrencies over at Coinbase. “Stacking Sats,” it’s called these days.</p>
<p>Coinbase makes it very straightforward: link your bank account, pick your currency and frequency of purchase, <em>et voila:</em> your USD becomes cryptocurrency. For a fee, of course.</p>
<p>Anybody who has been around Cryptocurrency for more than a couple minutes knows that prices tend to fluctuate wildly.
On the whole, however, prices have been trending up.
As of the time of this writing, Bitcoin is:</p>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>Last 6 months, +194.86%</li>
    <li>Last 2 years, +266.49%</li>
    <li>Last 3 years, +290.18%</li>
    <li>Last 5 years, +5,300.92%</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Price information derived from <a href="https://www.barchart.com/crypto/quotes/%5EBTCUSD/performance">barchart</a>
  </p>
</div>
<p>With a significant general upward trend like this, monthly cost averaging means you’re leaving a lot of BTC on the table compared with weekly or daily cost average investing.
I decided that daily dollar cost averaging was in my best interest, so I set up a recurring purchase for $10 per day, and ate the $1 service charge. What’s $30/mo when you’ve got compounding double-digit gains on $270/mo?</p>
<p>It’s a lot of extra money on the table!
Thinking about this in terms of USD is the wrong approach; the amount of USD I’m spending is fixed.
The correct way to think about this is: how much more BTC would I have if I were not paying Coinbase a 10% fee?</p>
<p>To be clear, Coinbase’s fee is a much smaller percentage if you’re investing a larger sum of money.
Investing a larger sum would mean more time between purchases, which (for reasons described above) I want to avoid.</p>
<p>One solution is to use <a href="https://pro.coinbase.com/">Coinbase Pro</a> instead of <a href="https://coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a>.
The <a href="https://pro.coinbase.com/fees">trading fees</a> on Coinbase Pro are <em>significantly</em> less — at the volume I’m trading, they’re 0.5% instead of 10%: a whole 9.5% less.</p>
<p>Switching to Coinbase Pro, in other words, earns me 10.5% more BTC per transaction when compared with Coinbase’s “Recurring Buys” offering.
The problem? Coinbase Pro does not offer recurring buys! They <em>do,</em> however, offer an API that we can use to initiate recurring buys on our own.</p>
<h2>Enter Rust</h2>
<p>Call me paranoid, but I am not about to put API keys that can access my personal Coinbase account on servers that I don’t physically control. This means running servers at home, which means electricity costs and heat.</p>
<p>The electricity and heat problems associated with running servers at home can be mitigated by using hardware like a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> — a credit-card sized computer that draws around 5W of power, and doesn’t put out enough heat to even require fans. The downsides include limited processing power, and downright atrocious disk IO (if using the built-in SD card reader).</p>
<p>The Pi’s performance limitations mean that I want software running on it to be small and fast.
Furthermore, because I’m dealing with money and network-based APIs, it’s also important that the software I’m using is <em>correct.</em></p>
<p>The Rust Programming Language checks all of these boxes — with performance on par with C and C++, and a compiler that requires you to account for failure cases and not just happy paths, it becomes difficult to write incorrect code.
Furthermore, Rust makes it easy to compile to multiple targets, which means getting it onto an ARM processor (the Pi) is not a significant undertaking.</p>
<p>In fact, thanks to Github’s new pricing strategy around Github Actions (free!), we can just let Github compile all the binaries for us! 😁</p>
<h2>The Strategy</h2>
<p>Instead of relying on Coinbase to purchase BTC for us, we’ll write a Rust program to do it instead.
Nothing fancy needed here — no price watching or machine learning to optimize purchase times, just a Rust binary that starts instantly, makes a transaction, logs the output, and exits. Stick it on the crontab and call it good!</p>
<p>The program I ended up with, <a href="https://github.com/ajpierce/hodl/">hodl</a>, has been running faithfully for the past two months! It’s my first Rust program, so please be kind and help me learn 😊.</p>
<p>Since I began “stacking sats” this way, I’ve only run into one issue: after losing power in a storm, we came back online with a new IP address, and the new address was not yet associated with my API key, so <code>hodl</code> failed to make a couple purchases (this is a security feature that you can elect to disable).
I noticed something was afoot after I stopped receiving my nightly confirmation emails, so I logged onto the Pi, checked the logs, saw the issue, added the new IP address, and we were back in business.</p>
<h2>Setting it up</h2>
<p>Everyone is going to have different API keys, and I’m not about to check mine into the repository :)
In order to use hodl, you need to set some environment variables.</p>
<p>My recommendation would be to create a script, <code>hodl</code>, that sets these and invokes <a href="https://github.com/ajpierce/hodl/releases">the hodl binary you download</a>:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>export</span> <span>COINBASE_API_KEY</span><span>=</span><span>[</span>your key<span>]</span>
<span>export</span> <span>COINBASE_API_SECRET</span><span>=</span><span>[</span>your secret<span>]</span>
<span>export</span> <span>COINBASE_API_PASSPHRASE</span><span>=</span><span>[</span>your passphrase<span>]</span>
<span>export</span> <span>BANK_ID</span><span>=</span><span>[</span>id of your associated bank account<span>]</span>

./hodl-ARMv7 <span>$@</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then, you can set your crontab to run periodic deposit and buy commands. For example,</p>
<div data-language="cron"><pre><code># m h  dom mon dow   command
0   0   */3  *   *   /home/pi/hodl deposit 45 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee -a /home/pi/logs/hodl.log
7   0   *    *   *   /home/pi/hodl buy BTC 10 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee -a /home/pi/logs/hodl.log
8   0   *    *   *   /home/pi/hodl buy ETH 5 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee -a /home/pi/logs/hodl.log</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Et voila,</em> cryptocurrency dollar cost averaging at a fraction of the retail cost!</p>
<p>The crontab above will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deposit $45 USD into Coinbase every 3 days (every 72 hours)</li>
<li>Buy $10 USD worth of BTC every day at 7 minutes past midnight</li>
<li>Buy $5 USD worth of ETH every day at 8 minutes past midnight</li>
<li>Send both standard error and standard output to a log file</li>
</ol>
<p>The times I picked were arbitrary; some time spent with historical data and in a Jupyter notebook revealed that there wasn’t a reliable correlation with time of day and low (relative to a sliding window) prices, so pick a time that’s convenient for you!</p>
<h2>Thoughts on Rust</h2>
<p>Overall, I’ve walked away with a positive impression of Rust.
I especially like the <code>match</code> structure, though it took me a while to get comfortable with the difference between <code>Option</code> and <code>Result</code> types.
Figuring out how to cryptographically sign API request headers to accommodate the Coinbase Pro API was a fun challenge that forced me to get into the docs of other Crates, and (coming from the dynamically typed world of JavaScript and Clojure) suffer a bit of pain for the type system, though I am grateful that it keeps me honest.
I also like the stance Rust takes towards data organization with Structs, which I feel are a much better alternative to the OO purgatory I found myself in back when worked in Java. When it comes to data, though, I still feel like Clojure has it figured out the best.</p>
<p>For this job, Rust was excellent, and I believe in picking the right tool for the job.
Not that other tools wouldn’t have done the job just as nicely, but I was looking for an excuse to learn something, and this solved a real problem that is making me more money as a result.
Just in time, too: since I started using <code>hodl</code> instead of Coinbase, the price of BTC has gone up over 30%!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you’re in the market for some Cryptocurrencies, why not check out <a href="https://github.com/ajpierce/hodl">hodl</a>, or use it as a starting point for trading against some other API if Coinbase Pro is not your preferred exchange?
If you’re a Rust pro, I’d love your feedback on how to improve the program.
And I’d like <em>everyone</em> to start buying Bitcoin — if you haven’t already, <a href="https://decrypt.co/37922/1-million-bitcoin-wallets-are-now-being-used-every-day?s=08">now is the time</a> to hop on the bandwagon!</p></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
<div>
<article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

<div itemprop="articleBody">
<h2 id="environment-variables-for-single-page-apps-spas">Environment Variables for Single Page Apps (SPAs)</h2>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>Have you ever built a SPA, and found yourself frustrated at having to build specifically for the target environment?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“oh dang, this container won’t run in staging because it has localhost:1337 for the back-end API endpoint, whut do?!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously you don’t want to pass secrets, but having to build a container per environment for config items is a PITA.</p>
<p>Fear not, answer below.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> In the container entrypoint, use <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/envsubst" target="_blank" rel="noopener">envsubst</a> to push env vars into a template file and serve as a JS file.</p>
<h2 id="environment-variables-env-vars">Environment variables (env vars)</h2>
<p>Environment variables are variables which are present in the current environment, duh. For example a container, or a Linux/Windows server, or your local machine.</p>
<p>Once set, they can be read by a program running in that environment. In Go you can do <code>myEnvVar = os.Getenv("MY_ENV_VAR")</code> to read the MY_ENV_VAR env var into a variable in your program.</p>
<p>Docker Compose provides a nice way to pass these from the yaml files which define services:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>my-service:
    environment:
        - MY_ENV_VAR=a-string-value-m9
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>When the compose file is used to run the services (containers) it defines, the variable <code>myEnvVar</code> in the Go example would be set to “a-string-value-m9”.</p>
<p>This is really useful, as now the same code can be run, but have things like URLs, DB host names etc. passed in to suit the environment.</p>
<h2 id="when-are-you-going-to-talk-about-spas-though">When are you going to talk about SPAs though?</h2>
<p>I know that the above is most likely familiar, but it gets a bit tricker when you try reading env vars in a statically compiled web app. This is where the docker + envsubst magic comes in.</p>
<p>As a container starts up, a command is run - normally in this context, to run a webserver like Nginx - to serve the static content. At this point we use envsubst to read our template file, squirt in the env vars, and then call the oringinal entry point command - start ya webserver.</p>
<h2 id="show-me-what-you-mean">Show me what you mean…</h2>
<p>From the Dockerfile:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>CMD ["sh", "-c", "envsubst &lt; /usr/share/nginx/env-config.template.js &gt; /usr/share/nginx/html/env-config.js &amp;&amp; nginx -g 'daemon off;'"]
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Our config template is read from a non-web-accessible directory above the web root (keep things clean), has the env vars injected by envsubst (<code>envsubst &lt; /usr/share/nginx/env-config.template.js</code>), and the result is output (<code>&gt; /usr/share/nginx/html/env-config.js</code>) into the web root of the static web app.</p>
<p>^^^ that, is the magic!</p>
<h2 id="the-web-bit">The web bit</h2>
<p>The template file I use looks like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>window.myexampleapp = {
	env: {
		API_URL: "$API_URL",
	},
};
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This is simply chucking us a configuration object onto window.</p>
<p>As long as we include env-config.js in our html <code>&lt;script src="/env-config.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> before our application JS, we can be sure that our env vars will be available for use.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>this.apiUrl = window.myexampleapp.env.API_URL
			? window.myexampleapp.env.API_URL
			: "http://localhost:1337";
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Read the values in our application as above.</p>
<h2 id="let-us-recap">Let us recap</h2>
<p>So far we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>set the env var (in the docker-compose file, or in a docker run command)</li>
<li>modified container entrypoint to spin up our container with envsubst + run our webserver start command</li>
<li>dropped a file in our container webroot with the env vars injected and added to window</li>
<li>added that file to our html via a script tag</li>
<li>read the env vars from window in our JS</li>
</ul>
<p>Hey presto - your container will now ingest those juicy env vars, and make them accessible to your static front-end application!</p>
<p>One of the huge benefits here is that a single container can be re-used across all environments - giving a higher level of confidence that any testing done has been on that specific piece of built code. Oh, and saving on the number of env specific containers, allowing for easier caching of images for deployments etc.</p>
<p>It also makes for riveting pub chat with your non-technical buddies.</p>
<h2 id="gimme-a-full-example-then-pal">Gimme a full example then pal</h2>
<p>It’ll be up on GitHub soon!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading - technical and other feedback very welcome, hope this is as helpful for you as it has been for me!</p>

<a name="sec:LArCal">&nbsp;</a>For the electromagnetic calorimeter in ATLAS is chosen a liquid argon
sampling calorimeter. Layers of lead/stainless steel and liquid argon
are interspaced.  The lead gives the shower development with its short
radiation length and the secondary electrons create ionisation in the
narrow gaps of liquid argon. An inductive signal from the ionisation
electrons drifting in the electric field across the gas-gap is
registered by copper electrodes.

To achieve a low capacitance of the detecting elements and thereby a
fast signal the lead plates have an accordion shape as shown in
fig. <a href="https://www.hep.lu.se/atlas/thesis/egede/thesis-node43.html#fig:Accordion">4.5</a>. At the same time this creates a fully homogeneous
calorimeter in the  <img width="13" height="24" src="https://www.hep.lu.se/atlas/thesis/egede/thesis-img37.gif" alt="$\varphi$">  coordinate. In the central rapidity
region there are four samplings:

In the end-cap there is less material in front of the calorimeter and
the presampler can be avoided. The end-cap EM calorimeters start at
 |<img width="11" height="24" src="https://www.hep.lu.se/atlas/thesis/egede/thesis-img48.gif" alt="$\eta$">| = 1.5  and continue down to  |<img width="11" height="24" src="https://www.hep.lu.se/atlas/thesis/egede/thesis-img48.gif" alt="$\eta$">| = 3.2  but with an increased
cell size above  |<img width="11" height="24" src="https://www.hep.lu.se/atlas/thesis/egede/thesis-img48.gif" alt="$\eta$">| = 2.5 . There is a crack with bad energy
resolution where the end-cap and barrel calorimeters meet. A large
effort has gone into reducing the size of the crack while still
leaving space for cables and cooling for the Inner Detector.

The resolution of the EM calorimeter is

with energies measured in GeV. The sampling term  <i>a</i>  is defined by the
number of lead/argon interfaces and is 8-11% depending on rapidity.
Noise influences the resolution at the lowest energies through the
term  <i>b</i>  which is of the order 400 MeV when running at high
luminosity. The constant term affects the resolution for high energy
clusters and is limited by the calibration of the global energy scale
and local variations in this. It is hard to predict but is believed to
stay below 0.7%<a name="tex2html40" href="https://www.hep.lu.se/atlas/thesis/egede/thesis-footnode.html#1927"><sup><img alt="[*]" src="https://www.hep.lu.se/atlas/thesis/egede/foot_motif.gif"></sup></a>.

To withstand the high radiation levels in the forward region the
hadronic calorimeter is also of liquid argon type in the end-caps. The
design is simpler than the EM calorimeter and has parallel copper
plates as absorbers placed perpendicular to the beam.

The very forward hadronic calorimeter with a coverage down to
 |<img width="11" height="24" src="https://www.hep.lu.se/atlas/thesis/egede/thesis-img48.gif" alt="$\eta$">| = 4.9  is made of copper/tungsten. The choice of copper/tungsten
is necessary to limit the width and depth of the showers from high
energy jets close to the beam pipe, and to keep the background level
low in the surrounding calorimeters from particles spraying out from
the forward region. The calorimeter is a metal matrix with cylindrical
holes. The holes have rods inside with a slightly smaller radius
allowing for a liquid argon gap of just 250  <img width="12" height="24" src="https://www.hep.lu.se/atlas/thesis/egede/thesis-img13.gif" alt="$\mu$"> m. The small gap
limits the sensitivity to pile-up effects which are large close to the
beam pipe where energetic jets often hit the same area of the
calorimeter.

                	<h2>The Halifax Gibbet</h2>
                    <p><img src="https://www.guillotine.dk/images/gibbetold.jpg" alt="The Halifax Gibbet shown in an old drawing "></p>                	
               		<p>The 'privilege' (right) of a gibbet is believed to have been vested in Halifax around the time of the Norman Conquest in 1066, although the earliest reference to it dates from 1280. At that time, there were said to be one hundred other places in Yorkshire that similarly enjoyed this distinctive honour. In the case of Halifax, however, its notoriety stemmed from the fact that the custom of the Gibbet Law continued long after it had been abandoned elsewhere.</p>
         
          			<p>The Laws of Halifax were administered from the Moot Hall (demolished 1957) which stood on a site near the Parish Church in Nelson Street. It was from here that the Lords of the Manor held their court and imposed fines and punishment for a wide variety of offences. Early records show that John de Warren, Earl of Surrey, held court here in 1286. In the same year, the Earls of Warren were granted by the Crown the 'Royalty' to execute thieves and other criminals, from which the Halifax Gibbet Law developed. It was in that first year that John of Dalton was decapitated, the first known victim of the Halifax Gibbet, although formal records of victims did not begin until 1541.<br>
</p>
        			<p>Up to the arrival of the Tudor dynasty in the late fifteenth century, Halifax was little more than a hamlet consisting of some fifteen cottages. However, its strategic position and abundance of clear spring water, made it an ideal location for the fast developing cloth trade. By 1556 the hamlet had grown to more than 500 households, all thanks to cloth manufacture. At that time, the newly manufactured cloth was delivered weekly to the town where it was washed and stretched out on wooden tenterframes and left to dry in the open air. Considering the size of the Halifax trade, the surrounding hillsides would have been covered by row upon row of these frames, leaving exposed and vulnerable the valuable pieces of cloth. And with the cloth reaching high prices, delivery of the bolts became a more and more dangerous occupation. Alarmed at the increase in thefts and at the number that went unpunished, local traders were fearful that the unchecked crime wave could lead to economic damage.<br>
        </p>
        			<p>Evidence of the arrival of the gibbet is recorded in Thomas Deloney's "Thomas, of Reading", a romantic and racy ballad in which 'Hodgskins, of Halifax, and his fellow clothiers are represented as having obtained the valuable privilege of the gibbet from the Crown, for the purpose of punishing those who filched their cloth from the tenters.' Local legend goes onto tell of how the good gentlemen of Halifax found it impossible to take on the role of hangman, but that eventually 'a "feat friar" came to the rescue of the tender consciences of the townsfolk, by the timely invention of a "gin" [engine] which was capable of cutting off the heads of "valiant rogues" without the direct intervention of human hands.'<br>
        </p>
        			<p>By today's standards, the use of the gibbet was harsh, often being deployed for the punishment of both minor and major offences. Local Gibbet Law dictated that 'If a felon be taken within the liberty of Halifax...either hand-habend (caught with the stolen goods in his hand or in the act of stealing), back-berand (caught carrying stolen goods on his back), or confessand (having confessed to the crime), to the value of thirteen pence half-penny, he shall after three markets...be taken to the Gibbet and there have his head cut off from his body'. While the sum may sound paltry by today's standards, English Common Law at that time permitted the death penalty for thefts to the value of twelve pence and above.<br>
        </p>
        			<p>When a thief was caught, he was placed in the custody of the Lord of the Manor's Bailiff. The Bailiff was an important official in that he kept the gaol, the gibbet-axe, and occasionally acted as executioner. Four constables of the Township then met to assess the value of the contraband. If the consensus was that it exceeded the minimum threshold, the Bailiff summoned a jury of sixteen men, usually selected from those who the manor held to be the 'most wealthy and best reputed for honesty and understanding.' Jurors were not put on oath, although their duties hardly required it as they were far from onerous. Their primary responsibility was to identify the goods and confirm its value, and ascertain the means by which the thief (hand-habend, back-berand or confessand). At this point the thief was confronted by the evidence. If he was then acquitted, he was set free after having paid the court fees; if he was condemned, arrangements were made for the execution. Markets occurred on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays: the main market was held on Saturday. These were busy affairs and the spectacle of a decapitation - all beheadings took place at the Saturday market - added to the numbers attending.<br>
        </p>
        			<p>After conviction, the felon's fate depended on which day of the week he had been tried. If it took place on a Saturday, he was immediately led to the market place and beheaded. If it was a Monday, he would be kept for three market-days and then beheaded at the next Saturday market. During the intervening days, the prisoner was placed back in the care of the Manor Bailiff and held in gaol. Each day he was taken out and placed in the stocks as a public display of justice being served and as a deterrent to others, often with the contraband placed around him: the stolen cloth would be draped around his shoulders, while stolen animals would be tethered about him.<br>
        </p>
        			<p>A curious note on the act of beheading is recorded by the Halifax historian Wright, in which he tells of a country woman on horseback who passed the gibbet while an execution was taking place. At her sides were large wicker baskets, and when the head of the victim was dispatched, the force of the descending axe caused it to bounce a considerable distance "into one of the hampers, or, as others say, seized her apron with its teeth, and there stuck for some time."<br>
        </p>
        			<p>A considerably longer description of a decapitation was recorded in Daniel Defoe's account of Halifax in his work "A Tour through the whole Island of Great Britain" (1724-1727). In it he says that 'I must not quit Halifax till I give you some account of the famous course of justice anciently executed here, to prevent the stealing of cloth. Modern accounts pretend to say it was for all sorts of felonies, but I am well assured it was first erected purely, or at least principally, for such thieves as were apprehended stealing cloth from the tenters; and it seems very reasonable to think it was so, because of the conditions of the trial.'<br>
        </p>
        			<p>The case to which he alludes was 'the erecting of the woollen manufacture here was about the year 1485 when King Henry VII, by giving encouragement to foreigners to settle in England, and to set up woollen manufactures, caused an Act to pass prohibiting the exportation of wool into foreign parts unwrought, and to encourage foreigners to come and settle here. Of these, several coming over settled the manufactures of various kinds of cloth in different parts of the kingdom, as they found the people tractable and as the country best suited them; as, for instance, the cloth named bays at Colchester; the says at Sudbury; the broadcloth in Wilts and other counties, and the trade of kersies and narrow cloth at this place [Halifax] and other adjacent towns.<br>
        </p>
        			<p>When this trade began to settle nothing was more frequent than for young workmen to leave their cloths out all night upon the tenters; and the idle fellows would come in upon them, and tearing it off without notice, steal the cloth. Now, as it was absolutely necessary to preserve the trade in its infancy, this severe law was made, giving the power of life and death so far into the hands of the magistrates of Halifax, as to see the law executed upon them. But the power was not given unless in one of these three plain cases, namely, hand-having, back-bearing, or tongue-confessing.<br>
        </p>
        			<p>This being the case, if the criminal was taken he was brought before the magistrate of the town, and those who were to judge and sentence and execute the offender, or to clear him, within so many days. Then there were frithborghs (or jurors) also to judge of the fact, who were to be good and sober men, and by the magistrates of the town to be approved as such. If these acquitted him he was immediately discharged; if those censured (convicted) him nobody could reprieve him but the town. The manner of execution was very remarkable; the engine, indeed, is carried away, but the scaffold on which it stood is there to this time (1727), and may continue for many ages, being not a frame of wood but a square building of stone, with stone steps to go up, and the engine itself was made in the following manner.<br>
        </p>
        			<p>The execution was performed by means of an engine called a gibbet, which was raised upon a platform four feet high and thirteen feet square, faced on every side with stone, and ascended by a flight of steps. In the middle of this platform were placed two upright pieces of timber, fifteen feet high, joined at the top by a transverse beam. Within these was a square block of wood four and a half feet long, which moved up and down by<br>
          means of grooves made for that purpose; and to the lower part of this sliding block was fastened a sharp iron axe of the weight of seven pounds twelve ounces.<br>
        </p>
        			<p>The axe thus fixed was drawn up to the top of the grooves by a cord and pulley. At the end of the cord was a pin, which, being fixed to the block, kept it suspended till the moment of execution, when the culprit, having placed his head on the block, the pin was withdrawn, the axe fell suddenly and violently on the …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>A wise man once told me that inexperienced engineers tend to undervalue simplicity. Since I’m not wise myself, I don’t know whether this is true, but the ideas which show up in many different contexts do seem to be very simple. This post is about two of the most widely used ideas in deep learning, the mean squared error loss and the cross entropy loss, and how in a certain sense they’re the simplest possible approaches.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the mean squared error, which is used when you want to predict a continuous value. If the model’s prediction was <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/1d97c6cd2a.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/1d97c6cd2a-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/1d97c6cd2a.png" alt="x"> and the correct answer was <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/846baa2e2f.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/846baa2e2f-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/846baa2e2f.png" alt="y">,</nobr> then the mean squared error is defined as:</p>
 <p><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/47c0aa68b9.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/47c0aa68b9-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/47c0aa68b9.png" alt="\text{MSE}(x, y) = \frac{1}{2} (x - y)^2"></p><p>We can observe some basic facts about the mean squared error. It’s differentiable, so we can find its derivative with respect to <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/1d97c6cd2a.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/1d97c6cd2a-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/1d97c6cd2a.png" alt="x">,</nobr> which lets us optimize the model parameters to minimize <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/8a02df084f.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/8a02df084f-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/8a02df084f.png" alt="\text{MSE}(x, y)"> using backpropagation. And it’s zero if and only if <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/199cbc9cce.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/199cbc9cce-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/199cbc9cce.png" alt="x = y">,</nobr> so a model which successfully minimizes it has learned to produce the correct answer.</p>
<p>But these facts don’t fully explain why people use mean squared error, since there are many other functions which also satisfy both properties. For example, <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6908b03ba2.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/6908b03ba2-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6908b03ba2.png" alt="(x - y)^4"> and <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/927373fddc.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/927373fddc-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/927373fddc.png" alt="\sin^2(x-y)"> <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/624083313a.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/624083313a-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/624083313a.png" alt="+"> <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/646129c21d.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/646129c21d-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/646129c21d.png" alt="\sin^2(\pi(x-y))">.</nobr></p>
<p>Instead, we should look at the derivative, which is beautifully simple:</p>
 <p><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/c6b793041d.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/c6b793041d-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/c6b793041d.png" alt="\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x} \text{MSE}(x, y) = x - y"></p><p>Neither of the alternative functions mentioned above has such a simple derivative. The only function that comes close is <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/0ae56029b3.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/0ae56029b3-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/0ae56029b3.png" alt="|x-y|">,</nobr> whose derivative is <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/d1847c4750.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/d1847c4750-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/d1847c4750.png" alt="\text{sgn}(x-y)">,</nobr> but most people would agree that a linear function is simpler than <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/e42367d617.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/e42367d617-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/e42367d617.png" alt="\text{sgn}">,</nobr> which is nonlinear.</p>
<p>So, in plain English, the mean squared error is the loss function you get if you decide that your error signal should be equal to the difference between the output you wanted and the output your model gave. This explains why we should use it: why use anything more complicated if it’s not necessary?</p>
<h2 id="the-cross-entropy">The cross entropy</h2>
<p>It turns out that a very similar argument can be used to justify the cross entropy loss. I tried to search for this argument and couldn’t find it anywhere, although it’s straightforward enough that it’s unlikely to be original.</p>
<p>The cross entropy is used when you want to predict a discrete value. To define it, we’ll need to change our framework to make the model output a probability distribution <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/d84c14e225.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/d84c14e225-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/d84c14e225.png" alt="q"> instead of a scalar.

<h2>Warm up</h2>

<p>Just like Scheme... at first.</p>
<p>
(+ 2 1)
(define inc (lambda (x) (+ x 1)))
(inc 2)
((lambda (x) (+ x 1)) 2)
(map inc '(1 2 3))
(map (lambda (x) (+ x 1)) '(1 2 3))
</p>

<p>Error loads new meta level.</p>
<p>
(incr 2)
</p>
<p>Notice the prompt change, from <code>0-7</code> to <code>1-0</code>.
The first number is the meta level, i.e. the <i>n</i> in meta<i><sup>n</sup></i> level. The second number is just the iteration counter at this level.</p>

<p>Two ways to go back down.</p>

<p>(1) call <code>old-cont</code>.</p>
<p>
(old-cont (lambda (x) (+ x 1)))
</p>
<p>(2) use <code>(base-eval <i>exp</i> <i>env</i> <i>cont</i>)</code>.</p>
<p>
(base-eval 1 '() (lambda (v) v))
incr ;; typo again
(base-eval 'inc old-env (lambda (v) v))
incr ;; typo again
(base-eval 'inc old-env old-cont)
</p>

<p>Notice we needed to quote <code>inc</code> at the meta-level. Why?
Let's jump back to the meta<sup>1</sup> level and see.
We can jump levels normally with <code>exit</code>, no need to fake errors.</p>
<p>
(exit 'hello)

;; inc is not defined
inc
</p>

<p>Oh, we loaded meta<sup>2</sup> now! Let's go back to 0:</p>
<p>
(old-cont 1)
(old-cont 'back-to-user-level)
</p>

<p>To recap, a variable is local to a level:</p>
<p>
(exit 'hello)
(define foo 1)
(old-cont foo)
;; foo is unbound at level 0
foo
;; but at level 1, it is defined
foo
;; going back again
(old-cont foo)
</p>

<p>Can we access some meta level without pushing away (or popping? which way does it go?) without leaving the level? Yes, with <code>EM</code>.</p>
<p>
(EM foo)
(EM (define bar 2))
(EM bar)
bar ;; not bound

(EM (EM 1))
(EM (EM foo))
;; oops, we just loaded level 3
(old-cont 1)
</p>
<p>Interesting, we got straight back to 0 from 3, some jumping indeed!</p>

<h2>The Mystery of Meta-Continuations Revealed</h2>

<p>Each level in the tower has its own environment and continuation.</p>

<h3>Bouncing Up and Down</h3>

<p>First, we redefine evaluation of variable (by mutating the meta
level) so that when the variable name is <code>_dummy</code> we do
something special: we call the continuation first with <code>1</code>, then <code>2</code>, then <code>3</code>.</p>
<p>
(EM (begin
(define old-eval-var eval-var)
(set! eval-var (lambda (e r k)
(if (eq? '_dummy e) (begin (k 1) (k 2) (k 3))
(old-eval-var e r k))))
))
</p>

<p>What happens when we evaluate <code>_dummy</code>?</p>
<p>
_dummy
</p>

<p>OK, so it seems that it just jumps out at the first <code>1</code>? Not so fast:</p>
<p>
_dummy     ;; 1
(exit 'up) ;; 2
(exit 'up) ;; 3
(exit 'up) ;; up (meta level)
</p>

<h3>Being Pushy... Bug or Feature?</h3>

<p>
(define where_am_i 'user)
(EM (define where_am_i 'meta))
(EM (let ((old-eval-var eval-var)
          (__k (lambda (x) x)))
      (set! eval-var (lambda (e r k)
                       (if (eq? e '__k) (k __k)
                           (begin
	                           (if (eq? e '_) (set! __k k) '())
                               (old-eval-var e r k)))))))
(define _ 0)
(+ _ 1)
where_am_i            ;; user
(EM where_am_i)       ;; meta
(__k 2)
where_am_i            ;; user
(EM where_am_i)       ;; user (!!!)
(EM (EM where_am_i))  ;; meta
(__k 2)               ;; unbound variable __k
</p>

<h3>There and Back Again</h3>

<p>There is a cute trick by Danvy et al.
(<a href="http://www.brics.dk/RS/02/12/BRICS-RS-02-12.pdf">ICFP</a>,
 <a href="http://brics.dk/RS/05/3/BRICS-RS-05-3.pdf">extended journal version</a>) to construct <code>(cnv xs ys) = (zip xs (reverse ys))</code> in <code>n</code> recursive calls and no auxiliary data list, where <code>xs</code> and <code>ys</code> are lists of size <code>n</code>.</p>

<p>It's fun to think about it, so let's not give it away. Suffice to
say that it's helpful to visualize the stack.</p>
<p>
(EM (load "examples/utils.blk"))
(EM (load "examples/taba.blk"))
(load "examples/cnv.scm")
(taba (cnv3 walk) (cnv3 '(1 2 3) '(a b c)))

(load "examples/pal.scm")
(taba (pal_c walk) (pal_c '(1 2 2 1)))
</p>

<p>
(EM (load "examples/utils.blk"))
(EM (load "examples/stack.scm"))
(EM (load "examples/taba3.blk"))
(load "examples/cnv.scm")
(taba (cnv3 walk) (cnv3 '(1 2 3) '(a b c)))

(load "examples/pal.scm")
(taba (pal_c walk) (pal_c '(1 2 2 1)))
</p>

    <!--INTRO START-->
    <p>Tor is a fantastic networking and privacy technology that makes private and anonymous browsing available to millions. Despite this, it is unfortunately seen by some people as a system that solely exists to facilitate an illegal criminal underground, </p>
    <p>However, to take a literal view, <i>Tor is just a networking tool</i>, and it can be used in any way that you want. The features that enable privacy and anonymity are also extremely useful for many of the tasks carried out by Network Engineers and Systems Administrators on a daily basis. For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#testing-ip-address-based-access-rules">Testing IP address based access rules</a></li>
        <li><a href="#testing-internally-hosted-services-from-an-external-perspective">Testing internally-hosted services from an external perspective</a></li>

    </ul>
    <p>In this article, I will demonstrate how Tor can be used to carry out some of these tasks, and why using Tor may be advantageous to other methods.</p>

            <h3><u>Warning:</u></h3>
        </p>
        <div>
            <p>The techniques described within this article should only be used in environments where you are permitted to do so.</p>
            <p>Please ensure that you comply with all local policies regarding the usage of Tor, including from your employer, customer/client, or other relevant entities.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2 id="testing-ip-address-based-access-rules">Testing IP Address Based Access Rules</h2>
    <p>In some network environments, IP address based access rules are used to either restrict or allow access to a service, or are used as a decision factor in a conditional access policy. For example, a common use-case is removing the requirement for two-factor authentication upon login if you are connecting from a trusted IP address, or requiring additional verification steps when connecting for the first time from a new location.</p>
    <p>However, it is usually quite difficult to fully test such policies without access to multiple unique devices and/or VPNs.</p>
    <p>Using Tor and the Tor Browser, you can test your access rules from multiple arbitrary external IP addresses. You can also very easily reset your browser profile or establish a new Tor circuit at any time, allowing you to very easily create a new 'identity' for testing, without the risk of previous tests impacting the results.</p>
    <p>If you want to test something that isn't a web-based service, you can use the <code>torsocks</code> wrapper to force the network connections of any program to be routed over Tor. For example, to test an IP address based SSH access rule, you could route an SSH connection over Tor to make it originate from a new/unknown IP address:</p>
    <pre>$ torsocks ssh <span>jamieweb.net</span></pre>
    <p>Unfortunately <code>torsocks</code> cannot be used with setuid programs such as <code>ping</code>, nor can it be used with programs that exclusively use UDP.</p>

    <h2 id="testing-internally-hosted-services-from-an-external-perspective">Testing Internally-Hosted Services From an External Perspective</h2>
    <p>If you are hosting certain network services internally/on-site, e.g. web servers or mail servers, it can often be a challenge to properly test these from an external/public-facing perspective.</p>
    <p>It's very important that this testing is carried out, as network services will often have differing configurations or policies depending on where you are connecting from. The lack of an easy way to perform this testing internally often leads to crude solutions involving personal devices or mobile data tethering, which are neither convenient or reliable.</p>
    <p>However, similarly to how IP address based access rules can be tested with Tor, you can also use Tor to access your internally-hosted services from an external perspective. This will allow you to carry out all required testing from your standard device.</p>
    <p>For example, you can use <code>torsocks</code> with cURL:</p>
    <pre>$ torsocks curl <span>https://www.jamieweb.net</span></pre>
    <p>Alternatively, if you don't want to use the <code>torsocks</code> wrapper, you can point cURL to the local SOCKS5 proxy directly, which runs on <code>127.0.0.1:9050</code>:</p>
    <pre>$ curl --socks5-hostname 127.0.0.1:9050 <span>https://www.jamieweb.net</span></pre>

    <h2 id="making-reliable-external-dns-lookups-when-operating-in-a-split-horizon-dns-environment">Making Reliable External DNS Lookups When Operating in a Split-Horizon DNS Environment</h2>
    <p>Most corporate networks operate a 'split-horizon' or 'split-brain' DNS setup, which is where a separate internally-hosted DNS server and associated zone is used to serve DNS requests that originate internally. The internal DNS server will often respond with 'internal' addresses, i.e. private or RFC1918 addresses, rather than 'external' public-facing addresses.</p>
    <p>This is usually used in combination with a configured search domain or DNS scope, in order to allow internal services to be accessed via their direct hostname, without requiring the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN).</p>
    <p>However, these split-horizon DNS setups can often pose a problem when you explicitly need a request to go to an external DNS server. Some networks will forcefully route <i>all</i> DNS traffic to the internal DNS server, and others will even intercept and rewrite DNS responses at the network edge, e.g. using the DNS doctoring or DNS NAT rewriting features that are present in many commercial edge firewall products.</p>
    <p>You can usually get around these issues by forcing your external DNS lookups to take place over TCP, i.e. using the <code>+tcp</code> option in DiG (also known as 'virtual circuit' mode), but this isn't always supported or available.</p>
    <p>By routing your external DNS lookup over Tor, you can know for certain that the response hasn't been tampered with during the 'last mile' as it passes through your network edge:</p>
    <pre>$ torsocks dig +tcp @1.1.1.1 <span>jamieweb.net</span></pre>
    <p>You'll need to use <code>+tcp</code> mode, as well as ensure that the request will be routed directly to the external DNS server, and not through a local caching resolver such as <code>dnsmasq</code>. This is because the Tor daemon will block requests to access local addresses such as <code>127.0.0.1</code>. If you do accidentally attempt to access a local address, Tor will display the following error:</p>
    <pre>WARNING torsocks[]: [connect] Connection to a local address are denied since it might be a TCP DNS query to a local DNS server. Rejecting it for safety reasons. (in tsocks_connect() at connect.c:192)</pre>

    <h2 id="bypassing-blocked-outbound-ports">Bypassing Blocked Outbound Ports</h2>
    <p>In many corporate network environments, permitted outbound ports are limited in order to help ensure that all outbound traffic is tightly controlled, e.g. for the purposes of Data Loss Prevention (DLP).</p>
    <p>However, for people in technical roles, this can pose quite a challenge, as various legitimate services will inadvertently be blocked too, and exceptions can be difficult to implement on a per-user basis.</p>
    <p>A common one that is often overlooked is the WHOIS protocol, which operates on TCP port 43.</p>
    <p>Using the <code>torsocks</code> wrapper, you can route these requests through Tor in order to get around the blocked outbound port:</p>
    <pre>$ torsocks whois jamieweb.net</pre>
    <p>In some cases, firewalls performing Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) can also prevent certain connections to otherwise allowed ports. For example, a sysadmin using <code>openssl s_client</code> to retrieve a certificate from a web server may have their request blocked, as they aren't establishing a full HTTPS connection.</p>
    <p>However, by routing the request through Tor, the connection can be made successfully:</p>
    <pre>$ torsocks openssl s_client -connect jamieweb.net:443</pre>

    <h2 id="exposing-services-when-behind-nat-or-cgnat">Exposing Services When Behind NAT or CGNAT</h2>
    <p>There may be cases where you need to expose a locally running service to the internet, e.g. SSH or a web server. Unfortunately, this is often non-trivial due to NAT, and especially CGNAT (carrier-grade NAT).</p>
    <p>One particular use case that I've worked on is accessing a 4G-connected device remotely using SSH. Because the majority of consumer data plans operate using CGNAT, you cannot just bind the service to your perceived public address and have it work, as there will potentially be hundreds of other customers sharing that same IP address. Multiple layers of NAT are often used too, which of course complicates things.</p>
    <p>However, you can use Tor to expose your service via a Hidden Service, also known as a <code>.onion</code> site. This way, your service will be easily accessible over Tor no matter how many layers of NAT or filtering you are behind.</p>
    <p>This can be achieved by adding a few lines to your <code>/etc/tor/torrc</code> configuration file:</p>
    <pre>HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/<span>my_service</span>
HiddenServicePort <span>22 127.0.0.1:22</span></pre>
    <p>The <code>HiddenServiceDir</code> configuration specifies where your Hidden Service public/private keys will be stored. This should be an arbitrary directory in <code>/var/lib/tor/</code>. You should not create this yourself, as the Tor daemon will create it for you using the correct permissions.</p>
    <p>The <code>HiddenServicePort</code> option is used to specify where incoming requests to a specific port will be forwarded to. In this case, requests to the Hidden Service on port <code>22</code> will be forwarded verbatim to <code>127.0.0.1:22</code>.</p>
    <p>You can also optionally configure your Hidden Service in single-hop mode, which will allow it to connect to the Tor network using a single hop, rather than the usual three, potentially improving performance. <b>This will completely de-anonymise your Hidden Service, so <u>DO NOT</u> use single-hop mode if your own anonymity is important.</b> In most legitimate sysadmin use cases, single-hop mode is perfectly safe and acceptable.</p>
    <p>You can enable single-hop mode by adding the following to your Hidden Service configuration:</p>
    <pre>HiddenServiceNonAnonymousMode 1
HiddenServiceSingleHopMode 1</pre>
    <p>However, running in single-hop mode will prevent your Tor daemon being used as a client, as your connection to the Tor network is not anonymised. If a SOCKS port is configured in your <code>torrc</code> file, you'll also need to disable this:</p>
    <pre>SocksPort 0</pre>
    <p>Once you've finalised your Hidden Service configuration, save the <code>torrc</code> file and restart the Tor daemon:</p>
    <pre>sudo service tor restart</pre>
    <p>You can now view the <code>/var/lib/tor/my_service/hostname</code> file in order to identify the <code>.onion</code> address for your Hidden Service. This can be used from any other …</p></div></div>

<br/>
August 8, 2020 | https://blog.repl.it/codingai | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.repl.it/codingai">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>In the past decade, we've seen an explosion of innovation in AI and machine learning. However, coding itself was barely touched by AI. The most significant example of AI-powered coding tools is editor autocomplete extensions like Kite or Tabnine. </p>
<p>At Repl.it, we believe this is about to change. With the advent of natural language models like <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT</a>, for the first time, we're seeing an ML model that performs shockingly well on all sorts of language-related tasks including coding.</p>
<p>I was first introduced to and excited by the applications of natural language models in coding when I read the 2012 paper <a href="https://amasad.me/public/natural.pdf">"On the Naturalness of Software,"</a> which leveraged an incredibly simple NLP technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram">n-gram</a> to build an autocomplete engine that rivaled industry standards. </p>
<p>GPT-3, the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">newest model from OpenAI</a>, is a multiple order of magnitude in power, making it feel closer to magic. We got access to the new model, which still in beta, and we quickly got to work building coding tools:</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Reading code is hard! Don't you wish you could just ask the code what it does? To describe its functions, its types.</p><p>And maybe... how can it be improved?</p><p>Introducing: <a href="https://twitter.com/replit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Replit</a> code oracle 🧙‍♀️</p><p>It's crazy, just got access to <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@OpenAI</a> API and I already have a working product! <a href="https://t.co/HX4MyH9yjm">pic.twitter.com/HX4MyH9yjm</a></p></div>— Amjad Masad (@amasad) <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1285789362647478272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>In this example, what we're seeing is an AI assistant who can answer questions related to coding, which we believe is a first of its kind. You can ask all sorts of questions. High-level questions like "What does this code do?" to questions about the program's details, like "what's the type of x?."</p>
<p>Perhaps more shocking and thrilling that it can also give you ideas on extending the project and where to take it. </p>
<p>To make it clear that this wasn't trained on some small subset of types of projects, we took a random project from our community and ran it on it as well:</p>
<blockquote data-conversation="none"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Just to prove that it works on totally novel code, here is a recent project from our community: <a href="https://t.co/oA15YOZtFw">https://t.co/oA15YOZtFw</a></p><p>- It described it!<br>- Told me how to improve it!<br>- Told me where to post it after I improved it!</p><p>It's an awesome tool to make learning programming fun! <a href="https://t.co/Fnkd69DgXU">pic.twitter.com/Fnkd69DgXU</a></p></div>— Amjad Masad (@amasad) <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1285797739930869761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>Now, this is pretty mindblowing. But we also wanted to do something more concretely useful. We thought, what if the AI could fix simple syntax errors. The kind that newbies tend to run into and sometimes get stuck. </p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>If you've ever taught programming you know that newbies make simple mistakes like mixing between strings and variables, not closing parenthesis or quotes, etc.</p><p>Many then get stuck and quit learning programming.</p><p>Working on a code fixer for <a href="https://twitter.com/replit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@replit</a> to fix this problem: <a href="https://t.co/DUxMAPGQfV">pic.twitter.com/DUxMAPGQfV</a></p></div>— Amjad Masad (@amasad) <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1285997706884706304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>These are just the tip of the iceberg we're hacking on many more ideas. But just to give you an idea of what's possible, here is a demo where GPT-3 is used to generate React.js components: </p>
<blockquote>— Sharif Shameem (@sharifshameem) <a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1284807152603820032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<h2 id="ai-and-the-future-of-coding">AI and the future of coding</h2>
<p>So what does this mean for programming? Does it mean that there is no point in learning programming because it will get fully automated? </p>
<p>We don't believe so. Here is what we think the impact will be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>AI-assisted coding will remove the drudgery out of coding. We'll have tools that help us code faster. We'll see more sophisticated code generation and refactor tools, and repetitive coding tasks -- the moments you see yourself copy-pasting code -- might get automated away wholly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>AI will make it easier to learn programming (and many other things). Imagine Codecademy-like courses entirely guided by AI with conversational abilities.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Eventually, AI will influence how we design programming languages, and a new class of languages will emerge. Since computers will be better and faster than humans at generating code, the act of programming itself might change. Who knows, we might be able to program by talking or even by moving in VR/AR. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At some point -- probably not in the near future -- the word "coding" will disappear from our lexicon because programming will stop requiring code and instead be about the pure act of solving problems using computers making it accessible to more and more people. </p>
<p>In the meantime, if you haven't yet, you should still learn how to code and get good at it. It's unlikely that things will change meaningfully in the short-term, and coding is still the best way to program computers. But keep your eyes open to the future, and we'll do our best at Repl.it to build the most advanced programming environment regardless of the modality. </p>
<h2 id="one-more-thing">One more thing</h2>
<p>In addition to GPT-3 we're also experimenting with more ways to bring AI into coding. In the following example, Sergei Chestakov, an engineer at Repl.it built an app that lets you execute hand-written code!</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm building an app that let's you take a picture of handwritten code and execute it: <a href="https://t.co/4s4Pvychqf">pic.twitter.com/4s4Pvychqf</a></p>— Sergei (@SergeiChestakov) <a href="https://twitter.com/SergeiChestakov/status/1289726580210561025?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>We're <a href="https://repl.it/@util/jerbs#open-positions/ai.txt">hiring AI engineers</a> to bring AI into coding. If this is something you're passionate about we'd love to talk to you!</p>

<h2>Why Use Oil?</h2>
<p><span>
    2020-08-07
  </span>
  <span>
  (Last updated 2020-08-07)
  </span>
</p>
<p>Oil is a new Unix shell.  It's <strong>our upgrade path from <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a></strong> to a better
language and runtime.</p>
<p>There are many parts of the Oil project, with various degrees of maturity.  The
POSIX and bash features are the most mature.</p>
<p>This page describe the <strong>benefits of Oil</strong> concisely, linking to details.  It
will be updated continuously.  <a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/Where-To-Send-Feedback">Let me know</a> if it gets out of date!</p>
 
<a name="what-you-can-use-right-now"></a>
<h2>What You Can Use Right Now</h2>
<p>Oil <strong>runs</strong> your existing POSIX shell scripts and bash scripts. It doesn't
fragment your codebase or pool of contributors.  Wiki: <a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/Shell-Programs-That-Run-Under-OSH">Shell Programs That Run
Under
OSH</a>.</p>
<p>If you're not ready to switch right away, you can use it simultaneously with
<a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>.  Oil is a good a <strong>dev tool</strong> for shell scripts, like
<a href="https://www.shellcheck.net/">ShellCheck</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>It can <strong>find bugs</strong> in your shell scripts.
<ul>
<li>It <strong>parses</strong> more strictly.  For example, it found bugs in <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=ble.sh#ble.sh">ble.sh</a> by
statically parsing it.</li>
<li>It has a dozen or so strict modes at <strong>runtime</strong>, e.g. as described under
the #<a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=real-problems#real-problems">real-problems</a> tag.  (TODO: more docs / blog posts about
strict modes).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It has better and <strong>more precise error messages</strong> than any other POSIX shell.
It points you to line number and column that caused the error.</li>
<li>It helps you avoid <strong>unsafe constructs</strong> (security).
<ul>
<li><code>eval_unsafe_arith</code> is off by default.  Static parsing is preferable to
dynamic parsing.  The latter leads to <em>data executed as code</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It saves you from <strong>quoting hell</strong>.  No more <code>!qefs</code> (quote every fucking
substitution).  See <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/simple-word-eval.html">Simple Word
Evaluation</a>.
<ul>
<li>Splicing syntax is <code>@myarray</code>, not the awkward <code>"${myarray[@]}"</code> (<a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/11/06.html">blog
post</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data Structures</strong>
<ul>
<li>Oil has arrays and associative arrays that fix the surprises and bugs in
<a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>.  (See <a href="https://oilshell.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/202008-oil-documentation/topic/What's.20Wrong.20With.20Arrays.20(in.20bash)">What's Wrong With Arrays in bash</a>, requires
Zulip login)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ruby-like <strong>Blocks</strong> are a new shell language construct which open up many
possibilities.
<ul>
<li><code>cd /tmp { echo $PWD }</code> works!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>
<ul>
<li>Parsing speed.</li>
<li>Runtime "compute" speed.</li>
<li>I/O speed.  Oil Starts Fewer Processes Than Other Shells (TODO: blog post)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It prints strings consistently with a format called QSN.</li>
<li>Conveniences like a builtin <code>readlink</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can write Python, <strong>you can change Oil</strong>!  See the section below.</p>

<a name="by-the-end-of-2020"></a>
<h2>By The End of 2020</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix problems with <code>errexit</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Debugging</strong> features
<ul>
<li><code>repr</code> builtin.  (Koichi liked this.)</li>
<li><code>argv</code> or <code>write --qsn</code>.</li>
<li><code>--debug-file</code> (TODO: test, document)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More Performance (link to details)</li>
<li>More Oil Blocks
<ul>
<li><code>shopt ... { ... }</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dev Tools (maybe)
<ul>
<li>crash dump in JSON</li>
<li>Better tracing.  (Hierarchical logging?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a name="for-system-integrators-eg-linux-distro-maintainers"></a>
<h2>For System Integrators, e.g. Linux Distro Maintainers</h2>
<p>Oil is standards compliant:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's a POSIX shell, which means it can be the <strong>only shell</strong> on a Unix
system.  You don't have to maintain two shells.</li>
<li>It ships as standard C++ 11, and is written against ANSI C APIs (e.g. GNU
libc, musl libc).  Oil has <strong>very few build dependencies</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Note that Oil's <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=metalanguage#metalanguage">metalanguage</a> is statically-typed Python + DSLs,
but you don't need a Python interpreter to build or use it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a name="whats-planned-help-wanted"></a>
<h2>What's Planned (<a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2019/12/09.html#help-wanted">Help Wanted</a>!)</h2>
<p>This work will happen in 2021 or later (or never).  I hope Oil will be useful
soon, and attract contributors.</p>
<ul>
<li>A brand new <strong>expression language</strong>, with types.
<ul>
<li>We want to get rid of ugly shell syntax like <code>${x%%prefix}</code>, in favor of
Python- or JavaScript-like expressions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=awk#awk">awk</a>-like language for filtering tables.
<ul>
<li>It will use <a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/TSV2-Proposal">QTSV</a>, an
enhancement to TSV that uses QSN strings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Blocks</strong> enable "declarative" configuration and DSLs.  For example, the
ability to generate <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=ninja#ninja">Ninja</a> files.  A replacement for the
shell-in-YAML antipattern.
<ul>
<li>A better flag parser for shell.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A <strong>sandboxed interpreter</strong> for configuration, and for writing a shell UI in
shell.</li>
<li>That is, a foundation for a principled <strong>interactive shell</strong>, i.e. written in
Oil and not C/C++.
<ul>
<li>Descriptions shown in completion.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=zsh#zsh">zsh</a>-like interactive interface.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a name="oils-code-is-easy-to-modify"></a>
<h2>Oil's Code Is Easy To Modify</h2>
<ul>
<li>It takes 2 minutes to build and modify.  (TODO: screencast.)</li>
<li>Statically typed with <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mypy#mypy">MyPy</a>.</li>
<li>Written in high level DSLs, which means the code is <strong>short</strong>.  In
comparison, the <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> implementation is long-winded.  It grovels
through backslashes and braces one at a time.</li>
<li>Despite the high-level languages, the resulting code is <strong>efficient</strong>, due to
<a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mycpp#mycpp">mycpp</a>.</li>
<li>Comprehensive continuous build infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<a name="why-not-use-it"></a>
<h2>Why Not Use It?</h2>
<ul>
<li>The documentation is sparse.  Help wanted!</li>
<li>As of August 2020, there's still a separation between <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-native#oil-native">oil-native</a> and
Oil in Python.  I hope that <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-native#oil-native">oil-native</a> will be the recommended
tarball by the end of 2020.</li>

                    <p>TikTok utilizes Artificial Intelligence to elevate content to various users, and enables content makers to make recordings with music, filters and other improvements. If you are looking for extreme entertainment, but you don't like to spend hours on your smartphone, TikTok is the answer. If you like short dance videos, lip-syncs, comedy, parody, or other talent videos, TikTok offers a one-stop solution. There will not be any online user who does not know about Tiktok.</p><p>Tiktok is built in 2016 by <a href="https://www.bytedance.com/en/">ByteDance</a>, a Chinese internet technology company. After a successful merger with Musical.ly, Tiktok was finally launched for the United States on August 2, 2018. TikTok has become the most downloaded app in 2018 and 2019. </p><h3 id="what-made-tiktok-the-highest-downloaded-mobile-app">What Made TikTok the Highest downloaded mobile App?</h3><p>Some people count the number of downloads to rank the most rated app. For this, TikTok yet stays the giant with more than 2 billion app downloads globally. Tiktok stands at 4<sup>th</sup> position with 800 million active users. Facebook, Messenger, and Whatsapp hold the top position in social media app ranking. </p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Wq3n5IFQHk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>What makes TikTok so popular?</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, the content published in TikTok is fantastic and addictive. But we cannot disregard the algorithm behind this app that keeps the user flooded with the videos of interest. This article is solely confined to the backend artificial intelligence programs that made TikTok user-friendly and more interactive. This discussion includes critical features and their respective AI programs for TikTok.</p><h3 id="how-is-tiktok-different-from-other-apps-the-recommendation-engine-">How is TikTok Different from other Apps? The Recommendation Engine!</h3><p>Recommendation engines are <strong>data filtering tools</strong> that work on the interest of a particular user. For this purpose, they use algorithms and searched data and then mention it as a recommendation in the sidebar of a particular platform. You can compare them with a ‘’shopkeeper guy.’’ When you ask him for a specific item, he also shows you some other products. At the same time, these products are based on the interest you have shown previously. With the rising number of data finders on search engines, the amount of data providers also raised. Moreover, particular platforms also use recommendation engines to keep the user on their site for a long time.</p><p>There must be a reliable data basis that collects and stores information and show it in real-time. It will then favor a variety of abstract layers like algorithm, serving, and application layers to appear on the front. Ultimately, it resolves many business person’s issues. </p><p>Typically, there are two standpoints for TikTok; the one represents the creator side while the other covers the consumer's side.</p><h3 id="1-content-creator">1- &nbsp;Content Creator</h3><p>TikTok supports content producers with AI to create viral content. Its robust AI system suggests the producers about keywords, hashtags, video editing, and attractive music selection. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="2-consumer-side">2- &nbsp;Consumer Side</h3><p>TikTok’s efficient algorithm notices the likes and comments of the users. It also focuses on their retention time on a particular video and then offers them the video of their interest. <strong> &nbsp;</strong></p><h3 id="what-will-appear-first-in-a-new-tiktok-user-s-feed">What will Appear First in a New TikTok User’s Feed? &nbsp;</h3><p>TikTok lowers inconvenience by not forcing the audience to sign-up first. It gets information about your taste by the first video you watch and the time you spent on it. The original content that appears in your TikTok feed is based on the data you provide during signing-up on the app. TikTok’s archetype traces your location, age, and gender to show you the content that matches the above-provided information. After it, TikTok will show you data related to your first search on the engine. </p><p>The primary purpose of every app is to engage the audience for a longer time by reducing the exit rate. TikTok efficiently shows you the most loved video by the audience in your location. After getting enough information about your interest, it will trace your metrics and offer a final score.</p><p>If you click on a celebrity video, it will add it to your favorites. Then next time when you come on the app, you’ll see related videos on top as a recommendation. Further, it analyses your curiosity to favor you with precise recommendations. &nbsp;</p><p>There are several theories related to TikTok’s algorithms. The user experience and expert analysis make their basis. </p><h3 id="batch-theory">Batch Theory</h3><p>When a user uploads a video, it undergoes through different batch pools to distinguish its content from others. In this scenario, the algorithm traces its watching history, personal preferences, location. Your content becomes famous if it gets more likes, sharing, and comments than usual. So, the algorithm assigns a score to your content based on the points mentioned above.</p><p>Finally, if the algorithm finds your content impressive, then it exposes your unique content to a big audience. According to this theory, it will take a week or more to become a celebrity. It also includes that engage more audience in trending topics to get more promotions. </p><h3 id="delay-momentum">Delay Momentum</h3><p>This theory suggests the data uploaders not to delete their content; it doesn't matter how rough it is. Some users also share their experience that some pieces of their content were not so appealing. They started using the app less than before, and they eventually saw a rise in their audience. In this way, TikTok cares about its users and feel them they are essential to its community. The TikTokers get passion and start producing new content to retain the audience. </p><p>This theory suggests that the success of your account to be viral is only depends on your introductory videos. If you succeed in gaining some likes and views, then TikTok’s AI considers you a perfect match. Now the algorithm provided you the audience, and you, in return, have to sustain it with fantastic content.</p><p>Three primary pillars help TikTok archetypes are:</p><ul><li>Tagging the content</li><li>Producing user-profiles and user scenarios and</li><li>Training and helping recommendation algorithms.</li></ul><p>Here is a detailed conversation about them.</p><h3 id="data-and-features">Data and Features</h3><p>Firstly., we consider what data is? Recommendation model comes with the user's fulfillment by providing the User Generated Content. For this information, input data comes from three-dimension.</p><p><strong><em>Content Data</em></strong><br>TikTok is widely in use over the world; thus, it also has a variety of information. Every type of content has a unique taste and should be in different categories. So, the system should be strong enough to show specific data in a specific recommendation. </p><p><strong><em>User Data</em> </strong><br>This data includes the user's personal information like age, gender, career, and demographics. It also adds some hidden features form ML-based customer clustering.</p><p><strong><em>Scenario Data</em></strong><br>As its name shows, it tracks user's preference shifts and uses scenarios on variable scenarios. For instance, what kind of video a user loves to watch while traveling, working, jogging, and many more.</p><p>Once the data collection is done successfully, then the four critically planned features are introduced into the recommendation engine. </p><h3 id="correlation-features">Correlation Features</h3><p>They correlate the content characteristics with user tags, containing keywords, theme tag, source matching, and arrangement tag. Moreover, they also represent latent features like vector separation between content and the user.</p><p><strong><em>User-Scenario Features</em></strong><br>These tags monitor scenario data like physical location time, and date of content uploaded with event tags. </p><p><strong><em>Trend Features</em> </strong><br>They represent a worldwide trend that becomes a hot topic in a specific time. However, they also denote top keywords, trending themes, and user interaction with them.</p><p><strong><em>Collaborative Features</em></strong><br>These features work based on a collaborating filtering strategy. It equilibrates the bias recommendation (narrow) and generalized recommendation (collaborative). Furthermore, this feature not only records data of an individual but also a group of related people with the same interests. It also traces their interests, impression click-through rate, themes, and keywords. In this way, the above-discussed features decide what to show in a particular scenario to a particular user. </p><h3 id="tiktok-recommendation-system">TikTok Recommendation System</h3><p>After video uploading, the robust algorithm uses a highly-efficient NLP and computer vision system for video analysis. Just like humans, it read every part of your video, including audio, video images, captions, and hashtags. Then it assigns it a specific category according to the content and context of the material. </p><p>The working strategy of TikTok will shock you. It exposes every new coming data to a small audience and evaluates your hard work based on the viewer's interest. After all, it will decide a score for your video as:</p><table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Watch-again rate</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>10 Points</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Retention time</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>8 Points</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Share to others</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>6 Points</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Comments and responses</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>4 Points</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Likes</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>2 Points</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table><p>Moreover, its robust AI system also distinguishes between looping and non-looping videos. Looping content doesn't help to make you viral. If your video catches the high score, it means your video is in the right list of TikTok’s algorithm. It will share your video with the right audience having the same head and heart. &nbsp;</p><p>Your video doesn’t go viral if it's unable to get the rank, as mentioned above. But still don’t lose heart, Delay Momentum Theory works here. Now you are well familiar with how TikTok retains the audience for more significant periods. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="intangible-goals">Intangible Goals</h3><p>In the recommendation model, all objectives, including clicks, likes, dislikes, comments, re-posts, and reading time, are assess-able. The algorithms use this information rightly and then show it as a prediction precisely. But there are some other imperceptible objectives; for them, the recommendation engine can’t provide quantifiable information. </p><p>For the maintenance of a healthy and user-friendly environment, TikTok is going to overpower all violent content. The platform is deciding to remove all content related to pornography, scamming, pomposity, and even political news. Therefore, there is a dare need of a compatible model that can …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>The questions we often hear are “Why create a new query language?” and
            “What’s wrong with SQL?”.  This post contains answers to both.</p>
<p>Before we begin, let’s overview some of the history of how the relational
            model came to be, and how SQL was created.</p>
<div id="a-brief-history-of-the-relational-model-and-sql">
<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-the-relational-model-and-sql"><a href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#a-brief-history-of-the-relational-model-and-sql"><svg width="35" height="35" viewBox="0 0 35 35"><path d="M2.694 6.631h19.085v3.961h-1.944V8.574H4.636v10.962h15.199V17.52h1.944v3.96H2.694V6.632zM13.3 13.085h19.086v14.848H13.3v-3.962h1.942v2.019h15.2V15.027h-15.2v2.017H13.3v-3.96z" fill="#047CFF"></path></svg></a>A Brief History of the Relational Model and SQL</h2>
<p>The relational model was introduced by Edgar F. Codd in a seminal 1970 paper
                “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks” <span>[<a id="id1" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1970">4</a>]</span>.
                There, Codd postulated that all data in a database can be represented in
                terms of sets of tuples, called <em>relations</em>. Codd also invented a form of
                first-order predicate logic to describe the database queries: <em>tuple
                    relational calculus</em>.</p>
<p>Codd’s ideas were revolutionary.  For the first time, a database,
                and a universal way to query it, was described in a succinct, consistent
                mathematical model.  This, naturally, created lots of interest in further
                research and, importantly, into practical implementation of the relational
                model.</p>
<p>In 1974 Donald Chamberlin and Raymond Boyce published a paper
                <span>[<a id="id2" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fchamberlin-1974">2</a>]</span>, which introduced “a set of simple operations on tabular
                structures, […] of equivalent power to the first order predicate calculus”.
                Chamberlin and Boyce felt that the formal relational query languages proposed
                at the time were too hard to understand for “users without formal training in
                mathematics or computer programming” and thought that the “predominant use of
                the language would be for ad-hoc queries” <span>[<a id="id3" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fchamberlin-2012">3</a>]</span>.  Initially,
                the authors did not consider SQL to be a “serious” language.  Nonetheless,
                the great interest in the commercial application of the relational model had
                pushed IBM to quickly adopt and productize SQL, which was also picked up by
                their quickly-rising competitor–Oracle.</p>
<p>IBM had an overwhelmingly large influence over the tech market at the time,
                so SQL became a de facto standard for relational databases, and then a proper
                standard with the publication of the first ANSI standard in 1989 that
                essentially circumscribed the most prominent existing implementations
                of SQL.  Subsequent versions of the standard continued to be primarily
                influenced by the commercial vendors.</p>
<p>Today, SQL is by far the most widely used database language.  But that does
                not necessarily mean that it represents the best of what we can do.
                In fact, SQL’s beginnings as a “simple, ad-hoc” language coupled with
                “design by implementation” from competing vendors had left the language with
                a baggage of severe issues.</p>
</div>
<div id="critique-of-sql">

<p>SQL, especially its earlier versions, was heavily criticized by the experts,
                including Codd himself <span>[<a id="id4" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1990">6</a>]</span>, as well as C. J. Date, who published a
                multitude of papers and books on the subject (<span>[<a id="id5" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1985">7</a>]</span>, <span>[<a id="id6" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1987">9</a>]</span>,
                <span>[<a id="id7" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-2009">10</a>]</span>).  While many of the early shortcomings were fixed in the later
                versions of the standard, some of the serious issues had been only further
                ingrained.</p>
<p>Some of the complaints here apply to SQL as a whole, while others are specific
                to a certain implementation.  We are primarily using PostgreSQL for the
                examples.</p>
<p>SQL’s shortcomings can be grouped into these categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>lack of proper orthogonality — SQL is hard to compose;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lack of compactness — SQL is a large language;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lack of consistency — SQL is inconsistent in syntax and semantics;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>poor system cohesion — SQL does not integrate well enough with
                        application languages and protocols.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div id="lack-of-orthogonality">

<p>Orthogonality in a programming language means that a relatively small set
                    of primitive constructs can be combined in a relatively small number of ways.
                    A language with good orthogonality is smaller, more consistent, and is
                    easier to learn due to there being few exceptions from the overall set of
                    rules.  Conversely, bad orthogonality leads to a large language with many
                    exceptions and caveats.</p>
<p>A good example of orthogonality in a programming language is the ability to
                    substitute an arbitrary part of an expression with a variable, or a function
                    call, without any effect on the final result.</p>
<p>In SQL, such generic substitution is not possible, since there are <em>two</em>
                    mutually incompatible kinds of expressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <em>table expression</em> is a SQL expression that yields a table:
                            <code>SELECT * FROM table</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>scalar expression</em> is a SQL expression that yields a single scalar value:
                            <code>SELECT count(*) FROM table</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Table expressions can only be used in a <code>FROM</code> clause, in a function, or with
                    an operator that specifically expects a table expression as input.
                    What’s worse the scalar and table expressions may have exactly the same syntax,
                    which can be a source of further confusion.</p>
<p>For example, let’s imagine we needed to list the names of all department
                    heads in a company.  This query would do the job:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> name
<span>FROM</span> emp
<span>WHERE</span> role <span>=</span> <span>'dept head'</span></span></span></pre>
<p>Now let’s say we needed to add this bit to a larger query that extracts
                    information about a department.  An intuitive way is to simply add the
                    above as a subquery to the target list of our larger query:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span>
    dept<span>.</span>name<span>,</span>
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
    <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> name <span>FROM</span> emp
     <span>WHERE</span> role <span>=</span> <span>'dept head'</span> <span>AND</span> deptno <span>=</span> dept<span>.</span><span>no</span><span>)</span>
<span>FROM</span>
    dept
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></span></span></pre>
<p>This is legal, but <em>only</em> if the subquery returns not more than one row.
                    Otherwise, an error would be raised at run time.  To account for multiple
                    department heads, we would need to rewrite the query using a join:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span>
    dept<span>.</span>name<span>,</span>
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
    head<span>.</span>name
<span>FROM</span>
    dept
    <span>INNER</span> <span>JOIN</span> emp <span>AS</span> head
        <span>ON</span> <span>(</span>head<span>.</span>deptno <span>=</span> dept<span>.</span><span>no</span>
            <span>AND</span> head<span>.</span>role <span>=</span> <span>'dept head'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></span></span></pre>
<p>The difference in structure is large enough to make any sort of source-level
                    query reuse impractical.</p>

<div><p>Few claim that SQL is an elegant language characterized by orthogonality.
                        Some call it an elephant on clay feet.  With each addition, its body grows,
                        and it becomes less stable.  SQL standardization is largely the domain of
                        database vendors, not academic researchers without commercial interests
                        or users with user interests. <span>[<a id="id8" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fatzeni-2013">1</a>]</span></p><p>Paolo Atzeni et al.</p></div>
<p>SQL is not a small language. At the time of writing the PostgreSQL
                    implementation contains <b>469 keywords</b>. Just part 2 (out of 14) of the
                    SQL:2016 standard has <b>1732 pages</b>.</p>
<p>The main reason is that SQL, in line with its original goals, strives to be
                    an English-like language, catered to “non-professionals”.  However, with the
                    growth of the language, this verbosity has contributed <em>negatively</em> to the
                    ability to write and comprehend SQL queries.  We learnt this lesson with
                    COBOL, and the world has long since moved on to newer, more succinct
                    programming languages.</p>
<p>In addition to keyword proliferation, the orthogonality issues discussed
                    above make queries more verbose and harder to read.</p>
</div>
<div id="lack-of-consistency">

<p>SQL is arbitrarily inconsistent both in its syntax and semantics. What
                    makes things even worse is that different databases have their own version
                    of SQL, often incompatible with other SQL variants.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of entirely different calling conventions in SQL:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> substring<span>(</span><span>'PostgreSQL'</span> <span>from</span> <span>8</span> <span>for</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>SELECT</span> substring<span>(</span><span>'PostgreSQL'</span><span>,</span> <span>8</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 

<span>SELECT</span> trim<span>(</span>both <span>from</span> <span>'yxSQLxx'</span><span>,</span> <span>'xyz'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>SELECT</span> extract<span>(</span><span>day</span> <span>from</span> <span>timestamp</span> <span>'2001-02-16 20:38:40'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span></span></pre>
<p>There are two syntaxes that specify the ordering of the input set in an
                    aggregate function:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> array_agg<span>(</span>foo <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> bar<span>)</span></span></span></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> rank<span>(</span>foo<span>)</span> <span>WITHIN</span> <span>GROUP</span> <span>(</span><span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> bar<span>)</span></span></span></pre>
<p>The list of inconsistencies like this does not end here and can be continued,
                    but that’s beyond the scope of this blog post.</p>

<div><p>In some cases of inadequate handling of missing information,
                        the problem is incorrectly perceived to be a problem of the
                        relational model. In fact, the problem stems from the inadequacies
                        of SQL and its non-conformance to the relational model. <span>[<a id="id9" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1990">6</a>]</span></p><p>Edgar J. Codd</p></div>
<p>It has been extensively argued that <code>NULL</code> is the biggest misfeature of SQL
                    (<span>[<a id="id10" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1987">5</a>]</span>, <span>[<a id="id11" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1986">8</a>]</span>, <span>[<a id="id12" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1987">9</a>]</span>).
                    In fact, the handling of <code>NULL</code> in contemporary SQL implementations is so
                    surprising, inconsistent, and dangerous that this topic deserves a separate
                    section.</p>
<p><code>NULL</code> is so special that it’s not equal to anything, including itself:</p>
<pre><span><span>postgres=# select NULL = NULL;
 ?column?
----------

(1 row)</span></span></pre>
<p>In fact, almost any operation on <code>NULL</code> will return <code>NULL</code> and the
                    effect may be very subtle:</p>
<pre><span><span>postgres=# CREATE TABLE x (a int, b text);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# INSERT INTO x(a, b)
           VALUES (1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (NULL, 'three')
           RETURNING a, b;
 a |   b
---+-------
 1 | one
 2 | two
   | three
(3 rows)

postgres=# SELECT * FROM x WHERE a NOT IN (1, null);
 a | b
---+---
(0 rows)</span></span></pre>
<p>But, in some cases <code>NULL</code>
<em>is</em> equal to itself, such as in <code>DISTINCT</code>:</p>
<pre><span><span>elvis=# SELECT DISTINCT *
        FROM (VALUES (1), (NULL), (NULL)) AS q;
 column1
---------

       1
(2 rows)</span></span></pre>

<p>Explorer is a power tool for GPT-3 experimentation with <strong>full history</strong>, <strong>sharing</strong>, and the community’s <strong>best-practices</strong> built-in. If you’re just getting started with GPT-3 or don’t want to build out your own boilerplate codebase, try the hosted version: <a href="https://gpt-3-explorer.vercel.app/">Explorer</a>. The source is available <a href="https://github.com/belay-labs/gpt-explorer">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="a-ui-for-experimentation">A UI for experimentation</h2>

<p>To get good results from GPT-3, you need to experiment. (Despite what the cherry-picked examples on Twitter will have you believe!)</p>

<p>This fundamental insight led to Explorer’s first feature: saved history. They say the difference between tinkering and science is rigor and reproducibility. We codified that transition by making all our prompts and settings automatically saved and shareable. Annotations further allowed us to build and improve upon previous results.</p>

<p>Long term, we envision an environment that enables the development of higher level APIs on top of GPT-3. A system for designing pipelines of prompts, complex scripts, logic to retrieve external information — that can all be published for use in products and research.</p>

<p>Building complex applications requires you to work at a higher level of abstraction than machine code. <strong>How can we build an open source operating system for GPT-3 at the dawn of <a href="https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35">Software 2.0</a>?</strong></p>

<h2 id="get-involved">Get involved!</h2>

<p>There’s a long road ahead and we’re thankful for all of your feedback and suggestions so far. We welcome code contributions to Explorer - pop over to <a href="https://github.com/belay-labs/gpt-explorer">the repository</a> to learn how you can get it running locally!</p>

<p>Oh, and try it out <a href="https://gpt-3-explorer.vercel.app/">here</a> :)</p>

<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>

<h3 id="building-together">Building together</h3>

<p>The community is continually discovering incredible methods for unlocking GPT-3’s potential. Without the right set of tools, most practitioners struggle to find and implement these new techniques.</p>

<p>That’s where we see the need for an open source project where we can all rapidly experiment and codify what we’ve learned. Here are some of the community’s methods and best practices that we’re excited to incorporate as features in Explorer:</p>

<p><strong>Prompt chaining</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>This method skirts the token limit by “chaining” together prompts and their outputs.</li>
  <li><a href="http://gptprompts.wikidot.com/chaining:chaining">Chaining</a> breaks down larger tasks into component sub-tasks, before composing them back together in a single prompt to get your final result.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Context stuffing</strong></p>

<p>This is a method of iterative prompt improvement that involves:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Running an initial prompt</li>
  <li>Cherrypicking the best GPT-3 outputs,</li>
  <li>Appending them to the original prompt, to provide more examples for GPT-3 to use.</li>
</ol>


<h3 id="the-roadmap">The Roadmap</h3>

<p>In the coming months, with your help, we plan to build these features (and more!). As the private beta comes to an end, let’s enable new GPT-3 users to hit the ground running with the cumulative, collective insights of the community.</p>

<p>As we receive feedback and contributions from the community, this roadmap will continue to change and be reprioritized. You can follow a live version of it <a href="https://github.com/belay-labs/gpt-explorer/projects/1">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing and importing prompts</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>“GitHub for Prompts”. Let’s make it easy to share and build on each others’ work!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Prompt evaluation</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>GPT’s performance is very, very sensitive to prompt design. So iterating on prompt design is our highest priority.</li>
  <li>With built-in tools for prompt evaluation, you can annotate, rank and sort results for the same task across different prompt designs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scripting &amp; chaining</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Enable commands which can trigger scripts.</li>
  <li>These scripts can then: <em>i.</em> do computation, or <em>ii.</em> trigger API requests to do actions, get more information, call other prompts, etc.</li>
  <li>In particular, this scripting interface can chain prompts together.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Higher level API interface</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The OpenAI API is all about simplicity, it is a raw text-in, text-out interface, which is great to build on top of but does not make it easy to best take advantage of the tool.</li>
  <li>We envision a higher level API which you can use to develop higher-level reasoning and operations on top of the low level API. Turn any prompt, which itself can be a pipeline of other prompts, into an API.</li>
  <li>This enables a more broadly useful natural language interface for: chat, question answering, text transformations, multi-step labeling, and other pipelines of natural language operations</li>
</ul>

<![CDATA[Cutting Corners in the Race for a Vaccine]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>When Alexander Ginzburg injected himself with the vaccine he developed, he hadn't even begun testing the substance on monkeys. That was four months ago, and Ginzburg, a microbiologist and director of the state-owned Gamaleya Institute in Moscow, says he is still feeling just fine. One hundred institute employees also agreed to be vaccinated. And all are still healthy.</p><div>
<p>Ginzburg is working on what is called a vector vaccine, which involves introducing genetic material from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into a harmless carrier virus in order to trigger the human immune system to produce antibodies. The 68-year-old Ginzburg isn't particularly interested in the risks associated with injecting a substance that is still in development. "I want to protect myself and my employees," he says, claiming that his vaccine is both safe and effective. After all, he says, he's already developed a coronavirus vaccine on one other occasion.</p><p>The Russian government is hoping to approve Ginzburg's vaccine as rapidly as possible, with Health Ministry officials saying that a decision could be made in the next several days. And if it is approved, Russian doctors and teachers are to be injected first. It is unclear whether they will have a choice.</p>
</div><p>Russia, though, isn't alone. It's just one of many examples showing how the race for a COVID-19 vaccine continues to accelerate -- fueled in part by autocratic countries like Russia and China, which aren't always so fastidious when it comes to medical and ethical standards. A research breakthrough would mean that Moscow and Beijing would be able to protect their populations more quickly and reopen their economies earlier than their rivals. A vaccine wouldn't just represent an advance in the fight against the virus, it would also translate into power, prestige and money, since the rest of the world would be clamoring to buy the remedy.</p><div>
<h3>Laxer than Elsewhere</h3><p>At the same time, the premature introduction of a vaccine that isn't ready for primetime can have grave consequences. Politicians must be aware that rapidly developing a vaccine isn't their only challenge, they must also convince the populace that the vaccine is safe, says Chandrakant Lahariya, an epidemiologist from India. Late-developing side effects could lead to a situation where "trust doesn't just sink in this vaccine, but in all others developed around the world."</p><p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), laboratories in 12 countries have developed 27 vaccine candidates, which are now undergoing clinical testing. That includes teams in Britain, Japan, Germany, South Korea and the United States, but institutes in China, India and Russia have also begun the process of clinical evaluation – three ambitious emerging markets with nationalist leadership and regulatory authorities that tend to be laxer than elsewhere.</p>
</div><div>
<p>With more than 865,000 coronavirus infections, Russia is currently the fourth-most affected country in this pandemic and President Vladimir Putin is pushing for a breakthrough in vaccine development. The government says that more than 20 countries from Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East have expressed interest in the vaccine. In Moscow, there is talk of a "Sputnik Moment," a reference to the Soviet Union's launch of the first ever satellite in 1957, ahead of the Americans.</p><p>Epidemiologists like Vasily Vlassov of the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, though, are warning against premature euphoria. The celebratory comments coming from the Kremlin, he says, are "like Soviet-era propaganda." Vlassov is critical of the government having lowered the legal hurdles. Moscow intends to begin mass production of the vaccine in September or October even though the clinical studies haven't even yet advanced into the decisive Phase III of testing. "Russia is violating internationally accepted rules," he says.</p><p>According to WHO vaccine guidelines, every new substance must first be tested in the laboratory and on animals before it can be administered to humans. In the first phase of a clinical study, only very few test subjects receive the vaccine, with Phase II involving dozens or perhaps a couple hundred people. In Phase III, tens of thousands of test subjects are often involved. Every phase is crucial to determining if the new vaccine is safe and whether it is effective.</p><h3>A "Nice Bonus"</h3><p>Furthermore, participation in the trials must be voluntary. Test subjects normally receive monetary compensation, but it tends not to be particularly generous. Also, all relevant data pertaining to the trials must be made public so that government agencies and other scientists can evaluate it.</p><p>The Gamaleya Institute is apparently violating these guidelines in several different ways. Thus far, hardly any scientific data has been published, while only 76 test subjects took part in the first and second testing phases, half of them soldiers in the army. The other half were civilians, who received 100,000 rubles for their participation, the equivalent of around 1,200 euros or around three average monthly salaries in Russia. Anna Kutkina, one of the volunteers, calls it a "nice bonus" and intends to use the money to help buy the farmhouse she has long been dreaming of.</p><p>But it's not just the Russian efforts that appear to be guided by excessive zeal. Some in India are also exhibiting impatience. The country's pharmaceutical industry is the largest producer of vaccines in the world, though most of them are developed elsewhere due to a shortage of domestic innovation there. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, though, would like to change that state of affairs. At least seven Indian pharmaceutical companies are currently seeking to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, with the company Bharat Biotech having made the most progress. They have named their candidate Covaxin.</p><p>In early June, a letter sent by the director of the state-owned Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) was leaked to the public. Test subjects, the letter instructed, were to be given Covaxin "no later than July 7" with the goal of making the vaccine available to the public by August 15. It was hardly a randomly chosen date: August 15 is India's Independence Day.</p><p>The Indian Academy of Sciences quickly released a statement calling the timeline both "unfeasible" and "unreasonable." Producer Bharat Biotech then noted that possible approval would take at least another five months and ICMR was forced to backpedal. For health expert Lahariya, the incident shows that oversight actually works in India. "Would such a debate also have been possible in Russia and China?" he wonders. &nbsp;</p><p>Still, the favorite in the race for a vaccine isn't India, but China. Three of the six candidates around the world that are currently in Phase III trials have been developed by Chinese scientists. The other three companies in the final stage of trials are the British-Swedish company AstraZeneca, the German firm Biontech and the American company Moderna.</p><p>The Chinese, though, are running into a problem that other countries would love to have: They don't have enough coronavirus cases. The efficacy of a vaccine can only really be adequately tested in places where test subjects face a certain risk of infection. As a result of strict lockdown measures and surveillance measures in China, though, the virus has essentially been eradicated in the country. In response, Sinopharm is carrying out its Phase III trials in the United Arab Emirates, while Sinovac has headed to Brazil.</p><h3>"A Diplomatic Fiasco"</h3><p>Beijing has already promised these two countries and other pro-China nations access to the vaccine, says Yanzhong Huang, a health expert with the U.S.-based think tank Council on Foreign Relations. And that, he says, is a bit of a political risk: Given that China can't control the media in the recipient countries, there could be negative reports about possible side effects. "That would be a diplomatic fiasco for China," Huang says.</p><p>In addition, the Chinese military has administered the vaccine to an unknown number of soldiers since the end of June, despite Phase III trials not yet having begun. That vaccine was developed by army scientists in cooperation with the Chinese company CanSino.</p><p>One participant in the Phase II clinical trial from CanSino makes it sound as though they have been a bit more stringent when it comes to testing guidelines than Moscow has. During the outbreak in Wuhan, Lao Ji delivered food and medicines on his moped. He recalls being horrified at the time when he read the Chinese translation of an article in the medical journal <em>Lancet,</em> which described how a coronavirus patient's immune system can spin out of control.</p>
</div><div>
<p>He learned via the Chinese microblogging site Weibo that volunteers were being sought for a study, Lao said during an April discussion in Wuhan held just two days after his injection. "I hope that a vaccine will be developed as soon as possible," he said. "So, it's better if I do my part to help out."</p><p>The scientists, he said, extensively informed him of the risks. One month prior to the injection, he was given a comprehensive health checkup and he provided details about his health history. He also committed to having his blood taken four times over a six-month period. When asked about the fee paid for his participation, he said he couldn't remember, but added: "It wasn't much. Perhaps half my monthly salary." He didn't volunteer for the money, though, he said.</p><h3>Vaccine Espionage</h3><p>Although China is ahead of the others in developing a vaccine, the country has also apparently turned to its intelligence service for help. In July, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted two Chinese hackers who were allegedly searching for weaknesses in the computer systems of networks of biotech firms and other companies conducting research into a COVID-19 vaccine. The two are thought to have been operating under the auspices of an officer in the Chinese Ministry of State Security.</p><p>The biotech firm Moderna confirmed having been informed by the FBI of the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <main id="main-content"> <section> <div>   <p>We’re excited to announce the first beta release and general availability of the <strong>Rome</strong> linter for JavaScript and TypeScript.</p> <p>This is the beginning of an entire suite of tools. Rome is not only linter, but also a compiler, bundler, test runner, and <a href="https://romefrontend.dev/#development-status">more</a>, for JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, JSON, Markdown, and CSS. We aim to unify the entire frontend development toolchain.</p> <p>Rome is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application">monolithic</a> tool containing functionality that has traditionally been separate tools in the frontend ecosystem. We call this a toolchain. It is <strong>not</strong> a collection of existing tools, but completely custom, built <a href="https://romefrontend.dev/credits">largely</a> from scratch, contained entirely in a single package and codebase.</p> <p>Rome is designed to replace <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>, <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a>, <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a>, <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a>, <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>, and others.</p> <p>We have significant implementations already for most components, including compiling, bundling, and testing, all using the same core abstractions and internal libraries. Rome is even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(compilers)">self-hosted</a> and we use them to <a href="https://github.com/romefrontend/rome/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">build and develop Rome itself</a>! Once usage as a linter has stabilized, we will move onto the unreleased features to prepare and generalize them for public usage.</p> <p>Linting is an excellent low-risk way for us to mature and validate shared functionality like editor integration, configuration, parallelization, caching, parsing, and dependency analysis. It is not in the critical build path for development so is relatively straight forward and safe to adopt.</p> <pre><code><span>$</span> rome check

See the full <a href="https://romefrontend.dev/docs/lint/rules">list of rules</a>. You can expect a full featured experience, however may still encounter bugs. With most of the feature development out of the way we will be focusing primarily on stability.</p> <p>Most of our rules have been inspired by their ESLint equivalents. This required a complete rewrite to utilize Rome’s API that differ extensively from existing tools. Without the amazing work of the ESLint team and community establishing these recommended patterns, we would not have been able to pull this off. Refer to the <a href="https://romefrontend.dev/docs/lint/rules">lint rule docs</a> for direct references.</p> <p>Since open sourcing, at the beginning of the year, we have received contributions from over <a href="https://github.com/romefrontend/rome/graphs/contributors">70 contributors</a> and <a href="https://github.com/romefrontend/rome/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged">600 pull requests</a>. We have an established <a href="https://romefrontend.dev/credits#team">team</a>, a formal <a href="https://github.com/romefrontend/rome/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md">governance model</a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/romefrontend/rome/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">code of conduct</a> enforcement policy. This ensures transparency around project decisions, moderation, and direction.</p> <p>You can read more about Rome, including how to get started, in our <a href="https://romefrontend.dev/">documentation</a>.

At the time I wasn’t trying to solve any particular problem, I was just building and experimenting with existing libraries and teaching myself new concepts. Over time though, as the project exploded in popularity, so did the scope and mission of the project.</p> <p>We renamed <strong>6to5</strong> to <strong>Babel</strong> to take on a new role as a general platform for doing static JavaScript transformation. This meant a plugin system and a new commitment to supporting future JavaScript standards and proposed features.</p> <p>We also planned on expanding Babel to be used as the base for other JavaScript language tooling by using shared public libraries. From the Babel blog post “<a href="https://babeljs.io/blog/2015/10/29/6.0.0">6.0.0 Released</a>” by <a href="https://twitter.com/buildsghost">Jamie Kyle</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>But we think we can go even further. Babel should be able to power minifiers, linters, formatters, syntax highlighters, code completion tools, type checkers, codemod tools, and every other tool to be using the same foundation to do their job better than ever before.</p> </blockquote> <figure> <img width="600" src="https://romefrontend.dev/img/blog/6to5-to-babel.png" alt="Old 6to5 logo with an arrow pointing to the new Babel logo"> <figcaption>Old 6to5 logo with an arrow pointing to the new Babel logo</figcaption> </figure> <p>In 2016, I left the project, and those plans never materialized. Over time, I learned the Babel would not have been able to successfully adapt to execute on this vision anyway. The solution to plugins was “expose all the internals” which is an extremely large API surface area to maintain and restricts your ability to make any changes.</p> <p>Making the necessary modifications to Babel to allow for it to be a reliable base for other tools would have required changes to absolutely everything. The architecture is bound to the initial design choices I made in 2014 when I was learning about parsers, ASTs, and compilers.</p> <p>There would have been no way to provide backward compatibility, and with expectations already set, any significant changes to the project would have introduced an extremely high amount of ecosystem churn.</p> <p>In an ode to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus">Ship of Theseus</a>, if all components of an object are replaced, is it the same object? There is far less confusion and friction to release something entirely new than drastically change something that’s already in widespread usage. I had since moved on from the project, and so any evolution would not have been possible, and would have required complete vision alignment.</p> <p>Even though I wasn’t involved in Babel, I still maintained a presence in the developer tooling ecosystem. I eventually went on to develop other tools like <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a> and be involved in projects like <a href="https://prepack.io/">Prepack</a> and <a href="https://fbflipper.com/">Flipper</a>. This work continued to develop the ideas that would eventually become Rome and shaped my philosophy on developer experience. A focus on excellent errors, clean user interface, and minimal configuration.</p> <figure> <img width="500" src="https://romefrontend.dev/img/blog/introducing-rome-post-babel-logos.png" alt="The logos of Yarn, Prepack, and Flipper"> <figcaption>The logos of Yarn, Prepack, and Flipper</figcaption> </figure> <p>The original idea behind Babel had always stuck. What sort of capabilities would be possible if a tool did more than one thing? This sort of philosophy has always seemed alien in the JavaScript ecosystem where micropackages and arbitrary separation of concerns are the norms. These tools being independent has never provided the sort of user autonomy and efficiency that most skeptics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application">monolithic</a> tools proclaim.</p> <p>Language tooling maintainers spend so much time working on the same things. Processing source code, whether it’s in a transpiler like Babel, linting it in ESLint, or bundling it in Webpack, is fundamentally the same problem with overlapping responsibilities and technical implementation.</p> <p>A linter in the JavaScript ecosystem is exactly the same as a compiler. They both consume code, then produce compiled code and errors. What the compiled code is varies. In the case of a linter, the compiled code is formatted source code with automatic fixes applied. The more powerful your compilation infrastructure, the more theoretically powerful your linter could be. These commonalities extend to pretty much anything that involves language processing. We can build more powerful tools using a shared base that is easily adaptable.</p> <p>I had always maintained private repos where I would experiment with ideas, but the original code that would become Rome was started at the beginning of 2017 while I was working for Facebook in my free time. I continued iterating and experimenting on the idea and building out all the different pieces, until 2019, when I was given the opportunity to work on and explore using it at Facebook full-time.</p> <p>I eventually left Facebook and the project became open source in February 2020 where I would continue it as an independent community-driven project.</p> <p>Rome is the spiritual successor of Babel. I’ve taken the lessons I learnt, and refined the mission. Rather than exposing a large public API for other tools to be built on, we are building them all in one place, with batteries included. I’m excited to be trying something new that the JavaScript and web ecosystem haven’t seen before.</p> <p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/sebmck">Sebastian McKenzie</a></p> </section>  </div> </section> </main> </div></div>]]>

We will learn about the different participants and their roles in the UPI ecosystem.</p><p><a href="https://the-other-side.blog/upi-the-transaction-lifecycle"><strong>Part 2:</strong></a> We take a deep-dive into UPI by tracing a UPI transaction from the beginning through the end.</p><p><strong><a href="https://the-other-side.blog/upi-the-settlement">Part 3:</a></strong> We will look at settlements and understand how money exchanges hands.</p><hr><h3 id="background">Background</h3><p>Since its inception in 2016, UPI has grown tremendously over the last 4 years. It has enabled a whole new set of individuals to transact digitally for the first time.</p><p>There were multiple attempts towards making India a cashless society. Earlier solutions were not simple to use and relied heavily on Netbanking facilities provided by the banks. The experience was not standard. Because of all these reasons, it was mostly used only by the tech-savvy population. India being a diverse country needed a system that has a plethora of payment apps that are optimised for different cohorts.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/06/upi_transaction_growth.png" alt="" width="1468" height="1088" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/upi_transaction_growth.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/upi_transaction_growth.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/06/upi_transaction_growth.png 1468w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Growth of UPI</figcaption></figure><p>The primary objective of UPI was to build an open payment system that is mobile-first, fast, and interoperable across different banks.</p><p>For a developing country like India, going mobile-first was almost a no brainer. Mobile Phones and Mobile Data were getting cheaper and the trend was clear.</p><p>Interoperability simply puts the user’s needs at the center. The users can opt for any payment app, link it with their bank account to engage in commerce with anyone across India.</p><p>Think about it, all of us want to use payment apps that we like, instead of being limited to a poorly designed app that’s provided by the bank where we keep our money. We should let banks do what they do best (which is managing money) and let tech companies handle building intuitive user interfaces for transacting money.</p><p>UPI was built on this principle to let private players innovate on top of public digital infrastructure.</p><h3 id="so-what-exactly-is-upi">So, What exactly is UPI?</h3><p>UPI is a payment markup language and a standard for interoperable payments in India.</p><p>To make the process of transacting money simple, UPI introduced the concept of human friendly unique IDs called UPI Virtual Payment Addresses (or VPAs). The VPAs are usually of the form <strong><em>&lt;unique_identifier&gt;</em></strong>@<strong><em>&lt;address_provider&gt;</em></strong>.</p><p>The UPI VPAs are similar to email addresses. They are interoperable. A gmail user can send an email to a yahoo user. </p><p>Some simple examples UPI VPAs are <strong><em>alice@ybl </em></strong>and<strong><em> bob@axis</em></strong>. Here, <strong><em>ybl</em></strong> and <strong><em>axis </em></strong>are two banks that provide virtual payment addresses. And, <strong><em>alice </em></strong>and<strong><em> bob </em></strong>are the unique identifiers in respective address providers.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/06/payment_markup.png" alt="" width="1600" height="1064" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/payment_markup.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/payment_markup.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/06/payment_markup.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>Just like how domains get resolved to IP addresses, every VPA needs to be linked to a bank account. The UPI handles get resolved to bank accounts and IFSC during the payment (we will see how).</p><p>In short, a UPI Virtual Payment Address serves as the addressing layer for a bank account.</p><p>There are mainly two types of transactions in the UPI realm.</p><h4 id="direct-payment">Direct Payment</h4><p>The payer (the sender) initiates the transaction. Typical examples would be, you paying a shopkeeper at the checkout by scanning a QR code or you sending money to your friends and family.</p><h4 id="collect-request">Collect Request</h4><p>The payee (the receiver) initiates the transaction. A simple example is a scenario where your landlord creates a collect request asking you to pay the monthly rent.</p><hr><h2 id="the-ecosystem">The Ecosystem</h2><p>There are three types of participants in the UPI ecosystem.</p><h3 id="the-banks">The Banks</h3><p>Banks hold your money. UPI works directly with the bank accounts, unlike Paytm, Venmo, or CashApp. The bank account will be debited from or credited to whenever you send money or receive money.</p><p>The banks that hold your money are also called <em>Issuing Banks</em>.</p><p>Every bank uses a system called Core Banking System (CBS) to manage its user’s accounts. At the core, CBS is a simple <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-crud" rel="noopener">CRUD</a> system built around user accounts.</p><p>Debit and Credit are the two fundamental operations of core banking software.The debit is when you’re taking money out of your account. The amount involved is subtracted from your balance. On the other hand, when you’re getting paid, its a credit. The money is added to your account.</p><p>Banks also maintain another UPI specific database. We will discuss more on that later.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/banks_intro.png" alt="" width="2328" height="1840" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/banks_intro.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/banks_intro.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/banks_intro.png 1600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/banks_intro.png 2328w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><h3 id="the-payment-apps">The Payment Apps</h3><p>Payment Apps are consumer-centric products that can be used to link a bank account and transact in the real world. Some major apps are Google Pay, PhonePe, BHIM, etc. Almost all the banks have their own versions of UPI Apps. There is a wide variety of options to chose from.</p><p>Payment Apps allow users to create handles to make everyday transactions easier. However, not everyone can start creating UPI handles. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates who can create UPI handles. Currently, only the member banks of the UPI ecosystem are allowed to do so.</p><p>That’s why all the payment apps will have to tie up with banks. These banks not only allow payment apps to create and manage UPI handles for their users, but they are also the interface to the UPI ecosystem.</p><p>These banks are called <em>Acquiring Banks</em>.</p><p>Google Pay has tied up with HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, and SBI. PhonePe has a tie-up with Yes Bank and ICICI Bank.</p><p>Banks provide separate APIs to allow payment apps to create and manage the UPI handles.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png" alt="" width="2540" height="1520" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png 1600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><h3 id="npci">NPCI</h3><p>National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is a non-profit set up by the Government of India to facilitate digital payments. They facilitate many payment schemes (like IMPS, BBPS, FASTag, etc.)</p><p>If we reflect back on the original objective of UPI, it was to build an interoperable system. An interoperable means anyone could download a payment app, link any bank (that they own), and transact with anyone else from any other bank.</p><p>One primitive way of building such an interoperable network would be to connect every payment app with every bank. As you’re probably guessing, that’s a very inefficient way of doing it, even if we assume something like that is possible. It practically not possible.</p><p>And, the only thing that’s constant in the software realm, is the fact that systems keep changing and breaking. Imagine the pain that everyone has to go through in reaching a consensus when configurations or infrastructures change. It would be chaos.</p><p>This approach is the same as building an Internet where your browser has to remember the IP address of every possible website on the planet, otherwise, you wouldn’t be able to access it.</p><p>Of course, the Internet is not built in this fashion. The job of resolving every web address into an IP address is taken out as a separate protocol called DNS. Our browsers trust the IP address resolved by the DNS servers used by our Internet Service Providers.</p><p>Introducing standardization and a trusted third party will result in a completely different architecture.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png" alt="" width="3000" height="1520" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png 1600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>That’s the route UPI creators took, they made NPCI as the trusted switch and they standardized the protocol. NPCI makes sure that data flow between banks and payment apps are routed to the correct and verified destinations.</p><p>The end result, the payment apps, and banks talk just to NPCI and can be assured by NPCI that they are really interacting with who they intend to.</p><p>To make this easy to understand, we made a GIF.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/npci_switch.gif" alt="" width="1200" height="851" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/npci_switch.gif 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/npci_switch.gif 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/npci_switch.gif 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>Apart from being the trusted router, NPCI also hosts non-financial meta APIs to serve everyone in the ecosystem.</p><p>Some examples of meta API are <em>listAccountProviders (returns all details of all banks), validateAddress (helps in validating VPAs), requestOtp (for 2FA), </em>etc.</p><p>NPCI has one more important role to play. It’s something to do with settlement. We will cover in the last part of the series.</p><hr><p>Before we wrap the first series, let's quickly visit authentication.</p><h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3><p>UPI uses 2-factor authentication. Commonly used factors are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication#Possession_factors" rel="noopener">possession factor</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication#Knowledge_factors" rel="noopener">knowledge factor</a>.</p><p>UPI being mobile-first, the possession factor (“what a user has”) is the user’s phone. It’s validated using the device fingerprint.</p><p>The knowledge factor (“what a user knows”) is the 4 digits or 6 digits UPI PIN.</p><p>The authentication scheme is designed to be flexible and can use different authentication factors in the future.</p><p>We will learn how these authentication factors are verified in the upcoming articles.</p><hr><p>That’s a wrap of the first part of the series.</p><p>We hope you enjoyed it. Share it with the intellectually curious folks in your circle. If you have any questions regarding UPI or anything related to Fintech in general, feel free to post them on our <a href="https://discuss.setu.co/">forum</a>.</p><p>In the <a href="https://the-other-side.blog/upi-the-transaction-lifecycle">next part</a> of the series, we will take a detailed look into how UPI transactions work. </p>

	<div>
		<h3>Why Firebase</h3>
<ul>
<li>Realtime / streaming updates are pretty easy.</li>
<li>Getting a whole app off the ground is fast – auth, email, versioning, hosting, monitoring, devops, uptime.</li>
<li>The data structure is JSON which maps perfectly to UI JavaScript.</li>
<li>Libraries across programming languages are similar and pretty good.</li>
<li>Cheap/free initially.</li>
<li>Easy-ish to integrate with analytics and crash monitoring.</li>
<li>All you need for the backend of a small mobile app.</li>
<li>While schemaless, it has some basic ability to validate data types.</li>
<li>It should scale very well with certain kinds of traffic (reads and writes are not on shared objects).</li>
<li>Minimal, or no, knowledge of devops/sysadmin is necessary.</li>
<li>They now have decent tools to migrate your data out of it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Not Firebase</h3>
<ul>
<li>Not a boring established technology.
<ul>
<li>You only get so many innovation tokens.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your entire backend is proprietary (BaaS), owned and run by another company. If they shut down Firebase, you have to rewrite everything on their timeline instead of moving it.
<ul>
<li>This happened with a nearly identical service called Parse.</li>
<li>Parse was purchased by Facebook, then shut down. (Google bought Firebase but seems to be investing in it, and its replacement).</li>
<li>Google shuts things down all the time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Firebase is somewhat deprecated in favor of Cloud Firestore.</li>
<li>Exceptionally expensive at scale compared to REST.</li>
<li>Not really possible to expose an API spec (swagger) with cloud functions.</li>
<li>Proprietary – complete lock-in:
<ul>
<li>Migrating off means rewriting all backend tests and much backend code. This is more dangerous than “just” rewriting the code and not the tests, because the tests make sure you didn’t mess something up during the migration.</li>
<li>Firebase is pretty unique in the way you interact with the APIs and realtime components, making a frontend migration a massive ordeal also.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Impossible to develop the app without an internet connection.</li>
<li>Security and data validation setup is tricky, and it cannot be unit tested.
<ul>
<li>Security and data validations are&nbsp;strings in a JSON file.</li>
<li>Must run security integration tests against a deployed app.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Having your main database public is a highly discouraged practice.
<ul>
<li>This may not be fully fair, but it is very easy to misconfigure things and expose data that shouldn’t be.</li>
<li>Normally databases are only listen on private interfaces or at least use IP restrictions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You must duplicate any business logic across all systems that interact with firebase.
<ul>
<li>Strong anti-pattern for architecture and maintenance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cloud functions are good for one-off tasks:
<ul>
<li>good for formatting a PDF invoice and sending it</li>
<li>good for processing a batch job</li>
<li>good for individual tasks delegated by a message bus</li>
<li>bad for a bunch of similar data update routes</li>
<li>bad for structuring and testing a large REST API</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unit testing firebase backend functions is way more complicated than a regular REST API.</li>
<li>Querying and aggregating are limited compared to SQL or popular NoSQL databases like MongoDB.</li>
<li>Transactions have some odd behavior – they might get “rerun” in the case of conflicts.</li>
<li>Database migrations are not supported at all.
<ul>
<li>red flag – basic service development</li>
<li>few band aid 3rd party open source solutions exist</li>
<li>means hand writing a migration framework that works with unit tests</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Firebase recommends duplicating data because JOINs are unsupported.
<ul>
<li>red flag – architecture</li>
<li>not a problem in other NoSQL databases</li>
<li>this is a core competency of relational databases (SQL)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Integration with outside APIs and maintaining good testing is not simple like a regular server
<ul>
<li>stripe for example: need to expose backend webhook routes, test them pretty well</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You are at the mercy of Firebase’s upgrade cycle.
<ul>
<li>If they decide to change or break something and force you to upgrade, you do not have a choice on the timeline, if there is one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Optimized for realtime apps.
<ul>
<li>Only a downside if you don’t have a realtime app.</li>
<li>Many of the realtime benefits of Firebase can be had with a plethora of popular open source technologies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Later services you write will likely not be written using firebase.
<ul>
<li>It reduces the surface area of your tech stack to pick a more boring database technology that will scale a long way and can be used for multiple services.</li>
<li>If you built your tech stack on say, Node.js or Go, each service would have similar paradigms.</li>
<li>With Firebase, now you have all the Firebase paradigms (coding, testing, build and deploying), plus your second service’s paradigms (coding, testing, build and deploying).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All these complaints are probably acceptable when you have a small mobile, a basic website or small ecommerce store, or something that will not grow beyond one server.</p>
<p>Building the core of a SaaS on Firebase, though, is not going to work. There are many blog posts about companies who hit a wall with Firebase, and eventually migrated off it. If you are building a SaaS, the question doesn’t seem to be&nbsp;<em>if</em> you will move off Firebase, but&nbsp;<em>when</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.prepear.com/">Prepear</a> is a meal planner and grocery list app that helps people discover recipes and more. It’s a spin off from the founders of <em><a href="https://www.superhealthykids.com/">Super Healthy Kids</a></em> and right now they saying its logo is under legal attack from Apple.</p>	
	
	
	
<p>It’s funny what Instagram accounts you follow as a parent at some point. Yesterday, we noticed <em>Super Healthy Kids</em> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDmcFEInZK7/">sharing a post</a> detailing their new legal woes with Apple.</p>
<p>According to the founders, Apple “has opposed the trademark application for our small business, Prepear, demanding that we change our obviously pear shaped logo, used to represent our brand in the recipe management and meal planning business.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.change.org/p/apple-save-the-pear-from-apple-end-apple-s-aggressive-opposition-of-small-businesses-with-fruit-logos?recruiter=1137882952&amp;recruited_by_id=ebcd47e0-d5d9-11ea-95f3-73a235808f2d&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=petition_dashboard">In a petition on Change.org</a>, Prepear goes on to say, “before attacking us, Apple has opposed dozens of other trademark applications filed by small businesses with fruit related logos. Many of those logos were changed or abandoned. Most small businesses cannot afford the tens of thousands of dollars it would cost to fight Apple.”</p>
<p>Prepear says they are a small company with only five staff and legal costs have already cost them “many thousands of dollars” plus laying off one team member, in their legal fight against the iPhone maker.</p>
<p>“It is a very terrifying experience to be legally attacked by one of the largest companies in the world, even when we have clearly done nothing wrong, and we understand why most companies just give in and change their logos,” adds Prepear in its plea for support.</p>
<p>Prepear says they “feel a moral obligation to take a stand against Apple’s aggressive legal action against small businesses and fight for the right to keep our logo. We are defending ourselves against Apple not only to keep our logo, but to send a message to big tech companies that bullying small businesses has consequences.”</p>
<p>So far, just over 8,200 signatures have been signed out of a goal of 10,000 on <a href="https://www.change.org/p/apple-save-the-pear-from-apple-end-apple-s-aggressive-opposition-of-small-businesses-with-fruit-logos?recruiter=1137882952&amp;recruited_by_id=ebcd47e0-d5d9-11ea-95f3-73a235808f2d&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=petition_dashboard">change.org</a>.</p>
<p>Looking at the two logos above, I can’t say the Prepear logo resembles the Apple logo at all. But of course, Apple feels different about that.</p>
<p>Prepear is a free app and available for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/prepear/id1248495163">download on iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.prepear.android&amp;hl=en_US">Android</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: You can check out Apple’s trademark opposition filed above (via <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/08/legal-action-against-company-with-pear-logo/">MacRumors</a></em>).</p>
<p><strong>Update August 9</strong>: Prepear’s COO, Russ Monson, told <em>iPhone in Canada</em> in an email more insight in regards to the company’s filing of their trademark for the ‘pear’ logo.</p>
<p>Monson says Prepear filed their trademark for the logo back in January 2017 and eventually was told by the U.S. Trademark office “that it was not in conflict with any other registered trademarks and that they would publish it for opposition.” Everything seemed good to go.</p>
<p>That was until on the “on the last day of the window to oppose the trademark we received notice that Apple had filed for an extension of the window to oppose, and they subsequently filed for additional extensions which put our trademark in legal limbo for an extended period of time.”</p>
<p>According to Monson, Apple filed their actual opposition on the final day they were legally allowed. Subsequent extensions filed result in more legal fees for a company like Prepear to take on, which they said “seemed designed by their legal team to be made as long, difficult, and expensive as possible for us.”</p>
<p>Monson goes on to explain Prepear was “naive enough” to think they could discuss the matter with Apple rationally, as both logos look different. But that wasn’t the case and the opposition has reached the ‘discovery phase’, which the COO says will “be the most expensive part of this case for us.”</p>
<p>After Apple filed to proceed to discovery phase, that’s what Prepear decided to start their petition. “We believe that this case is clearly frivolous, and that once the public is aware of Apple’s position on this that Apple will be more willing to drop the case rather than have the public see how they are clearly harming us for no apparent justifiable reason,” said Monson to <em>iPhone in Canada.</em></p>
<p>Prepear says they aren’t asking for a boycott of Apple products, but they are asking the iPhone maker to “stop attacking small businesses like ours in frivolous cases that seem designed to cause us to spend as much money and time thinking about the case instead of focusing on how to grow our business and ensure we survive the current economic crisis.”</p>
<p>Monson shared with<em> iPhone in Canada</em> some other oppositions Apple had previously filed against, in a similar fashion to what is happening them right now. These companies below gave up when Apple reached out, but Prepear says they are lucky to garner enough media attention “to expose this practice by Apple.”</p>

<p>Prepear says it will be handing its petition of signatures–which currently stands at nearly 19,000 signatures–to Apple soon and will be sharing updates on what happens. The company explains to <em>iPhone in Canada</em> it hopes Apple will drop the case before it gets to more expensive discovery and trial phases.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Blockchain and smart contract development are still relatively new and highly experimental. They require a different engineering mindset than traditional web, or app development where ‘move fast and break things’ has become the norm. </p>
<p>Blockchain development is much more like hardware, or financial service development. Smart contracts are complex instruments that offer the possibility to have self-enforcing contracts including transparent, tamper-proof, and immutable information. They have the authority to allocate high-value resources between complex systems. Often working autonomously. With huge financial loss at risk. This makes smart contracts critical components in these systems. Development of such components requires more investment, design, and effort upfront. Solid engineering practices, rigorous testing, and a strong security mindset. </p>
<p>In a series of blog posts, I’m planning to go through several patterns, practices, and principles that can be applied to blockchain and smart contract development to reduce the risks associated with it. </p>

<p>In this first article, I’ll cover more general engineering practices based on the concepts of Clean Code. Clean code is a well-known concept within the software development industry. <a href="https://amzn.to/30RsoKk">Robert C Martin, also known as ‘Uncle Bob’ wrote the famous handbook</a>. Its principles go back to even the earlier concepts of the Agile manifesto and software craftsmanship. It’s a knowledge base for the way we think, write, and read code. Build on decades of wisdom in software development. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Truth can only be found in one place: the code“</em> - Robert C. Martin </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clean code is code that is easy to read. Easy to understand. And easy to maintain. Clean code is an attempt to make sense of the complexity of systems that we’re dealing with. It’s a defense mechanism that can provide guidance when you’re not sure how a change would affect the codebase. While there’s valid criticism on the handbook and the examples are considered outdated, the principles are still very relevant. Especially for object-oriented languages, such as Solidity. They apply to designing and writing secure, open, and immutable code, such as smart contracts.  </p>

<h2>Naming</h2>
<p>The naming of contracts, functions, or variables should reveal the intention, why it exists, and how it is used. If a name requires comments to explain, then it doesn’t reveal its intent. </p>
<p>Be consistent in your naming throughout your code. Especially when you’re working with a large codebase. Use the same names for abstract concepts, throughout multiple contracts. </p>
<p>Use pronounceable names. </p>
<p>Use searchable names.</p>

<p><em>“There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.”</em> - Phil Karlton</p>

</ul>
<h2>Structure &amp; Ordering</h2>
<p>Ordering helps readers identify which functions they can call and to find the constructor and fallback definitions easier.</p>
<h3>Order of Layout</h3>
<p>Layout contract elements in the following order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pragma statements</li>
<li>Import statements</li>
<li>Interfaces</li>
<li>Libraries</li>
<li>Contracts</li>
</ol>
<p>Inside each contract, library or interface, use the following order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type declarations</li>
<li>State variables</li>
<li>Events</li>
<li>Functions</li>
</ol>
<h3>Ordering of Functions</h3>
<p>Functions should be grouped according to their visibility and ordered:</p>
<ol>
<li>constructor</li>
<li>receive function (if exists)</li>
<li>fallback function (if exists)</li>
<li>external</li>
<li>public</li>
<li>internal</li>
<li>private</li>
</ol>
<p>Explicitly label the visibility of functions and state variables. Functions can be specified as being <code>external</code>, <code>public</code>, <code>internal</code>, or <code>private</code>. Please understand the differences between them.</p>
<h3>Ordering of Modifiers</h3>
<p>The modifier order for a function should be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Visibility</li>
<li>Mutability</li>
<li>Virtual</li>
<li>Override</li>
<li>Custom modifiers</li>
</ol>

</ul>
<h2>Documentation &amp; Natspec</h2>
<p>Solidity contracts can have a form of comments that provide rich documentation to others reading the code as well as end-users. This is called the Ethereum Natural Language Specification Format, or <a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/natspec-format.html">NatSpec</a>.</p>
<p>This documentation is segmented into developer-focused messages and end-user-facing messages. These messages may be shown to the end-user (the human) at the time that they will interact with the contract (i.e. sign a transaction).</p>
<p>It is recommended that Solidity contracts are fully annotated using NatSpec for all public interfaces (everything in the ABI).</p>
<p><strong>References</strong></p>

<li><a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/natspec-format.html">NatSpec</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Formatting</h2>
<p>Reading code should be like reading this blog, an article, or a book. It should be well formatted. The Solidity style guide provides guidance for writing Solidity code. The goal for it is not to be the right or only way, but to be consistent. </p>
<p>Consistency can be enforced by using a linter. This not only provides formatting and style guide validation but also includes security validation.</p>
<p>Linters for Solidity</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/duaraghav8/Ethlint">Ethlint</a> (formerly Solium)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/protofire/solhint">Solhint</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/juanfranblanco/vscode-solidity/">VS Code Solidity</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Use a regular linter for your dapp development (e.g. eslint, depending on your language).</p>

</ul>
<h2>Contracts &amp; Data structures</h2>
<ul>
<li>Contracts expose behavior and hide data (in abstraction. Not actually hiding data from others. No data on the blockchain is actually hidden, see chapter Contracts). This makes it easy to add new kinds of objects without changing existing behaviors. It also makes it hard to add new behaviors to existing objects.</li>
<li>Data structures expose data and have no significant behavior. This makes it easy to add new behaviors to existing data structures but makes it hard to add new data structures to existing functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clear separation of the two is important, due to the contract’s immutability. If you want to add logic or deploy new contracts, you want to be able to utilize the existing data structures. Separating the two can be done by storage contracts. We’ll cover these in more detail in another blog post. </p>
<h2>Systems</h2>
<p>Keep it Simple Stupid (‘KISS’). Complexity increases the likelihood of errors and unexpected behavior. Contracts should have one responsibility, and only one reason to change, supporting the Single Responsibility Principle. It’s one of the most important concepts in OO design.</p>
<p>Keep your contracts small. Every line of code in a smart contract costs money to execute and storing data is expensive. A best practice is to store a pointer to data in a smart contract, rather than storing the data itself. For example, data can be stored using decentralized data storage providers such as IPFS.</p>
<p>Modularize your contracts to keep them small and utilize existing standards &amp; libraries (see ‘Standards &amp; Libraries’). </p>
<p>The same applies to functions. Functions should do one thing. They should do it well. They should do it only.</p>
<p>On blockchain everything is public. Private data and variables within a smart contract are not actually private. “Private” means within the execution scope of the contract, but the data is public and can be read by anyone. Keep this in mind when designing your programs.</p>
<p>Only use blockchain and smart contracts for the parts that need to be decentralized. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that.”</em> - Robert C. Martin </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Standards &amp; Libraries</h2>
<p>An intrinsic feature of smart contracts is its composability. Turning every contract into a component and potential building block that others can leverage. A lot of these building blocks exist already and standards ensure the ease of use and development. The most well-known standard was created for the emerging token ecosystem and the exchanges serving it: the ERC20 standard.</p>
<p>Before you dive in and start writing your own, custom smart contracts, it’s wise to check if any standards or open-source components exist. If such standard contracts exist and are properly tested and audited, they can minimize the risk in your programs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) describe standards for the Ethereum platform, including contract standards. <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/erc#final">Finalized ERC’s</a></li>
<li><a href="https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/">OpenZeppelin Contracts</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Error handling</h2>
<p>Exceptions are a crucial part of modern software engineering. They require special treatment and can be extremely powerful. Instead of fighting them, we should try to leverage them, as an unhandled exception may cause unexpected behavior. </p>
<p>When an exception is thrown in Solidity code, all state changes are rolled back and further execution is halted. Luckily, exception handling is built into Solidity (since 0.6). This is only available for external calls. </p>
<p>Provide enough context with your exception to determine the source and cause of your error. </p>
<p>Try to write tests that throw these exceptions.</p>
<p>Don’t return null. Don’t pass null to functions.</p>
<p>Guard Checks can help that the behavior of a smart contract and its input parameters are as expected.</p>
<p>Use <code>assert()</code>, <code>require()</code>, <code>revert()</code> properly. <strong>assert</strong> should be used to test for internal errors, and check invariants.
<strong>require</strong> should be used to test that inputs, contract state variables, or return values from external contracts are valid. </p>
<p>If a transaction doesn’t have enough gas to execute, the out of gas error is not caught.</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>The same rules for clean code, apply to testing. Clean tests are tests that are easy to read. Easy to understand. And easy to maintain. Tests help you keep your code flexible, maintainable, and reusable. They validate the behaviors, reduce the risks of making unintended changes, and save time debugging and writing your code. </p>
<h3>F.I.R.S.T</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fast</strong> — Test should fast enough so that you want to run them frequently. It should help speed up your development process, not hinder it</li>
<li><strong>Independent</strong> — Tests should be independent of each other and able to run in any order</li>
<li><strong>Repeatable</strong> — Tests should be repeatable in any environment</li>
<li>** Self-validating** — Tests should a clear (boolean) output if it passes. </li>
<li><strong>Timely</strong> — Tests need to be written in a timely fashion. Just before the production code. </li>
</ul>
<h3>AAA</h3>
<p>The AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern is one of the most common standards in software testing. It suggests dividing your tests into the corresponding …</p></section></div>

<p>This week I received the latest 14in laptop from Lenovo, the T14s (AMD gen1). Below are some of the tweaks / setup I’ve done on my machine (and generally all my laptops) which typically increase the battery life (with no noticeable reduction in performance).</p>

<p>The specs are as follows (Lenovo Thinkpad T14s):</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU – 8 Core, 16 Thread – AMD Ryzen 7 Pro 4750u</li>
<li>GPU – AMD Renoir</li>
<li>DISK – 2Tb – M.2 NVME SSD – 970 EVO Plus</li>
<li>RAM – 32 Gb</li>
<li>DISPLAY – 1080p low power (ISP)</li>
<li>KEYBOARD – backlit English</li>
</ul>
<p>As all my machines run on Arch Linux (with Gnome as the GUI), I went ahead and installed the latest build. It worked out of the box, no issues, was up in about an hour.</p>
<p>However, it does requires quite a few optimizations to get power consumption down on a laptop. The goal is always to maximize battery life, while enabling all the functions you’d normally do on a machine.</p>
<h2>BIOS</h2>
<p>On any new laptop, it’s often possible to disable features you don’t need in the BIOS. For instance, any 3rd party software and unused components (such as fingerprint scanner), Bluetooth, etc. can switched off. Often, this will power down those components and save battery.</p>
<p>In this case, I turned off the following components (it’s possible to turn them back on, if needed):</p>
<ul>
<li>Ethernet LAN</li>
<li>USB Port</li>
<li>Memory Card Slot</li>
<li>Smart Card Slot</li>
<li>Fingerprint Reader</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also some 3rd party software which apparently you can also uninstall:</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg"><img src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg" alt="" width="533" height="142" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg 780w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled-300x80.jpeg 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled-768x205.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg 780w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled-300x80.jpeg 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled-768x205.jpeg 768w"></a></p>
<p>That’s it! It’s possible to later turn on components if necessary. This should result in some minor reductions in power draw.</p>
<h2>TLP or PowerTop</h2>
<p>On the software side, the first step is to install <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Powertop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PowerTop</a>. This lets you manage and monitor <em>almost </em>everything you’ll need related to power consumption: turning off components, increasing system wakes, etc.</p>
<p>This can get rather complex, but for brevity: <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Powertop#Calibration_to_prevent_inaccurate_measurement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">start with calibrating PowerTop</a>. I should note, this will run several measurements, changing screen brightness, fan speed, etc. and will take some time (few minutes), so be prepared:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo powertop --calibrate
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Launch powertop with sudo:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo powertop</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Tab over to “Tunables” and turn on / off various recommendations. This can often result in 5-25% gains in battery life. To set all recommendations to “good”, utilize auto-tune:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo powertop --auto-tune</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This will automatically run all the possible recommendations.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’d like these changes to be persistent (aka not run the command every time you startup the laptop), it’s recommended you create a service:</p>
<pre>/etc/systemd/system/powertop.service</pre>

<p>Then enable the service:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo systemctl enable powertop.service</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This will automatically tune your computer to improve power utilization on boot (although it’ll slow the boot process 1-3 seconds).</p>
<p>It is also important to note that there is <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/TLP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TLP</a>, which also offers a similar service to PowerTop. There are some noticeable differences with TLP. TLP for instance, doesn’t shutdown all connected devices (i.e. PCI devices).</p>
<p>I personally chose TLP, but many other swear by PowerTop.</p>
<p>TLP requires a far more minimal setup:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo systemctl enable tlp.service</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2>Suspend vs Hibernate</h2>
<p>The next improvement that can dramatically improve the time between charges is modifying the suspend behavior.</p>
<p>Don’t know what suspend is?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suspend to RAM</strong> – Keep machine state in RAM. This requires keeping the RAM powered, but power is cut to other components of the system (keyboard, monitor, etc.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Essentially, when a laptop lid opens, it instantly boots, often before the laptop is fully ajar. This lets you get “right to work”, but that requires the RAM to be constantly powered.</p>
<p>There is an alternative method, often called <em>Suspend to Disk</em> or <em>Hibernation</em></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Hibernation (Suspend to Disk)</strong> – Saves the machine state into the <a href="https://www.linux.com/news/all-about-linux-swap-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>swap space</em></a> on disk and completely powers off the machine. When the lid is opened / machine is powered on, the machine state is loaded into RAM.</p></blockquote>
<p>The hibernation method can save power for very long periods, as it completely powers down the machine. The drawback is that (at least on my machine) it can take 10-30 seconds to boot into the prior state.</p>
<p>In addition, a <strong>swap file or partition is required</strong>. Note, it is recommend that the swap space is 2-3x than the available RAM.</p>
<p>The beauty, is it’s possible to marry the two methods called: <em>suspend-then-hibernate</em>. It’s possible to <em>suspend</em> for a duration of time (say one hour), then if the laptop isn’t brought out of <em>suspend</em> it will <em>hibernate</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suspend then Hibernate</strong> – Keep the machine state in RAM for a duration of time, then transition to <em>Hibernation</em> on disk.</p></blockquote>
<p>I should note, it’s also possible to do both <em>suspend</em> and <em>hibernate</em> at the same time, in the case of power loss.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suspend and Hibernate</strong> – The machine state is copied to the <em>swap space</em> and continues to be stored in RAM. The RAM will continue to draw power, but if power is lost the machine state can be recovered.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Closing the Lid</h2>
<p>The most effective power saving method (as discussed above) is to hibernate, every time.</p>
<p>However, it can be rather annoying to close a laptop, realize you need something, then reopen it and waiting 30 seconds for it to boot.</p>
<blockquote><p>Is a 30 second delay in booting your laptop worth the power savings?</p></blockquote>
<p>Honestly, most people should say it’s a worthy trade. Thirty seconds is a negligible amount of time, given we often open our laptops for hours.</p>
<p>That being said, there’s something primal about being able to open a laptop and being “ready-to-rock” in less than a few seconds. With that in mind, I used the <em>Suspend-then-Hibernate</em> configuration. The <em>suspend-then-hibernate</em> behavior will let the computer quickly boot for some specified amount of time (say 2 hours), after which it will enter the hibernation state.</p>
<h2>Hibernate Configuration</h2>
<p>First, to configure the <em>hibernate</em> behavior, simply edit the following files.</p>
<p>To get <em>hibernate</em> configured, inform GRUB where and how to swap. I personally recommend a swap partition over a swap file as the swap file appears to cause issues in some machines[<a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/6769/hibernate-and-resume-from-a-swap-file" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>].</p>
<p>To accomplish this, find the swap partition, and add the UUID to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT.</p>
<pre><strong>$ sudo lsblk</strong>
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
nvme0n1     259:0    0  1.8T  0 disk 
├─nvme0n1p1 259:1    0    1G  0 part  
├─nvme0n1p2 259:2    0   64G  0 part [SWAP]
└─nvme0n1p3 259:3    0  1.8T  0 part /
<strong>$ sudo lsblk -f | grep SWAP</strong>
├─nvme0n1p2 swap   1 &lt;UUID&gt;  [SWAP]</pre>
<p>Add the resume=UUID=&lt;PARTITION UUID&gt; to the following file:</p>
<pre>/etc/default/grub</pre>

<p>From there, you can start hibernating by adding the MAJ:MIN values for the swap partition to /sys/power/resume with the following command[<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate#Hibernation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>]:</p>
<pre>sudo echo 259:2 &gt; /sys/power/resume</pre>
<p>It should then be possible to hibernate.</p>
<p>To make the changes to GRUB on boot, execute the following:</p>
<pre>sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</pre>
<p>At this point, a reboot is recommended.</p>
<h2>Suspend-Then-Hibernate Configuration</h2>
<p>Once it’s possible to enter &amp; wake from the hibernation state, we can then transition to the <em>suspend-then-hibernate</em> step. For this, we have to configure systemd to handle entering <em>hibernation</em> from the <em>suspend</em> state after a given period.</p>
<p>There are two edits here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set a delay in the sleep.conf, which will inform systemd how long to stay in the suspend state before hibernating.</li>
<li>Inform systemd the behavior of the power switch, lid closing, and suspend state.</li>
</ol>
<p>See the file edits below:</p>
<pre>/etc/systemd/sleep.conf</pre>

<pre>/etc/systemd/logind.conf</pre>

<p>The above enables closing the lid or clicking power button to trigger a <em>suspend-then-hibernate state.</em> For the first 45 minutes (in this case), the machine state will be kept in RAM. After 45 minutes (in this case), the machine state will write to disk and power down.</p>
<p>When the lid is next opened, if the machine is in the&nbsp;<em>suspend</em> state (&lt;45 minutes), logging in will take a second or two. If the machine is in the <em>hibernation</em> state, the system will power up, load the machine state into RAM, then let you login (~25-30 seconds).</p>
<h2>Quickly Recovering from Hibernation</h2>
<p>One quick way to speed up recovering from hibernation is to reduce the time the grub menu is up. To edit this, go to:</p>
<pre>/etc/default/grub</pre>
<p>And edit the following command, I changed it from GRUB_TIMEOUT=5 to:</p>
<pre>GRUB_TIMEOUT=1</pre>
<p>This saves an addition 4 seconds on boot, although this does mean you’ll have to act fast if you need to utilize the grub menu. After that, you’ll have to execute the following command for it to take effect:</p>
<pre>sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</pre>
<p>Beyond speeding up GRUB, you can run the following command to analyze the boot up process via <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Improving_performance/Boot_process" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">systemd-analyze</a>:</p>
<pre>$ sudo systemd-analyze
Startup finished in 5.566s (firmware) + 2.088s (loader) 
+ 1.010s (kernel) + 9.702s (userspace) = 18.368s 
graphical.target reached after 9.614s in userspace</pre>
<p>To get a more detailed list use the blame or critical-chain argument:</p>
<pre>$ sudo systemd-analyze critical-chain
The time when unit became active or started is printed after the "@" character.
The time the unit took to start is printed after the "+" character.

<p>In this case, it appears the network manager is the real bottleneck. This is a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager#Enable_NetworkManager_Wait_Online" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">known issue</a>, and can be addressed by disabling the NetworkManager-wait-onine.service.

  <p>Containers need to communicate with each other and outside world.<br>
Docker has wide network capabilities.</p>
<p>What we can do with docker network? How to use it?</p>
<h2 id="docker-network-theory">Docker Network Theory</h2>
<p>What elements we have in docker network?</p>
<ul>
<li>CNM</li>
<li>libnetwork</li>
<li>drivers</li>
</ul>
<p>Docker network concept is based on open-source design specification called Container Network Model(CNM). CNM assume that network drivers should be pluggable.<br>
Docker CNM implementation is in <code>libnetwork</code> library.</p>
<p>What we can do with docker CNM?</p>
<ul>
<li>single-host bridges</li>
<li>multi-host overlay networks</li>
<li>networks plugged into VLAN’s</li>
<li>ingress networks with load balancing
Also we get auto service discovery for our containers.</li>
</ul>
<p>What elements we have in docker CNM implementation?</p>
<ul>
<li>sandboxes - container network stack - isolated - ethernet interfaces, ports, routing tables and DNS config</li>
<li>endpoint - virtual interfaces in containers - veth</li>
<li>networks - virtual switches(bridges) - connect endpoints</li>
</ul>
<p>What drivers are built-in by default into docker(Linux)?</p>
<ul>
<li>bridge</li>
<li>overlay</li>
<li>macvlan</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="single-host-network-bridge">Single-host network bridge</h2>
<p>By default docker creates one brigde after instalation.</p>
<p>All containers are by default connected to it unless we override it.<br>
To set another non-default network we use <code>--network</code> flag for <code>docker run</code>.</p>
<p>What is the diference between default bridge and user created one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Default brigde is less secure - provide less isolation - by default all containers will be connected to it</li>
<li>We can connect/disconnect containers from user defined bridges without restarting containers</li>
<li>Defualt bridge does not have DNS included - we must use IP in such network - on user defined bridge we get DNS(all containers added to bridge network automatically will be added also to DNS) - just connect container to bridge and you can talk with other containers in network by their names(works for named containers with <code>--name</code> at creation time)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can see that all default networks are local - what means that we can’t connect with them containers on multiple docker hosts.</p>

In such situation container will not get his own IP address and MAC(neither externally from docker host network, neither internally from network created by docker engine) - he will be reachable as he will be normal software running on our host.</p>
<p>This is good solution if we want to run some software that use network but we want to have full isolation of process(pid), mount(mnt), user and IPC namespaces.</p>
<p>To active such mode we use <code>--network=host</code> parameter to <code>docker run</code>.<br>
In this mode <code>--publish</code> doesn’t work - if service in container listen on port 80 - port 80 on docker host will be taken.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During the past few years, I’ve been involved in migrations from Xcode workspace based build system to Buck twice (Facebook and Snapchat). Both of these experiences took talented engineers multi-months work with many fixes upstreamed to get it work. Recently, I’ve been helping another company to migrate their iOS project from Xcode workspace based build system to Bazel. This experience may be relevant to other people, considering the <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/bazel-and-apple.html#migrating-to-bazel">Bazel guide</a> is quite light on details.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<p>Why in these companies, people choose to use alternative build tools such as Buck or Bazel but not Xcode? There are a few reasons:</p>

<h3 id="better-code-review-and-dependency-management">Better Code Review and Dependency Management</h3>

<p>Xcode stores its build configurations in both xcscheme files and pbxproj files. None of them are text-editor friendly and heavily rely on Xcode GUI for its configurations. There are ways to only use xcconfig, a text-based configuration file for pbxproj. But for many real-world projects, that is just the third place for build configurations rather than the only source of truth. As a result, configuration changes are impossible to review effectively in any popular web tools (GitHub / Gitlab / Gerrit).</p>

<p>Xcode does dependency management in implicit ways. Thus, you have to create xcworkspace to include all dependent sub-projects for build. This is problematic if you want to split your projects and tests into smaller manageable units. That often ends up with many xcworkspace projects and each need to have manual dependency management and being included in CI tool.</p>

<h3 id="better-caching-and-faster-build-speed">Better Caching and Faster Build Speed</h3>

<p>Xcode’s build cache management is quite incompetent. A change in the scheme can result in rebuilding from scratch. Switching between branches can often result in full rebuilding as well.</p>

<p>Bazel is a <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/release-engineering/#hermetic-builds-nqslhnid">hermetic build system</a>. If a file or its dependency doesn’t change, a rebuild won’t be triggered. Switching between branches won’t slow down the build because artifacts are cached by its content.</p>

<p>Bazel provided an upgrade path from its primitive disk-based cache system to <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/remote-caching.html">a distributed remote cache</a>. You can make a switch when the codebase grows or the team grows.</p>

<h3 id="better-modularization">Better Modularization</h3>

<p>Swift likes to have smaller modules. Having each module as its own project poses challenges in code review and dependency management. There are alternative solutions such as Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods. Both of them have their unique set of problems (SPM is often too opinionated, while CocoaPods is slow and invasive).</p>

<h2 id="when">When</h2>

<p>Engineering teams often have competing priorities. For many teams, it is unlikely that their starting point will be a Bazel-based project (hopefully this will change in the future). When to prioritize the migration to Bazel? I’ve read it somewhere a good summary on this, and will just put it here: <em>a good time to migrate to Bazel is when you about to need it</em>. If the team starts to feel the pain of Xcode-based build system (multi-minute build time, a ball of mud mono-project, or many small projects but with CI brokages many times every week), it can often take months to do the migration. On the other hand, when you have only 2 people developing an app, it is simply hard to judge the value proposition.</p>

<p>A semi mono-project, with 3 to 4 developers, and some external dependencies (~10 CocoaPods libraries) would be a good place to allocate 1 engineer-week to do the transition. That’s what I did here.</p>



<p>The first step of the migration is to set up the tools. We will use <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk">Bazelisk</a> to manage Bazel versions, and will symlink Bazelisk to <code>/usr/local/bin/bazel</code> for ease of access. For Xcode integration, we will use <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/tulsi">Tulsi</a>. It will be installed from source. Both tools are checked out under: <code>$HOME/${Company_Name}/devtools</code> directory. The installation is automated through scripts inside the repository.</p>

<h2 id="setup-repository-directory-structure">Setup Repository Directory Structure</h2>

<p>While it is possible to manage external dependencies through <code>WORKSPACE</code>, Bazel loves monorepo. Thus, we are going to vendoring almost all our dependencies into our repository. The repository will be reorganized from a one-project centric layout to a monorepo layout.</p>

<h2 id="the-migration">The Migration</h2>

<h3 id="bazel-basics">Bazel Basics</h3>

<p>If you haven’t, now is a good time to read the <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/bazel-and-apple.html">Bazel guide for iOS</a>. We first setup an <a href="https://gist.github.com/liuliu/5127262a28f77946908591fd176b90a8">ordinary <code>WORKSPACE</code> file</a> that has <code>rules_apple</code>, <code>rules_swift</code> and <code>xctestrunner</code> imported.</p>

<p>This will allow us to start to use <code>swift_library</code>, <code>swift_binary</code> and <code>ios_application</code> to quickly build iOS app using Bazel.</p>

<p>For Xcode integration, we use the <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/tulsi/blob/master/src/tools/generate_xcodeproj.sh"><code>generate_xcodeproj.sh</code></a> script to create Xcode project with Tulsi. The <code>tulsiproj</code> however, was never checked into our repository. This keeps our Bazel <code>BUILD</code> file the only source of truth for our build configurations.</p>

<p>At this step, we exhausted what we learned from the <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/bazel-and-apple.html">Bazel guide for iOS</a> and need to face some real-world challenges.</p>

<h3 id="cocoapods-dependencies">CocoaPods Dependencies</h3>

<p>It is hard to avoid CocoaPods if you do any kind of iOS development. It is certainly not the best, but it has accumulated enough popularity that everyone has a <code>.podspec</code> file somewhere in their open-source repository. Luckily, there is the <a href="https://github.com/pinterest/PodToBUILD">PodToBUILD</a> project from Pinterest to help alleviate the pain of manually converting a few CocoaPods dependencies to Bazel.</p>

<p>First, I use <code>pod install --verbose</code> to collect some information about the existing project’s CocoaPods dependency. <a href="https://gist.github.com/liuliu/0bba51a54ef8b1308cf74ef0769f4f82">This script</a> is used to parse the output and generate <code>Pods.WORKSPACE</code> file that PodToBUILD want to use. We use the <code>bazel run @rules_pods//:update_pods</code> to vendoring CocoaPods dependencies into the repository.</p>

<p>Some dependencies such as Google’s Protobuf already have <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/BUILD">Bazel support</a>. After vendoring, we can switch from PodToBUILD generated one to the official one. Some of the dependencies are just static / dynamic binary frameworks. We can just use <code>apple_dynamic_framework_import</code> / <code>apple_static_framework_import</code>. Pure Swift projects support in PodToBUILD is something to be desired. But luckily, we can simply use <code>swift_library</code> for these dependencies. They usually don’t have complicated setup.</p>

<p>Some do. Realm is a mix of C++17, static libraries (<code>librealm.a</code>) and Swift / Objective-C sources. We can still use PodToBUILD utilities to help, and it is a good time to introduce <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_swift/blob/master/doc/rules.md#swift_c_module"><code>swift_c_module</code></a> that can use <code>modulemap</code> file to create proper Swift imports.</p>

<p>The <strong>C++17</strong> portion is interesting because until this point, we used Bazel automatically created <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/toolchains.html">toolchains</a>. This toolchain, unfortunately, forced C++11 (at least for Bazel 3.4.1 on macOS 10.15). The solution is simple. You need to copy <code>bazel-$(YourProject)/external/local_config_cc</code> out into your own <code>common/bazel_tools</code> directory. Thus, we will no longer use the automatically generated toolchains configuration. You can modify C++11 to C++17 in the forked <code>local_config_cc</code> toolchain.</p>

<p>Here is what my <code>.bazelrc</code> looks like after CocoaPods dependencies migration:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

try-import .bazelrc.variant
try-import .bazelrc.local
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="the-application">The Application</h3>

<p>If everything goes well, depending on how many CocoaPods dependencies you have, you may end up on day 3 or day 5 now. At this point, you can build each of your CocoaPods dependencies individually. It is time to build the iOS app with Bazel.</p>

<p>There actually aren’t many gotchas for building in the simulator. Following the <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/bazel-and-apple.html">Bazel guide for iOS</a> and set up your dependencies properly, you should be able to run the app inside the simulator.</p>

<p>If you have any bridging header (which you should avoid as much as possible!), you can add <code>["-import-objc-header". "$(location YourBridgingHeader.h)"]</code> to your <code>swift_library</code>’s <code>copts</code>.</p>

<p>To run the app from the device, it may need some extra work. First, Bazel needs you to tell it the exact location of provisioning files. I elected to store development provisioning files directly in <code>ios/ProvisioningFiles</code> directory. With more people, this may be problematic to update, since each addition of device or developer certificate requires a regeneration of provisioning files. Alternatively, you can manage them through <a href="https://fastlane.tools/">Fastlane tools</a>.</p>

<p>iOS devices are often picky about the entitlements. Make sure you have the proper <code>application-identifier</code> key-value pair in your entitlements file.</p>

<p>If you use Xcode, now is a good time to introduce the <code>focus.py</code> script. This script will take a Bazel target, and generate / open the Xcode project for you. It is a good idea to have such a script to wrap around <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/tulsi/blob/master/src/tools/generate_xcodeproj.sh"><code>generate_xcodeproj.sh</code></a>. You will inevitably need some light modifications around the generated Xcode project or scheme files beyond what Tulsi is capable of. <a href="https://gist.github.com/liuliu/ccbbfe94fed7bfe07148a6ffd200b06e">Here is mine</a>.</p>

<p>You can use such script like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>./focus.py ios/Apps/Project:Project
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="dynamic-frameworks">Dynamic Frameworks</h4>

<p><code>rules_apple</code> in 04/2020 <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/issues/746">introduced a bug that won’t codesign dynamic frameworks properly</a>. It is not a big deal for people that have no dynamic framework dependency (you should strive to be that person!). For many mortals, this is problematic. Simply switching to <code>rules_apple</code> prior to that commit will fix the issue.</p>

<h3 id="tests">Tests</h3>

<p>Bazel, as it turns out, has fantastic support for simulator-based tests. I still remember the days to debug Buck issues around hosted unit tests and alike.</p>

<p>Many projects may start with something called <em>Hosted Tests</em> in the Xcode world. It is quick and dirty. With <em>Hosted Tests</em>, you have full access to UIKit, you can even write fancy <a href="https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing">SnapshotTesting</a>. However, now is a good time for you to separate your tests out into two camps: a library test and a hosted test.</p>

<p>A library test in Bazel is a <code>ios_unit_test</code> without <code>test…</code></p></div></div>

<p>A few years back, I did some work for a sensor network startup. Since then, I’ve always been on the lookout for new sensor hardware and tools. I just moved into a new apartment, and discovered the VegeHub when searching for soil moisture sensors to use on my flower boxes.</p>

<p>The VegeHub supports sending your data to a few online storage providers (a.k.a <em>The Cloud</em>), or to a custom web service. I considered adding support to <a href="https://bigsense.io/">BigSense</a>, a sensor web service I wrote in <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/tech/video/big-sense-rest-web-services-in-scala-for-sensor-networks-wellington-java-user-group/">Scala</a>. Instead, I decided it would be a good time to experiment with a time series database. I wrote a small Python Flask application called <a href="https://gitlab.com/djsumdog/senseflux">SenseFlux</a> to store VegeHub data in InfluxDB. In this post, I’ll show you how you can setup SenseFlux and InfluxDB using <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/tech/my-love-hate-relationship-with-docker-and-container-orchestration-systems/">Docker</a>, and graph sensor data using chronograf. Let’s get started.</p>

<p>The VegeHub’s web interface allows you to set a custom web service endpoint, an API Key and a Channel ID. The Channel ID is what SenseFlux will use to identify the sensor data and store it InfluxDB. SenseFlux will also use the API key for validation.</p>

<p>SenseFlux is a Python application which uses <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">Flask</a> for its application framework and <a href="https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/stable/">Waitress</a> for its web server. It can accept data from a VegeHub sent to the <code>/create/vghub</code> endpoint. The data is stored in InfluxDB and can be viewed using tools like Chronograf. The easiest way to get started is to run these components in Docker containers. The following establishes a Docker network and then creates the appropriate containers for InfluxDB and SenseFlux, exposing the SenseFlux port on the host machine.</p>

<pre>docker network create sensenet

docker run -d --name influx-sf --network sensenet \
    -e INFLUXDB_USER=influx \
    -e INFLUXDB_USER_PASSWORD=&lt;SecurePassword&gt; \
    -v influx-state:/var/lib/influxdb \
    influxdb

docker run -d --name senseflux-sf --network sensenet -p 8003:8003 \
    -e SF_API_KEY=TESTKey \
    -e INFLUXDB_HOST=influx-sf \
    -e INFLUXDB_USER=influx \
    -e INFLUXDB_PASSWORD=&lt;SecurePassword&gt; battlepenguin/senseflux:v0.0.9 \
    -e FIELD1=Humidity \
    -e FIELD2=SoilTemperature \
    -e FIELD3=SoilMoisture \
    -e FIELD4=Darkness
    -e FIELD5=Battery

</pre>

<p>In the above example, create a secure password for <code>&lt;SecurePassword&gt;</code>, and set each field input to the appropriate sensor type. Ensure the <code>SF_API_KEY</code> matched what’s configured on the VegeHub. Fields that are not defined will default to the type <code>Voltage</code>, scaling the range of 0.0 to 3.0 volts to a number between 0 and 100.</p>

<p>The VegeHub Wi-Fi was the most expensive component of this setup at $140. It comes with firmware that has a web interface for configuration. It’s not a general purpose device and the software on it is closed source and proprietary.</p>

<p>For comparison, a Raspberry Pi or Beagle Bone would be between $35 ~ $65 depending on the model. Single Board Computers (SBCs) are more general purpose devices, and would need <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/tech/video/ltsense-using-embedded-python-for-sensor-networks-wellington-python-user-group/">additional software</a> and configuration to become a sensor relay. SBCs also consume considerably more power, would not run nearly as long with similar batteries, and additional hardware would be needed to turn the device on and off at regular intervals to read sensor data in order to conserve battery. Embedded hardware like an Arduino might be a more comparable device when it comes to storage and power consumption.</p>

      Inside of VegeHub Wi-Fi Module

<p>The built in Wi-Fi is unable to see 5Ghz wireless access points, so you must have a <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/tech/building-a-thin-itx-router/">Wi-Fi router</a> that supports either 2.4Ghz or dual 2.4Ghz/5Ghz configurations. The range of its Wi-Fi is not very good. I had to move my router about a meter closer to my balcony so the VegeHub could make reliable connections. Sometimes it would stop reporting for hours and I’d have to open the case, just so it could establish a reliable signal. I do live in an apartment, so there may be noise and interference issues. It can store 64 samples per channel in the event it can’t communicate with SenseFlux. If you use the default sample rate of 5 minutes, it can cache about five and a half hours worth of samples.</p>

<p>The VegeHub supports transmitting data over SSL/TLS, but it only appears to have certificates for the major hosting providers it supports. I could not get the VegeHub to send data to an instance of SenseFlux secured by LetsEncrypt certificates. I suspect the limited storage on the VegeHub doesn’t allow for it to have many of the standard certificate authorities found in most operating systems and web browsers. Their website does have instructions for flashing your own certificates via its USB interface, however I didn’t attempt this myself.</p>

      VegeHub Wi-Fi, Battery Box and Sensors

</figure>

<p>The VegeHub has minimal setup and can start logging data to one of its supported cloud providers right out of the box. It does provide an easy way to collect sensor, however the software lacks useful error messages via the web interface. If I were making suggestions to the VegeHub engineers, I’d suggest the following feature set in their next release:</p>

<ul>
  <li>External waterproof Wi-Fi antenna</li>
  <li>More on-board storage</li>
  <li>Better diagnostics via the web interface</li>
  <li>Include all standard SSL certificates</li>
</ul>

<p>Even with these limitations, the VegeHub is still an okay solution. Be sure you have a powerful Wi-Fi access point very close to the device, and change the defaults to a higher refresh interval, in order to minimize data loss.</p>

<h3 id="chronograf">Chronograf</h3>

<p>You can use the following to launch a Chronograf container to read and graph data out of InfluxDB.</p>

<pre>docker run --name chronograf-sf --network sensenet -p 8888:8888 \
  -v chronograf-state:/var/lib/chronograf \
  -e INFLUXDB_URL=http://influx-sf:8086 \
  -e INFLUXDB_USERNAME=influx \
  -e INFLUXDB_PASSWORD=&lt;SecurePassword&gt; \
  chronograf
</pre>

<p>This will expose a web interface at port 8888, which can be used to create graphs and dashboards. The following is a dashboard I created for the VegeHub Sensors.</p>

</figure>

<p>The soil temperature, humidity and light saturation sensors returned reasonable data and pretty much work as expected. The battery sensor has fewer data points as it’s only recorded whenever the VegeHub sends data. I’m assuming it is a simple voltage sensor, which can vary due to the temperature of the batteries.</p>

<p>At first, the soil moisture sensor seemed to continually send a voltage of 3.3, which turned into a reading of 109%. It was recording 0 when it wasn’t in my flower box, so I thought there may have been a short. After repositioning the sensor, I started to get readings between 7% to 9%. I don’t have another soil moisture sensor to compare it to, so I’m not sure how accurate the readings are.</p>

<h3 id="influxdb">InfluxDB</h3>

<p>In my <a href="https://bigsense.io/">previous sensor network project</a>, I created a web service that could use either MySQL, Postgres or Microsoft SQL as a data storage backend. SenseFlux is my first attempt at using a time series database. An early bug in SenseFlux caused data to be stored as strings instead of floats<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, and InfluxDB doesn’t allow for changing a schema or casing from strings back to numeric types<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. I ended up having to export the entire database and write a script to reload the data. During my development process, I discovered the following InfluxDB limitations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Schema cannot be modified once created</li>
  <li>No ability to delete specific old or invalid records</li>
  <li>Old data is only deleted if it’s configured to expire</li>
</ul>

<p>InfluxDB has very specific use cases for reading measures from hundreds or thousands of sensors at high intervals. It’s commonly found in devops applications for monitoring data from virtual machines, such as CPU and disk space usage. It’s also used for storing readings from sensors in data centers, such as cabinet temperature or network switch throughput. It works well in situations where old data needs to expire at regular intervals, but it may not be the best tool for measuring inputs from environmental sensors, which tend to have much lower sample rates. InfluxDB may be better suited for large deployments of agriculture sensors.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>This was a fun project. I got to try out a new device, write some code and create some pretty graphs. I’d be hesitant to recommend the VegeHub at this point, due to the Wi-Fi connectivity, firmware limitations and data transmission issues. However, I think the device is a good idea and consumers need more products that allow their data to be processed by a variety of services, as well as the ability to keep and host the data themselves. <a href="https://gitlab.com/djsumdog/senseflux">SenseFlux</a> is a simple example of how to write middleware that can transform sensor data, so it can be stored and viewed with a variety of existing open source tools.</p>

<p>This year we released the first version of <a href="https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/">Beekeeper Studio</a>, a cross-platform SQL editor and database manager. It is like VSCode, but for SQL.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/assets/img/screenshots/main-dark-9e3099be326f5ba8f2389545e6811e9dda80ae842f210450385226f7cf3cc817.png" integrity="sha256-njCZvjJvW6jyOJVF5oEendqAroQvIQRQOFIm9888yBc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></p>

<p>Beekeeper Studio is built with <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a>, a cross-platform desktop app development framework built on top of <a href="https://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a> and <a href="https://www.chromium.org/">Chromium</a>.</p>

<p>I did most of my Beekeeper Studio development work in Ubuntu, running natively inside Windows, using the <a href="https://ubuntu.com/wsl">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>.</p>

<p>WSL provides an awesome tech-stack, so in this article I’ll show you how to set up your WSL2 environment for cross-platform development.</p>

<h2 id="quick-introduction-to-wsl-2">Quick introduction to WSL 2</h2>

<p>WSL, or the Windows Subsystem for Linux, is an official component of Windows 10 that runs a full build of Linux right inside of Windows.</p>

<p>I’ve been using <strong>WSL 2</strong>, which was officially released in the <code>2004</code> Windows update earlier this year. While WSL 1 had a slow filesystem and some package compatibility issues, WSL 2 is a full-blown Ubuntu linux install, so out of the box everything that works on Linux, works on Windows.</p>

<p>For this guide, I’m assuming you’re using Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 on WSL 2.</p>

<p>Once we have WSL 2 installed, we can boot it up (I also installed neofetch).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/assets/img/wsl-terminal-41f38b9308a70979cf5d6a15cd52b1ceb1a710fad9f0f763e5f105fc0e1f0def.png" integrity="sha256-QfOLkwinCXnPXWoVzVKxzrGnEPrZ8Pdj5fEF/A4fDe8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></p>

<p>Double check you’re running WSL 2, by opening Powershell and typing <code>wsl -l -v</code>, if not, upgrade with <code>wsl --set-version Ubuntu-20.04 2</code>.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-an-electron-friendly-wsl-2-environment">Setting up an Electron friendly WSL 2 environment</h2>

<p>Here is the shopping list of things we need:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Dark Mode</li>
  <li>Basic development tools (git, node, etc)</li>
  <li>An electron project</li>
  <li>Some way to view the electron app</li>
  <li>A code editor (not in the terminal)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="1-dark-mode">1. Dark Mode</h2>

<p>I’m only joking, but not really, go <a href="https://www.hellotech.com/guide/for/how-to-enable-dark-mode-in-windows-10">enable dark mode</a> first.</p>



<p>This is easy, we’re in Ubuntu! Lets just install a bunch of things we know we’ll need.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt update <span># this takes a while the first time</span>
<span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>nodejs git npm <span># ~200mb of packages</span>
<span>sudo </span>npm <span>install</span> <span>-g</span> yarn <span># Yarn is so much faster</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="3-setting-up-electron">3. Setting up Electron</h2>

<p>Then lets make a quick Electron project. I think the easiest way to make an Electron app is with <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>, the <a href="https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html">Vue CLI</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/nklayman/vue-cli-plugin-electron-builder">Vue Cli Electron Builder</a> plugin. Let’s go.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># system libraries needed for electron</span>
<span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>libnss3-dev libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libxss-dev
<span># install vue cli</span>
<span>sudo </span>yarn global add @vue/cli

<span># create a project.</span>
<span># follow instructions here https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/creating-a-project.html#vue-create</span>
vue create <span>--default</span> my_app
<span>cd </span>my_app
vue add electron-builder
<span># install dependencies</span>
yarn <span>install</span>

<span># That's it!! We have a fully working electorn app. Lets run it:</span>

yarn run electron:serve

<span># NOTHING HAPPENS!? Where's the app window?</span>
<span># There's no way for Ubuntu or Windows to display it!</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point we should be able to see our app window, but we can’t. Why not?</p>

<h2 id="4-viewing-linux-apps-in-windows">4. Viewing Linux Apps in Windows</h2>

<p>Out of the box, WSL 2 does not have a window manager in which to display linux apps, so we’ll have to install one, and configure WSL 2 to use it.</p>

<p>Hopefully in future this will be supported out-of-the box, until then, we’ll have to install our own.</p>

<p>What we need is called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X Server</a>. Searching online for ‘WSL X server’ will yield a bunch of conflicting advice about which one to use. Just skip all that and install <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/">VcsXsrv</a>. Yes I know that is a SourceForge link, just do yourself a favor and install it using <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/vcxsrv">Chocolatey</a>.</p>

<p>There are also guides about running a whole <a href="https://autoize.com/xfce4-desktop-environment-and-x-server-for-ubuntu-on-wsl-2/">Linux desktop environment</a>. Running a full desktop environment is totally overkill and not at all nessecery for our purposes.</p>

<p>To configure VcsXsrv you’ll need two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An VcsXsrv config</li>
  <li>An environment variable inside Ubuntu to tell it where to find the X Server</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="vcsxsrv-config">VcsXsrv Config</h3>

<p>Open <code>VcsXsrv</code> and it’ll guide you through three config screens. Here’s what to pick on each one:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Choose Multiple Windows</li>
  <li>Choose ‘Start no client’</li>
  <li>Choose Clipboard and OpenGL integration, plus provide <code>-ac</code> as additional arguments</li>
</ol>

<p>Save your config in your home directory for eash launching, then start the server. You’ll see the little <code>X</code> logo in your system tray. We’re ready to go.</p>

<h3 id="wsl-config">WSL Config</h3>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Add the following lines to your ~/.bashrc file:</span>

<span>export </span><span>DISPLAY</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span><span>cat</span> /etc/resolv.conf | <span>grep </span>nameserver | <span>awk</span> <span>'{print $2}'</span><span>)</span>:0
<span>export </span><span>LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT</span><span>=</span><span>true</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To test that you have everything working, you can try starting an app. Lets try the basic x11 apps to make sure everything is working.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>x11-apps

xcalc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You should see the gorgeous x11 calc window.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/assets/img/xcalc-ab2c6e4475a874ab280cb9eb0b59f5aa9ab31fd9c5fa57d0e94c9a8c1cec6761.png" integrity="sha256-qyxuRHWodKsoDLnrC1n1qpqzH9nF+lfQ6UyajBzsZ2E=" crossorigin="anonymous"></p>

<p>Hey, that actually looks pretty good! Who needs the new Windows calculator anyway.</p>

<p>Oh wait, do you have a Hi-DPI screen and everything looks blurry? Ok you should follow <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1370361/blurry-fonts-on-using-windows-default-scaling-with-wsl-gui-applications-hidpi">this Stackoverflow post</a> to stop the blur, or alternatively use <a href="https://x410.dev/">X410</a> instead of vcsXsrv which supports hiDPI screens out of the box (but is a paid app). I simply disabled all dpi-scaling for vcsXsrv windows as I only have a 1080 screen.</p>

<h3 id="running-our-electron-app">Running Our Electron App</h3>

<p>Now we can run our electron dev server again.</p>



<p>You’ll see a bunch of build messages, and if you’re lucky, you should now see your Electron app in all it’s glory</p>

<p><img src="https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/assets/img/electron-window-cdb85ecb0c8b49fc4420c313767e7e332a6f1185fe5c5cea9934b2cb5c33fb1f.png" integrity="sha256-zbheywyLSfxEIMMTdn5+MypvEYX+XFzqmTSyy1wz+x8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></p>

<p>Great! Now when you make changes to your app it will auto-reload.</p>

<p>You can use <code>yarn run electron:build</code> command to create linux binaries.</p>



<p>You might think (like I did) that you can just use your normal Windows apps to interact with your new electron code. Well you can, sort-of, but the performance is terrible, like you’re editing code on a network drive (you are).</p>

<p>It’s best to think of your WSL environment as a totally separate place that simply co-exists alongside Windows. They’re like two cars side by side on the highway.</p>

<p>There are two ways to set up a code editor:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use the linux version of your favorite editor</li>
  <li>Use VSCode and the <code>Remote - WSL</code> extension</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="linux-apps">Linux Apps</h3>
<p>The only way to use whatever app you want is to run it in Linux.</p>

<p>Personally I commonly use Sublime Text and IntelliJ IDEA for code editing. So I installed them into the WSL environment, see for example the <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/linux_repositories.html">Linux instructions for Sublime Text</a>.</p>

<p>One limitation is you have to start the editor using the terminal, for Sublime that means you execute the <code>subl</code> command. Another limitation is that WSL 2 does not currently support <code>snap</code> packages, so make sure you use <code>deb</code> or <code>AppImage</code> versions of whatever app you need.</p>

<p>Here’s a fun screenshot of Windows Sublime next to Linux sublime. They’re basically identical in form and function, you’d have a hard time telling the difference.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/assets/img/two-sublimes-58b9472c8b1408bb5a7c11ea1aa585feb74db165cbff97d7f44dfd957c93eeda.png" integrity="sha256-WLlHLIsUCLtafBHqGqWF/rdNsWXL/5fX9E39lXyT7to=" crossorigin="anonymous"></p>

<p>Don’t worry about the performance of these apps, IntelliJ is a heavy-weight IDE, and it works great with this set-up.</p>

<h3 id="vscode">VSCode</h3>

<p>VSCode offers something unique. There’s an extension you can install for Windows-VSCode called ‘Remote - WSL’. This allows you to just use the regular Windows VSCode. Once installed, you can open a directory in your linux terminal with <code>code .</code>, and it will magically open in Windows VSCode.</p>

<p>It works great, and is a fantastic show piece of how deeper WSL2 integration could happen for other apps in the future.</p>

<p>Here’s me editing this blog post in VSCode running against WSL:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/assets/img/vscode-wsl-80362603245161dd02b52194ec315d741fb81d97d37fabd308622db342b896fb.png" integrity="sha256-gDYmAyRRYd0CtSGU7DFddB+4HZfTf6vTCGIts0K4lvs=" crossorigin="anonymous"></p>

<h2 id="wsl-gotchas">WSL Gotchas</h2>

<p>While WSL truly is fantastic, it’s still an early technology not without some quirks. Here are a few things that might happen, and how to fix them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>X Windows close on suspend.</strong> Yes, if you suspend your laptop your GUI windows from WSL will disappear. It’s frustrating. For Sublime Text simply start them again with <code>subl</code> from the terminal</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>HiDPI futzing.</strong> If you have a High DPI screen you might need to tweak things a bit to get linux windows looking good. This is a one time thing, but still something to watch out for. Paying for X410 fixes this, and Microsoft plans to fix this themselves in an upcoming release.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Separate Firewalls.</strong> WSL runs in its own virtual network. This means it does NOT respect your Windows proxy or firewall configurations. If you are behind a corporate firewall and you try to <code>apt install</code> you’ll get an error. There’s not a good workaround here other than manually figuring out your particular organization’s primary firewall settings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>VM Memory Growth.</strong> If you run some memory-heavy processes in WSL, Windows might not be able to reclaim the memory they used. You should see an entry in your system monitor for <code>vmmem</code>, which rarely goes down (but it does go up). If it gets too large you have to restart your machine, or at least restart the WSL instance. As I write this mine is at 4gb, although I haven’t restarted in a week. You can kill running WSL processes with <code>wsl --terminate</code>, then just open a new bash shell.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2>

<p>Hopefully you should be well on your way to building Electron apps in Windows with WSL 2. I’ve found running Ubuntu under Windows to be a dream, and has prompted my return to Windows as my primary OS for the first time in a decade.</p>

This could enable wearers to safely reuse limited supplies of the respirators, originally intended to be one-time-use items.</p><p>Led by civil and environmental engineering professors Thanh “Helen” Nguyen and Vishal Verma, the researchers published their findings in the journal Environmental Science and Technology Letters.</p><p>N95 respirator masks are the gold standard of personal protective equipment that protect the wearer against airborne droplets and particles, such as the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.</p><p>“A cloth mask or surgical mask protects others from droplets the wearer might expel, but a respirator mask protects the wearer by filtering out smaller particles that might carry the virus,” Nguyen said.</p><p>High demand during the COVID-19 pandemic has created severe shortages for health care providers and other essential workers, prompting a search for creative approaches to sanitization.</p><p>“There are many different ways to sterilize something, but most of them will destroy the filtration or the fit of an N95 respirator,” Verma said. “Any sanitation method would need to decontaminate all surfaces of the respirator, but equally important is maintaining the filtration efficacy and the fit of the respirator to the face of the wearer. Otherwise, it will not offer the right protection.”</p><p>The researchers hypothesized that dry heat might be a method to meet all three criteria - decontamination, filtration and fit - without requiring special preparation or leaving any chemical residue. They also wanted to find a method that would be widely accessible for people at home. They decided to test an electric cooker, a type of device many people have in their pantries.</p><p>They verified that one cooking cycle, which maintains the contents of the cooker at around 100 degrees Celsius or 212 Fahrenheit for 50 minutes, decontaminated the masks, inside and out, from four different classes of virus, including a coronavirus - and did so more effectively than ultraviolet light. Then, they tested the filtration and fit.</p><p>“We built a chamber in my aerosol-testing lab specifically to look at the filtration of the N95 respirators, and measured particles going through it,” Verma said. “The respirators maintained their filtration capacity of more than 95% and kept their fit, still properly seated on the wearer’s face, even after 20 cycles of decontamination in the electric cooker.”</p><p>The researchers created a <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2Fo7-k0EIR0To&amp;t=ODMzZDEzMGY3NDlhZTIzNTE0OTVmMTU0Nzk5NTllZDJiNjI1ZWFlNCw4aHZGVTRCSw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F625900390129500160%2Fn95-mask-sanitization-in-electric-cooker&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1597119587">video</a> demonstrating the method. They note that the heat must be dry heat - no water added to the cooker, the temperature should be maintained at 100 degrees Celsius for 50 minutes and a small towel should cover the bottom of the cooker to keep any part of the respirator from coming into direct contact with the heating element. However, multiple masks can be stacked to fit inside the cooker at the same time, Nguyen said.</p><figure></figure><p><i>Video:&nbsp;“Sanitizing N95 respirator masks in an electric multi-cooker” by&nbsp;NewsAtIllinois, <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2Fo7-k0EIR0To&amp;t=ODMzZDEzMGY3NDlhZTIzNTE0OTVmMTU0Nzk5NTllZDJiNjI1ZWFlNCw4aHZGVTRCSw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F625900390129500160%2Fn95-mask-sanitization-in-electric-cooker&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1597119587">YouTube</a>.</i></p><p>The researchers see potential for the electric-cooker method to be useful for health care workers and first responders, especially those in smaller clinics or hospitals that do not have access to large-scale heat sanitization equipment.

		<p>From the <em>September 1991</em> issue of <em>Scientific American</em>, pp.       54, 58.</p>
<p><strong>PROFILE: DAVID A. HUFFMAN</strong></p>
<p>Encoding the “Neatness” of Ones and Zeroes</p>
<p>Large networks of IBM computers use it. So do high-definition       television, modems and a popular electronic device that takes the brain       work out of programming a videocassette recorder. All these digital       wonders rely on the results of a 40-year-old term paper by a modest       Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate student—a data       compression scheme known as Huffman encoding.</p>
<p>In 1951 David A. Huffman and his classmates in an electrical       engineering graduate course on information theory were given the choice       of a term paper or a final exam. For the term paper, Huffman’s       professor, Robert M. Fano, had assigned what at first appeared to be a       simple problem. Students were asked to find the most efficient method       of representing numbers, letters or other symbols using a binary code.       Besides being a nimble intellectual exercise, finding such a code would       enable information to be compressed for transmission over a computer       network or for storage in a computer’s memory.</p>
<p>Huffman worked on the problem for months, developing a number of       approaches, but none that he could prove to be the most efficient.       Finally, he despaired of ever reaching a solution and decided to start       studying for the final. Just as he was throwing his notes in the       garbage, the solution came to him. “It was the most singular moment of       my life,” Huffman says. “There was the absolute lightning of sudden       realization.”</p>
<p>That epiphany added Huffman to the legion of largely anonymous       engineers whose innovative thinking forms the technical underpinnings       for the accoutrements of modem living—in his case, from facsimile       machines to modems and a myriad of other devices. “Huffman code is one       of the fundamental ideas that people in computer science and data       communications are using all the time,” says Donald E. Knuth of       Stanford University, who is the author of the multivolume series <em>The       Art of Computer Programming</em>.</p>
<p>Huffman says he might never have tried his hand at the problem—much       less solved it at the age of 25—if he had known that Fano, his       professor, and Claude E. Shannon, the creator of information theory,       had struggled with it. “It was my luck to be there at the right time       and also not have my professor discourage me by telling me that other       good people had struggled with this problem,” he says.</p>

<p>Like many codes, including the one named after Samuel Morse, Huffman’s       creation tried to find a way to assign the shortest codes to those       characters used most, the longest codes being reserved for those used       rarely if at all. This process was carried out by forming a so-called       coding tree, in which the probability that a number, letter or another       character will occur is designated as a leaf on a tree.</p>
<p>The two lowest probabilities are summed to form a new probability.       Combining of probabilities continues along the branches of the tree       until the last two numbers add up to 1.0, which forms the tree root.       Each probability is a leaf, and each branch of the tree is assigned a       zero or a one. Code words are formed by moving along the branches from       the root to the top of the tree, aggregating the binary digits along       the way.</p>
<p>If letters are to be encoded, an <em>E</em>, which might have a       probability of 0.13, could be represented by the code <em>101</em>. The       three-digit code is constructed by moving from the root along three       branches—marking a <em>1</em>, <em>0</em> and <em>1</em>, respectively—to       reach the leaf that corresponds to 0.13. The <em>E</em> receives a       shorter code than a <em>Q</em>, a letter that occurs less frequently. By       systematically employing codes of varying length, Huffman’s idea may       reduce by a half or even more the number of code symbols that would be       needed if the codes were of a fixed length.</p>
<p>Huffman did not invent the idea of a coding tree. His insight was that       by assigning the probabilities of the longest codes first and then       proceeding along the branches of the tree toward the root, he could       arrive at an optimal solution every time. Fano and Shannon had tried to       work the problem in the opposite direction, from the root to the       leaves, a less efficient solution. When presented with his student’s       discovery, Huffman recalls, Fano exclaimed in his thick Italian accent:       “Is that all there is to it!”</p>
<p>Products that use Huffman code might fill a consumer electronics store.       A recent entry on the shop shelf is VCR Plus+, a device that       automatically programs a VCR and is making its inventors wealthy. (Some       newspapers on their own list a toll-free number that readers can call       for information about where to buy the device.) Instead of confronting       the frustrating process of programming a VCR, the user simply types       into the small handheld device a numerical code that is printed in the       television listings. When it is time to record, the gadget beams its       decoded instructions to the VCR and cable box with an infrared beam       like those on standard remote-control devices. This turns on the VCR,       sets it (and the cable box) to the proper channel and records for the       designated time.</p>
<p>Although he acknowledges that he is best known for his code, Huffman       says he is most proud of his doctoral thesis, which may be the first       formal methodology for devising asynchronous sequential switching       circuits, an important type of computer logic. The thesis helped him       obtain a faculty position at M.I.T. to teach a course on switching       circuits.</p>
<p>His work also attracted the attention of others. During the early       1960s, William O. Baker, then vice president of research for AT&amp;T       Bell Laboratories, tapped Huffman to sit on a committee that was       reviewing future technology plans for the National Security Agency.       What may have attracted Baker was work by Huffman that had outlined a       method for converting one sequence of binary numbers into another       without losing any information in the translation, a technique that had       obvious application in cryptography.</p>
<p>In 1967 Huffman left his position as full professor at M.I.T. to move       to the University of California at Santa Cruz, which had lured him to       become the first head of its new department of computer science. The       relocation brought him closer to the western mountains where he loves       to backpack and camp. (At the age of 65, he now prefers snorkeling and       body surfing.) Today Huffman is no longer head of the department, but       he still teaches a course in digital signal processing at the       university.</p>
<p>Huffman’s earliest years did not mark him as a prodigy. His mother once       told him that he lagged behind other children by two years in learning       how to speak. He attributes his slow development to a number of family       incidents that led to his parents’ divorce and that he has ever since       tried to forget. His mother, whom he recalls with great affection,       tried to help by becoming a mathematics teacher at a school for       troubled children so he could be enrolled there. But a series of tests       immediately made clear to his mother and teachers that his reticence       had masked precociousness.</p>
<p>At school, Huffman soon leapfrogged his classmates. He finished a       bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering at Ohio State University at       the age of 18 and immediately became an officer in the U.S. Navy, where       he served on a destroyer that helped to clear mines in Japanese and       Chinese waters after World War II.</p>
<p>Huffman believes his tumultuous early years fostered a love of       mathematics. “I like things neat,” he says. “I like to wrap things up       and get definitive answers, possibly because of the uncertainties of my       early life.” A sense of order is something toward which he continues to       strive. Huffman told this caller that he could spare only 20 minutes.       When the time elapsed, an alarm dutifully sounded in the background.</p>
<p>The imposition of structure where none exists has proved a recurrent       theme of his career. In the early 1970s Huffman became a debunker of       optical illusions. What inspired him were the seemingly incongruous       shapes in the work of M. C. Escher: triangles containing three right       angles, for example. Inspecting Escher’s creations, which he much       admires, led him to devise a set of rules to determine whether an       artist’s picture or a video image had cheated in depicting a       two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional scene.</p>
<p>Huffman determined a method for showing whether the many boundaries       between geometric elements in an image—represented as Y, V or T       shapes, among others—logically fit into a coherent pattern. He       describes his proof as an image grammar. “I wanted to create a sieve so       grammatical pictures would go through and ungrammatical images would be       seen as unrealizable,” he says. This contribution to the young field of       scene analysis, which has been used in developing machine vision       systems for robots, was presented in a 1971 paper entitled “Impossible       Objects as Nonsense Sentences.”</p>
<p>Huffman’s other work has ranged from the design of radar waveforms to       his last paper, published in the early 1980s, which proved that a       digital computer could be designed that would virtually eliminate one       of the staples of Boolean algebra. Huffman showed that a hypothetical       …</p></div></div></div></div>

If you’ve used Snap Search, you’ll find lots of banners and vector images used throughout the app. However, it comes with a very obvious risk: loading large images can slow down your app, and increase the apk size. I have a <strong><em>total 321 files in the drawable folder</em></strong> for Snap Search, and the following method is my easy trick to reduce APK size on Android.</p> <p>For those who are in a hurry and just want to know it quickly, these are the steps I follow:</p><ul><li>Save your image as a .png file</li><li>Compress your image using <a href="https://tinypng.com/">TinyPNG</a></li><li>Add the compressed image to your drawable folder</li><li>Right click on file, select ‘Convert o WebP’</li></ul><p>This whole process, on an average compresses the image by almost 80-90%. The images do NOT lose any quality at all, and your UI is still snappy and responsive to load and use.</p><p>Let’s check an example:</p><h2>Example to Reduce APK Size</h2><p>Here’s an example of an image in Snap Search, highlighting one of the premium features ( <a href="https://snapsearch.online/general/why-should-i-pay-for-premium-mode-of-snap-search/">there are quite a few</a>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><div itemprop="text"><p>This is a condensed version of part of the second chapter, which focuses on the history of lockdowns and how they became government policy. Hope you enjoy it.</p>
<p>The entire booklet is available on Amazon at https://amzn.to/33reYrm and at iBooks at https://apple.co/2PoNhqI.</p>

<p>By Alex Berenson</p>
<p>In March, as the Sars-Cov-2 epidemic jumped to Europe and the United States, epidemiologists and public health experts told governments to lock down – fast and hard. Not just mass gatherings, but schools, offices, malls, even parks and beaches. To do anything less would be to sentence millions of people to death, the experts said.</p>
<p>Most infamously, the Imperial College London report of March 16 – written by researchers who were working with the World Health Organization – predicted more than 2 million American coronavirus deaths without immediate action. It called for a policy of what Professor Neil Ferguson, the report’s lead author, termed “suppression”:</p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf">https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf</a>)</p>
<p>(Of course, Professor Ferguson exempted himself from his mandate. Two weeks after the report came out, as the entire United Kingdom had locked down, and <em>while Ferguson himself was still supposed to be self-isolating after contracting the coronavirus, </em>he had an affair with a married woman who traveled across London to meet him.)</p>
<p>The stunning impact of the Imperial College report made Ferguson arguably the most important public health expert in the world. Yet he was neither physician nor virologist. His PhD was in theoretical physics, arguments about the structure of the universe that are something close to pure math.</p>
<p>But he and the other Imperial College researchers appeared to believe a handful of relatively simple equations would predict the coronavirus epidemic. At their core, these models are simply software programs designed to simulate reality, based on the assumptions that the person who creates them inputs into them. They are as realistic as a game of SimCity, though less colorful.</p>
<p>Nonethless, Ferguson’s model produced highly precise answers. Lockdowns could reduce coronavirus deaths 95 percent if they continued until a vaccine was developed. Ferguson and his team even offered different death projections based on the severity of the lockdowns and benchmarks used to lift and reinstate them.</p>
<p>These details gave the Imperial College model an undeserved sense of certainty and reliability. In this sense, they were like other mathematical simulations of real-world events – like the ones that helped fuel the 2008 housing and financial meltdown.</p>
<p>But for all the complexity of his equations, Ferguson really offered nothing more than an updated version of the original frightened rationale for the quarantines European city-states had imposed during the Black Death seven centuries earlier: <em>Keep strangers away and we’ll be safe.</em></p>

<p>The idea of using widespread lockdowns to slow epidemics took off in 2006, as The New York Times reported in April. After a flu scare in 2005, then-President George W. Bush asked scientists for research on slowing epidemics. Dr. Carter Mecher, an internist at the Department of Veterans Affairs, connected with Robert Glass, a computer scientist at Sandia National Laboratories.</p>
<p>For a science project, Glass’s 14-year-old daughter had created a model of the way social distancing might slow the spread of the flu<em>. </em>Glass built on it to create a simulation “proving” lockdowns could reduce an influenza epidemic in a hypothetical town of 10,000 people by 90 percent. “Dr. Mecher received the results at his office in Washington and was amazed,” the Times wrote.</p>
<p>Robert and Laura Glass ultimately became the first two authors on a paper about the simulation. Inevitably, it contained a shout-out to Neil Ferguson. And sure enough, it showed the “mitigation strategies” worked.</p>
<p>In the retelling of this heroic lockdowns-for-all story by the Times, the conclusions of the paper took the CDC by storm. “In February 2007, the C.D.C. made their approach – bureaucratically called Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions, or NPIs – official U.S. policy.”</p>
<p>The reality was different.</p>
<p>The 2007 CDC paper ran 108 pages and included descriptions of many ways to reduce transmission, from “voluntary isolation of ill adults” to “reducing density in public transit.” (<a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/11425">https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/11425</a>)</p>
<p>Crucially, it also contained a “Pandemic Severity Index” that included five categories. On the low end, Category 1 represented a normal seasonal flu season, which still might kill up to 90,000 Americans. On the high end, a Category 5 pandemic, like the Spanish flu, would kill at least 1.8 million Americans.</p>
<p>Based on the CDC’s scale, Sars-Cov-2 almost certainly should be classified as Category 2 epidemic, meaning it will cause between 90,000 and 450,000 deaths. For an epidemic like that, the CDC merely said governments should <em>consider</em> school closures of less than four weeks, along with moderate efforts to reduce contacts among adults, such as telecommuting.</p>
<p>The prospect of closing all retail stores or offices <em>is not even mentioned in the paper, </em>not even for the most severe epidemics.</p>
<p>Yet the Times glossed over these distinctions in its article. It wrote instead “the (Bush) administration ultimately sided with the proponents of social distancing and shutdowns” and claimed the coronavirus response came directly from the original CDC report. “Then the coronavirus came, and the plan was put to work across the country for the first time.”</p>

<p>Even as the CDC was putting its 2007 plan together, many scientists and physicians with expertise in treating pandemics worried about the weakness of real-world evidence for lockdowns and other interventions.</p>
<p>Among the most vocal critics of lockdowns was Dr. Donald Henderson, who led the successful effort to eradicate smallpox. In December 2006, Henderson and three others wrote an 11-page paper called “Disease Mitigation Measures in the Control of Pandemic Influenza.” After outlining potential lockdown measures, they wrote, “We must ask whether any or all of the proposed measures are epidemiologically sound… [and] consider possible secondary social and economic impacts.”</p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/bsp.2006.4.366?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&amp;">https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/bsp.2006.4.366?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&amp;</a>)</p>
<p>Efforts in past epidemics to slow – much less stop – the spread of the flu had largely failed, the authors wrote. They attacked quarantines, travel bans, and school closings of more than two weeks as likely counterproductive. They did not even mention full lockdowns, presumably because they viewed those as so unlikely. And near the end of the paper, they made a heartfelt plea:</p>
<p>Experience has shown that communities faced with epidemics or other adverse events respond best and with the least anxiety when the normal social functioning of the community is least disrupted.</p>
<p>In 2020, their warning went unheeded.</p>

    <p>So far everything we’ve done with breakpoints involved us creating a breakpoint file and using this
to automate part of a track. Now we’ll take a look at how we can take an existing track and extract
some breakpoints from this. For this post, we’ll take a look at extracting the amplitudes from the
.wave files, as this is one of the most straightforward properties that we can extract.</p>
<p>There is nothing here that we’ve not seen in the <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/tags/goaudio/">previous
posts</a>, but rather we are going to combine what we’ve
already learned to create a new tool to do this.</p>
<p>In a high level overview, we’ll have to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>iterate over our frames</li>
<li>record the given amplitude (frame value)</li>
<li>write to breakpoint file</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence this would be simple enough, but we’ll make two small modifications to this
algorithm. First of all, we don’t want to just generate a breakpoint for each frame, this would just
result in a list that is equal to our frame data. We’ll use less space by just taking a snapshot at
a certain interval, e.g every 10ms, and take advantage of
our linear interpolation that happens when looking up the value of a breakpoint at a certain time.</p>
<p>A small extention to our current breakpoint code is that we need to be able to ‘batch’ the samples
into slices of a given time.</p>
<p>If you want to get to the code, everything can be found on
<a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio/blob/master/cmd/extractbrk/main.go">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The BatchSamples function will take a <code>Wave</code> and <code>seconds float64</code> as input, as this gives us enough
data to batch the frames. Given a certain SampleRate, we know how many Samples per Second we are
seeing in the file. With this information, we can find the amount of Frames per Seconds. Although
frames per second is only equal to the samples per second for mono files, but adapting for
multi-channel audio is just a matter of multiplying the SampleSize by the amount of channels.</p>
<p>The SampleSize can thus be expressed as follows: <code>SampleSize = SampleRate * Channels * seconds</code></p>
<p>When we know our sample size, we can split the raw frames into slices of this size.</p>

<p>Once we can split our frames into batches, we can call <code>BatchSamples(wave,x)</code> to get the requested
batches of a given duration. Then, we can find the max amplitude over all of these and keep
track of this over all batches.</p>
<p>The setup code is the same as usual, where we parse an input file with
<a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio">GoAudio</a>. Except that now we’ll also send the frames to the
‘BatchSamples’ function. (Error handling ignored for brevity)</p>

<p>When we run this program <code>go run main.go -i input.wav -w 15 -o output.brk</code> we can generate a
breakpoint file. I’ve created a sample waveform (something I’ll write a future blogpost about) with
variable amplitude. You can listen to it <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part7/input.wav">here</a>.</p>
<p>The extracted breakpoint file can be seen <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part7/output.brk">here</a>.</p>
<p>Using audacity and your favourite plotting tool you can compare the waveform with what the
breakpoint extractor generated.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>A number of programming languages offer a feature called “Named Arguments” or “Labeled Arguments”, which
makes some function calls much more readable and safer.</p>

<p>Let’s see how hard it would be to add these in Rust.</p>

<p>Consider a function such as:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>rect</span>(x: <span>u32</span>, width: <span>u32</span>, y: <span>u32</span>, height: <span>u32</span>, background: Option<span>&lt;</span>Color<span>&gt;</span>, foreground: Option<span>&lt;</span>Color<span>&gt;</span>, line: Option<span>&lt;</span>Color<span>&gt;</span>) -&gt; <span>Widget</span> {
 <span>// ...
</span><span></span>}
rect(X, Y, WIDTH, HEIGHT, LINE, None, None); <span>// Oops, I have completely confused the order of arguments.
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It would be nice if we could leverage Rust’s syntax and/or type system help us avoid confusing these arguments.
This is a feature often called Named Arguments or Labeled Arguments, which is available in Python, OCaml, Swift, Dart, … with strong typing in some of these languages that support it.</p>

<p>In Rust, one could imagine writing</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// In this example, `{( ... )}` means that we're using named arguments.
</span><span>// Other syntaxes are possible.
</span><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>rect</span>{(x: <span>u32</span>, width: <span>u32</span>, y: <span>u32</span>, height: <span>u32</span>, background: Option<span>&lt;</span>Color<span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> None, foreground: Option<span>&lt;</span>Color<span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> None, line: Option<span>&lt;</span>Color<span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> None)} -&gt; <span>Widget</span>
{
    <span>// ...
</span><span></span>}
rect{(x <span>=</span> X, y <span>=</span> Y, width <span>=</span> WIDTH, height <span>=</span> HEIGHT, line <span>=</span> LINE)}; <span>// Arguments are automatically reordered. Default values are automatically inserted. Above error becomes impossible.
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Wouldn’t that be more readable and safer?</p>



<p>This is <strong>not</strong> about syntax, only about semantics.</p>

<p>I was toying with a few ideas on how to implement named arguments without breaking the existing type system. I have a few macro-based prototype implementations. It’s way too early to turn them into a RFC, but I hope that these can serve as a basis for further conversation.</p>

<p>With these prototypes, we can write <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// Define the function.
</span><span></span>define<span>!</span>(<span>fn</span>(rect, x: <span>u32</span>, width: <span>u32</span>, y: <span>u32</span>, height: <span>u32</span>, background: Option<span>&lt;</span>Color<span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> None, foreground: Option<span>&lt;</span>Color<span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> None, line: Option<span>&lt;</span>Color<span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> None) -&gt; <span>Widget</span> {
    <span>// ...
</span><span></span>})

<span>// Call the function, macro-style.
</span><span>// Arguments are re-ordered as needed and optional arguments are replaced with their default value if needed.
</span><span></span>call<span>!</span>(rect, x <span>=</span> X, y <span>=</span> Y, width <span>=</span> WIDTH, height <span>=</span> HEIGHT, line <span>=</span> LINE);

<span>// Or, equivalently, builder-style.
</span><span></span>rect::setup()
    .x(X)
    .y(Y)
    .width(WIDTH)
    .height(HEIGHT)
    .line(LINE)
    .call();

<span>// On the other hand, the following fails to type-check, because we've forgotten
</span><span>// required argument `height`.
</span><span></span>call<span>!</span>(rect, x <span>=</span> X, y <span>=</span> Y, width <span>=</span> WIDTH, line <span>=</span> LINE);
<span>// ... or equivalently
</span><span></span>rect::setup()
    .x(X)
    .y(Y)
    .width(WIDTH)
    .line(LINE)
    .call();

<span>// And the following fails to type-check because we've used the same argument
</span><span>// twice:
</span><span></span>call<span>!</span>(rect, x <span>=</span> X, y <span>=</span> Y, x <span>=</span> X, width <span>=</span> WIDTH, height <span>=</span> HEIGHT, line <span>=</span> LINE);
<span>// ... or equivalently
</span><span></span>rect::setup()
    .x(X)
    .y(Y)
    .x(X)
    .width(WIDTH)
    .height(HEIGHT)
    .line(LINE)
    .call();
</code></pre></div>
<p>A bit more verbose but much safer, right?</p>

<p>At the time of this writing, the prototype only support module-level <code>fn</code> declarations, not functions within <code>impl</code> or <code>trait</code> or closures. I don’t think that there’s any strong blocker for either, I just haven’t attempted implementing these yet. These are left as future works.</p>



<p>The general idea is that macro <code>define!</code> creates a type-level final state machines that behaves as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>the state is the set of named arguments that have already been passed;</li>
<li>the initial state is <em>{}</em> (the empty set);</li>
<li>from a state <em>S</em> and for each argument <em>a: T</em> that doesn’t appear in <em>S</em>, there is a transition materialized
by a function <code>S::a(Self, T) -&gt; S2</code>, where <em>S2 = S ∪ {a}</em>;</li>
<li>a state <em>S</em> is accepting if and only if <em>S</em> contains all required arguments;</li>
<li>when a state <em>S</em> is accepting, we materialize this with a function <code>S::call()</code> that
calls our original function.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the moment, all this is implemented by generating one <code>struct</code> type per state <em>S</em> and storing all of them
within a semi-hidden module.</p>

<p>Macro <code>call!</code> just chains calls to these functions <code>S::a(...)</code>. The type system catches when we’re attempting
to use the same argument twice (because the method doesn’t exist) or when we’re missing one argument (because
method <code>call()</code> doesn’t exist).</p>



<p>This is still an early prototype but I believe that it demonstrates satisfyingly that we can extend Rust with named arguments,
at least in simple cases, without modifying either the type system or the semantics of the language in depth.</p>

<p>It feels like we could extend the Rust type system to improve error messages (when we use the same argument twice or forget one argument) and likely compile-time performance of this use case without it having it cascade in too many places.</p>



<p>As mentioned previously, the current prototype only works for module-level function declarations. Making it work for <code>impl</code>-level functions and <code>trait</code>-level functions should be possible but will require a little more effort to store the type-level finite
state machine.</p>



<ul>
<li>An early prototype is available <a href="https://github.com/Yoric/named-args.rs/">on github</a> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</li>
<li>This prototype is based on the (great!) crate <a href="https://crates.io/crates/typed-builder">typed-builder</a> by Chris Morgan and IdanArye. They did all the heavy lifting :)</li>

Phone addiction or compulsive phone use goes along-side internet addiction and social media addiction. Psychologists also call it “problematic phone use.” For this post, we will consider them together. Cell-phones are habit-forming – once you go down that rabbit hole, you use more and more. Like drugs, one can get hooked to a phone or an activity on the phone that leads to addiction. There is abuse without control, changes in mood, excessive desire to use, withdrawals like irritability and anger when you can’t use the phone, low tolerance to avoid the phone, and the phone interferes with life in a negative way.</p><p>Strictly speaking, addiction is “the loss of control, the establishment of a dependent relationship, tolerance, the need for progressively more time and dedication, and severe interference with daily life (Echeburua et al., 2009).” Phones, internet-based activities, and any technology for that matter can become an addiction in the truest sense (even though many disagree). And sometimes, phone addicts need to be rehabilitated in a hospital.</p><p>People often get addicted to the phone because they want to <em>escape from reality</em>, <em>gain social karma</em>, <em>cope with stress caused by social anxiety and self-esteem</em>, <em>follow their greed for social validation</em>, <em>likes</em>, <em>and other types of rewards</em>, or <em>play rewarding games</em>. The constant flow of digital rewards and information can <em>pull</em> a person into addiction and day-to-day difficulties can <em>push</em> a person toward addiction.</p><div><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?w=855&amp;ssl=1" alt="Phone addiction" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?w=855&amp;ssl=1"></figure></div><h3><span id="Indicators_of_problematic_phone_use">Indicators of problematic phone use</span></h3><p><strong>There is no cut-off point for phone use which everyone agrees to but here are some indicators</strong>.</p><ol><li>You spend continuous hours on the phone to play games, scroll through social media, open and close apps, text people to invite a chat, etc.</li><li>You frequently pick up the phone without any aim to check for notifications or see if something has changed in your social feeds.</li><li>Your online and offline behavior gets more integrated and you don’t know what you did in the digital reality or the material reality.</li><li>You get restless if your phone is dead or has low-battery, is out-of-coverage, or low on data/balance.</li><li>You treat your phone as a security blanket without which you get uncomfortable in social gatherings.</li><li>Your day-to-day activities take a backseat, relationships are strained, and you can’t focus and commit to the important things in your life.</li></ol><h3><span id="Common_examples_of_problematic_phone_use">Common examples of problematic phone use</span></h3><ol><li>Infinitely scrolling through Instagram.</li><li>Playing Call of Duty or PubG for hours and social activities contain little to no honest communication.</li><li>Excessive display of hurt, loneliness, attention-seeking behavior, hate, jealousy, and disapproval on social media.</li><li>Social needs are not met (sexual intimacy, close friendship, physical touch, etc.) and online alternatives are used to compensate for poor social health (Chatbots, echo-chambers, porn, social gaming, virtual reality social games like second life, camming relationships).</li><li>Inability to feel pleasure and excitement in the offline world but excessive emotions are tied to online rewards like gambling, likes, shares, followers, sexting, masturbation to porn, etc.</li><li><em>FOMO</em> (fear of missing out) and <em>Nomophobia</em> (no-mobile phobia) cause mental and physical discomfort.</li><li>You frequently experience <em>Ringxiety</em> or <em>Textaphrenia</em> or Phantom notifications – the feeling that you received a notification when you actually did not.</li></ol><h2><span id="Fast_facts_about_phone_and_internet_use">Fast facts about phone and internet use</span></h2><ol><li><a href="https://blog.rescuetime.com/screen-time-stats-2018/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">According to a 2019 report</a>, the average person spends about 3.5 hours on their phone in a day with the top 20% of people spending more than 4.5 hours a day. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/24/screen-time-iphone-coronavirus-quarantine-covid/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">The quarantine</a> has increased these numbers – many users report over 8 hours a day.</li><li>The 2019 report also says that 70% of all phone use lasts lesser than 2 minutes and 50% of all phone pick-ups occur within 3 minutes of the previous pick-up.</li><li><a href="https://wearesocial.com/blog/2019/01/digital-2019-global-internet-use-accelerates" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Another 2019 report</a> (2018 data) says at least 3.3 billion people use the internet and social media from their phones.</li><li><a href="https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations-and-Whitepapers/2019/Global-State-of-Mobile" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Comscore’s 2019 Global state of mobile</a> report says 70% of all digital media engagement in the US happens from a smartphone.

That means poor attention, poor memory, poor reasoning skills, bad decision making, etc. One of the main reasons is the role of sleep. Addiction can disturb sleep and sleep worsens cognitive performance. However, self-regulation (personal control, commitment to healthy choices, tolerating negative emotions) can counter the negative effects of addiction and that can help you overcome it.</p><p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190740919311296" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">A dysfunctional family can push</a> children into addiction and one reason is social anxiety. A broken family or unhealthy parenting like neglect or excessive control can often hamper emotional growth. Children might fail to learn how to behave in social settings. There may be a fear of ridicule, disapproval, disappointment, etc. or simply a looming belief like “I am not good enough” or “I am a bad child” that creates pressure on children. These fears or thoughts transfer into the real-world and children cope with the social anxiety it causes by withdrawing into their phones – where the fantasy digital world rescues them from their real life. Fortunately, mindfulness – being aware of your actions and living in the moment as an observer – can reduce the negative impact of phone addiction.</p><p>Underlying mental health conditions like bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, and attachment issues can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7215249/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">increase the risk</a> of phone addiction.

As long as you can first demonstrate some output. Random notifications and random experiences are potent in pulling you to check your phone precisely because they are random. Unpredictable notifications and call-to-actions are hard to anticipate so the brain maximizes their potential reward (feeling great) by constantly creating the urge to pick up the phone and check. Schedule an hour to commit to your phone or make it a rule to check it every 45 minutes. That way, the rewards will be hard to anticipate but they will occur at a known time and your brain will find it easier to adjust than completely abandoning your phone.</p><h3><span id="2_Interrupt_your_habitual_routine">2.&nbsp;<strong>Interrupt your habitual routine</strong>&nbsp;</span></h3><p>Habits are hard to break because neurons in your brain rigidly fire a certain way. Once an action is repeated enough, neural circuits become efficient. They then direct and dictate behavior automatically. Countering their tendencies becomes harder. Higher the repetitions, the more stable those neurons get. These neural circuits fire in a predictable way and they fire automatically with almost no external push. You may have little to no awareness about the start of habitual actions. However, breaking a habit means you have to change how those neurons behave and the only way to do that is to ensure a change in the neural circuit. You can do that by changing 3 things:</p><ul><li><strong>The context in which the habit occurs</strong> – Identify how your mood is when you get into the phone-use black hole and do an activity that changes the mood. Instead of sitting and scrolling, start cleaning up or begin work, and occasionally take a phone break.</li><li><strong>Interrupting the trigger that kick-starts the habit</strong> – Identify the triggers and immediately distract yourself, change the room, go for a bath, etc.</li><li><strong>The verbal narrative about that habit</strong> – Change your self-talk about phone addiction. For example, change “I need to use my phone, I want to do that right now” to “I can use a strategy to use my phone in a limited way so I don’t stay an addict and still enjoy it.”</li></ul><p>For example – If you have a habit of staring at your phone right after writing an email,&nbsp;<strong>change the context</strong>&nbsp;by doing a physical stretch.&nbsp;<strong>Interrupt the trigger</strong>&nbsp;by clicking send and then switching off your phone immediately. And&nbsp;<strong>change the narrative</strong>&nbsp;by telling yourself something like “<em>The email was not the end of my work, I can start another task and then go on Instagram.</em>” Even if this just delays your phone use by a few minutes, it’s progress.</p><h3><span id="3_Introspect_about_your_expectations">3.&nbsp;<strong>Introspect about your expectations</strong>&nbsp;</span></h3><p>Continuous short-interval phone checking may …</p></div></div>

<p>I’ve spotted the following common data access patterns.</p>



<h2>Get the Only Element in an Array</h2>



<p>You need to get the only element of an array as in</p>



<pre><code>my_val = my_arr[0]</code></pre>



<p>Additionally you want to express the assumption that there should be exactly one element in the array. In <a href="https://ngs-lang.org/">NGS</a> it’s simple:</p>



<pre><code>my_val = my_arr.the_one()</code></pre>



<p><code><a href="https://ngs-lang.org/doc/latest/generated/the_one.html">the_one()</a></code> will return the only element or will throw an exception if there is not exactly one element in the given array.</p>



<h2>Get the Only Matching Element in an Array</h2>



<p>You have an array. Only one element should satisfy some condition. You want to access that element. Again, there is a straightforward way to express this in NGS:</p>



<p><code>my_instance = instances.the_one({"InstanceId": my_id})</code></p>



<p>The use of <code>the_one(...)</code> here is again about the assumption that there should be exactly one instance with the given instance id in the <code>instances</code> array. Exception will be thrown by <code>the_one(...)</code> if that is not the case. </p>



<p><em>Update 2020-08-08</em>: As <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/menbfs/ngs_unique_features_one">pointed out</a>, the method is <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.single">not unique to NGS</a>.</p>



<hr>



<p>Happy coding and have a nice week!</p>

<p>A new report published this week sheds light on a vulnerability in smart lock models that hackers could exploit to crack them open remotely. </p>



<p>Not only that, the attackers could see the exact timestamps indicating when a door had been “locked” and “unlocked” by the user. Further, the revealed information contained the user’s IP address and device MAC address information, which are fairly unique identifiers.</p>



<p>The specific model of the smartlock impacted by this flaw is <a href="https://www.u-tec.com/lock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">U-Tec UltraLoq</a></p>

<p>U-Tec smart locks use what’s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MQTT</a>, “publish-subscribe” protocol which runs over TCP/IP.</p>



<p>With MQTT protocol, a smartphone app, for example, can seamlessly monitor multiple actuators, such as temperature controls in HVAC systems in real-time. </p>



<p>Further, the “publish-subscribe” architecture makes it easier to adjust settings on a per device basis in connected homes and offices.</p>



<p>“The risk of using MQTT arises when it is deployed without proper authentication and authorization schemes. Without this, anyone who can connect to the broker can leak sensitive data and potentially influence kinetic systems,” states the report released by Tripwire.</p>



<h2>Shodan exposed smart locks</h2>



<figure><img src="https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Redacted-Shodan-Excerpt-800x149.jpg" alt="Redacted excerpt of data from Shodan MQTT" data-src="https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Redacted-Shodan-Excerpt-800x149.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption><strong>A sample smart device found on Shodan with MQTT requests expo</strong>sed<br>Source: Tripwire</figcaption></figure>



<p>IoT search engines like Shodan regularly sweep the web for internet-exposed devices. A researcher recently came across such IoTs that appeared to be doorlocks.</p>



<p>“I tested various MQTT search terms to see how many hits they yield One server in particular caught my attention because it had pages and pages of MQTT topic names and repeatedly came up in searches including references to ‘lock’ and free email providers like ‘gmail.com,’” states a computer security researcher, <a href="https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/contributors/craig-young/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Craig Young</a> at Tripwire. </p>



<p>The researcher was able to access this MQTT device via simple Linux CLI tools, such as <em>mosquitto_sub</em>.</p>



<h2>View IPs, MACs, usernames…</h2>



<p>The data returned by the device confirmed researcher’s suspicion that it was a smart lock device. Among the fields returned, Young saw sensitive information exposed, including IP addresses, usernames, and a record of when the device was locked and unlocked with timestamps.</p>



<figure><img src="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1024x72.png" alt="" srcset="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1024x72.png 1024w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-300x21.png 300w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-768x54.png 768w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1536x108.png 1536w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2048x143.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-srcset="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1024x72.png 1024w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-300x21.png 300w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-768x54.png 768w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1536x108.png 1536w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2048x143.png 2048w" data-src="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1024x72.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>“The data included email and IP addresses associated with locks and timestamped records of when the locks [were] opened and closed, among other things,” said Young.</p>



<p>He further explained, “This means that an anonymous attacker would also be able to collect identifying details of any active U-Tec customers including their email address, IP address, and wireless MAC addresses.”</p>



<p>“This is enough to identify a specific person along with their household address. If the person ever unlocks their door with the U-Tec app, the attacker will also now have a token to unlock the door at a time of their choosing.”</p>



<h2>“Unlock” doors remotely</h2>



<p>To add misery to an already unfortunate situation, the device allowed “replaying” of these requests without any authentication mechanism in place.</p>



<p>This means, an attacker who could intercept these messages was able to “replay” them at will to lock or unlock the smart device at his pleasure.</p>



<p>Moreover, an adversary who could sniff the MQTT traffic for some time could eventually retrieve the MD5 password <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hash</a>, along with the usernames.</p>



<p>On finding these flaws, the researcher reported them U-Tec on November 10, 2019. But, the company had initially dismissed his report stating:</p>



<p>“<em>We have token authorize on the devices, Unauthorized users will not be able to open the door, please don’t worry.</em>“</p>



<p>After a few more exchanges between the researcher and U-Tec, the company ultimately patched the security flaws.</p>



<p>“U-Tec’s engineers went quiet for a few days but then came back to announce that user isolation had been implemented. I confirmed that I could no longer publish messages across accounts and promptly disconnected the lock and packed it away in the basement,” the researcher stated.</p>



<p>The researcher’s complete investigation and recommendations are shared in Tripwire’s <a href="https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/featured/tripwire-research-iot-smart-lock-vulnerability/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikitext">

<p>I bought Avnet's $49 Spartan 3A development board but it was discontinued not long afterward - right about the time when I decided I needed a few dozen more. I've since done some extensive research (thanks, Google!) to find a comparable thrifty thrill.
</p>
<p>When choosing a development board, consider what you get with it and what you want to use it for. FPGAs are ideal for use with high speed peripherals, and in general it is much easier to buy a board that contains the part you want, rather than trying to add one on later (and inevitably giving up and upgrading to a more capable board). Examples of things you might want, and are quite difficult to add yourself:
</p>
<ul><li>Gigabit Ethernet
</li><li>HDMI/DVI
</li><li>PCI/PCI Express
</li><li>External non-serial memory (DDR/Flash etc.)
</li></ul><p>Things that are relatively easy to add, and are not so much of a big deal to wire up yourself.
</p>
<ul><li>MMC/SD cards
</li><li>Character (e.g. 16x2) LCDs
</li><li>Anything I2C/SPI and relatively low speed
</li><li>VGA (with low colour depth)
</li></ul><p>I like having a board with many (at least 8) SPST switches and LEDs, and momentary buttons. Unlike a microcontroller where it's relatively easy to spit debug information out of a serial port or to an LCD with a single C function call, debugging FPGA designs is a bit harder. LEDs  provide a zero fuss way to break out internal signals for visualisation - if you're tracking the progress of a complex state machine, you can light up an LED when it gets to a certain point without adding any extra logic. While these are easy enough to add yourself, I find that it's better to get a board that has them so that you don't waste valuable user IOs or waste time investigating failures caused by your terrible soldering skills.
</p>
<p>Some manufacturers promote a standard form factor for add-ons, notably Digilent with their very wide range of <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-modules-connectors/">Pmods</a>, the Papilio One's <a href="http://papilio.cc/index.php?n=Papilio.Wings">Wings</a>, and Arduino shields.
</p>
<p>If you would like to connect high speed devices (above 10-20 MHz) to your FPGA, make sure your board has an interface connector that supports the speeds you'll be using. Look for ground wires interspersed regularly between signal wires, high speed connectors (not just 0.1" headers), PCB trace length equalisation, and impedance control. Few of the cheap boards bother with any of these.
</p>
<p>FPGAs can be a bit daunting, so check that the manufacturer provides:
</p>
<ul><li>Schematic diagram
</li><li>A reference manual, describing all of the on-board peripherals
</li><li>A guide to getting started, if you've never used an FPGA before
</li><li>A reference design that exercises all on-board peripherals.
</li></ul><p>Reference designs can either be HDL or microcontroller-based, but in recent boards, most manufacturers seem to be moving to the latter. Bear this in mind if you don't have a license for the microcontroller and environment (e.g. Xilinx EDK/SDK is not free), as the code will be difficult to port to HDL.
</p>
<p>If you're a beginner, you may benefit from buying a board that has a companion textbook which has been written specifically for the board in mind, and describes each of the peripherals and how to interface with them. Popular boards with larger user communities may also be worth considering above cheaper options. The most popular Xilinx boards are those made by Xilinx (none of them cheap enough to be listed here), Digilent and Avnet. Terasic seem to make the most popular Altera boards.
</p>

<p>A long-standing complaint with vendor FPGA design tools is that they are generally enormous, complicated, slow, buggy, closed source, and are either expensive or have annoying license requirements. The open source community has made great progress in recent years to reimplement parts or all of the FPGA design toolchain and to address all of these concerns.
</p>
<p>FPGA devices which are currently either partially or fully supported by open source tools include:
</p>
<ul><li>Xilinx Spartan 6
</li><li>Xilinx Series 7 (Artix 7, Kintex 7, Virtex 7, Zynq with Series 7 Fabric)
</li><li>Xilinx Ultrascale(+)
</li><li>Lattice iCE40
</li><li>Lattice ECP5
</li><li>QuickLogic EOS S3 and PolarPro3
</li></ul><p>Some tools to check out include:
</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex">LiteX</a> - A Python-based SoC builder
<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/litex-hub">LiteX Hub</a> - collaborative FPGA projects based on LiteX
</li><li><a href="https://github.com/timvideos/litex-buildenv">LiteX-BuildEnv</a> - An environment for building LiteX-based FPGA designs
</li></ul></li><li><a href="http://www.clifford.at/yosys/">Yosys</a> - Verilog synthesis tool
</li><li><a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr">nextpnr</a> - a vendor neutral, timing driven place and route tool
</li><li><a href="https://symbiflow.github.io/">SymbiFlow</a> - an umbrella project for FPGA architecture definitions
</li></ul><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mithro">Tim 'mithro' Ansell</a> has an open offer to send FPGA hardware to anyone who has time to to contribute to open source FPGA projects but doesn't have any hardware.
</p>

<h4>Xilinx</h4>
<h5>Zynq</h5>
<p>Xilinx's Zynq parts are supported by their Vivado high level synthesis design suite and include a dual-core ARM Cortex-A9, USB 2.0, and Gigabit Ethernet.

Given the virtually endless configurability of the FPGA chip itself, the development board is all about the peripherals it offers and its overall cost. Despite the fact that there are only a few FPGA manufacturers, the companies and individuals designing FPGA development boards is just about as endless as the reconfigurability of an FPGA itself.</p><p><span>And even when you've found the perfect FPGA development board for your project, sometimes the board ends up discontinued when you need to replace it or buy more. This is the particular situation that lead one hobbyist to create his own </span><a href="https://joelw.id.au/FPGA/CheapFPGADevelopmentBoards" rel="nofollow">reference list of affordable FPGA development boards</a><span>.</span></p><p>Joel Williams' list starts off by outlining the criteria that he looks for in an FPGA development board. He makes the great point to consider what peripherals you need for your project and which of those peripherals are the most difficult to recreate yourself if they aren't built onto the development board itself. For instance, adding your own HDMI port or DDR flash memory would be such a pain that you'd sink more effort into adding them compared to the cost you saved of not buying them built into the development board.</p><p>The vast majority of the boards on this list are under a $150 price point with a few exceptions. Namely, the boards equipped with higher-speed peripherals tend to reflect that in their price.</p><p>The boards on this list are grouped together by FPGA chip manufacturer. This is helpful given each of the FPGA manufacturers require use of a proprietary toolchain for the place-and-route step of a design onto the FPGA, so FPGA developers tend to stick to the toolset they know when shopping for a new board.</p><p>This list is a really great resource for hobbyists, students, and industry engineers alike. As an engineer in industry, the beginning of every new project usually has a need for a low-cost initial proof of concept for the design and the last thing I want to do is spend a ton of time looking for a cost-effective development board when the clock is ticking on getting started with the project itself.</p><p><span>In true maker community spirit, </span><a href="https://joelw.id.au/FPGA/CheapFPGADevelopmentBoards" rel="nofollow">Williams requests at the end of the list that anyone contact him</a><span> if there is a board they think needs to be added to the list so it can keep evolving and stay up to date. This is definitely a resource I'll keep on hand myself for the future.</span></p></div></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>It has been a year since I left social media. It was difficult to do at the time, and I kept finding excuses and reasons not to. Looking back I realise it was because I was an addict. I was addicted to the scrolling, the likes, the unlimited content.</p>
<p>I was addicted to social media in the same way I was addicted to cigarettes. I wasn’t a heavy social media user (or smoker for that matter), but I knew that it wasn’t in my best interests. I knew that it was clever capitalism that kept me on my leash, and I knew that it was robbing me of my time and my physical and mental health. But it was there with me every day. It never made me feel any better, yet I still spent time and energy on it.</p>
<p>There are many reasons to quit using social media, and few to remain connected. The switch flicked as I posted a picture of a gorgeous sunset on Instagram. I was showing off to the world how beautiful my life is, while at the same time knowing it was a false representation at that moment. At the time I was mildly depressed and hungry and cold. Did I want people to admire me right there and then? Why was I doing this?</p>
<p>The year since has been great. It’s not a huge change. Things have just regained their natural cadence. When I meet up with friends I haven’t seen in a while, we have lots to discuss since we don’t have a constant feed of one another’s lives on our smartphones. My relationships deepened as they became more intentional. It was easy to feel like I was keeping in touch when I was on social media, even though there was no conversation happening. No relationship being nurtured.</p>
<p>And finally, this has been by far the most productive year of my life. I’ve taught at an accelerator in Ghana and a university in Cape Town. I’ve started 3 projects, <a href="https://justsketch.me/">one</a> of which turned into a business that allowed me to quit my job and live a much freer life. <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Another</a> became a lovely open-sourced platform of which the ethos is dear to my heart. I've built little <a href="https://herman_the_merman.itch.io/">games</a> and played with interesting ideas.</p>
<p>The combination of productivity, but also mindful leisure has made the past year delightful. In my free time, I read books and spend time with people who are important to me. I play and exercise and don’t keep up with the Joneses. I spend time in the mountains or on beaches, and the whole world doesn’t need to know. In a fundamental way, quitting social media has made me more free.</p>

<![CDATA[Memory Reduced to 66% by Reordering Struct]]>

August 8, 2020 | https://qvault.io/2020/08/07/saving-a-third-of-our-memory-by-re-ordering-go-struct-fields/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://qvault.io/2020/08/07/saving-a-third-of-our-memory-by-re-ordering-go-struct-fields/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>In past projects at <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/">Qvault</a> we had an application that typically ran with <strong>~2GB</strong> in memory at any given time. By simply changing the order of some <code>uint</code> variables we managed to drop the memory usage to less than <strong>1.4GB</strong>. The vast majority of this allocated memory is due to an enormous slice of <code>stats</code> structs.</p>



<p>The <code>stats</code> struct has the following type definition:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">type stats struct {
	NumPosts uint8
	Reach    uint16
	NumLikes uint8
}</code></pre>



<p>In theory, this struct will take a use a measly 4 bytes. Each <code>uint8</code> uses 1 <code>byte</code>, and the single <code>uint16</code> needs 2. We began to suspect that we had some wasteful memory issues, so I built the following little program to show how memory is being used by our struct:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"reflect"
	"runtime"
)

type stats struct {
	NumPosts uint8
	Reach    uint16
	NumLikes uint8
}

func main() {
	typ := reflect.TypeOf(stats{})
	fmt.Printf("Struct is %d bytes long\n", typ.Size())
	n := typ.NumField()
	for i := 0; i &lt; n; i++ {
		field := typ.Field(i)
		fmt.Printf("%s at offset %v, size=%d, align=%d\n",
			field.Name, field.Offset, field.Type.Size(),
			field.Type.Align())
	}

	allStats := []stats{}
	for i := 0; i &lt; 100000000; i++ {
		allStats = append(allStats, stats{})
	}

	printMemUsage()
}

func printMemUsage() {
	var m runtime.MemStats
	runtime.ReadMemStats(&amp;m)
	fmt.Printf("Alloc = %v MiB", bToMb(m.Alloc))
	fmt.Printf("\tTotalAlloc = %v MiB", bToMb(m.TotalAlloc))
	fmt.Printf("\tSys = %v MiB", bToMb(m.Sys))
	fmt.Printf("\tNumGC = %v\n", m.NumGC)
}

func bToMb(b uint64) uint64 {
	return b / 1024 / 1024
}</code></pre>



<p>On my MacBook using Go 1.14.1 the above program prints:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">Struct is 6 bytes long
NumPosts at offset 0, size=1, align=1
Reach at offset 2, size=2, align=2
NumLikes at offset 4, size=1, align=1
Alloc = 1084 MiB        TotalAlloc = 3012 MiB   Sys = 2713 MiB  NumGC = 19</code></pre>



<p>Notice that even though <code>NumPosts</code> only has a size of 1 byte, the next field, <code>Reach</code>, still starts at offset 2. A whole byte is being wasted! The same thing happens with the <code>NumLikes</code> field, it starts at offset 4 with a size of 1, but the struct still takes up the full 6 bytes.</p>



<p>This may not seem like a big deal, but when you are storing millions of these structs in memory the bloat starts to add up quick.</p>



<p>If we change the <code>stats</code> struct such that the <code>uint16</code> isn’t defined between the <code>uint8</code>s:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">type stats struct {
	Reach    uint16
	NumPosts uint8
	NumLikes uint8
}</code></pre>



<p>Then the output of the program becomes:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">Struct is 4 bytes long
Reach at offset 0, size=2, align=2
NumPosts at offset 2, size=1, align=1
NumLikes at offset 3, size=1, align=1
Alloc = 694 MiB TotalAlloc = 1927 MiB   Sys = 1391 MiB  NumGC = 19</code></pre>



<p>The total allocated memory drops from 3 GB to less than 2, and each instance of the struct now only uses 4 bytes.</p>



<h2>Why?</h2>



<p>Modern CPU hardware performs reads and writes to memory most efficiently when the data is&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">naturally aligned</a></em>. The memory that is stored side by side should be accessible using a common multiple, so the Go compiler makes sure that it is.</p>



<p>With our first struct, the Reach field is between the NumPosts and NumLikes fields, which means that the compiler will add some padding to keep things nice and even. </p>

<p>In our updated struct however, we have grouped the smaller fields, and since they add up to the same amount of memory as the larger <code>Reach</code> field we can save some space!</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The process of writing <a href="https://www.gigobooks.com/blog/why-i-started-gigobooks.html">Why I started GigoBooks</a> made me think more about the market niche and positioning for GigoBooks. Previously (even though I was creating something that I could use) I only had some vague idea that it would be for ‘solopreneurs and other micro-businesses’.</p>

<p>But now, thanks to (the thinking triggered by) blogging, I have a much clearer idea. Here it is:</p>

<!--break-->

<ul>
  <li>Solo operator
    <ul>
      <li>Comfortable doing accounting by themselves</li>
      <li>Doesn’t have a/an (regular) accountant</li>
      <li>Wants to manage/control own data</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Simple affairs:
    <ul>
      <li>No employees</li>
      <li>No (or minimal) stock</li>
      <li>Few/no capital assets that need depreciation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s expand this further.</p>

<p>The model user is someone who is running a business/gig/consultancy/side-project/etc by him-/her-self and is knowledgeable enough to DIY. They don’t need an accountant, or at least, they don’t use one on a regular basis. They appreciate having control over their own data and strongly dislike having their data held hostage by a SaaS solution.</p>

<p>Related to this is that they have simple affairs: No employees. No/minimal stock inventory. No/minimal capital assets/depreciation. The simplicity is what makes DIY feasible and attractive. For example, they don’t need a regular accountant if their affairs are simple and rarely change.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, this describes me :)</p>

<p>Simplicity works for the vendor (in this case: me) too. It means I don’t have to implement features to support accounting for employees, or stock, or capital assets and depreciation. This makes the product tractable for a “bootstrapped business”.</p>

<p>But now I’m going to arbitrarily add one more thing. I’m projecting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Focus on quick and ease of use</li>
  <li>Let the user do what they need to do, in a minimum amount of time</li>
</ul>

<p>I spend very little time doing accounting. I personally have only a handful of transactions to record each month, and I do most of the filing once per quarter (Even that is because my local tax authority requires quarterly statements).</p>

<p>I really appreciate spending just a minimal amount of time, every once in a while, on accounting. Just go in, do it, get out and then get on with your life. I hope my users will appreciate it too.</p>

<p>And that’s the niche I’m targeting with GigoBooks.</p>

<p>(Does this niche sound like you? Are you a solo operator looking for a simple DIY accounting solution for your simple affairs? NoSaas? If so, then perhaps GigoBooks is the perfect match for you.)</p>

<p>The great thing about a clearly defined niche (and model user) is that it informs the MVP feature set. For example, a lot of ‘accounting for small business’ solutions would tout ‘Your staff can access your accounts from anywhere’ as a great feature (and a strong argument for SaaS). For my niche, that’s actually an anti-feature.</p>

<p>Going a bit further: Having defined the niche as those users who have simple affairs, I can omit 90% of the functionality that other accounting software have, but which my users won’t use. This allows me to reduce clutter and make GigoBooks even more focused and suitable for its niche.</p>

<p>Blogging has really helped clarify the niche in my mind. I feel like I know the end user much better than when I had some vague ‘accounting for SMBs’ idea.</p>

<p>(And now I need to adjust the marketing/message for the product and the blog.)</p>

<p>Now I know why startup advice recommends going for a niche. It really does bring clarity and focus.</p>

<p>Press Release No. 61/2020 of 17 July 2020</p>
<p>Order of 27 May 2020 - <a href="https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/SharedDocs/Entscheidungen/DE/2020/05/rs20200527_1bvr187313.html;jsessionid=7DDDFEBFBFD1111F7FDC90EDC6E214F3.1_cid370" title="Beschluss vom 27. Mai 2020">1 BvR 1873/13, 1 BvR 2618/13</a> (Subscriber data II)</p>
<p>In an order published today, the First Senate of the Federal Constitutional Court declared unconstitutional § 113 of the Telecommunications Act (Telekommunikationsgesetz – TKG) and several ordinary federal laws, which govern the manual procedure for obtaining information on subscriber data. They violate the complainants’ right to informational self-determination and their right to the privacy of telecommunications (Art. 10(1) of the Basic Law (Grundgesetz – GG). The complainants are subscribers of telecommunications and internet services. The manual information procedure enables security authorities to obtain information from telecommunications enterprises, in particular, information on subscribers of telecommunications services or an IP address assigned at a certain point in time. The information that is provided includes personal customer data that is linked to the conclusion or performance of a contract (so-called subscriber data). Information on data that relates to the use of telecommunications services (so-called traffic data) and the actual content of telecommunications is not provided.<br>
In principle, providing information on subscriber data is permissible under constitutional law. Yet, similar to the image of a double-door, the legislature must create a proportionate legal basis for both the transfer of subscriber data by telecommunications providers and the retrieval of such data by the authorities. Provisions on transferring and retrieving data must adequately limit the purposes of the utilisation of data, particularly by establishing thresholds for the use of powers as part of the constituent elements of the provision and by providing for sufficiently meaningful protection of legal interests. The First Senate clarified that, in principle, despite the moderate weight of the interference, using the general powers to transfer and retrieve subscriber data in the context of maintaining public security and the activities of intelligence services requires there to be a specific danger in the individual case, and an initial suspicion of criminal conduct (Anfangsverdacht) in the context of the investigation and prosecution of offences. Where dynamic IP addresses are matched, this must additionally serve to protect or legally reinforce legal interests of at least considerable weight given the increased weight of the interference. Where, with regard to maintaining public security or activities of intelligence services, the thresholds for the use of powers require less than a specific danger, this must be compensated for by establishing stricter requirements for the weight of the legal interests meriting protection. For the most part, the challenged provisions did not satisfy these requirements. For the rest, the First Senate again held that information on login details may be provided only if the statutory requirements for its use are met.</p>

<p><strong>Facts of the case:</strong></p>

<p>§ 113 TKG permits the transfer of subscriber data by telecommunications providers in the context of a so-called manual information procedure. The other challenged provisions govern the retrieval of such data by various federal security authorities, such as the Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt), the Federal Police Office (Bundespolizei) and the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz). The challenged provisions were all aimed at implementing the Federal Constitutional Court’s decision of 24 January 2012 (Subscriber data I), in which the Court had declared parts of § 113 TKG, as it stood then, to be unconstitutional and had objected to the lack of ordinary law provisions on data retrieval. <br>
Telecommunications providers provide information pursuant to § 113 TKG at the request of one of the security authorities listed in § 113 TKG. Pursuant to § 113(1) first sentence TKG, the information that must be provided encompasses subscriber data such as the subscriber’s name, date of birth and phone number that must be retained as well as customer data which, pursuant to § 95 TKG, is retained voluntarily by the telecommunications providers for operational purposes. This usually includes the subscriber’s address, the type of the service as provided in the contract and other data such as their bank details.<br>
Pursuant to § 113(1) second sentence TKG, information must also be provided on login details like personal identification numbers (PIN) assigned by the telecommunications provider. By contrast, telecommunications providers usually only save passwords created by users themselves in an encrypted format. Thus, no information can be provided thereon.<br>
Pursuant to § 113(1) third sentence TKG, subscriber data may also be determined on the basis of an IP address that has been assigned at a specific point in time (dynamic IP address). The information that is provided includes the IP address matched to a specific subscriber and thus also forms part of the subscriber data. This is only possible where telecommunications providers analyse previously retained traffic data in order to identify the subscriber to whom the used IP address was assigned at the point in time specified in the request.<br>
Pursuant to § 113(2) first sentence TKG, information may be provided only if one of the authorities listed in § 113(3) TKG requests such information for the purpose of the investigation and prosecution of criminal or administrative offences, for averting dangers to the public order or security, or for performing the tasks conferred upon intelligence services under statutory law. In its request, the authority must state the provision that authorises data retrieval. <br>
The provisions on data retrieval challenged in the constitutional complaints set out that security authorities may request information on subscriber data from telecommunications providers. In essence, the provisions require only that the authorities need the information in order to perform their tasks. With respect to information on login details, the provisions imply that the statutory requirements for the use of such data are met. The provisions also permit requesting information on subscriber data that is determined on the basis of a dynamic IP address. The Federal Criminal Police Office, the Federal Police Office, the Customs Criminal Investigations Office (Zollkriminalamt) and the federal intelligence services are authorised to make such requests.</p>

<p><strong>Key considerations of the Senate:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I. In substantive terms, the challenged powers to transfer data under § 113 TKG do not satisfy the constitutional requirements that follow from the general right of personality deriving from Art. 2(1) in conjunction with Art. 1(1) GG and the privacy of telecommunications guaranteed by Art. 10(1) GG. It is true that these powers serve legitimate purposes – increasing the effectiveness of investigating and prosecuting offences, of maintaining public security, and of performing the tasks of the intelligence services. However, the provisions on the transfer of data are only compatible with the requirements of proportionality in its stricter sense if they limit the purposes for which these powers may be used with sufficient legal clarity.<br>
1. The powers laid down in § 113(1) first sentence TKG to request information on subscriber data in general does not satisfy these requirements.<br>
a) § 113(1) first sentence TKG permits requests for information on subscriber data in general; this amounts to an interference with the right to informational self-determination. Even though the interference is not of great weight, the challenged powers to transfer data are disproportionate because of their scope. It cannot be permissible to indiscriminately request information on data, even if its significance and possible uses are very limited. Thus, thresholds that limit the use of these powers are required; these thresholds must ensure that information can be obtained only if factual circumstances provide specific grounds for the use of these powers. Information that solely serves to facilitate the performance of the authority’s tasks in general may not be provided without specific grounds. The provision on data retrieval itself must set out thresholds for the use of these powers – this is the first door in the double door concept. In the context of maintaining public security and the activities of intelligence services, it is required that there be a specific danger in the specific case. In the context of the investigation and prosecution of offences, an initial suspicion is sufficient.<br>
However, under constitutional law, the legislature is not limited from the outset to establishing criteria for the use of powers that reflect the traditional security law approach to averting specific, imminent or present dangers. Rather, it can set wider limits by making requirements for foreseeability of the causal chain less strict under special circumstances. The legal basis for the use of powers must usually include the requirement that there be sufficient indications of a danger that is developing into being specific. For reasons stemming from the principle of proportionality, lowering the thresholds for the use of powers in such a manner is inextricably linked to increased requirements for the protection of specific legal interest; in this respect, regard must be had to the weight of the interference arising from the respective measure. Thus, interferences of lesser weight, such as requests for information on subscriber data in general might already be justified by a danger that is developing into being specific where the interferences serve to protect legal interest of at least considerable weight. <br>
In principle, these constitutional requirements apply to any authorisation to use powers with the aim of prevention and thus also to the utilisation of data by intelligence services. In this context, it …</p></div></div></div>

Developers commit directly into it and use it to deploy to the staging and production environment.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/05/Basic-git-workflow-3.png" alt="Basic Git Workflow"><figcaption>Basic Git Workflow with all commits getting added directly to master branch</figcaption></figure><p>This workflow isn’t usually recommended unless you’re working on a side project and you’re looking to get started quickly.</p><p>Since there is only one branch, there really is no process over here. This makes it effortless to get started with Git. However, some cons you need to keep in mind when using this workflow are:</p><ol><li>Collaborating on code will lead to multiple conflicts.</li><li>Chances of shipping buggy software to production is higher.</li><li>Maintaining clean code is harder.</li></ol><h2 id="2-git-feature-branch-workflow">2. Git Feature Branch Workflow</h2><p>The Git Feature Branch workflow becomes a must have when you have more than one developer working on the same codebase.</p><p>Imagine you have one developer who is working on a new feature. And another developer working on a second feature. Now, if both the developers work from the same branch and add commits to them, it would make the codebase a huge mess with plenty of conflicts.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/05/Feature-Branch-git-workflow-4.png" alt="Git feature branch workflow"><figcaption>Git workflow with feature branches</figcaption></figure><p>To avoid this, the two developers can create two separate branches from the master branch and work on their features individually. When they’re done with their feature, they can then merge their respective branch to the master branch, and deploy without having to wait for the second feature to be completed.</p><p>The Pros of using this workflow is, the git feature branch workflow allows you to collaborate on code without having to worry about code conflicts.</p><h2 id="3-git-feature-workflow-with-develop-branch">3. Git Feature Workflow with Develop Branch</h2><p>This workflow is one of the more popular workflows among developer teams. It’s similar to the Git Feature Branch workflow with a develop branch that is added in parallel to the master branch.</p><p>In this workflow, the master branch always reflects a production-ready state. Whenever the team wants to deploy to production they deploy it from the master branch.</p><p>The develop branch reflects the state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release. Developers create branches from the develop branch and work on new features. Once the feature is ready, it is tested, merged with develop branch, tested with the develop branch’s code in case there was a prior merge, and then merged with master.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/05/feature-branch-with-develop-git-workflow-2.png" alt="Git workflow with feature and develop branches"><figcaption>Git workflow with feature and develop branches</figcaption></figure><p>The advantage of this workflow is, it allows teams to consistently merge new features, test them in staging, and deploy to production. While maintaining code is easier, it can get a little tiresome for some teams since it can feel like going through a tedious process.</p><h2 id="4-gitflow-workflow">4. Gitflow Workflow</h2><p>The gitflow workflow is very similar to the previous workflow we discussed combined with two other branches — the release branch and the hot-fix branch.</p><h3 id="the-hot-fix-branch">The hot-fix branch</h3><p>The hot-fix branch is the only branch that is created from the master branch and directly merged to the master branch instead of the develop branch. It is used only when you have to quickly patch a production issue. An advantage of this branch is, it allows you to quickly deploy a production issue without disrupting others’ workflow or without having to wait for the next release cycle.</p><p>Once the fix is merged into the master branch and deployed, it should be merged into both develop and the current release branch. This is done to ensure that anyone who forks off develop to create a new feature branch has the latest code.</p><h3 id="the-release-branch">The release branch</h3><p>The release branch is forked off of develop branch after the develop branch has all the features planned for the release merged into it successfully.</p><p>No code related to new features is added into the release branch. Only code that relates the release is added to the release branch. For example, documentation, bug fixes, and other tasks related to this release are added to this branch.</p><p>Once this branch is merged with master and deployed to production, it’s also merged back into the develop branch, so that when a new feature is forked off of develop, it has the latest code.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/05/GitFlow-git-workflow-2.png" alt="Gitflow workflow"><figcaption>Gitflow workflow with hotfix and release branches</figcaption></figure><p>This workflow was first published and made popular by <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">Vincent Driessen</a> and since then it has been widely used by organizations that have a scheduled release cycle.</p><p>Since the git-flow is a wrapper around Git, you can install git-flow in your current repository. It's a straightforward process and it doesn't change anything in your repository other than creating branches for you. </p><p>To install on a Mac machine, execute <code>brew install git-flow</code> in your terminal.</p><p>To install on a Windows machine, you'll need to <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">download and install the git-flow</a>. After the installation is done, run <code>git flow init</code> to use it in your project.</p><h2 id="5-git-fork-workflow">5. Git Fork Workflow</h2><p>The Fork workflow is popular among teams who use open-source software.</p><p>The flow usually looks like this:</p><ol><li>The developer forks the open-source software’s official repository. A copy of this repository is created in their account.</li><li>The developer then clones the repository from their account to their local system.</li><li>A remote path for the official repository is added to the repository that is cloned to the local system.</li><li>The developer creates a new feature branch is created in their local system, makes changes, and commits them.</li><li>These changes along with the branch are pushed to the developer’s copy of the repository on their account.</li><li>A pull request from the branch is opened to the official repository.</li><li>The official repository’s manager checks the changes and approves the changes to get merged into the official repository.</li></ol><hr><h2 id="automating-your-git-workflows-for-better-productivity">Automating your Git Workflows for better productivity</h2><p>One of the things that developers have to constantly juggle with is updating their project management tool to keep their teammates updated. That’s why, at Zepel, our developers automate their workflow, so they can spend more of their time building the software.</p><p>Here’s how we automate our git workflow to keep everyone in sync:</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/04/zepel-git-developer-workflow.png" alt="Developer Workflow with GitHub, Zepel, and Slack Integrations"><figcaption>A simple flowchart of how developer workflow is automated with GitHub, Zepel, and Slack</figcaption></figure><p>While Zepel integrates deeply with <a href="https://zepel.io/guide/integrations/github/">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://zepel.io/guide/integrations/bitbucket/">Bitbucket</a>, and <a href="https://zepel.io/guide/integrations/gitlab/">GitLab</a>, we use GitHub internally. So, once we’ve integrated GitHub with Zepel, our development team sets up the git workflow automation within Zepel. Here’s how it looks today:</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/01/zepel-git-workflow-automation.png" alt="Git workflow automation"><figcaption>Automating Zepel to update statuses based on Git workflow.</figcaption></figure><p>As developers continue to make progress, our team automatically gets a Slack notification and their changes are recorded within the user story.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/05/image.png" alt="Git workflow updates to user story in real-time"><figcaption>Real-time updates on every commit, pull request, and branch changes.</figcaption></figure><hr><h2 id="your-own-workflow-">Your own workflow!</h2><p>The git workflows I’ve shown in this article are examples of some of the popular and best working workflows for the development team. Some teams create a branch for Staging and it works perfectly for them.</p><p>If you use other workflows that work well for you, tweet to us <a href="https://twitter.com/@getzepel">@getzepel</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span>There are many guides for making Jekyll websites with translated pages, but none of them resulted in something as foolproof and flexible as I need it to be. After trying several approaches, I found that using collections is the best way to set things up. In fact, I found that making a website multilingual is pretty easy!</span></p><h2 id="the-basics">The basics</h2><p>Most guides I found out there seem to be based on the principle laid out in Sylvain Durand’s <a href="https://www.sylvaindurand.org/making-jekyll-multilingual/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Making Jekyll multilingual</a>. If you’re getting started with translations, I recommend you read that first. I use the same basic approach. Each page and post gets a <code>translation_reference</code> property in its front matter: a string that is the same for all translations. That string can be used in liquid tags to look up translations.</p><h2 id="my-requirements">My requirements</h2><p>The examples I found didn’t solve all my problems, because they were either prone to errors in front matter or too rigid. So it turned out, I had a few more requirements than I thought I had. Here they are:</p><ol> <li>There’s a limited number of <strong>supported languages</strong>: languages for which there are a homepage, header and footer navigation.</li> <li>Pages may be added in an <strong>unsupported language</strong>: one-off pages for events in a specific locale for instance. These pages should have menus in the <strong>default language</strong>.</li> <li>Any page in a supported language can have <strong>any number of translations</strong> in supported languages.</li> <li>All content for a supported language should be <strong>stored in its own directory</strong>.</li> <li>The <strong>URL structure</strong> for pages in supported languages should follow the pattern <code>/[language code]/[page slug]</code> </li> <li>For supported languages, the only translation-related info stored in <strong>front matter</strong> should be the <code>translation_reference</code>; only pages in an unsupported language get a <code>language</code> property.</li> <li>All pages can get a <strong>translation menu</strong>. In that menu, for each supported language there is either a link to a translated page or, in case there is no translation, the homepage.</li></ol><h2 id="using-jekyll-collections-for-translations">Using Jekyll collections for translations</h2><p>A site’s <code>config.yml</code> allows defaults for both categories and collections. That means that you can set a URL pattern with a slug there and don’t have to define a permalink for each page. Nice!</p><p>But should we now use categories or collections for this? In my view, categories are useful mainly to organize posts. To be honest, I don’t understand the purpose of collections completely, but <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the docs</a> say:</p><blockquote><p>Collections are a great way to group related content like members of a team or talks at a conference.</p></blockquote><p>Since grouping related content (by language) is exactly what I want to do and because it’s likely that we’re going to need to use categories to organize posts at some stage, I decided to to use collections to organize translations.</p><p>Now my file structure looks like this:</p><div><div><pre><code>content
└─── _de
     └───  pages
     └───  posts
└─── _en
     └───  pages
     └───  posts
</code></pre></div></div><p>This means all pages for supported languages are in the <code>content</code> directory.</p><p>Note that for the language codes, I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ISO 639</a>. That way, they can be used directly to <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">define the page lanugage</a> in the head. That’s essential for accessibility and SEO.</p><p>In <code>config.yml</code> I’ve set up the following:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>language_default</span><span>:</span> <span>de</span>

<span>collections_dir</span><span>:</span> <span>content</span>
<span>collections</span><span>:</span>

</code></pre></div></div><p>This is all you need to organize content for a multilingual Jekyll website.</p><h3 id="finding-a-pages-translations">Finding a page’s translations</h3><p>With posts an pages in place, now we can access them in various ways. Perhaps the most important way to navigate multilingual content is showing a specific page’s translations in a layout template. To do that, we first get the language of the current page. If the page is in an unsupported language, its language code should be defined in its front matter. If we were sloppy and no language is defined, we use the default language so we don’t break anything:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>{%</span><span> </span><span>assign</span><span> </span><span>page_language</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>page</span><span>.</span><span>collection</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>page</span><span>.</span><span>language</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"none"</span><span> </span><span>%}</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>Now we can look up all pages with the same translation reference:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>{%</span><span> </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>page</span><span>.</span><span>translation_reference</span><span> </span><span>!=</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span> </span><span>%}</span>
  <span>{%</span><span> </span><span>assign</span><span> </span><span>page_translations</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>site</span><span>.</span><span>documents</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>where</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"translation_reference"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>page</span><span>.</span><span>translation_reference</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>where_exp</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"item"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"item.collection != page_language"</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>where_exp</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"item"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"item.published != false"</span><span> </span><span>%}</span>
<span>{%</span><span> </span><span>endif</span><span> </span><span>%}</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>For the translations menu, we’re using the <code>page_translations</code> variable we declared above. Then we create an array with all supported languages. Note that Jekyll automatically adds a collection for posts, so we need to ignore that one:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>{%</span><span> </span><span>assign</span><span> </span><span>languages</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>site</span><span>.</span><span>collections</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>where_exp</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"item"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"item.label != 'posts' and item.label != page_language "</span><span> </span><span>%}</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>And now it’s a matter of iterating through the languages, getting a translated page’s URL or using the homepage for the link instead:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>{%</span><span> </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>language</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>languages</span><span> </span><span>%}</span>

</code></pre></div></div><p>I use the same approach to create language-specific RSS feeds and translation links (the <code>&lt;link rel="alternate"&gt;</code> tags in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>). Except that those don’t have the other language’s homepage as a fallback, of course.</p><h3 id="finding-a-translated-string">Finding a translated string</h3><p>It’s a good habit to put UI copy like names of menu items in <code>yml</code> files in the <code>_data</code> directory (and not in the layout files themselves). When managing translations, this is essential. Here’s an example of a simplified data <code>yml</code> file for a menu:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>menu_title</span><span>:</span>
  <span>de</span><span>:</span> <span>Primäre Navigation</span>
  <span>en</span><span>:</span> <span>Primary navigation</span>

<span>menu_items</span><span>:</span>
  <span>de</span><span>:</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>label</span><span>:</span> <span>So funktioniert's</span>
      <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>/de/so-funktioniert-es</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>label</span><span>:</span> <span>Über uns</span>
      <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>/de/ueber-fortomorrow</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>label</span><span>:</span> <span>Blog</span>
      <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>/de/blog</span>

    <span>-</span> <span>label</span><span>:</span> <span>Join now</span>
      <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>/en/climate-subscriptions</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>Instead, you could use the languages as the top level identifier. I found the approach I show here works best, because the strings for the different languages appear together. That doesn’t just help understanding the meaning of the strings, but makes it easy to add, edit and remove strings too. The important thing here is to organize strings across multiple files using the same approach. That way you can copy code snippets between templates without having to adjust them for different data structures.</p><p>We use the menu data defined above like this:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>{%</span><span> </span><span>assign</span><span> </span><span>nav_language</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>page</span><span>.</span><span>collection</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>site</span><span>.</span><span>language_default</span><span> </span><span>%}</span>

<span>{%</span><span> </span><span>endunless</span><span> </span><span>%}</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>And we can now iterate through the menu items like you would with any liquid array:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>{%</span><span> </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>item</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>menu_items</span><span> </span><span>%}</span>

  &lt;/li&gt;
<span>{%</span><span> </span><span>endfor</span><span> </span><span>%}</span>

Dynamically accessing all documents in a collection</h4><p>I’ve done countless internet searches like ‘jekyll how to dynamically get documents in collection’. For some reason my memory fails to accept that this is the right syntax. It’s straightforward, though—this is how:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>{%</span><span> </span><span>assign</span><span> </span><span>documents</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>site</span><span>[</span><span>page</span><span>.</span><span>collection</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>%}</span>

Iterating through the documents and only showing posts</h4><p>With all the documents in the current archive page’s language stored in the <code>documents</code> variable, we can now iterate through that array. We only have to filter for the type of page; we only want the posts and not the pages. We could filter for the page’s layout, but there may be multiple post layouts in use. So instead, we simply filter for a string in the document paths:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>{%</span><span> </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>document</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>documents</span><span> </span><span>%}</span>

</code></pre></div></div><h3 id="multilingual-404-page">Multilingual 404 Page</h3><p>With Jekyll we can only define one 404 page for all languages. Because of that, the translations for that page work a bit differently. We add copy in all supported languages to the 404 page’s front matter. Then using JavaScript and the browser’s locale, we guess what language is best shown. The <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> fallback simply shows text all languages.</p><h3 id="drafts">Drafts</h3><p>With…</p></div></div>

<h2>Lockdowns &amp; remote work help create a new social class. The Sovereign Individual.</h2>

<p>The pandemic lockdown is creating a new social class. A group of emerging Sovereign Individuals that are changing how governments provide services to address collective action problems. This modern class divide is no longer a blue-collar versus white-collar issue. Rather, it’s a divide between digital workers and physical location-based workers.</p>



<p>The root of the problem is the adaptability of these social classes. Digital jobs can now be conducted from anywhere in the world and are inoculated to the pandemic. Location-based jobs are less flexible and are harmed by the lockdown.</p>



<p>This new social class divide is a major reason why the pandemic is more than a health crisis. It’s an economic crisis that highlights a growing divide already underway. Large populations have different needs. And governments have limited ability to apply support programs to meet these needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The consequence is a global shift that rewards sovereign and independent individuals. This class of people conduct digital work and are an emerging social class separate from physical modes of work.</p>



<p>As this class divide continues, global governments will change how they appeal to the diverging groups of people. Some will create favorable digital age policies. Others will cater to the location-based worker.</p>



<p>Read on for what the new class is, the key factors causing the change, and how it will impact your life.</p>



<h2>The Sovereign Individual&nbsp;is a New Social Class </h2>



<h3>Leveraging digital infrastructure to maximize individual choice</h3>



<p>Digital workers have the flexibility to move to locations that better meet their needs. These sovereign individuals include new types of occupations such as influencers and content creators.</p>



<p>Location-based flexibility creates a new form of personal sovereignty. Digital workers can now earn a living anywhere and choose a community that will appeal to their beliefs. Ex: moving to <a href="https://www.goabroad.com/articles/jobs-abroad/cheapest-countries-live-and-work">locations with lower cost of living</a>, <a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/regulations/hcra/univ_hlth_care.htm">healthcare not tied to employment</a>, or <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/100715/top-10-caribbean-tax-havens.asp">tax havens</a>. </p>



<p>This change will force governments to start marketing to the needs of these sovereign individuals.</p>



<h3>Bypassing protectionism of service industries</h3>



<p>Because of the ability to change locations at a whim, digital workers will experience <strong>new forms of leverage over political leaders</strong>. Adapting to this new class divide will prove complicated for lifelong politicians. The political elite will experience loss of influence with their traditional constituencies as these new social groups don’t form clean coalitions.</p>



<p>As digital workers move to foreign jurisdictions local governments will react. Tactics will include new laws including subsidies to one social class or another. They will implement capital controls and expatriation taxes. </p>



<p>In the past, this would be unavoidable but there are new digital technologies to bypass these controls.</p>



<p>As a result, we can expect to see these alternative global technologies like bitcoin benefit. Primarily because bitcoin appears to be a method for bypassing capital controls. Bitcoin may also prove to be an ideal method of global transaction leading up to this societal shift. Businesses with global workers in foreign jurisdictions may opt to pay all workers in bitcoin for ease of accounting.</p>



<h2>The Pandemic is Reinforcing&nbsp;Social Class Change</h2>



<h3>Lockdowns harm some more than others</h3>



<p>The early and primary solution for stoping the pandemic has been a lockdown. Closing all non-essential businesses. This harms any location-based businesses that don’t have the ability to generate income digitally. They either close operations completely or operate at severely restricted capacity. </p>



<p>This greatly impacts the ability of the business to survive and impacts employees ability to meet their financial obligations. Companies with <strong>digital workforces are able to push operations to remote work and retain business.</strong> Life in a pandemic is challenging albeit manageable for digital workers. </p>



<p>But it’s an impossible situation for the location-based businesses and workers. Many live paycheck to paycheck and  without government support a collective actions dilemma arises. Ie: you can go to work and get paid risking possible illness, or you can stay home and risk the consequences of no income. </p>



<h3><strong>Local governments, schools, and colleges are also closing</strong></h3>



<p>Schools are also subject to lockdown measures. In many cases, lessons have been moved online.  And with online classes, parents are finding they must supervise and often coach their young children through the process. For location-dependent workers, their children don’t receive adequate at-home support for their studies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital workers while working remotely, can supervise their children’s education in some capacity. By doing so, they can see their children get ahead of location-dependent workers unable to do so. Creating a self-reinforcing feedback loop and perpetuating this new class divide.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Government welfare &amp; subsidies for location-based workers</h3>



<p>There will always be a need for physical and location-dependent labor throughout society. These jobs will continue to be productive contributors until robots are capable of replacing them. So, government support of this emergent location-based class is essential. Especially during the pandemic to prevent a widening class divide. This has manifested as the temporary stimulus checks and increased unemployment compensation in the US. </p>



<p>As the class divide widens, we can expect a push for governments to continue subsidizing location-dependent workers. </p>



<h3>Trends in remote&nbsp;work – relocation of digital workers</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.sfgate.com/living-in-sf/article/2-out-of-3-tech-workers-would-leave-SF-15289316.php"><strong>Silicon Valley companies are leading the charge</strong></a> in offering remote work. Facebook and Twitter are large examples. The emerging trend: workers that can conduct digital business are exploring new living arrangements.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-workers-can-live-anywhere-many-ask-why-do-i-live-here-11592386201?mod=wsjtwittertest19"><strong>Digital workers have indicated they would relocate</strong></a> if given the ability to work from home. With greater frequency, this means leaving undesirable locations. As a result, locations with poor conditions in local jurisdictions are seeing a flight of digital workers.</p>



<p>Examples include New York, San Francisco, and other major cities seeing the flight of digital workers to the suburbs. Why? Because the virus impacts densely populated areas and lifestyle shifts under quarantine and lockdown in these environments are constrictive. Digital workers are opting to move away from populated areas in favor of rural and suburban locations. They are seeking homes that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-your-house-could-be-your-best-performing-asset-class-11596629101">provide better amenities to their lockdown and remote work needs</a>. </p>



<h3>Countries alter policies to appeal to remote&nbsp;workers</h3>



<p>Relocating also occurs for other reasons. As an example, some national jurisdictions have favorable policies for digital workers. </p>



<p>In the times of COVID-19, many small nations that rely on tourism are suffering from lower tourism. This has accelerated the push to find new ways to attract visitors. One way is reducing the restrictions on visas for digital workers. This allows digital workers an ability to live in new locations for extended periods of time. ex: <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bermuda-students-remote-workers-residency-certificates/">Bermuda</a>, <a href="https://en.unesco.org/courier/2017-april-june/global-lessons-estonia-s-tech-savvy-government">Estonia</a></p>



<h2>The Other Consequences of Remote&nbsp;Work</h2>



<h3>Offshoring labor</h3>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=416071110104123077126068082008080091040034086039061011092095125127008112065090072110053110119106112108049065002107115122083007033051039018060116014016086084077087001050055057126070071090123104125079023079002121118091084108122103029101082066070123000066&amp;EXT=pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">research paper by Britta Glennon</a> indicates that multinational corporations will offshore their workforce when skilled worker visas are unattainable.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>An increasingly high proportion of these workers — and particularly STEM workers — in the US were born abroad and immigrated to the US</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>restrictions on high skilled immigration caused increased foreign affiliate employment and made firms more likely to open up foreign affiliates abroad.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>The effect is strongest among R&amp;D-intensive firms in industries where services could more easily be offshored</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>US multinational firms are responsible for 80% of US R&amp;D and employ about ¼ of US private employees</p></blockquote>



<h3>Nations opt for tight border&nbsp;controls</h3>



<p>In a world where fear of the Pandemic is rampant, the US passport is no longer what it once was. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/us-international-travel-covid-19/index.html">The world has placed significant travel restrictions on US Passport holders.</a> Likewise, the US is implementing its own nationalist policies. Many of these policies are to protect the labor force from international competition. </p>



<p>Ex: the government implemented<a href="https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/sevp-modifies-temporary-exemptions-nonimmigrant-students-taking-online-courses-during#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Department%20of%20State,to%20enter%20the%20United%20States.&amp;text=Eligible%20F%20students%20may%20take,or%20three%20credit%20hours%20online."> student visa restrictions to foreign nationals. </a>Thus restricting who can attend school in this coming semester. As foreign students stop coming to the US for education, we can expect them to go elsewhere.</p>



<h3>New global labor arbitrage opportunities</h3>



<p>As digital workers begin moving to new locations, companies will alter how they manage labor. It will open new possibilities for hiring. Companies will seek out labor in new locations.</p>



<p>Combined with restrictive visa rules they may look outside of national jurisdictions. The foreign students rejected from coming to America will get educated elsewhere. And they will remain viable employment candidates.</p>



<p>This will create labor arbitrage opportunities. We can expect jobs will move to new locations based on where the digital talent lives. We can also expect this to create a great equalization of opportunity. As companies grow their workforce across time zones we can expect to see foreign national workers benefit.</p>



<p>This will reduce costs to businesses as they pay salaries according to localized costs of living. Further reinforcing the expansion of opportunity to globalized markets of digital workers.</p>



<h2>Why You Should Care</h2>



<p><br>Where you live and who you elect to create laws are affected by this evolving social class divide. Governments are adopting new ways to protect their workers both location-based and digital. But not all traditional policies impact these classes of people in the same way. </p>



<p>As we enter the next phase of the pandemic, the real economic burdens of lockdown will begin to show. Digital workers embracing remote work will start to move. Students …</p></div></div>

<p>If you read a description of a static analysis in a paper, what might you find? There’ll be some cute model of a language. Maybe some inference rules describing the analysis itself, but those rules probably rely on a variety of helper functions. These days, the analysis likely involves some logical reasoning: about the terms in the language, the branches conditionals might take, and so on.</p>



<p>What makes a language good for implementing such an analysis? You’d want a variety of features:</p>



<ul><li>Algebraic data types to model the language AST.</li><li>Logic programming for cleanly specifying inference rules.</li><li>Pure functional code for writing the helper functions.</li><li>An SMT solver for answering logical queries.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~bembenek/">Aaron Bembenek</a>, <a href="https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~chong/">Steve Chong</a>, and I have developed a design that hits the sweet spot of those four points: given Datalog as a core, you add constructors, pure ML, and a type-safe interface to SMT. If you set things up just right, the system is a powerful and ergonomic way to write static analyses.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/HarvardPL/formulog">Formulog</a> is our prototype implementation of our design; our <a href="https://cs.pomona.edu/~michael/papers/formulog_sub2020.pdf">paper on Formulog and its design</a> was just conditionally accepted to <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/track/splash-2020-oopsla">OOPSLA 2020</a>. To give a sense of why I’m excited, let me excerpt from our <a href="https://github.com/HarvardPL/formulog/blob/master/examples/liquid_types.flg">simple liquid type checker</a>. Weighing in under 400 very short lines, it’s a nice showcase of how expressive Formulog is. (Our paper discusses substantially more complex examples.)</p>



<pre>type base =
&nbsp;&nbsp;| base_bool

type typ = 
&nbsp;&nbsp;| typ_tvar(tvar)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| typ_fun(var, typ, typ)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| typ_forall(tvar, typ)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| typ_ref(var, base, exp)

and exp = 
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_var(var)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_bool(bool)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_op(op)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_lam(var, typ, exp)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_tlam(tvar, exp)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_app(exp, exp)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_tapp(exp, typ)
</pre>



<p>ADTs let you define your AST in a straightforward way. Here, <code>bool</code> is our only base type, but we could add more. Let’s look at some of the inference rules:</p>



<pre>(* subtyping *)
output sub(ctx, typ, typ)

(* bidirectional typing rules *)
output synth(ctx, exp, typ)
output check(ctx, exp, typ)

(* subtyping between refinement types is implication *)
sub(G, typ_ref(X, B, E1), typ_ref(Y, B, E2)) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;wf_ctx(G),
&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_subst(Y, exp_var(X), E2) = E2prime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;encode_ctx(G, PhiG),
&nbsp;&nbsp;encode_exp(E1, Phi1),
&nbsp;&nbsp;encode_exp(E2prime, Phi2),
&nbsp;&nbsp;is_valid(`PhiG /\ Phi1 ==&gt; Phi2`).

(* lambda and application synth rules *)
synth(G, exp_lam(X, T1, E), T) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;wf_typ(G, T1),
&nbsp;&nbsp;synth(ctx_var(G, X, T1), E, T2),
&nbsp;&nbsp;typ_fun(X, T1, T2) = T.

synth(G, exp_app(E1, E2), T) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;synth(G, E1, typ_fun(X, T1, T2)),
&nbsp;&nbsp;check(G, E2, T1),
&nbsp;&nbsp;typ_subst(X, E2, T2) = T.

(* the only checking rule *)
check(G, E, T) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;synth(G, E, Tprime),
&nbsp;&nbsp;sub(G, Tprime, T).</pre>



<p>First, we declare our relations—that is, the (typed) inference rules we’ll be using. We show the most interesting case of subtyping: refinement implication. Several helper relations (<code>wf_ctx</code>, <code>encode_*</code>) and helper functions (<code>exp_subst</code>) patch things together. The typing rules below follow a similar pattern, mixing the <code>synth</code> and <code>check</code> bidirectional typing relations with calls to helper functions like <code>typ_subst</code>.</p>



<pre>fun exp_subst(X: var, E : exp, Etgt : exp) : exp =
&nbsp;&nbsp;match Etgt with
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_var(Y) =&gt; if X = Y then E else Etgt
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_bool(_) =&gt; Etgt
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_op(_) =&gt; Etgt
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_lam(Y, Tlam, Elam) =&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let Yfresh = 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fresh_for(Y, X::append(typ_freevars(Tlam), exp_freevars(Elam)))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let Elamfresh = 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Y = Yfresh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then Elam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else exp_subst(Y, exp_var(Yfresh), Elam)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_lam(Yfresh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;typ_subst(X, E, Tlam),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elamfresh)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_tlam(A, Etlam) =&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_tlam(A, exp_subst(X, E, Etlam))
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_app(E1, E2) =&gt; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_app(exp_subst(X, E, E1), exp_subst(X, E, E2))
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_tapp(Etapp, T) =&gt; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_tapp(exp_subst(X, E, Etapp), typ_subst(X, E, T))
&nbsp;&nbsp;end</pre>



<p>Expression substitution might be boring, but it shows the ML fragment well enough. It’s more or less the usual ML, though functions need to have pure interfaces, and we have a few restrictions in place to keep typing simple in our prototype.</p>



<p>There’s lots of fun stuff that doesn’t make it into this example: not only can relations call functions, but functions can examine relations (so long as everything is stratified). Hiding inside <code>fresh_for</code> is a clever approach to name generation that guarantees freshness… but is also deterministic and won’t interfere with parallel execution. The <a href="https://cs.pomona.edu/~michael/papers/formulog_sub2020.pdf">draft paper</a> has more substantial examples.</p>



<p>We’re not the first to combine logic programming and SMT. What makes our design a sweet spot is that it doesn’t let SMT get in the way of Datalog’s straightforward and powerful execution model. Datalog execution is readily parallelizable; the magic sets transformation can turn Datalog’s exhaustive, bottom-up search into a goal-directed one. It’s not news that Datalog can turn these tricks—<a href="https://bitbucket.org/yanniss/doop/src/master/">Yiannis Smaragdakis has been saying it for years</a>!—but integrating Datalog cleanly with ML functions and SMT is new. Check out the <a href="https://cs.pomona.edu/~michael/papers/formulog_sub2020.pdf">draft paper</a> for a detailed related work comparison. While our design is, in the end, not so complicated, getting there was hard.</p>



<p>Relatedly, we have also have an <a href="https://cs.pomona.edu/~michael/papers/iclp2020_extabs.pdf">extended abstract at ICLP 2020</a>, detailing some experiments in using incremental solving modes from Formulog. You might worry that Datalog’s BFS (or heuristic) strategy wouldn’t work with an SMT solver’s push/pop (i.e., DFS) assertion stack—but a few implementation tricks and <code>check-sat-assuming</code> indeed provide speedups.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    

<div>
  
<p><img src="https://blot.im/cdn/blog_8b0a23dc03d84943adf8be09b08014a6/_image_cache/27c93597-70c8-465e-b77b-5b2eba72b047.jpg" width="640" height="427" data-action="zoom"></p>
<p>I was talking to a friend and recounting my experiences building multiple SaaS startups and why SaaS is generally a tough nut to break into. While I was talking to her, I started asking myself with the benefit of hindsight<span></span> <span>“</span>What would I do differently the next time?”. Here are a couple of things I would have done differently, irrespective of what I was building.</p>
<h2 id="start-with-the-price">Start with the price:</h2>
<p>This was the top-most thing that came to my mind when I asked that question, for a good reason. Price influences many things: Your customer segments, your retention, sales and renewal cycles and most importantly MRR/ARR. If you price something too high, you will need to come up with a significant differentiation w.r.t your lower priced competition. If you price something too low, you will need to go through motions of raising the prices slightly and risk drawing ire from your early users. What about Freemium? Better have a good reason for doing so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Research, experiment and choose your price carefully!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="choose-who-you-let-in-and-out">Choose who you let in and out:</h2>
<p>Understanding and mapping this audience will help you understand how they influence your Sales and Product strategy. There are three major buckets you can divide your SaaS customers into: Significant Gainers, Outsourcers and Underserved segments. Significant Gainers are the accounts who will end up as a net-net <span>ROI</span> gainers. Outsourcers are typically large accounts &amp; have a good mapping with your offerings, they may end up outsourcing all of their headaches on to you. Underserved accounts are not completely sold by your offerings or there is a good lapse in the expectation, price or (worse) their <span>ROI</span>. It’s always a good idea to try and balance all of them in a way that you don’t become a service shop for your top 10-20% accounts and under-satisfy the rest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Try to map the <span>ROI</span>, their impact on your revenue and roadmaps before you onboard accounts.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="break-down-the-journeys-and-map-them-to-specific-stakeholders">Break down the journeys and map them to specific stakeholders:</h2>
<p>Break the journeys down and map them to specific stakeholders. If you want to onboard accounts where the annual ticket sizes are more than 25K$+ spend some time here. Acquisitions of large accounts typically have four specific journeys:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interested/ Chase me,</li>
<li>Want to Evaluate,</li>
<li>Procurement,</li>
<li>Onboard Me (&amp; my problems).</li>
</ul>
<p>At every step of the way you will meet different POCs/Teams handholding &amp; influencing the specific journeys. Understand how other deals have gone through these stages and make it brain-dead simple. It seems obvious but in retrospect, this is mostly an after-thought and not the first thought.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Optimize to get to<span></span> <span>“</span>I need this now”,<span></span> <span>“</span>This looks good” and<span></span> <span>“</span>This is approved” mails as quickly as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="have-exit-interviews-at-both-evaluations-and-churned-stages.">Have exit interviews at both Evaluations and Churned stages.:</h2>
<p>When you build a tool that solves (one or more) problem(s), understand that there are a number of possible solutions. Understanding the market’s expectations continually can only happen if you ingest valid feedback at proper places. The most significant places are: Whenever demos/pitches happen, and whenever someone churns. Pitches are akin to coffee dates, sometimes they just don’t work out. Be prepared to get all sorts of feedback if done right. Existing accounts are like married couples and as with every failed marriage, the reasons are typically a mismatch in expectations or not being respected in the relationship. Try to solve for this before the dwindling bottom funnel becomes a problem!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Failed expectations typically end up in churns, so avoid it like the plague.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="have-strong-opinions-weakly-held">Have strong opinions weakly held:</h2>
<p>Intuition and Opinions will rarely ever take you far along the right path. Everyone (including me) has an opinion on making things work and building something. That doesn’t mean whatever works for you is wrong, learn to differentiate between signal and noise. But always remember when the map doesn’t match the territory the map is wrong. I wish I had listened to customers more than thought leaders and filtered signals from various noises. Be open to change at every step of the way - it’s the only way to grow. Look (upto) at companies that disrupt themselves or cannibalise themselves, as they can teach you a lot. Nothing is truly one-size fits all!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you make the same mistake twice, it’s not a mistake anymore, but a <a href="mailto:f@#kup">f@#kup</a>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is mostly a collection of stuff I messed up on, that doesn’t mean there will be a 1-1 mapping with whatever you are doing. Remember to have fun while building, &amp; ship stuff you are proud of!&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>P.S: I would love to know more about what you think about the same? Also thanks to Bhavya for reviewing and suggesting edits to the early drafts for this post.</p>

<p><em>India’s first lunar mission, Chandrayaan 1, <a href="https://jatan.space/how-nasa-and-chandrayaan-discovered-water-on-the-moon/">confirmed the presence</a> of water on the Moon. It was a groundbreaking achievement for its Mission Director, Srinivasa Hegde, who worked at the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) for 36 years, from 1978 to 2014. At&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.isro.gov.in/about-isro/u-r-rao-satellite-centre-ursc" target="_blank">ISRO’s Satellite Center</a> in Bangalore, he was involved in planning, analysis and operations for dozens of space missions.</em></p>



<p><em>I interviewed him for Supercluster on his role as Mission Director for Chandrayaan 1 and India’s future in space. The responses have been edited for clarity and some links and images have been added for the reader’s benefit.</em></p>



<hr>



<h5><strong>What first got you interested in space exploration?</strong></h5>



<p>As a kid, I was influenced by my grandfather. He was a Sanskrit scholar and an astrologer, with a love for stars in the sky. He used to take me for early morning walks before dawn. During those days of reduced pollution, many constellations were clearly visible. He used to identify and explain all the constellations to me and I was intrigued. Besides, I was generally interested in science and reading up on new discoveries and happenings in the field. Then one day I came across a job opening at ISRO for which I applied and got selected.</p>



<h5><strong><strong>Chandrayaan 1 was the first time India explored another world. What were the early stages of its conception like at ISRO?</strong></strong></h5>



<p>Dr. K. Kasturirangan, who chaired ISRO from 1994 to 2003, wanted the organization to play a small role in India’s ambition to become a superpower. This planted the seed for undertaking more ambitious missions. The idea of a Moon orbiter was floated around and was received positively by everyone.</p>



<p>At the time, ISRO already had satellites intended for geostationary applications which have plenty of fuel. So the basic infrastructure was ready and the only delta required was adapting it to the Moon. Initial calculations showed that our PSLV rocket was capable of giving an Earth-bound orbit beyond which the fuel on the spacecraft could be used to go to the Moon and perform orbital capture. In all, Chandrayaan 1 seemed like a logical extension of our capabilities.</p>



<h5><strong>What did your role as Chandrayaan 1’s Mission Director involve and what was your biggest challenge?</strong></h5>



<p>I was involved in all aspects of the Mission Design – the design of the various orbits, data management, orbit determination, strategies for mid-course corrections, etc. and also in aspects of operating the spacecraft.</p>



<p>Chandrayaan 1 was the first ISRO project to involve many foreigners who had their scientific instruments onboard. As Mission Director, I was tasked with accommodating their needs. It posed challenges because they had diverse requirements.</p>



<p>For instance, scientists behind the Mini-SAR payload wanted to calibrate the instrument when the spacecraft would be en-route to the Moon. They were unhappy with the fact that we couldn’t accommodate that due to certain changes in our launch schedule. However, at a later stage we provided them with a geometry in lunar orbit for calibration which they said was even better than what they originally asked for.</p>



<h5><strong>Was finding water on the Moon a primary scientific objective during the planning of Chandrayaan 1? Why was it important?</strong></h5>



<p>Absolutely. NASA missions to the Moon in the past decade had already hinted at the possibility of water ice being trapped in the permanently shadowed regions of the Moon. So it was crucial to confirm its presence as it has implications for future human settlements as well as getting insights on <a href="https://jatan.space/apollo-moon-origin/">the Moon’s origin</a>.</p>



<h5><strong>For Chandrayaan 1, ISRO solicited scientific instruments from other space agencies around the world. What was the driving philosophy behind that?</strong></h5>



<p>We had our own science payloads on Chandrayaan 1 but given the renewed global interest in the Moon after so many decades, we also wanted to provide the spacecraft as a platform for others. And so ISRO put out an announcement of opportunity to scientists all over the world to pitch payloads for Chandrayaan 1. We got instruments from ESA as well as NASA, including Universities associated with them. I think the timing of Chandrayaan 1 was good as NASA’s next Moon mapper, LRO, was still a year away.</p>



<h5><strong>Tell us about the <a href="https://jatan.space/how-nasa-and-chandrayaan-discovered-water-on-the-moon/">discovery of water</a> on the Moon by the NASA instruments onboard Chandrayaan 1 and more on the India-USA partnership.</strong></h5>



<p>As discussed, NASA scientists were really interested in putting their instruments on Chandrayaan 1 and working with us to confirm the presence of water. The discovery ultimately came from two NASA-built instruments – the Miniature Synthetic Aperture Radar (Mini-SAR) and the Moon Mineralogical Mapper (M3).</p>



<p>Mini-SAR <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Mini-RF/multimedia/feature_ice_like_deposits.html">found</a> that more than 40 craters on the lunar poles reflected signals in patterns consistent with water ice. However, there was still some uncertainty like in previous missions about the detections really being water ice.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/c2356-mini-sar-finds-water-ice.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Likely water ice on the Moon’s north pole (marked by green circles) found by Chandrayaan 1 instrument Mini-SAR. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Mini-RF/multimedia/feature_ice_like_deposits.html">Credit: NASA</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It was the M3 instrument that <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7218">confirmed</a> water ice being present in the polar craters based on how the surface absorbed infrared light. In fact, M3 detected water and hydroxyl molecules almost everywhere on the Moon. Scientists now knew for the first time that the lunar soil does hold trace amounts of water even in the non-polar regions.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3cc0f-water-ice-moon-map-m3.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Distribution of water ice on the lunar poles mapped by Chandrayaan 1 instrument M3. <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7218">Credit: NASA</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The India-USA partnership on Chandrayaan 1 also extended to NASA providing us access to its iconic Deep Space Network which was used for communications with the spacecraft.</p>



<h5><strong>What was the most challenging scenario when operating Chandrayaan 1 in lunar orbit?</strong></h5>



<p>Oh, this is my favorite part! Chandrayaan 1 actually managed to view a solar eclipse from the Moon! We were able to see the Moon’s shadow cast on Earth. In 2009, a year after launch, both the star sensors onboard the spacecraft had failed. With that, the spacecraft lost its ability to precisely point to a desired attitude in space. A mission failure was looming.</p>



<p>Instead of losing the craft, we came up with a solution that involved using the Sun sensors to get knowledge of two spatial axes and take aid from the ground station to know the third. This data was utilized by the onboard gyroscopes to be able to point the spacecraft again with reasonable accuracy. The mission was back up and running.</p>



<p>As the spacecraft passed between the Moon and Earth in its lunar orbit on July 22, 2009, it imaged the Moon’s shadow cast on our planet. This was a first for any lunar mission and completely executed when the spacecraft was in a non-nominal state.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ch-1-solar-eclipse.gif?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>The totality shadow cast on Earth by the Moon during the total solar eclipse of July 22, 2009, as captured by the Chandrayaan 1 spacecraft from lunar orbit. Images credit: ISRO, GIF: Jatan Mehta</figcaption></figure></div>



<h5><strong>Do you think there’s enough water on the Moon’s poles to power large human settlements in the future?</strong></h5>



<p>It’s too early to comment but going by the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Mini-RF/multimedia/feature_ice_like_deposits.html">amount estimated</a> from Chandrayaan 1 Mini-SAR observations, it seems there could be enough. Chandrayaan 2’s orbiter can tell us more details about it.</p>



<h5><strong>How is the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter positioned to provide us more insights on water on the Moon?</strong></h5>



<p>The Chandrayaan 2 orbiter has <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/chandrayaan2-payloads">upgraded instruments</a>. It’s infrared spectrometer will build a global, high-resolution map of water concentrations in the lunar soil and how the amount changes in response to the lunar environment.</p>



<p>The upgraded radar, that can penetrate deeper, will map the water ice trapped in the lunar poles and quantify its amount, something no one has adequately done yet.</p>



<h5><strong>How can India compete with China and the USA in the renewed Moon race?</strong></h5>



<p>It is difficult as both these nations have enormous resources. But the spectrum of science that can be done on the Moon is vast and our strategy has been to fill crucial gaps in our current understanding, like the discovery of water.</p>



<h5><strong>Which planetary destination do you think India should aim for next and why?</strong></h5>



<p>Saturn’s moon Enceladus. It&nbsp;is mostly covered with fresh, clean ice, making it one of the most reflective bodies in the Solar System and is known to host water underneath that icy surface. After Cassini spacecraft’s <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/new-organic-compounds-found-in-enceladus-ice-grains">discovery of organic compounds</a> in Enceladus’ plumes, it has become, to me, by far the most interesting object in the Solar System.</p>



<h5><strong>What does having a planetary exploration program mean for a country like India?</strong></h5>



<p>It plays an important role in eventual settlement of space. Doing such missions means we gain new capabilities and experiences, all of which give us a good starting point for future endeavors. For instance, the most notable thing in Chandrayaan 2 is that all of its cutting-edge scientific instruments are designed and built indigenously.</p>



<h5><strong>What are your thoughts on India sending its own astronauts to space, aka the Gaganyaan program?</strong></h5>



<p>Sending humans to space involves too many challenges, like ruggedization of the spacecraft and launcher, having enough fuel at all stages, complex trajectories, multi-layered redundancy in spacecraft functions, etc. At every stage, there should be a means to get back humans safely and there is little to no tolerance for failure. With all those requirements, Gaganyaan is certainly a very expensive undertaking. But it has to be done sooner or later for space settlement, so why not now?</p>



<h5><strong>Throughout your career at ISRO, how have you seen the landscape for women in STEM change?</strong></h5>



<p>There are many <a href="https://jatan.space/book-review-those-magnificent-women-and-their-stories/">women at ISRO</a> who are capable and doing exceptional work. Over the years they have rightly assumed increasingly higher and more versatile positions inside ISRO’s various missions and centers. This includes women who aren’t necessarily photogenic and don’t feel the need to be in the limelight.</p>



<h5><strong>Should humanity establish permanent presence on the Moon first or Mars?</strong></h5>

<p>This is a follow-up to my previous post: <a href="https://blog.gingerlime.com/2020/hey-com-is-onto-something-with-its-tracking-pixel-blocker/">hey.com is onto something with its tracking-pixel blocker</a>. I mentioned contacting Backblaze about their email tracking there. </p>

<p>I didn’t think too much of it at the time, and honestly (or naively?) was expecting some kind of a “Oh, yes, you’re right, there’s no need to track those emails”… But it didn’t unfold in quite the same way.</p>



<h2>TL;DR</h2>



<p>This is my own interpretation, obviously. Backblaze seems to think that tracking emails is totally fine, even under the GDPR. They’re not going to stop doing it until further notice.</p>



<h2>Blow by blow details</h2>



<p>Rather than describing the conversation, I think for the sake of transparency it’s easier to just quote the entire thread. So here goes, in chronological order… I removed names and identifying details to protect the privacy of the people involved, but the text was otherwise left exactly as-is. Some of the interaction is fairly mundane, but you can skip to the end to see how it was resolved (or rather, not resolved).</p>



<h2>Initial conversations with Backblaze support</h2>



<figure><div>Jun 20, 2020<p>Hi Backblaze,</p><p>I started forwarding my emails to hey.com and they spotted the use of tracking pixels on your emails. I (and I believe many other customers, especially in Europe) would appreciate not being tracked without explicit consent (and I didn’t give such consent).</p><p>Respectfully,<br>Yoav</p></div></figure>



<figure><div>Jun 21, 2020<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you for writing in. We do use Sendgrid to send system emails, and only collect if an email was delivered, opened, and how many times it was opened. We do not gather other information beyond that.&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that the terms can be found when you click on the link below and by using the service agree to our terms:<br>–&nbsp;<a href="http://www.backblaze.com/terms.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">http://www.backblaze.com/terms.html</a></p><p>All the best,<br>A.<br>Support Technician</p></div></figure>



<figure><div>Jun 21, 2020<p>Hi A.,</p><p>Thanks for getting back to me. Your terms page doesn’t actually say anything about tracking my email opens etc. Or at least I couldn’t find anything.</p><p>Regardless, I don’t believe this is permissible without explicit consent under the GDPR. I also don’t quite understand why you would even want to track those alert emails?</p><p>Sincerely,<br>Yoav</p></div></figure>



<figure></figure>



<figure><div>Jun 22, 2020<p>Hi A.,</p><p>Perhaps the timestamps on their own aren’t considered personal data, but combined with my email address, IP, browser info etc, I’m pretty sure falls under personal data as defined by the GDPR. According to two articles I was able to find, this kind of tracking isn’t permissible by GDPR and the e-Privacy directive without explicit consent, which was not requested, nor given by me.</p><p><a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=ac233fd4-cd49-45a7-9494-6085512c0312" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=ac233fd4-cd49-45a7-9494-6085512c0312</a><br><a href="https://www.pipedrive.com/en/blog/gdpr-email-tracking" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://www.pipedrive.com/en/blog/gdpr-email-tracking</a></p><p>The links you provided so far do not appear to address this issue. Would appreciate if you could look into this more seriously.</p><p>Sincerely,<br>Yoav</p></div></figure>



<figure><div>Jun 23, 2020<p>Hello Yoav,</p><p>I asked my Compliance organization to review your concerns. They noted that much of the literature around this topic deals with Marketing Emails, which you can opt-out of at any time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For Service Emails, which the message in question is, the rules are less clear and they will contact our GDPR attorney in the EU for clarification. That said, I believe you have four choices:<br>1) You may alter the settings on your email system to receive such emails as text, this will remove all tracking,<br>2) You can discontinue using the Backblaze service and delete your Backblaze account if you remain an active customer we will continue to send you Service emails per our Terms,<br>3) You can wait to see what our GDPR attorney says, or<br>4) You may file a complaint with the GDPR authorities in your jurisdiction.</p><p>All the best,<br>A.<br>Support Technician</p></div></figure>



<figure><div>Jun 23, 2020<p>Hi A.,</p><p>Happy to wait and hear from your GDPR attorneys.</p><p>I agree that most resources talk about marketing emails, because those are the most prevalent and most common use-case of B2C and B2B emails these days. Transactional emails are generally considered legitimate use, and in this case, I explicitly asked for those emails. So there’s no question there about *sending* these emails. As far as *tracking* how I interacted with the email, as well as further personal data like IP address, device/browser info etc (that this type of tracking typically involves), and storing this info on Sendgrid’s servers, I’m pretty confident that this isn’t considered legitimate without informed and explicit consent under the GDPR and the ePrivacy directives. hey.com seem also quite confident that this is illegal (although I don’t take legal advice from them).</p><p>But besides that, I’m just curious to understand why Backblaze even cares to track those emails? what insights do you gain from knowing that X% of those emails were opened? (especially given that those stats are hugely inaccurate and some email clients block them anyway?). Wouldn’t it be easier to do the right thing here, respect your customers privacy, and stop tracking those emails? (or if you do gain important insights, explicitly and clearly ask for consent?)</p><p>Sincerely,<br>Yoav</p><p>p.s. I also believe the same rules apply to tracking of marketing emails, even if someone explicitly gives consent to *receive* those, it does not automatically mean that they give consent to being tracked, and the privacy implications of such tracking.</p></div></figure>



<figure><div>Jun 24, 2020<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p><p>I have referred the matter to the legal department and will need to close this ticket. Any further communication will come from <a href="mailto:legal@backblaze.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">legal@backblaze.com</a>.</p><p>All the best,<br>A.<br>Support Technician</p></div></figure>



<h2>A month passes…</h2>



<p>I was losing my patience, so sent another message to Backblaze.</p>



<figure><div>Jul 25, 2020<p>This is a follow-up to your previous request #ZZZZZZZ “email tracking”</p><p>Hi A.,It’s been a month now, and I still haven’t heard back. Would appreciate if someone can get back to me on this.</p><p>Sincerely,<br>Yoav</p></div></figure>



<div><div>
<figure><div>Jul 25, 2020<p>Hi Yoav,</p><p>Thank you for reaching out regarding this issue. Apologies for any delay. I’m sorry to say but further communication will need to go through <a href="mailto:legal@backblaze.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">legal@backblaze.com</a>.</p><p>Please reach out to that email for additional information.<br>M.<br>Support Technician</p></div></figure>



<figure><div>Jul 26, 2020<p>Hi M.,</p><p>Yes, but it’s been a month, and I believe that under GDPR I can typically expect an answer within a month? see https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/time-limits-for-responding-to-data-protection-rights-requests/</p><p>Looking forward to hearing back from whichever team/person that can handle my enquiry.</p><p>Sincerely,<br>Yoav</p></div></figure>



<h2>Legal department steps in</h2>



<figure><div>Jul 31, 2020<p>Hi Yoav,</p><p>Thank you for following up on this matter. We take data privacy matters very seriously at Backblaze, Inc. We have reviewed your concerns and understand your sensitivity regarding the use of tracking technology on emails. In this particular case, we believe there is an exception allowed for doing so for a valid business purpose. There are two reasons we believe this is necessary.</p><p>The first reason is to accurately measure the reach and usefulness of our service email messages to our customers. Service emails communicate important information to the customer and if they are not being received or opened, valuable information is being missed. For example, the customer’s data we are storing could be at risk of being deleted, or their account could be in peril of being compromised. We use the tracking technology to provide an aggregated measure of this information versus using more invasive technologies such as user surveys or onscreen popups. Over the years we have sent many service emails and we have a full understanding as to the delivery and open rates of our service emails. As such, any anomalies are easily detected and can be acted upon to improve how well we communicate with our customers.</p><p>The second reason is for forensic purposes to respond to questions from customers and defend ourselves as needed. For example, we send multiple service emails to a customer whose subscription is expiring, as once it does expire, we will close their account and delete the data we are storing for them. From time-to-time an ex-customer will want their data and claim we did not notify them that their account was expiring. The tracking technology allows us to show what messages we have sent and what messages the customer received and opened. While not perfect, it has helped us defend ourselves in the past. There is no reasonable replacement for using the tracking technology in such cases. By the way, the same technology also allows us to prove the customer right in many cases, so it delivers value and protects both us and the customer at the same time.</p><p>Thank you for being a valued customer.</p><p>Best regards,<br>T.<br>Legal Department</p></div></figure>



<figure><div>Aug 1, 2020<p>Hi T.,</p><p>Thanks for getting back to me and explaining your reasoning in detail.</p><p>I have to admit, it sounds a bit like a husband spying on their wife “because they love her” to some extent. I don’t feel like these are valid reasons for blanket tracking of ALL emails across all customers, which seems to be the case at Backblaze. As far as I can tell, all Backblaze emails are tracking me and all other customers, from newsletters, across minor service notifications all the way to billing and other messages. Not all messages are the same, but they are all tracked in the same way as far as I can tell. Furthermore, not only there is no informed consent for this tracking, there’s actually no opt-out mechanism either. As a customer, I cannot tell you that I want your service emails, but I don’t want them tracking me. I don’t believe this meets the spirit nor the letter of the GDPR.</p><p>The first example does not at all sound like a legitimate reason to me, and I doubt the data protection authorities will accept it as legitimate either. Especially when it applies to all emails, including minor notifications, newsletters and other marketing materials. What you’re describing is that you’re compromising the privacy of your customers for your own internal reasons for marketing purposes. And as I mentioned before, with no informed consent, nor opt-out options. But besides that, given …</p></div></figure></div></div></div></article></main></div></div></div></div></div>

<![CDATA[The wrong way to filter sockets with BPF]]>
            </title>

August 8, 2020 | https://natanyellin.com/posts/ebpf-filtering-done-right/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://natanyellin.com/posts/ebpf-filtering-done-right/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>Here is a bug that everyone who uses BPF to filter packets on Linux eventually encounters:  you create a socket, use setsockopt to apply a BPF, and then read from the socket using recv. You read a packet that does <strong>not</strong> match the filter but was received from the socket anyway. The bug only happens when there is a lot of traffic and even then it only occurs when the application first starts. What is happening?</p>

<p>Here is some code which suffers from this issue. Error-handling has been removed for conciseness:</p>

<pre><code>int sock = socket(AF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW, htons(ETH_P_ALL));

struct sock_filter bpf_bytecode[] = { ... }; // bytecode generated by hand or using "tcpdump -dd"
struct sock_fprog bpf_program = { sizeof(bpf_bytecode) / sizeof(bpf_bytecode[0]), bpf_bytecode};
int err = setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ATTACH_FILTER, &amp;bpf_program, sizeof(bpf_program));

char buffer[MAX_PACKET_SIZE];
int n = recv(sock, buffer, MAX_PACKET_SIZE, NO_OPTIONS); // buffer will sometimes contain a packet that doesn't match the bpf
</code></pre>

<p>The bug here is deceptively simple: Packets are filtered when they are received by the kernel <strong>not</strong> when they are read by user-mode using recv. Therefore packets which don’t match the BPF can be received after the socket is created and before setsockopt is called. Those packets will remain in the socket’s buffer even after the BPF is applied and will later be transferred to the application via recv.</p>

<p>Here are two <strong>wrong</strong> ways to fix this:</p>

<ol>
<li>After applying the bpf use recv in a loop to discard packets from the socket until it is empty. This typically works but it breaks down if the traffic rate is greater than the rate at which you can discard packets. (e.g. if you’re sniffing on a very high traffic machine and your app typically loses packets when the socket’s buffer fills but it doesn’t matter for your use-case.) In this case your attempt to empty the socket will turn into an infinite loop.</li>
<li>Add user-mode checks that duplicate the BPF’s logic and check all packets after receiving them. Duplicate logic leads to bugs. Enough said.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>Now lets look at the textbook solution for fixing this bug - the same solution that <a href="https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap/blob/f4fcc9396dc425399846cf082f9ed1056b81dd11/pcap-linux.c#L6096">libpcap uses</a>:</p>

<pre><code>struct sock_filter zero_bytecode = BPF_STMT(BPF_RET | BPF_K, 0);
struct sock_fprog zero_program = { 1, &amp;zero_bytecode};

if (setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ATTACH_FILTER, &amp;zero_program, sizeof(zero_program)) &lt; 0) {
	printf("error attaching zero bpf: %d\n", errno);
	return 1;
}

char drain[1];
while (1) {
	int bytes = recv(sock, drain, sizeof(drain), MSG_DONTWAIT);
	if (bytes == -1) {
		// we assume the error here means there is nothing left to read from the socket which is exactly what we want
		break;
	}
}

// bpf_program is the actual bpf program we want to apply - just like in the previous example
int err = setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ATTACH_FILTER, &amp;bpf_program, sizeof(bpf_program));
char buffer[MAX_PACKET_SIZE];
int n = recv(sock, buffer, MAX_PACKET_SIZE, NO_OPTIONS); // buffer will now always match the bpf
</code></pre>

<p>What we’re doing here is taking advantage of the fact that swapping one BPF out for another is an atomic operation: if you swap one BPF for another then at every moment either the first is in place or the second but never neither. We therefore start by applying the so-called “zero-BPF” which is a BPF that matches no packets. Then we empty out any packets that arrived before the “zero-BPF” filter was applied. At this point the socket is definitely empty and it can’t fill up with junk because the zero-BPF is in place. Then we replace the zero-BPF with the real BPF we want. Because the swap is atomic we know that any packet in the socket after that must match the real BPF.</p>

<p>Simple.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>High performing teams thrive on accountability. Accountability is the foundation for a culture that gets stuff done: if you say you’ll do something, we all trust that it will happen. Accountability is empowering, creates great opportunities for learning, and allows the company to move faster. You can’t succeed in a competitive environment without it.</p>

<p>The more complex your organization, the more elusive accountability becomes. Startups foster learning because they’re high-accountability arenas: it’s immediately obvious when Bob isn’t towing the line. As a company scales, accountability easily gets lost if ownership isn’t well-defined and outcomes aren’t immediately observable. When things go well, people claim any victory that occurred in their area code as their own. When they go poorly, people skitter away to dusty corners of the org chart or just make excuses. This leads to a vicious cycle of eroding trust, heavyweight management processes, and disempowerment.</p>

<p>Eventually, when enough balls get dropped, leadership makes big, all-or-nothing decisions that either abandon accountability altogether or are overly harsh. The senior people in the vicinity of a big win get promoted. People find scapegoats. Nobody wins.</p>

<p>So how do you avoid this inevitable landmine? Get high-quality accountability from transparency.</p>

<h2 id="why-transparency-works">Why Transparency Works</h2>

<p>The first reason that transparency leads to accountability: <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/05/we-work-harder-when-we-know-someones-watching">people rise to the occasion when they know they have an audience</a>, and transparency gives your team a front row seat to the action. Put another way, people (generally) don’t want to publicly screw up. The light peer pressure of transparency immediately delivers results.</p>

<p>On healthy teams, people want to see their teammates succeed and will lend a hand if they see something falling off-track. But most people don’t want to go to their teammates with some form of “hey, it looks like you’re screwing up.” Transparency lowers the friction involved in asking or offering help.</p>

<p>Transparency also gives you observability well before the train flies off the tracks. Imagine the conversations below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Hey Bob, at the last 2 standups you said you were planning to get to Project X next. Still on-track for launch on the first of the month? Let me know if there are blockers I can help with, or if we should discuss whether it even still makes sense as a priority.”</li>
  <li>“Hey Bob, why did X not get done? We had planned for it to be done by the first of the month. What happened?”</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these conversations will get you to accountability, but the former conversation is infinitely easier. It’s early, and there is time to get help or adjust plans. There’s also still room for nuance – does it still make sense to spend our time here at all? By contrast, the latter conversation is an adversarial nightmare and almost guaranteed to elicit a defensive reaction. Transparency allows you to aim small, and therefore miss small.</p>

<p>Finally, if a project truly does fail, transparency helps you address it correctly and fairly.</p>

<p>There’s usually a pretty reasonable explanation when things go wrong. Were our goals unrealistic? Did other priorities get in the way? Did some exogenous factor throw a wrench into our plans? Or, are we in the (relatively uncommon) situation where someone was simply lazy or incompetent? As a manager, you owe it to your team to have a nuanced response to what is almost certainly a nuanced situation.</p>

<p>Transparency gives you a clear trail to understand and take action – which is the bedrock upon which true accountability rests. Trying to get accountability without transparency is like doing brain surgery with a sledgehammer rather than a scalpel.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-achieve-transparency">How to Achieve Transparency</h2>

<p>You can achieve transparency through a variety of methods, all centered around tracking true indicators of productivity or progress towards goals.</p>

<p>Tools for transparency should be neutral, objective, and predictable – think of metrics dashboards or a weekly team check-in, rather than a manager nosing in and asking for a status report on a whim. The best forms of transparency are impersonal as they’re rooted in facts and data, not opinions and explanations. They should be at least semi-public: shared between a manager and report, with a team, or with the entire company. And most importantly, transparency efforts must be lightweight: the benefit of more transparency is increased accountability and observability without a decrease in velocity.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite lightweight ways to get more transparency are below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make business metrics that you care about public to the company, and automatically publish them to an email list / public chat channel at a regular cadence. For example, create a public Slack channel in which you post metrics such as renewal rate, number of news signups, or number of support tickets per active user once a month.</li>
  <li>Use standups (of any form – live or virtual) to keep projects on track. The key is to follow up on hurdles that have blocked progress for some time as soon as things are off track – standup should be an active listening exercise.</li>
  <li>It’s easy for the “last 10%” of projects to take as much time to complete as the first 90%. As you’re approaching the end of a project, teams should track their current best guess for when a project will go live.</li>
  <li>On a quarterly basis, send everyone in the organization an anonymous poll rating their current job satisfaction on a few key dimensions, and have the CEO / other executives follow up with the heads of large functional groups that report to them.</li>
  <li>For any complex and sensitive business-critical process (e.g. deploying risky code or launching new products to customers), set up a checkin meeting to talk about all upcoming launches. The existence of the public checkin is a strong forcing function for people to run a tight ship.</li>
  <li>If you use an Agile system with sprints, track metrics such as points completed per sprint, average time that stories have been in-progress, or percentage of sprints in which all work is completed.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-learn-cli-commands-and-flags-of-your-package-manager-and-build-tool">4. Learn CLI commands and flags of your package manager and build tool.</h3>
<p>Most of them have flags you can use on CI.</p>

<p>For example, here are the commands for making sure packages and lock file match:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>npm ci</code> instead of <code>npm install</code></li>
  <li><code>yarn install --immutable</code> instead of <code>yarn install </code></li>
  <li><code>pod install --deployment</code> instead of <code>pod install</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Usually you can also set build cache location and installation folder so you can cache those on CI.</p>

<h3 id="5-use-bundler-for-managing-installation-of-cocoapods-and-fastlane">5. Use <code>bundler</code> for managing installation of <code>cocoapods</code> and <code>fastlane</code>.</h3>
<p><a href="https://bundler.io/">https://bundler.io/</a> is a ruby package manager (similar to <code>npm</code> for javascript)
which supports local installation and lock-files.
It’s easy to use even locally.</p>

<p>Gradle doesn’t lock dependencies by default. How many times your build or runtime have failed due to automatic updates of some firebase package?

            <!-- Share buttons by mashshare.net - Version: 3.7.6--><h2><strong>Rats in Alberta, Where Are They?</strong></h2>
<p>As we all know, rats are illegal in Alberta. You can’t have them as pets, raise them as pet food, or even employ them in the Government. If you’re caught with a rat, you can face a fine of up to $5000 or jail time or both (exceptions for zoos, universities, and research institutes). It’s serious business and it has been this way since 1950. This program has been so successful, the times that people DO see rats in Alberta, they’re coming in on trucks or trains from neighboring provinces or something like that. I’ve lived in Alberta for over 30 years and have never seen one myself.</p>
<p>Everyone says Alberta is rat free, but is it really? Word of mouth says yes. Everything that shows up on Google says yes. This extremely long and detailed <a href="https://www.alberta.ca/history-of-rat-control-in-alberta.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">history of rats in Alberta</a> says yes. On WikiPedia, it depends on who you ask.</p>
<h3><strong>Wikipedia: Brown Rats</strong></h3>
<p>As you would expect, there’s an entry on WikiPedia for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_rat" rel="">brown rat</a> (also known as Norwegian rats). It includes all of the typical information about the rodents, their history, diet, family, species and so on, and nothing is too out of the ordinary, except when you come to one specific part of the page….</p>
<p><img src="https://crackmacs.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Brown-rats-distribution-map-wikipedia.jpg" alt="rats in Alberta" width="578" height="736" data-old-src="//crackmacs.ca/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://crackmacs.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Brown-rats-distribution-map-wikipedia.jpg"></p>
<p>The distribution map at the bottom of that sidebar, which shows in red where brown rats are spread throughout the world, this is what we’re looking at here. On the outside, it looks like a world map right? Well behind the scenes, an epic battle has been taking place for over 10 years that nobody even knows about.</p>
<h3>The Rat Map Battles Begin!</h3>

Basically all of the world, except the north. The north is too cold. And there it stayed for over a year.</p>

<p><a title="User:Oknazevad" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Oknazevad"><bdi>Oknazevad</bdi></a> reverts it back to the full map (with Alberta included) saying they did so because “the claim is promotional nonsense.” (that Alberta is rat free).</p>
<p>Shortly after that someone else reverted the map back to remove Alberta. Oknazevad following it up with “The claim is dubious, and the idea that the animals follow the provincial borders exactly is absurd.”.</p>
<p>This is not the last we’ve heard of this genius.</p>

Anyone who has lived in Albert thier whole life will most likely never see a rat. Considering that Alberta’s rat population is much, much lower than the rest of the worlds, to the point that infestations are zero in 2017, it can be said that the province is rat free.”.</p>

<h3><strong>Rat Map Battle Summary!</strong></h3>
<p>I think Alberta should be excluded from the map. We are rat free! Rats in Alberta are not a thing.</p>
<p>This is where the map stands now, it includes Alberta on the map, within the home range of the Brown Rat, or Norwegian Rat, whatever you prefer to call it. In addition, the WikiPedia entry for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_rat#Alberta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brown Rats</a> does say:</p>
<blockquote><p><a title="Alberta" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta">Alberta</a>, Canada, is the largest rat-free populated area in the world. Rat invasions of Alberta were stopped and rats were eliminated by very aggressive government rat control measures, starting during the 1950s. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_rat#Alberta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><em>link</em></span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Says rat free to me? The map should reflect that.</p>
<h3><strong>Why Did Alberta Ban Rats Anyway?</strong></h3>
<p>Rats are extremely destructive, contaminating and destroying pretty much everything they come in contact with. Rats were responsible for spreading of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">black plague</a>.&nbsp; They’re easy to breed and really intelligent as well, making them hard to get rid of once you have an infestation. Rats are not only bad news for food, they can be quite devastating to building foundations with their tunnel digging, and chewing holes in things, damaging sewers and all sorts of other infrastructure.</p>
<h2><strong>Rats In Alberta Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>I’ve never seen one, dead or alive. I have spent a lot of time in the city of Calgary, camping in fields, camping in the mountains, in small towns, in and around farms and have not seen a rat or any evidence of rats in Alberta. Rats in Alberta are not a thing! I don’t know why these WikiPedia editors are being so literal.</p>

<p>Hey!</p>



<p>In this post, you will learn how to use Python to automate the routine work of searching for hotels on booking.com. We will help you get the best deal for your next vacation. I’ve recently created this script to help pick the best option for my summer trip, so I decided to share it with the community.</p>



<p>This article is useful for you in case:</p>



<ol><li>You’re learning Python and want to apply your skills to some real-world problems.</li><li>You already know Python and want a boilerplate code to monitor booking.com, so you don’t have to write it yourself.</li></ol>



<p>This article is written for purely educational purposes. Please make sure to comply with <a href="https://www.booking.com/content/terms.html">booking.com terms of use</a>.</p>



<p>The script we’re going to write works best if it runs on schedule automatically without you triggering it manually. There are multiple options to achieve it (you can set up a server and create a cron job, for example). I recommend using <a href="https://www.seamlesscloud.io/">seamlesscloud.io</a>, a tool I’m developing right now, and it’s built specifically for this purpose.</p>



<p>We’re going to write a script that finds three cheapest hotels with 9+ rating and show us the price for two rooms, four people total (cause I was traveling with friends). Okay, for those of you who just want the code, here it is:</p>

            url += '&amp;nflt=review_score%3D90%3B'
        elif score_filter == '8+':
            url += '&amp;nflt=review_score%3D80%3B'
        elif score_filter == '7+':
            url += '&amp;nflt=review_score%3D70%3B'
        elif score_filter == '6+':
            url += '&amp;nflt=review_score%3D60%3B'
    return url</code></pre>



<p>This is the URL that you would see in your browser if you just manually search for hotels. We just programmatically insert filters and generate the URL from code, that’s it.</p>



<p>Next, we simply make a GET request to the URL and receive the result.</p>



<pre><code>response = session.get(data_url, headers=REQUEST_HEADER)</code></pre>



<p>Then we use the BeautifulSoup library to parse the response.</p>



<pre><code>soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "lxml")</code></pre>



<p><a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">BeautifulSoup</a> is the most popular Python library used to make sense of web pages (in our case, booking.com web page). The library helps convert the text representation of the page into an object with attributes and search methods that you can use in your code.</p>



<p>This is how you can get the list of hotels from the page:</p>



<pre><code>hotels = soup.select("#hotellist_inner div.sr_item.sr_item_new")</code></pre>



<p>What does this mean? What is this weird string we select? If you open the URL we generate in the browser and use developer tools (I use Chrome), you can see this:</p>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/crop-53-501-674-275-0-image.png" alt="Booking.com website source code" width="590" height="240" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/crop-53-501-674-275-0-image.png 674w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/crop-53-501-674-275-0-image-300x122.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px"></figure>



<p><code>hotellist_inner</code> is an id of HTML element. It is highlighted in my browser, and I can see that it corresponds to the list of hotels in the search result. </p>



<p><code>div.sr_item.sr_item_new</code> means <code>div</code> element with classes <code>sr_item</code> and <code>sr_item_new</code>.</p>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/crop-443-665-673-357-0-image-1.png" alt="Booking.com website source code" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/crop-443-665-673-357-0-image-1.png 673w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/crop-443-665-673-357-0-image-1-300x159.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px"></figure>



<p>And this is the example of such an element. We’re effectively selecting all div elements that have classes <code>sr_item</code> and <code>sr_item_new</code> and are located inside the element with id = <code>hotellist_inner</code>.</p>



<p>Our next step is to iterate over hotels and parse each one of them individually.</p>



<pre><code>for hotel in hotels:
    result.append(Hotel(hotel))</code></pre>



<p>If you look into the <code>__init__</code> method of the <code>Hotel</code> class you’ll see that we use a bunch of functions to get various information from the hotel’s element on the web page. I won’t go into details here, but they work in a similar way to the logic that selects a hotel element, which I described above.</p>

<p>After we found hotels, we need some way to be notified. In this section, I will …</p></div></div>

I thought there must be a catch, something complicated that I was missing. But no, it just worked.</p><p id="b626">An additional bonus is that you get the chrome dev tools to help debug any issues or adjust the layout. Also, I love the use of JS promises to implement the async calls between Go and JS, given I have been writing about promises <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://maori.geek.nz/jquery-promises-and-deferreds-i-promise-this-will-be-short-d10275f82717">since 2014</a>.</p><p id="f0ee">The big downside to Lorca is that because it uses Chrome, some application details (like the system menu, icon, title) cannot be customized. The tradeoff is then between application polish and a simple application. Depending on what you are trying to build this might be a deal-breaker, e.g. it would be fine if you are building an internal tool, but for an enterprise application this might not look great.</p><h2 id="872d">Webview</h2><p id="2a63"><a href="https://github.com/webview/webview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Webview</a> is a library that helps building a web app directly on top of a native components. The code to do this looks like:</p><pre><span id="ab1e">func main() {<br> w := webview.New(true)<br> defer w.Destroy()</span><span id="cc4a"> w.SetSize(600, 200, webview.HintNone)</span><span id="c720"> // Create a GoLang function callable from JS<br> w.Bind("hello", func() string { return "World!" })<p>  // Create UI with data URI <br> w.Navigate(`data:text/html,<br>  &lt;!doctype html&gt;<br>  &lt;html&gt;<br>   &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hello&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;<br>   &lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/body&gt;<br>   &lt;script&gt; hello().then((x) =&gt; { console.log(x) }) &lt;/script&gt;<br>  &lt;/html&gt;`)</p><p>   w.Run()<br>}</p></span></pre><p id="9d61">This is very similar API to Lorca, which I assumed was based on webview. Though unlike Lorca, the output is a bit different:</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1598/1*X542oA37DqJa9ZW2Bw8KIQ.png" width="799" height="488" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*X542oA37DqJa9ZW2Bw8KIQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*X542oA37DqJa9ZW2Bw8KIQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*X542oA37DqJa9ZW2Bw8KIQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*X542oA37DqJa9ZW2Bw8KIQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*X542oA37DqJa9ZW2Bw8KIQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="0129">You can see the in the above screen shot the webview application window has no drop shadow, has no border, and it is initialized in the bottom left corner of the screen. This can be customized through the <code>Window</code> method that returns an <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> to the OS dependent window object (<code><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NSWindow</a></code> in macOS). <strong>This is where the difficulty begins.</strong></p><p id="e6e1">To work with the <code>Window</code> object we must write binding from Go to the native component. For example, if we wanted our window to start centered, we would call <code>center</code> on the <code>NSWindow</code>. So we need to write a binding in three files (adapted from <a href="https://github.com/alediaferia/gogoa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gogoa</a>):</p><p id="394b"><code><strong>ns_window.go</strong></code></p><pre><span id="d817">package main<br>// #cgo CFLAGS: -x objective-c<br>// #cgo LDFLAGS: -framework Cocoa<br>//#include "ns_window.h"<br>import "C"<br>import "unsafe"<br>type NSWindow struct {<br> ptr unsafe.Pointer<br>}<br>func (self *NSWindow) Center() {<br> C.Center(self.ptr)<br>}</span></pre><p id="d8b2"><code><strong>ns_window.h</strong></code></p><pre><span id="39df">#include &lt;Cocoa/Cocoa.h&gt;<br>void Center(void *);</span></pre><p id="7e6b"><code><strong>ns_window.m</strong></code></p><pre><span id="a7b8">#include "ns_window.h"<br>void Center(void *self) {<br>  NSWindow *window = self;<br>  [window center];<br>}</span></pre><p id="0968">Then in the <code>main()</code> function we can center the window with:</p><pre><span id="84b9">window := NSWindow{w.Window()}<br>window.Center()</span></pre><p id="5ba1">Unlike Lorca, webview can be fully customized for our application. The problem is that it requires a bit of work.</p><p id="ebec">There are a few other parts of webview that make working with it a bit difficult:</p><ol><li id="2bac">If using Bazel and gazelle, <code>webview</code>'s generated <code>Build.bazel</code> file is incorrect and <code>clinkopts = [“-framework WebKit”]</code> must be patched.</li><li id="0eb2">Calling <code>w.Init</code> only works when <code>w.Navigate</code> is called, but then the <code>w.Eval</code> calls stop working.</li><li id="bb2a">To set the title you could write a binding as described above, or you have to use the <code>Dispatch</code> method e.g. <code>w.Dispatch(func() { w.SetTitle("Title") })</code>. This is incorrect in the provided examples.</li></ol><p id="7998">I am not sure how much of this is <code>webview</code> and how much is <code>NSWindow</code>. More investigation and learning on my part should make it clearer why these things are happening.</p><h2 id="26f6">Electron</h2><p id="994d">My <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://maori.geek.nz/building-an-electron-app-with-bazel-d124ed550957">previous post</a> was about building a simple Electron app that looks like:</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1422/1*vS_SKcJKTrHzCySM_hpMVA.png" width="711" height="291" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*vS_SKcJKTrHzCySM_hpMVA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*vS_SKcJKTrHzCySM_hpMVA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*vS_SKcJKTrHzCySM_hpMVA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*vS_SKcJKTrHzCySM_hpMVA.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*vS_SKcJKTrHzCySM_hpMVA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="e89d">Electron is used in many large products like VSCode. This is probably because bundling everything into a single application makes portability much simpler and applications can be extensively customized. The downside of bundling the app with a browser and Node.js is that it makes the distribution <strong>very large.</strong></p><p id="d4c0">Getting Golang to play with Electron is also a bit difficult. There are frameworks that make this easier, like <a href="https://github.com/asticode/go-astilectron" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go-astilectron</a>, but these are complicated and mostly feature incomplete. Another way might be to use Golang compiled to WASM, which I <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://maori.geek.nz/a-web-app-using-bazel-golang-wasm-and-proto-c020914f4341">wrote about before</a>, but this is also not a simple solution.</p><p id="dba6">The benefits of Electron are that it is portable, customizable, and battle tested for application distribution. It is just a bit complicated with Golang.</p><h2 id="83a0">Comparison</h2><p id="b25a">I think the main comparison to be made is customizability vs. simplicity. Lorca is by far the simplest with very limited customizability, webview can be fully customized with some difficulty, and Electron is fully customizable but difficult to use with Golang.</p><p id="ab93">Also the size of the bundle is very different between the frameworks; Lorca has a <strong>8.7 MB </strong>binary, webview <strong>3.7Mb</strong>, and Electron a <strong>157Mb</strong> bundle size. <br>The debugging tools also vary: Lorca and Electron use the Chrome dev tools, where webview uses the Safari dev tools.</p><h2 id="b79a">Conclusion:</h2><p id="987c">Both Lorca and webview work well with Golang, have small distribution sizes, and similar APIs. The main difference is between the underlying renderer being native and debug tooling.</p><p id="2e1d">Electron I think is probably too complicated to use with Golang without a lot of difficulty.</p><p id="8e32">A potential workflow is to use Lorca during development and webview for distribution. Lorca provides familiar tooling for debugging and development, where webview provides the customizability for distribution. Lorca would also be a nice backup as a means of cross-compilation to other operating systems that webview does not support.</p><p id="4108"><em>Note: there are still more options like </em><code><a href="https://github.com/wailsapp/wails" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>wails</em></a></code><em> or </em><code><a href="https://github.com/gotk3/gotk3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>gotk</em></a></code><em> that can provide other means to build/distribute apps.</em></p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

  <p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) automates network architecture engineering. It aims to learn a network topology that can achieve best performance on a certain task. By dissecting the methods for NAS into three components: search space, search algorithm and child model evolution strategy, this post reviews many interesting ideas for better, faster and more cost-efficient automatic neural architecture search.</p>

<p>Although most popular and successful model architectures are designed by human experts, it doesn’t mean we have explored the entire network architecture space and settled down with the best option. We would have a better chance to find the optimal solution if we adopt a systematic and automatic way of learning high-performance model architectures.</p>

<p>Automatically learning and evolving network topologies is not a new idea (<a href="http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf">Stanley &amp; Miikkulainen, 2002</a>). In recent years, the pioneering work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02167">Baker et al. 2017</a> has attracted a lot of attention into the field of Neural Architecture Search (NAS), leading to many interesting ideas for better, faster and more cost-efficient NAS methods.</p>

<p>As I started looking into NAS, I found this nice survey very helpful by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05377">Elsken, et al 2019</a>. They characterize NAS as a system with three major components, which is clean &amp; concise, and also commonly adopted in other NAS papers.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Search space</strong>: The NAS search space defines a set of operations (e.g. convolution, fully-connected, pooling) and how operations can be connected to form valid network architectures. The design of search space usually involves human expertise, as well as unavoidably human biases.</li>
  <li><strong>Search algorithm</strong>: A NAS search algorithm samples a population of network architecture candidates. It receives the child model performance metrics as rewards (e.g. high accuracy, low latency) and optimizes to generate high-performance architecture candidates.</li>
  <li><strong>Evaluation strategy</strong>: We need to measure, estimate, or predict the performance of a large number of proposed child models in order to obtain feedback for the search algorithm to learn. The process of candidate evaluation could be very expensive and many new methods have been proposed to save time or computation resources.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/NAS-high-level.png" alt="High-level categorization of NAS"></p>
<p><em>Figure 1. Three main components of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) models.  (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05377">Elsken, et al. 2019</a> with customized annotation in red)</em></p>



<h2 id="search-space">Search Space</h2>

<p>The NAS search space defines a set of basic network operations and how operations can be connected to construct valid network architectures.</p>

<h3 id="sequential-layer-wise-operations">Sequential Layer-wise Operations</h3>

<p>The most naive way to design the search space for neural network architectures is to depict network topologies, either CNN or RNN, with a list of <em>sequential layer-wise operations</em>, as seen in the early work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a> &amp; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02167">Baker et al. 2017</a>. The serialization of network representation requires a decent amount of expert knowledge, since each operation is associated with different layer-specific parameters and such associations need to be hardcoded. For example, after predicting a <code>conv</code> op, the model should output kernel size, stride size, etc; or after predicting an <code>FC</code> op, we need to see the number of units as the next prediction.</p>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/NAS-search-space.png" alt="The sequential layer-wise operation search space"></p>
<p><em>Figure 2. (Top) A sequential representation of CNN. (Bottom) A sequential representation of the tree structure of a recurrent cell. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a>)</em></p>

<p>To make sure the generated architecture is valid, additional rules might be needed (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a>):</p>
<ul>
  <li>If a layer is not connected to any input layer then it is used as the input layer;</li>
  <li>At the final layer, take all layer outputs that have not been connected and concatenate them;</li>
  <li>If one layer has many input layers, then all input layers are concatenated in the depth dimension;</li>
  <li>If input layers to be concatenated have different sizes, we pad the small layers with zeros so that the concatenated layers have the same sizes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The skip connection can be predicted as well, using an <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log%20/2018/06/24/attention-attention.html">attention</a>-style mechanism. At layer \(i\) , an anchor point is added with \(i−1\) content-based sigmoids to indicate which of the previous layers to be connected. Each sigmoid takes as input the hidden states of the current node \(h_i\) and \(i-1\) previous nodes \(h_j, j=1, \dots, i-1\) .</p><p>

\[P(\text{Layer j is an input to layer i}) = \text{sigmoid}(v^\top \tanh(\mathbf{W}_\text{prev} h_j + \mathbf{W}_\text{curr} h_i))\]

</p><p>The sequential search space has a lot of representation power, but it is very large and consumes a ton of computation resources to exhaustively cover the search space. In the experiments by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a>, they were running 800 GPUs in parallel for 28 days and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02167">Baker et al. 2017</a> restricted the search space to contain at most 2 <code>FC</code> layers.</p>

<h3 id="cell-based-representation">Cell-based Representation</h3>

<p>Inspired by the design of using repeated modules in successful vision model architectures (e.g. Inception, ResNet), the <em>NASNet search space</em> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07012">Zoph et al. 2018</a>) defines the architecture of a conv net as the same cell getting repeated multiple times and each cell contains several operations predicted by the NAS algorithm. A well-designed cell module enables transferability between datasets. It is also easy to scale down or up the model size by adjusting the number of cell repeats.</p>

<p>Precisely, the NASNet search space learns two types of cells for network construction:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Normal Cell</em>: The input and output feature maps have the same dimension.</li>
  <li><em>Reduction Cell</em>: The output feature map has its width and height reduced by half.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/NASNet-search-space.png" alt="NASNet search space"></p>
<p><em>Figure 3. The NASNet search space constrains the architecture as a repeated stack of cells. The cell architecture is optimized via NAS algorithms. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07012">Zoph et al. 2018</a>)</em></p>

<p>The predictions for each cell are grouped into \(B\) blocks (\(B=5\) in the NASNet paper), where each block has 5 prediction steps made by 5 distinct softmax classifiers corresponding to discrete choices of the elements of a block. Note that the NASNet search space does not have residual connections between cells and the model only learns skip connections on their own within blocks.</p>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/cell-prediction-steps.png" alt="5 prediction steps in one block"></p>
<p><em>Figure 4. (a) Each cell consists of \(B\) blocks and each block is predicted by 5 discrete decisions. (b) An concrete example of what operations can be chosen in each decision step.</em></p>

<p><a name="ScheduledDropPath"></a>During the experiments, they discovered that a modified version of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07648"><em>DropPath</em></a>, named <em>ScheduledDropPath</em>, significantly improves the final performance of NASNet experiments. DropPath stochastically drops out paths (i.e. edges with operations attached in NASNet) with a fixed probability. ScheduledDropPath is DropPath with a linearly increasing probability of path dropping during training time.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05377">Elsken, et al (2019)</a> point out three major advantages of the NASNet search space:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The search space size is reduced drastically;</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_motif">motif</a>-based architecture can be more easily transferred to different datasets.</li>
  <li>It demonstrates a strong proof of a useful design pattern of repeatedly stacking modules in architecture engineering. For example, we can build strong models by stacking residual blocks in CNN or stacking multi-headed attention blocks in Transformer.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="hierarchical-structure">Hierarchical Structure</h3>

<p>To take advantage of already discovered well-designed network <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_motif">motifs</a>, the NAS search space can be constrained as a hierarchical structure, as in <em>Hierarchical NAS</em> (<strong>HNAS</strong>; (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00436">Liu et al 2017</a>)). It starts with a small set of primitives, including individual operations like convolution operation, pooling, identity, etc. Then small sub-graphs (or “motifs”) that consist of primitive operations are recursively used to form higher-level computation graphs.</p>

<p>A computation motif at level \(\ell=1, \dots, L\) can be represented by \((G^{(\ell)}, \mathcal{O}^{(\ell)})\), where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(\mathcal{O}^{(\ell)}\) is a set of operations, \(\mathcal{O}^{(\ell)} = \{ o^{(\ell)}_1, o^{(\ell)}_2, \dots \}\)</li>
  <li>\(G^{(\ell)}\) is an adjacency matrix, where the entry \(G_{ij}=k\) indicates that operation \(o^{(\ell)}_k\) is placed between node \(i\) and \(j\). The node indices follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">topological ordering</a> in DAG, where the index \(1\) is the source and the maximal index is the sink node.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/hierarchical-NAS-search-space.png" alt="Hierarchical search space"></p>
<p><em>Figure 5. (Top) Three level-1 primitive operations are composed into a level-2 motif. (Bottom) Three level-2 motifs are plugged into a base network structure and assembled into a level-3 motif. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00436">Liu et al 2017</a>)</em></p>

<p>To build a network according to the hierarchical structure, we start from the lowest level \(\ell=1\) and recursively define the \(m\)-th motif operation at level \(\ell\) as</p><p>

\[o^{(\ell)}_m = \text{assemble}\Big( G_m^{(\ell)}, \mathcal{O}^{(\ell-1)} \Big)\]

</p><p>A hierarchical representation becomes \(\Big( \big\{ \{ G_m^{(\ell)} \}_{m=1}^{M_\ell} \big\}_{\ell=2}^L, \mathcal{O}^{(1)} \Big), \forall \ell=2, \dots, L\), where \(\mathcal{O}^{(1)}\) contains a set of primitive operations.</p>

<p>The \(\text{assemble}()\) process is equivalent to sequentially compute the feature map of node \(i\) by aggregating all the feature maps of its predecessor node \(j\) following the topological ordering:</p><p>

\[x_i = \text{merge} \big[ \{ o^{(\ell)}_{G^{(\ell)}_{ij}}(x_j) \}_{j &lt; i} \big], i = 2, \dots, \vert G^{(\ell)} \vert\]

</p><p>where \(\text{merge}[]\) is implemented as depth-wise concatenation in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00436">paper</a>.</p>

<p>Same as NASNet, experiments in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00436">Liu et al (2017)</a> focused on discovering good cell architecture within a predefined “macro” structure with repeated modules. They showed that the power of simple search methods (e.g. random search or evolutionary algorithms) can be substantially enhanced using well-designed search spaces.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02639">Cai et al (2018b)</a> propose a tree-structure search space using path-level network transformation. Each node in a tree structure defines an <em>allocation</em> scheme for splitting inputs for child nodes and a <em>merge</em> scheme for combining results from child nodes. The path-level network transformation allows replacing a single layer with a multi-branch motif if its corresponding merge scheme is add or concat.</p>

<h2>Java Hashtable Class</h2>
<p>Java.util package provides a <b>Hashtable</b> class which implements hash table and maps keys to value. Any non-null object can be used as a key or as a value. To successfully store and retrieve objects from a hashtable, the objects used as keys must implement the hashCode method and the equals method. If many entries are to be made into a Hashtable, creating it with a sufficiently large capacity may allow the entries to be inserted more efficiently than letting it perform automatic rehashing as needed to grow the table.</p>


<h3>Class declaration</h3>
<p>The declaration of java.util.Hashtable class is:</p>
<div>
    
<pre>public class Hashtable&lt;K,V&gt;
  extends Dictionary&lt;K,V&gt;
    implements Map&lt;K,V&gt;, Cloneable, Serializable
</pre>
</div>
<p>Here, K and V are the type of key and value respectively maintained by the container.</p>


<p>The java.util.Hashtable has a number of methods which are listed below:</p>

    <p><em>In my daily work, I have the good fortune to work with many very talented
people. Some are professional software developers, like myself. Others are for
example researchers, scientist, project leaders, and so on. Is that you? Do you
also write software, but not as your main activity? Do you have some experience
but maybe no formal training? In <a href="https://unfolded.dev/pages/software-development-easy-to-learn-hard-to-master/">this series of blog
posts</a> I will explain
the best practices that I use, so that you may be able to benefit from them. So
that writing software hopefully takes you less effort and gives you more
pleasure.</em></p><h2 id="the-second-thing-for-new-code">The second thing for new code</h2><p>The very first thing I <em>always</em> do when starting something new, is <code>git init</code>.
Potential new hobby project? <code>git init</code>. Sample code for a blog post? <code>git init</code>. Doing programming exercises on something like Exercism.io? <code>git init</code>.
And then I start using git the way I described in the <a href="https://unfolded.dev/posts/2020-07-21-using-git-more-effectively">first
post</a> of this series. There are
virtually no exceptions to this; it hardly costs me anything and it has helped
me plenty of times.</p><p>The second thing that I do, I do just slightly less often, but still very often:
set up <em>continuous integration</em>. Obviously I won't do that for things that I
never push to a remote. And some things that I push to a remote don't need it
either, for example those Exercism coding exercises. But for anything that I
suspect may have a longer life than a few weeks, including <a href="https://github.com/svdo/either-validation-demo/actions">for that sample code
for a blog post</a>, I'll set it up.</p><h2 id="what-is-continuous-integration">What is continuous integration</h2><p>To get rid of potential confusion, let me explain what I mean with continuous
integration, or <em>CI</em> for short. In its most basic form, it's actually quite
simple: every single time you push something to your git remote (e.g. GitHub,
BitBucket, GitLab, etc), an automated process will start that builds your code
and runs all your tests. (You do have unit tests, right? Maybe a nice topic for
a future post in this series.) That's all, if you do that you can claim you're
doing continuous integration.</p><p>The other day, I was talking to one of my researcher colleagues about coding
practices. When I asked him whether he was using continuous integration, he
thankfully asked for clarification. For me the term has become so commonplace
that I hadn't realize that of course for him it wasn't. He is working on a
software library that his (internal) customers integrate into their product. So
quite logically he thought that was what I meant: continuously automatically
integrating his releases into the customer's product code. While doing that is
of course fantastic, that's going quite a few steps further than just basic CI.
In fact, I would say that that is the combination of <em>continuous delivery</em> (the
<em>CD</em> in <em>CI/CD</em>) on his part, plus <em>continuous integration</em> of his delivery on
his customer's end.</p><p>So if you have a <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/">Travis job</a>, a <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/getting-started/#section=getting-started">CircleCI
pipeline</a>, a <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/">GitLab
pipeline</a>, a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/getting-started-with-github-actions">GitHub Actions
workflow</a>, a <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/getting-started-with-bamboo-289277283.html">Bamboo build</a>, anything that automatically
build and tests your code when you push it to your remote, you're doing
continuous integration.</p><p>😌</p><h2 id="the-value-of-continuous-integration">The value of continuous integration</h2><p>Ok, so now that we're hopefully on the same page regarding the term <em>continuous
integration</em>, you may be curious why you should bother. Here's a few reasons
that I have.</p><h3 id="safety-net--quality-baseline">Safety net / quality baseline</h3><p>I'm human. I make mistakes. There, I've said it, now you know. I have learnt
that mistakes that escape the development process and end up at the customer,
are way more expensive than mistakes that are caught earlier. So that's why I
like pair programming, because your pair can catch your mistakes while your
making them. It doesn't get any cheaper than that. That's also why I like unit
tests, because they run many times an hour so they also catch mistakes very
quickly. And that's also why I like continuous integration, because it catches
even more mistakes before they escape the development process. For instance,
when I forget to run my unit tests before pushing my code to the remote: CI will
run and immediately notify me. And my reaction to that notification is: cool,
thanks for catching that!</p><p>🤭</p><h3 id="makes-it-easier-for-others-to-contribute">Makes it easier for others to contribute</h3><p>CI runs for any code that is pushed to the remote, not just by me/my team. So if
it's source code that others can also see and use, having CI will lower the
threshold for them to contribute. Even when you have a new team member it will
help. They don't know the source code as well as you do, so they are a lot more
likely to make mistakes. When I contribute code to somebody else's project, it
feels very comforting to see "all green" as part of the automated tests in the
pull request!</p><p>✅</p><h3 id="executable-documentation-of-build--test--deployment">Executable documentation of build &amp; test (&amp; deployment)</h3><p>Just like unit tests are a form of executable code documentation, CI is a form
of executable documentation of how your project can be built and tested. And, if
you're doing CI/CD, deployed. And I don't think I need to explain the benefits
of having executable documentation over plain only-human-readable documentation,
or do I?<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></p><h3 id="ensure-that-code-keeps-working-in-the-future">Ensure that code keeps working in the future</h3><p>The final reason I'll mention here, is the future. Because there are two
possible sources of problems: you as part of the development team pushing code,
but also the environment changes. Libraries that you depend on may turn out to
contain security issues<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>, or cease to exist altogether. Operating
systems are updated, as well as libraries in there that you may directly or
indirectly depend on. If you have a CI script that periodically runs, even when
you don't push anything, you will know that your code not only works as
specified when you push it, but also in the future!</p><p>🦾</p><h2 id="some-encouraging-words">Some encouraging words</h2><p>When I'm setting up CI, which I have done countless times, it's always a
challenge. Every single time I have to brace myself and mentally prepare for
doing quite a few tries before getting it right. It's just such a complex black
box! You write a script that will run on a not-quite-known configuration on a
unknown server somewhere, and if it fails you get limited feedback. For example,
if you want to automatically test an iOS app, you'll have to specify which
version of the iOS simulator should be used. But before trying the build, you
may not know which are available and what the simulator device identifiers
are that you can use. So you have to try, look at the output, and try again. And
then something else isn't quite right, and you try again. And again. And once
more. Just have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/svdo/either-validation-demo/search?q=%5Bci%5D&amp;type=Commits">eighteen (18!) commits</a> I did for
sample code for a blog post. And you can't even really clean up those commits
because you <em>have</em> to push them to the remote. I guess if it's important to you,
you can do them on a separate branch and squash-merge the branch when you are
done, but I often don't bother. But bottom line: if it doesn't work immediately
and takes a lot of attempts, it's not you. You're not losing your touch, it's
not because you're getting older. You're fine, it's just complicated.</p><p>🤗</p><p>And when you finally have that working CI build and it passes, go ahead and slap that badge on your readme!</p><p><img src="https://unfolded.dev/img/ci-passing.png" alt="CI passing" width="90"></p><p>Since this is a privacy-friendly static web site, I'm not including the ability
to post comments directly here. I do love feedback though, so I created a ticket
on GitHub that you can use to leave your comments. Tell me if it's bad, tell me
if it's good, but please don't forget to tell me <em>why</em>. So please head over
there and <a href="https://github.com/svdo/unfolded.dev/issues/3">leave your comments</a>!</p>

<p>What can I say? The Greatest Language Ever and the Greatest
Language Possible are both doomed propositions. The former ignores
the infinite variation of use cases, platforms, coding styles, and
the sociology of individuals and groups. The latter does all of
that and goes still further by arbitrarily choosing language
features for which the "best" is likely to be a highly debatable
matter. Like all good philosophical questions, these one's
don’t have concrete answers. We pose them not to arrive
somewhere, but to stimulate thought and further innovation.</p>
<p>But Lisp is still the Greatest Language Ever.</p>
<p>I only learned Lisp a couple of years ago. I’m not sure
how I got there, really. I think I might have stumbled on one of
Paul Graham’s essays (perhaps from a Slashdot interview Kent
Pitman gave some time ago). I was thoroughly intrigued by what
Graham had to say, and decided to give it a shot. That, of course,
led me into the Scheme vs. Common Lisp debate, as well as to the
question of which implementation to use.</p>
<p>I think it took me about an hour to decide against Scheme.
Nearly everything I read about it suggested that it was a highly
minimalistic version of Lisp intended for introductory computer
science courses and ponderous experiments in the study of languages
and algorithms. In other words, it wasn’t meant for serious
application development at all. In fact, the very first Q from the
Scheme FAQ sealed it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scheme is often used in computer science curricula and
programming language research, due to its ability to represent many
programming abstractions with its simple primitives. Common Lisp is
often used for real world programming because of its large library
of utility functions, a standard object-oriented programming
facility (CLOS), and a sophisticated condition handling system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So (I concluded), if you want to build real apps you want Common
Lisp. I ended up going with SBCL (which is a fantastic
implementation). I also read Peter Seibel’s book, which is
really sensational.</p>
<p>I started this recent series of blog posts, because I wanted to
talk about why I’m both dazzled and frustrated by certain
aspects of Common Lisp. None of my objections involved the language
itself (I’m not even sure I follow some of the critiques of
CL that show up on the newsgroups). My problems were the garden
variety ones. CL folks use Emacs/Slime. I use Vim (which has very
weak support for IDE-style development with Lisp). And anyway, I
hate IDEs. I want the compiler to compile (or the interpreter to
interpret), the debugger to debug, the editor to edit, and I want
to switch tools whenever I want. I also don’t want anything
abstracting me away from the details of the tools themselves.
That’s just me, but there it is.</p>
<p>I loved having a REPL, but I hated having just a REPL, and while
it’s possible to get SBCL to work with a shebang, it involves
a lot of hacking of configuration files. Package installation was
often complex and tedious, and the library I was looking for
usually wasn’t available (or if it was, it had absolutely no
documentation whatsoever). I fully understood the arguments about
why it’s hard to create standalone "binaries" for CL, but I
wondered why there wasn’t something like a Java jar file -
some easy way to launch an app with minimal fuss.</p>
<p>As I’ve said before, there is a way to do all of this if
you’re patient. But when you read the posts about these
matters, you witness a very peculiar rhetorical trend. Someone
posts asking about, say, how you go about creating an "executable"
with Clisp or SBCL. Someone might respond with a howto, but the
person asking is much more likely to get a sermon about how they
need to free their mind. They’re told about how the line
between development and use is blurred in Lisp, about how
"standalone programs" are actually a myth, since the operating
system ships with the C runtime and is therefore providing you with
mountains of scaffolding (no different from Lisp!). They’re
told that the REPL is a perfectly legitimate "shell" for ordinary
users. And anyway, the UNIX shell is a horrific hack from which we
should all attempt to extricate ourselves. In fact, it’s
really much better to have Lisp insulated from the fallen world of
shells, C libraries, conventional interfaces, etc. You just need to
embrace the Lambda Nature.</p>
<p>Yeah. Whatever.</p>
<p>I get it! I really do. I understand these arguments. In fact,
some of my objections are completely unfair (No documentation? No
libraries? Well surely <em>you</em> can do something about that!).
Other points are absolutely dead on (like the one about the C
runtime). It’s just that I’m trying to get my work done
and make my users happy. They will not be happy if they have to
fiddle with the common-lisp-controller, set up aliases for asdf,
recompile fasls, and then learn Lisp syntax so they can use my
program. And I’m going to be unhappy if I have to wade
through source code for lack of documentation, struggle with the
FFI, and spend an hour setting up my system so I can use a
particular package. It may be - in fact it is - the Best Language
Ever. But it’s not the Best Userspace Tool Ever. Not by a
long mile.</p>
<p>So I started looking around for other Lisp alternatives, and
this led me to a long, second look at Scheme.</p>
<p>I discovered that the opening salvo of the FAQ is absolutely
true. It is a very small language, and is therefore ideal for
teaching and language research. But what the FAQ was leaving out, I
think, is the startling implications of a language that is
trivially easy to implement (relatively speaking). If you’re
going to implement CL, you better lock and load. It’s going
to be a major job. Scheme? Well that’s a different story.</p>
<p>The fact that Scheme is easy to implement has led to dozens and
dozens of implementations. Some of them are "pure," in the sense
that they provide the core language and don’t concern
themselves with OS integration. That’s perfect if
you’re teaching Lisp. But what if you want to target the JVM
("for shame!" say the CL folks)? Or compile to C? Or run it on a
Palm? Or use it as a systems programming language? Or embed it in
another program? Or embed it in another <em>programming
language?</em> Or put in on a cell phone? Or use it as the
scripting language for your editor?</p>
<p>And we can go further. What about a Scheme that is designed to
work seamlessly with UNIX? Or a Scheme that makes it trivially easy
to call native libraries? Or a Scheme that can be used as a shell?
Or a scheme that acts like an ordinary "scripting language?"</p>
<p>What I discovered, is that there are Scheme implementations for
all of that. They’re all Scheme (and therefore all Lisp), but
none of them try to be all things to all users (or worse, impose
philosophical restrictions on how the language is used).</p>
<p>Imagine my delight when I stumbled across Chicken Scheme (one of
several that try to fill in a particular programming niche). This
is a Scheme implementation that compiles to C (using a very clever
method), which means that you can very easily create the elusive
"executable" with a single command, and it will behave like any
other native app. Its package system is brainlessly easy to use,
and it has lots of libraries to do good-old-fashioned every day
stuff (talk to databases, munge XML, export to CSV, etc.). In fact,
it really feels like Ruby or Perl or Python. But it’s fast!
And it’s Lisp!</p>
<p>That was enough to make me fall in love, but my real moment of
epiphany came when I discovered Easyffi.</p>
<p>All of the CL implementations allow you call native functions
through a foreign function interface. I read over some of the
specifications for doing that (CFFI and UFFI). "Yeah, it’s
doable," I thought, "But it’s going to require some serious
effort."</p>
<p>Here’s how you call native C libraries from Chicken using
Easyffi:</p>
<ol>
<li>You reference the C header in your source file.</li>
<li>You call the native function (in Scheme).</li>
</ol>
<p>Sorry, did I miss something? I mean, it’s a little more
complicated than that, but not much. I sat down to write an
interface to the native GraphViz library. I had it working in about
a half an hour.</p>
<p>The mind reels. I’m speechless. So, I can just create
interfaces to any C library I want (making them as Lispy as I care
to with macros and whatnot)? Just by calling them? And then I can
compile the programs that call those interfaces into fast C code
that will behave like an ordinary POSIX program?</p>
<p>And I can do all this in the Greatest Language Ever!?</p>
<p>I’m a convert. I’ve known for awhile that Lisp is
the red pill. Now it seems that, for me at least, Chicken Scheme
(and Scheme in general) might be the little blue one.</p>

<h2>The challenge</h2>
<p>Sheldon, Leonard, Penny, Rajesh and Howard are in the queue for a “Double Cola” drink vending machine; there are no other people in the queue. The first one in the queue (Sheldon) buys a can, drinks it and doubles! The resulting two Sheldons go to the end of the queue. Then the next in the queue (Leonard) buys a can, drinks it and gets to the end of the queue as two Leonards, and so on.</p>
<p>For example, Penny drinks the third can of cola and the queue will look like this:</p>
<pre title="">Rajesh, Howard, Sheldon, Sheldon, Leonard, Leonard, Penny, Penny
</pre>
<p>Write a program that will return the name of the person who will drink the&nbsp;<code>n</code>-th cola.</p>
<h3 id="input">Input:</h3>
<p>The input data consist of an array which contains at least 1 name, and single integer&nbsp;<code>n</code>&nbsp;which may go as high as the biggest number your language of choice supports (if there’s such limit, of course).</p>
<h3 id="output--examples">Output / Examples:</h3>
<p>Return the single line — the name of the person who drinks the n-th can of cola. The cans are numbered starting from 1.</p>
<pre title="">let names = &amp;[Name::Sheldon, Name::Leonard, Name::Penny, Name::Rajesh, Name::Howard];
assert_eq!(who_is_next(names, 1), Name::Sheldon);
assert_eq!(who_is_next(names, 6), Name::Sheldon);
assert_eq!(who_is_next(names, 52), Name::Penny);
assert_eq!(who_is_next(names, 7230702951), Name::Leonard);

<h2>Test cases</h2>
<pre title="">import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class ListTests {
    @Test
    public void test1() {
      String[] names = new String[] { "Sheldon", "Leonard", "Penny", "Rajesh", "Howard" };
      int n = 1;  
      assertEquals("Sheldon", new Line().WhoIsNext(names, n));
    }
   @Test
    public void test2() {
      String[] names = new String[] { "Sheldon", "Leonard", "Penny", "Rajesh", "Howard" };
      int n = 6;  
      assertEquals("Sheldon", new Line().WhoIsNext(names, n));
    }
}
</pre>
<h2>The solution using Java</h2>
<pre title="">public class Line {
  public static String WhoIsNext(String[] names, int n) {
    n = n - 1;
    int len = names.length;
    
    while(n &gt;= len) {
      int div = n-len;
      n = (int)Math.floor(div/2);
    }
    return names[n];

<p>Ohhh, never thought of this hypothesis: that the act of getting
drunk together might be a social technology that helps us verify
the trustworthiness of others by inhibiting their higher cognitive
functions and thus making it harder to consciously fake things.
That would make sense.</p>
<p>&gt; To enhance our natural thin-slicing abilities, humans have
therefore also developed various cultural practices that make these
instant assessments more reliable. These techniques take advantage
of the fact that deception is fundamentally a cold-cognition act
and relies on cognitive control centers. This means that if we can
impair the cognitive control abilities of people we're trying to
judge, we’ll do a better job of sussing them out: they will
be less able to confuse our cheater-detection systems.</p>
<p>&gt; In one study that has proven enormously useful to law
enforcement agencies, researchers found that police officers could
significantly improve their ability to detect false statements if
suspects were asked to give their alibis in reverse order, starting
with the most recent event and working their way back. This is not
the way we normally tell stories, so being forced to do it
increases cognitive load. Dishonest suspects, it turns out, are
less effective liars if you handicap their conscious minds in this
way.</p>
<p>&gt; This reverse-order alibi technique is a great tool for law
enforcement but not terribly practical when evaluating a potential
business partner or deciding if the people you’re about to
make a peace treaty with are being sincere. There are other ways to
achieve the same effect, though. The police study aimed to reduce
subjects’ cognitive control ability by increasing the
load-adding more weight, as it were. Alternately, you can keep the
load constant but decrease cognitive control ability-weaken the
mental muscles-by suppressing cognitive control centers. One way to
do this is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which involves
applying a powerful magnetic force to the appropriate region of the
skull. TMS, however, is a very recent technology and not exactly
widely available. Also, in most cultures it’s considered bad
form to shock the heads of new acquaintances with huge magnets.</p>
<p>&gt; A much more low-tech and socially acceptable way to produce
the same effect is to get someone completely wasted. As we
discussed in chapter 6, one of the primary effects of alcohol and
other intoxicants is to "downregulate," or temporarily paralyze,
areas of the prefrontal cortex associated with cognitive control. A
couple shots of tequila is the liquid equivalent of a nice jolt of
TMS. It’s therefore no accident that intoxicants of various
sorts are frequently employed by human beings as social lubricants.
Alcohol, kava, cannabis, magic mushrooms, you name it: any
intoxicant that people can get their hands on quickly comes to play
a central role in social occasions, both formal and informal. In
ancient China, no major treaty was signed without first bringing
everyone together in an extended, alcohol-soaked banquet. In fact,
this is one feature of Chinese culture that has not changed a bit
in over four thousand years. Any modern businessperson hoping to
ink a deal with Chinese partners had better get his or her liver in
shape first.</p>
<p>&gt; On a less formal level, this is no doubt why intoxicants
are a universal feature of all sorts of human social gatherings,
from casual cocktail parties to fraternity mixers. Not only is
getting drunk pleasant, it also typically causes people to get
along more freely and easily (at least to a certain point, after
which the drunken fights break out). Intoxication enhances
cooperation in at least two ways. First of all, it reduces social
faking by inhibiting cognitive control centers. Second, if we all
get drunk together, we create a situation of mutual vulnerability
that makes trust easier to establish. Getting drunk is essentially
an act of mental disarmament. In the same way that shaking right
hands with someone assures them that you’re not holding a
weapon, downing a few tequila shots is like checking your
prefrontal cortex at the door. See? No cognitive control. You can
trust me.</p>

</ul><p>Imagine a custom <em>set-like</em> data structure that doesn’t perform hashing and trades performance for tighter memory footprint. Or imagine a <em>dict-like</em> data structure that automatically stores data in a PostgreSQL or Redis database the moment you initialize it; also it lets you to <em>get-set-delete</em> key-value pairs using the usual <em>retrieval-assignment-deletion</em> syntax associated with built-in dictionaries. Custom data structures can give you the power of choice and writing them will make you understand how the built-in data structures in Python are constructed.</p>

<p>One way to understand how built-in objects like dictionary, list, set etc work is to build custom data structures based on them. Python provides several mixin classes in the <code>collection.abc</code> module to design custom data structures that look and act like built-in structures with additional functionalities baked in.</p>

<h2 id="concept-edifice">
Concept Edifice</h2>

<p>To understand how all these work, you’ll need a fair bit of knowledge about Interfaces, Abstract Base Classes, Mixin Classes etc. I’ll build the concept edifice layer by layer where you’ll learn about interfaces first and how they can be created and used via the <code>abc.ABC</code> class. Then you’ll learn how abstract base classes differ from interfaces. After that I’ll introduce mixins and explain how all these concepts can be knitted together to architect custom data structures with amazing capabilities. Let’s dive in.</p>

<h2 id="interfaces">
Interfaces</h2>

<p>Python interfaces can help you write classes based on common structures. They ensure that classes that provide similar functionalities will also have similar footprints. Interfaces are not as popular in Python as they are in other statically typed language. The dynamic nature and duck-typing capabilities of Python often make them redundant.</p>

<p>However, in larger applications, interfaces can make you avoid writing code that is poorly encapsulated or build classes that look awfully similar but provide completely unrelated functionalities. Moreover, interfaces implicitly spawn other powerful techniques like mixin classes which can help you achieve DRY nirvana.</p>

<h3 id="overview">
Overview</h3>

<p>At a high level, an interface acts as a blueprint for designing classes. In Python, an interface is basically a specialized abstract class that defines one or more abstract methods. Abstract classes differs from concrete classes in the sense that they aren’t intended to stand on their own and the methods they define shouldn’t have any implementation.</p>

<p>Usually, you inherit from an interface and implement the methods defined in the abstract class in a concrete subclass. Interfaces provide the skeletons and concrete classes provide the implementation of the methods based on those skeletons. Depending on the ways you can architect interfaces, they can be segmented into two primary categories.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Informal Interfaces</li>
  <li>Formal Interfaces</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="informal-interfaces">
Informal Interfaces</h2>

<p>Informal interfaces are classes which define methods that can be overridden, but there’s no strict enforcement.</p>

<p>Let’s write an informal interface for a simple calculator class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>ICalc</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"""Informal Interface: Abstract calculator class."""</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>mul</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>div</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that the <code>ICalc</code> class has four different methods that don’t give you any implementation. It’s an informal interface because you can still instantiate the class but the methods will raise <code>NotImplementedError</code> if you try to apply them. You’ve to subclass the interface to use it. Let’s do it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Calc</span><span>(</span><span>ICalc</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Concrete Class: Calculator"""</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>-</span> <span>b</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>mul</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>*</span> <span>b</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>div</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>/</span> <span>b</span>


<span># Using the class
</span><span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>Calc</span><span>()</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>))</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>.</span><span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>))</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>.</span><span>mul</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>))</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>.</span><span>div</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, you might be wondering why you even need all of these boilerplate code and inheritance when you can directly define the concrete <code>Calc</code> class and call it a day.</p>

<p>Consider the following scenario where you want to add additional functionalities to each of the method of the <code>Calc</code> class. Here, you’ve two options. Either you can mutate the original class and add those extra functionalities to the methods or you can create another class with similar footprint and implement all the methods with the added functionalities.</p>

<p>The first option isn’t always viable and can cause regression in real life scenario. The second approach ensures modularity and is generally quicker to implement since you won’t have to worry about messing up the original concrete class. However, figuring out which methods you’ll need to implement in the extended class can be hard because the concrete class might have additional methods that you don’t want in the extended class.</p>

<p>In this case, instead of figuring out the methods from the concrete <code>Calc</code> class, it’s easier to do so from an established structure defined in the <code>ICalc</code> interface. Interfaces make the process of extending class functionalities more tractable. Let’s make another class that will add logging to all of the methods of the <code>Calc</code> class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>logging</span>

<span>logging</span><span>.</span><span>basicConfig</span><span>(</span><span>level</span><span>=</span><span>logging</span><span>.</span><span>INFO</span><span>)</span>

        <span>logging</span><span>.</span><span>info</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"Operation: Multiplication, Arguments: {(a, b)}"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>*</span> <span>b</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>div</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>logging</span><span>.</span><span>info</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"Operation: Division, Arguments: {(a, b)}"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>/</span> <span>b</span>


<span># Using the class

<p>In the above class, I’ve defined another class called <code>CalcLog</code> that basically extends the functionalities of the previously defined <code>Calc</code> class. Here, I’ve inherited from the informal interface <code>ICalc</code> and implemented all the methods with additional info logging capability.</p>

<p>Although writing informal interfaces is trivial, there are multiple issues that plagues them. The user of the interface class can still instantiate it like a normal class and won’t be able to tell the difference between a it and a concrete class until she tries to use any of the methods define inside the interface. Only then the methods will throw exceptions. This can have unintended side effects.</p>

<p>Moreover, informal interfaces won’t compel you to implement all the methods in the subclasses. You can easily get away without implementing a particular method defined in the interface. It won’t complain about the unimplemented methods in the subclasses. However, if you try to use a method that hasn’t been implemented in the subclass, you’ll get an error. This means even if <code>issubclass(ConcreteSubClass, Interface)</code> shows <code>True</code>, you can’t rely on it since it doesn’t give you the guarantee that the <code>ConcreteSubClass</code> has implemented all the methods defined in the <code>Interface</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s create another class <code>FakeCalc</code> an only implement one method defined in the <code>ICalc</code> abstract class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>FakeCalc</span><span>(</span><span>ICalc</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Concrete Class: Fake calculator that doesn't implement all the methods

<p>Despite not implementing all the methods defined in the <code>ICalc</code> class, I was still able to instantiate the <code>FakeCalc</code> concrete class. However, when I tried to apply a method <code>sub</code> that wasn’t implemented in the concrete class, it gave me an error. Also, <code>issubclass(FakeCalc, ICalc)</code> returns <code>True</code> which can mislead you into thinking that all the methods of the subclass <code>FakeCalc</code> are usable. It can cause subtle bugs can be difficult to detect. Formal interfaces try to overcome these issues.</p>

<h2 id="formal-interfaces">
Formal Interfaces</h2>

<p>Formal interfaces do not suffer from the problems that plague informal interfaces. So if you want to implement an interface that the users can’t initiate independently and that forces them to implement all the methods in the concrete sub classes, formal interface is the way to go. In Python, the idiomatic way to define formal interfaces is via the <code>abc</code> module. Let’s transform the previously mentioned <code>ICalc</code> interface into a formal one:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>abc</span> <span>import</span> <span>ABC</span><span>,</span> <span>abstractmethod</span>


<span>class</span> <span>ICalc</span><span>(</span><span>ABC</span><span>):</span>

August 7, 2020 | https://maxrozen.com/react-components-hooks-functions-vs-classes/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://maxrozen.com/react-components-hooks-functions-vs-classes/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re new to React, and you’ve been working through tutorials, chances are you’ve run into examples of both functional components with Hooks, and class components, with no strong indication of which one you should be using. Even as a seasoned developer, you might still be using class components, wondering if its worth the rewrite.</p>
<p>Heck, you might even be thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been digging for answers, but I just can’t find a clear answer for this</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s fair enough, even the official documentation didn’t have a strong recommendation until the middle of 2020.</p>
<h2 id="which-one-should-you-use"><a href="#which-one-should-you-use" aria-label="which one should you use permalink"></a>Which one should you use?</h2>
<p>The official React team stance (according to the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#should-i-use-hooks-classes-or-a-mix-of-both">docs</a>), is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you’re ready, we’d encourage you to start trying Hooks in new components you write. […] We don’t recommend rewriting your existing classes to Hooks unless you planned to rewrite them anyway (e.g. to fix bugs).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To summarise:</p>
<ul>
<li>New code should use functional components with Hooks, when you’re ready</li>
<li>Old code can keep using class components, unless you want to rewrite</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="should-i-just-focus-on-hooks-then"><a href="#should-i-just-focus-on-hooks-then" aria-label="should i just focus on hooks then permalink"></a>Should I just focus on hooks then?</h2>
<p>It’s not that simple.</p>
<p>You still need class components to build <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html">Error Boundaries</a>.</p>
<p>On top of that, most code written before 2019 will likely still use class components, as there is no immediate need to rewrite them to functional components with Hooks. If you want to understand existing code in a codebase, you’ll need to also learn class components.</p>
<p>You’ll also find that companies that ask React questions during their interviews will still ask you about classes.</p>
<h2 id="should-we-rewrite-our-old-class-based-code-to-use-hooks"><a href="#should-we-rewrite-our-old-class-based-code-to-use-hooks" aria-label="should we rewrite our old class based code to use hooks permalink"></a>Should we rewrite our old class-based code to use Hooks?</h2>
<p>As with all good things, there are tradeoffs to consider here.</p>
<p>Hooks result in much cleaner, easier to understand components compared to class components of a similar complexity.</p>
<p>To illustrate my point, compare this component that fetches some data from <a href="https://swapi.dev/">The Star Wars API</a>, written first as a class, then as a functional component with hooks:</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>import</span> React <span>from</span> <span>'react'</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>class</span> <span>DataDisplayer</span> <span>extends</span> <span>React<span>.</span>Component</span> <span>{</span>

      <span>return</span> <span>&lt;</span>div<span>&gt;</span><span>{</span>data<span>.</span>name<span>}</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>div<span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>null</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>A pretty standard class component.</p>
<p>As your app grows, the lifecycle methods grow larger, and the context switching involved just from scrolling through the file increases.</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but my thought process when scrolling through classes is like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay so I’m in <code>componentDidMount</code>, so we’ll be fetching data here</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay so here we’re rendering, so this code runs every single time</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I need to add some extra functionality… hmm which lifecycle method does <em>that</em> go in again?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, you have Hooks:</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>import</span> React<span>,</span> <span>{</span> useEffect<span>,</span> useState <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'react'</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>function</span> <span>DataDisplayer</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>data<span>,</span> setData<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>''</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>getData</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>const</span> response <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>https://swapi.dev/api/people/</span><span><span>${</span>props<span>.</span>id<span>}</span></span><span>/</span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
      <span>const</span> newData <span>=</span> <span>await</span> response<span>.</span><span>json</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
      <span>setData</span><span>(</span>newData<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span><span>;</span>
    <span>getData</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      
    <span>}</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span>props<span>.</span>id<span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>if</span> <span>(</span>data<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>&lt;</span>div<span>&gt;</span><span>{</span>data<span>.</span>name<span>}</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>div<span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>null</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With Hooks, writing code that follows sequentially is much easier, and I find reading functional components with Hooks requires less context switching, as you’re not jumping around the file to find which lifecycle method you think something happened in.</p>
<p>That’s the main benefit of rewriting to Hooks - your codebase’s developer experience improves as it takes less time to understand what each component does.</p>
<p>The main drawback is time - time spent rewriting is time you could have spent building new features.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-from-here"><a href="#where-to-from-here" aria-label="where to from here permalink"></a>Where to from here?</h2>
<p>When introducing Hooks to my team in the past I recommended the following approach, and it worked quite well:</p>
<ul>
<li>All new code should be written as functional components with Hooks</li>
<li>Existing code should only be rewritten if it gets touched (for example, if you’re fixing a bug or adding functionality, take the time to swap the component over to Hooks)</li>
</ul></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Migrating a server to the cloud</em> always sounds great. But we know it’s a hassle. Especially for servers in production. We want a new server, but keeping current data. And we need to migrate it fast with minimum service disruption.</p>
<p>It takes some time to understand how to do it. Therefore I wrote a <strong>step-by-step guide</strong> to make migration simple and repeatable. Here is how I did it.</p>

<h2>1. Creating a CloudEndure Account</h2>
<p>The tool I used is CloudEndure. This is a free tool that orchestrates migration tasks. To get started, I created a <a href="https://console.cloudendure.com/#/register/register">CloudEndure account</a>. I received a confirmation email. And afterward, I was able to log in to CloudEndure console.</p>
<h2>2. Granting Access to AWS Account</h2>
<p>The first step in the console was creating a new project.</p>
<p>

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<p>Note that the CloudEndure account is different from the AWS account. So I needed to create a user that gives CloudEndure access to my AWS account. I followed the steps described in <a href="https://docs.cloudendure.com/#Generating_and_Using_Your_Credentials/Working_with_AWS_Credentials/Generating_the_Required_AWS_Credentials/Generating_the_Required_AWS_Credentials.htm">Generating the Required AWS Credentials</a>. The result was an access key ID and a secret access key.</p>
<p>Then I added these credentials in CloudEndure console and click Save. This verified that CloudEndure got access to my AWS account. And the project changed from <em>“Project not setup”</em> to <em>“Project not fully setup”</em> status.</p>

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<h2>3. Defining Replication Settings</h2>
<p>Once communication with AWS is enabled, the next step was configuring the migration project details. I set the migration source to <em>“Other Infrastructure”</em> (because the server to migrate was located on-premises). And I set the target to <em>“AWS US East (Northern Virginia)”</em>. That was the region chosen to migrate the server.</p>
<p>That project tab also had these settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replication instance type</li>
<li>Converter instance type</li>
<li>Disks types (SSD or standard)</li>
<li>Subnet (where Replication Servers will be launched)</li>
<li>Security Groups (for Replication servers)</li>
<li>Network Bandwith Throttling</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the <strong>replication instances</strong> are used to continuously sync your source disks to the cloud. CloudEndure completely manages them.</p>
<p>Apart from these, CloudEndure uses temporary <strong>converter instances</strong>. They adapt the source disks just before launching the target machine, so they can boot and run in the cloud. This might include changing the bootloader and adding drivers for the new HW.</p>
<p>In my case, I just used default settings, and click <em>“Save replication Settings”</em>. And I got a <em>“Project setup complete”</em> message.</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <span>
      <img alt="CloudEndure project setup complete" title="" src="https://www.iobasis.com/static/5c4d3d5e1f6676482cb11fc622f6a34e/a6d36/CloudEndure03.png" srcset="https://www.iobasis.com/static/5c4d3d5e1f6676482cb11fc622f6a34e/772e8/CloudEndure03.png 200w,

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<h2>4. Verifying Agent Requirements</h2>
<p>The <em>“Cloudendure agent”</em> is a small program to install on the source machine. It connects to CloudEndure and sends the disks data to <em>“replication servers”</em> on the AWS account. The replication is continuous. So any change in the source is automatically sent to the cloud.</p>
<p>First I checked CloudEndure <a href="https://docs.cloudendure.com/Content/Getting_Started_with_CloudEndure/Supported_Operating_Systems/Supported_Operating_Systems.htm">supported operating systems</a>. Ubuntu is supported from version 12.04. So my OS was supported.</p>
<p>I also checked the other agent <a href="https://docs.cloudendure.com/Content/Installing_the_CloudEndure_Agents/Agent_Installation_Requirements/Agent_Installation_Requirements.htm">installation prerequisites</a>. All these verifications makes sure that the agent works correctly in the source machine.</p>
<h2>5. Installing the Agent</h2>
<p>Then I installed the CloudEndure agent on the source server. The <em>“Machine”</em> window on CloudEndure console showed how to install the agent.</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <span>
      <img alt="CloudEndure agent installation instructions" title="" src="https://www.iobasis.com/static/e6fccda739f4a9d99b3816d12447d156/5a190/CloudEndure04.png" srcset="https://www.iobasis.com/static/e6fccda739f4a9d99b3816d12447d156/772e8/CloudEndure04.png 200w,

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<p>For Linux source machines, there are 2 commands. The first one downloads the agent. And the second one installs it. This command also has a code (the <em>“Agent Installation Code”</em>) that links the agent to a particular CloudEndure account.</p>
<p>The installation wasn’t as simple as it appeared. I had to use <code>python3</code> command (instead of <code>python</code>). The first installation also failed. The agent didn’t detect the root disk correctly. But I removed the <code>--no-prompt</code> argument from the second installation command. That allowed me to specify the correct device <code>/dev/sda</code> during the installation process.</p>
<p>The second installation had issues also. CloudEndure agent couldn’t establish a connection to the console. In order to solve this, I installed some packages (<code>make</code>, <code>openssl</code>, <code>wget</code>, <code>curl</code>, <code>gcc</code>, and <code>build-essential</code>). This solved the problem and the agent was finally installed. Both product documentation and <code>~/cloudendure.log</code> were useful for troubleshooting.</p>
<p>

    <span>
      <img alt="CloudEndure agent installed" title="" src="https://www.iobasis.com/static/6cce179e8a0a83e3acead559400a4259/76cea/CloudEndure05.png" srcset="https://www.iobasis.com/static/6cce179e8a0a83e3acead559400a4259/772e8/CloudEndure05.png 200w,

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<h2>6. Replicating Disk</h2>
<p>After installing the agent, a row appeared in the <em>“Machines”</em> tab of CloudEndure console, and it showed the source server’s name (<em>“ubuntu”</em>).</p>
<p>

<p>That row also showed the status of the replication. For example, at the moment of the screenshot, replication was 3.78% complete. And the ETA to get full replication was <em>“An hour”</em>. This indicator is very useful when you need to sync lots of data (or your upload bandwidth is limited).</p>
<p>I also noticed that CloudEndure launched a <strong>t3.small</strong> machine on the target region.</p>

  </p>
<p>That instance was used as the <strong>Replication instance</strong>. It runs when there is any replication in progress. And it replicates up to 15 source volumes simultaneously.</p>
<p>I also noticed that CloudEndure created 2 EBS volumes:</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <span>
      <img alt="CloudEndure EBS Volumes" title="" src="https://www.iobasis.com/static/7dcd217a12ee248e880a4175081dcf8a/227ba/CloudEndure08.png" srcset="https://www.iobasis.com/static/7dcd217a12ee248e880a4175081dcf8a/772e8/CloudEndure08.png 200w,

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<p>Both volumes were attached to the replication server. The first one was intended to store the replicated data. And the volume size was the same as the source disk (in this case 8 GiB). And the second volume was for the <strong>replication server</strong> software.</p>
<p>I also found that CloudEndure created snapshots of these volumes. I found multiple snapshots of my disc, as shown below.</p>

<h2>7. Completing Replication</h2>
<p>After some time, the sync finished. It took me around 2 hours to sync an 8 Gb disk. Here is a screenshot of the console at that moment:</p>

  </p>
<p>Note that the Data Replication Progress changed to <em>“Continuous Data Replication”</em>. That means there was an EBS volume with a complete replica of my source volume. And that any changes were replicated instantly to AWS.</p>
<p>By clicking in the target machine row, I was able to see the details of the machine in CloudEndure. And the main characteristics of the source server were also described there (e.g. CPUs, Memory, OS, Disks, and installed packages).</p>

<p>The Blueprint tab described the Target configuration. These are the settings of the target server to launch in AWS.</p>

  </p>
<p>CloudEndure automatically defines the settings of the target machine (for example machine type, subnets, IP, Security Group, and Disk Type). These settings are very important because they define the new EC2 instance characteristics. It’s important to review these settings and adjust default values if necessary.</p>
<p>In my case, I just adjusted a few parameters. First, I changed the machine type to t3.medium. I also set the <em>“Private IP”</em> to <em>“Create new”</em>. This assigns the target machine an IP in the target subnet. And also changed the disk type to SDD. That was all I needed to fine-tune my new server.</p>
<h2>8. Testing the Launch</h2>
<p>The next step was making sure that the server migration would be successful. So I made a test launch before final migration. This is started with the <em>“Launch Target Machines”</em> button.</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <span>
      <img alt="CloudEndure Test Launch" title="" src="https://www.iobasis.com/static/6e9b2130ecb217a1a1f27f8bbd014b1e/8b153/CloudEndure13.png" srcset="https://www.iobasis.com/static/6e9b2130ecb217a1a1f27f8bbd014b1e/772e8/CloudEndure13.png 200w,

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<p>This process creates the new EC2 instance with the migrated volume. That was completed in 7 minutes. And I found the new EC2 instance in the AWS Console. That was very fast.</p>
<p>

  </span>
  </p>
<p>I noticed that there was an instance in <em>“Terminated”</em> state. That’s normal. That’s the temporary converter instance. The conversion time was below 2 minutes. And that conversion instance was terminated afterward.</p>
<p>I wrote down the public IP address of the new instance just launched in the Virginia region. And I was able to login to the instance without any issue. That means that the migration test was successful.</p>

  </p>
<h2>9. Removing Unused Test Resources</h2>
<p>After all tests on the instance were completed, I still had the target instance running on AWS. And it wasn’t useful anymore. So I decided to remove its resources from AWS. This was done by selecting the instance in CloudEndure console and choosing <em>“Delete Target Machine”</em>.</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <span>
      <img alt="CloudEndure Delete Target Machine" title="" src="https://www.iobasis.com/static/ebff82e8acaa67b072fc56c3a3eb7bd8/07484/CloudEndure16.png" srcset="https://www.iobasis.com/static/ebff82e8acaa67b072fc56c3a3eb7bd8/772e8/CloudEndure16.png 200w,

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<p>Then, the target instance was terminated in AWS as expected.</p>
<p>Note that the replication instance was still active. It was still used to sync the source machine.</p>
<p>

    <span>

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<p>But I noticed that the Volume previously used by the Target instance wasn’t removed from AWS. So deleted it on my own.</p>
<h2>10. Cutover</h2>
<p>Then the last step was the final migration. I launched a new machine. But this time I used <em>“Cutover Mode”</em> instead of <em>“Test Mode”</em>.</p>
<p>The process was the same as in the <em>“Test Mode”</em>. A new machine was launched in 7 minutes. And I was able to log into the migrated server successfully. So the migration completed successfully again.</p>
<h2>11. Cleaning up</h2>
<p>I still had lots of unused resources on my AWS account. These are the steps I took to clean everything up:</p>
<ul>
<li>I completed a <em>“Remove Machine from this console”</em> on CloudEndure Console. This removes the agent from the source server and stops replication. Note that the target machine isn’t modified. We don’t want the migrated server to be terminated.</li>
<li>I terminated the <em>“Replication Server”</em> instance in AWS (because I had no other replication in progress). This has to be done manually because it isn’t done by CloudEndure.</li>
<li>I removed the EBS volumes previously used by <em>“Replication Server”</em>.</li>
<li>I also removed all unused snapshots.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This process allowed me to <strong>lift-and-shift</strong> the server. Lift-and-shift is always the first step in the cloud journey. And this tool allowed to complete it efficiently.</p>
<p>I want to mention that the process had many advantages. For example, I used the same tool for uploading the data to the cloud and orchestrate the migration. I was also able to test the process before the cutover. That’s very important because it eliminates possible migration mistakes. The unavailability period was very short. Additionally, I didn’t have to adapt the disk to boot in the cloud, because that was managed by the tool. And this process allows me to automate the migration of …</p></div></div>

<article>
  <p>There has been a sudden resurgence of interest in my <a href="https://www.a1k0n.net/2006/09/15/obfuscated-c-donut.html">“donut” code from 2006</a>, and I’ve
had a couple requests to explain this one.  It’s been five years now, so it’s
not exactly fresh in my memory, so I will reconstruct it from scratch, in great
detail, and hopefully get approximately the same result.</p>

<p>This is the code:</p>
<pre>             k;double sin()
         ,cos();main(){float A=
       0,B=0,i,j,z[1760];char b[
     1760];printf("\x1b[2J");for(;;
  ){memset(b,32,1760);memset(z,0,7040)
  ;for(j=0;6.28&gt;j;j+=0.07)for(i=0;6.28
 &gt;i;i+=0.02){float c=sin(i),d=cos(j),e=
 sin(A),f=sin(j),g=cos(A),h=d+2,D=1/(c*
 h*e+f*g+5),l=cos      (i),m=cos(B),n=s\
in(B),t=c*h*g-f*        e;int x=40+30*D*
(l*h*m-t*n),y=            12+15*D*(l*h*n
+t*m),o=x+80*y,          N=8*((f*e-c*d*g
 )*m-c*d*e-f*g-l        *d*n);if(22&gt;y&amp;&amp;
 y&gt;0&amp;&amp;x&gt;0&amp;&amp;80&gt;x&amp;&amp;D&gt;z[o]){z[o]=D;;;b[o]=
 ".,-~:;=!*#$@"[N&gt;0?N:0];}}/*#****!!-*/
  printf("\x1b[H");for(k=0;1761&gt;k;k++)
   putchar(k%80?b[k]:10);A+=0.04;B+=
     0.02;}}/*****####*******!!=;:~
       ~::==!!!**********!!!==::-
         .,~~;;;========;;;:~-.
             ..,--------,*/
</pre>
<p>…and the output, animated in Javascript:
</p>
<pre id="d"></pre>

<p>At its core, it’s a framebuffer and a Z-buffer into which I render pixels.
Since it’s just rendering relatively low-resolution ASCII art, I massively
cheat.  All it does is plot pixels along the surface of the torus at
fixed-angle increments, and does it densely enough that the final result looks
solid.  The “pixels” it plots are ASCII characters corresponding to the
illumination value of the surface at each point: <code>.,-~:;=!*#$@</code> from dimmest to
brightest.  No raytracing required.</p>

<p>So how do we do that?  Well, let’s start with the basic math behind 3D
perspective rendering.  The following diagram is a side view of a person
sitting in front of a screen, viewing a 3D object behind it.</p>

<center><img src="https://www.a1k0n.net/img/perspective.png"></center>

<p>To render a 3D object onto a 2D screen, we project each point (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>,<em>z</em>) in
3D-space onto a plane located <em>z’</em> units away from the viewer, so that the
corresponding 2D position is (<em>x’</em>,<em>y’</em>).  Since we’re looking from the side,
we can only see the <em>y</em> and <em>z</em> axes, but the math works the same for the <em>x</em>
axis (just pretend this is a top view instead).  This projection is really easy
to obtain: notice that the origin, the <em>y</em>-axis, and point (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>,<em>z</em>) form a
right triangle, and a similar right triangle is formed with (<em>x’</em>,<em>y’</em>,<em>z’</em>).
Thus the relative proportions are maintained:</p>



<p>So to project a 3D coordinate to 2D, we scale a coordinate by the screen
distance <em>z’</em>.  Since <em>z’</em> is a fixed constant, and not functionally a
coordinate, let’s rename it to <em>K<sub>1</sub></em>, so our projection equation
becomes .  We can choose
<em>K<sub>1</sub></em> arbitrarily based on the field of view we want to show in our
2D window.  For example, if we have a 100x100 window of pixels, then the view
is centered at (50,50); and if we want to see an object which is 10 units wide
in our 3D space, set back 5 units from the viewer, then <em>K<sub>1</sub></em> should
be chosen so that the projection of the point <em>x</em>=10, <em>z</em>=5 is still on the
screen with <em>x’</em> &lt; 50: 10<em>K<sub>1</sub></em>/5 &lt; 50, or <em>K<sub>1</sub></em> &lt; 25.</p>

<p>When we’re plotting a bunch of points, we might end up plotting different
points at the same (<em>x’</em>,<em>y’</em>) location but at different depths, so we maintain
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-buffering">z-buffer</a> which stores
the <em>z</em> coordinate of everything we draw.  If we need to plot a location, we
first check to see whether we’re plotting in front of what’s there already.  It
also helps to compute <em>z</em><sup>-1</sup>  and use that when depth
buffering because:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>z</em><sup>-1</sup> = 0 corresponds to infinite depth, so we can pre-initialize
our z-buffer to 0 and have the background be infinitely far away</li>
  <li>we can re-use <em>z</em><sup>-1</sup> when computing <em>x’</em> and <em>y’</em>:
Dividing once and multiplying by <em>z</em><sup>-1</sup> twice is cheaper than
dividing by <em>z</em> twice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, how do we draw a donut, AKA <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus">torus</a>?  Well, a torus is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_of_revolution">solid of
revolution</a>, so one way to do it is to draw a 2D circle around some point in
3D space, and then rotate it around the central axis of the torus.  Here is a
cross-section through the center of a torus:</p>

<center><img src="https://www.a1k0n.net/img/torusxsec.png"></center>

<p>So we have a circle of radius <em>R</em><sub>1</sub> centered at point
(<em>R</em><sub>2</sub>,0,0), drawn on the <em>xy</em>-plane.  We can draw this by sweeping
an angle — let’s call it <em>θ</em> — from 0 to 2π:</p>

<p>\[
(x,y,z) = (R_2,0,0) + (R_1 \cos \theta, R_1 \sin \theta, 0)
\]</p>

<p>Now we take that circle and rotate it around the <em>y</em>-axis by another angle
— let’s call it φ.  To rotate an arbitrary 3D point around one of the
cardinal axes, the standard technique is to multiply by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix">rotation matrix</a>.  So if
we take the previous points and rotate about the <em>y</em>-axis we get:</p>





<p>But wait: we also want the whole donut to spin around on at least two more axes
for the animation.  They were called <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> in the original code: it was a
rotation about the <em>x</em>-axis by <em>A</em> and a rotation about the <em>z</em>-axis by <em>B</em>.
This is a bit hairier, so I’m not even going write the result yet, but it’s a
bunch of matrix multiplies.</p>



<p>Churning through the above gets us an (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>,<em>z</em>) point on the surface of our
torus, rotated around two axes, centered at the origin.  To actually get screen
coordinates, we need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Move the torus somewhere in front of the viewer (the viewer is at the
origin) — so we just add some constant to <em>z</em> to move it backward.</li>
  <li>Project from 3D onto our 2D screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>So we have another constant to pick, call it <em>K</em><sub>2</sub>, for the distance
of the donut from the viewer, and our projection now looks like:</p>

<p>\[
\left( x’, y’ \right)
=
\left( \frac{K_1 x}{K_2 + z} , \frac{K_1 y}{K_2 + z} \right)
\]</p>

<p><em>K</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>K</em><sub>2</sub> can be tweaked together to change the field
of view and flatten or exaggerate the depth of the object.</p>

<p>Now, we could implement a 3x3 matrix multiplication routine in our code and
implement the above in a straightforward way.  But if our goal is to shrink the
code as much as possible, then every 0 in the matrices above is an opportunity
for simplification.  So let’s multiply it out.  Churning through a bunch of
algebra (thanks Mathematica!), the full result is:</p>



<p>Well, that looks pretty hideous, but we we can precompute some common
subexpressions (e.g. all the sines and cosines, and )
and reuse them in the code.  In fact I came up with a completely different
factoring in the original code but that’s left as an exercise for the reader.
(The original code also swaps the sines and cosines of A, effectively rotating
by 90 degrees, so I guess my initial derivation was a bit different but that’s
OK.)</p>

<p>Now we know where to put the pixel, but we still haven’t even considered which
shade to plot.  To calculate illumination, we need to know the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal">surface normal</a> —
the direction perpendicular to the surface at each point.  If we have that,
then we can take the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">dot
product</a> of the surface normal with the light direction, which we can choose
arbitrarily.  That gives us the cosine of the angle between the light direction
and the surface direction: If the dot product is &gt;0, the surface is facing
the light and if it’s &lt;0, it faces away from the light.  The higher the
value, the more light falls on the surface.</p>

<p>The derivation of the surface normal direction turns out to be pretty much the
same as our derivation of the point in space.  We start with a point on a
circle, rotate it around the torus’s central axis, and then make two more
rotations.  The surface normal of the point on the circle is fairly obvious:
it’s the same as the point on a unit (radius=1) circle centered at the origin.</p>

<p>So our surface normal (<em>N<sub>x</sub></em>, <em>N<sub>y</sub></em>, <em>N<sub>z</sub></em>) is
derived the same as above, except the point we start with is just (cos
<em>θ</em>, sin <em>θ</em>, 0).  Then we apply the same rotations:</p>



<p>So which lighting direction should we choose?  How about we light up surfaces
facing behind and above the viewer: .  Technically
this should be a normalized unit vector, and this vector has a magnitude of
√2.  That’s okay – we will compensate later.  Therefore we compute the
above (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>,<em>z</em>), throw away the <em>x</em> and get our luminance <em>L</em> = <em>y</em>-<em>z</em>.</p>



<p>Again, not too pretty, but not terrible once we’ve precomputed all the sines
and cosines.</p>

<p>So now all that’s left to do is to pick some values for <em>R</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>K</em><sub>1</sub>, and <em>K</em><sub>2</sub>.  In the original donut
code I chose <em>R</em><sub>1</sub>=1 and <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>=2, so it has the same
geometry as my cross-section diagram above.  <em>K<sub>1</sub></em> controls the
scale, which depends on our pixel resolution and is in fact different for <em>x</em>
and <em>y</em> in the ASCII animation.  <em>K</em><sub>2</sub>, the distance from the viewer
to the donut, was chosen to be 5.</p>

<p>I’ve taken the above equations and written a quick and dirty canvas
implementation here, just plotting the pixels and the lighting values from the
equations above.  The result is not exactly the same as the original as some of
my rotations are in opposite directions or off by 90 degrees, but it is
qualitatively doing the same thing.</p>

<p>Here it is: </p>

<canvas id="canvasdonut" width="300" height="240">
</canvas>

<p>It’s slightly mind-bending because you can see right through the torus, but the
math does work!  Convert that to an ASCII rendering with <em>z</em>-buffering, and
you’ve got yourself a clever little program.</p>

<p>Now, we have all the pieces, but how do we write the code?  Roughly like this
(some pseudocode liberties have been taken with 2D arrays):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>const</span> <span>float</span> <span>theta_spacing</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>.</span><span>07</span><span>;</span>

<blockquote><p><em>The fish will be the last to discover water.</em><br>Modern proverb</p></blockquote>



<p>Talk to high-school students preparing for their science exams, and you’ll probably hear two things: that they’re scared of physics, and relatively comfortable with biology. Strangely, this is contrary to the view of most researchers. The scientific zeitgeist is that physics is easy. Its simplicity comes from an ability to create crystalline theories that are powerfully predictive, for everything from the existence of subatomic particles to how light bends around stars. Biology, on the other hand, is much harder to distil into elegant theorems and mathematical equations. For this reason, some eminent thinkers have <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/black-holes-are-simpler-than-forests-and-science-has-its-limits">argued</a> that cells and forests are harder to understand than distant and difficult-to-observe black holes.</p>



<p>But perhaps there is no such thing as an easy or hard discipline. Maybe there are only easy and hard questions. Biology only <em>seems</em> so hard because it has been defined by a set of very hard questions. Physics only <em>seems</em> easy because centuries of effort by deeply insightful thinkers have produced a set of answerable questions.</p>



<p>What makes biology so challenging, ironically, is our closeness to it. Ask yourself: who is ‘easier’ to understand – a romantic crush or a work colleague? Our intimacy with biology – as well as to psychology and social science – has led us to interrogate these phenomena with profound knowledge already in hand. We ask very detailed questions, and then we’re surprised by the seemingly mysterious or contradictory answers.</p>



<p>On a walk through the forest, we might observe the unusual shapes of the foliage on a maple tree. That might lead us to wonder why the leaves have lobes, why they turn red in autumn, what insects live in the leaf litter, and how they decompose and feed the soil. These questions are deceptively complex, despite the naturalness with which we ask them. By contrast, the cold vast vacuum of space and the unseeable smallness of quarks are so foreign to us that we are proud – at least initially – to say the simplest things about these entities, even just to show that they exist.</p>



<p>Intimacy has sometimes slowed our understanding in physics, too. The question of how the planets move is one of humanity’s oldest obsessions, and runs through many different mythologies. Yet thanks to our species’ self-absorption, the longstanding theory of epicycles wrongly placed the Earth at the centre of the Universe – a mistake that persisted for around 2,000 years. When the question was abstracted to matters of force, mass and gravity in Newtonian physics, planetary motion became much easier to predict and understand.</p>



<p>There are still plenty of hard questions for physicists to puzzle over. If physics pinned its reputation on predicting the next solar flare that could interfere with telecommunications on Earth, it would be viewed as a much more complicated and difficult discipline. Why? Because modelling the many mechanisms that produce the dynamics of the Sun’s surface – all of the gravitational, electromagnetic, thermal and nuclear processes involved – is fiendishly tricky. As for planetary motion, we can get a good-enough picture of a planet’s trajectory by recognising that the massiveness of our Sun allows us to ignore the influence of other heavenly bodies. But if we really wanted to attend to these details, we’d soon find that we can’t precisely predict the motion of three bodies of equal mass. Similarly, with chaos theory, we learned that we can make only rough guesses about the specific position of two pendulums whose motion is coupled together. We cannot, however, say with certainty where either pendulum will ever be.</p>



<p>Perhaps the questions that we have demanded of biology are just too hard. How do we save an individual human life? Why is this bluejay slightly darker than the other? But just because we demand more from biology doesn’t mean we can’t pose slightly easier questions. In fact, drawing on ‘easy’ physics can help us figure out how to <em>find</em> those questions. Physicists are particularly good at looking for pervasive, large-scale phenomena that apply across multiple systems and that are likely the result of simple, shared mechanisms.</p>



<p>Take the idea of <em>biological scaling</em>. This concept stems from early observations that a mammal’s metabolic rate depends predictably and nonlinearly on body size via a <em>power law</em>. A power law is a mathematical relationship that tells us how much a feature changes as the size of the system increases by orders of magnitude (that is, by multiples of a certain number, usually 10). So when a creature’s body mass increases by 1,000-fold, the principles of biological scaling accurately predict that its metabolic rate will increase 100-fold.</p>



<p>But how can the same mathematics apply to something as simple as the gravitational pull between two objects and the messy process of speciation across diverse habitats? In physics, power laws point to shared mechanisms and symmetries that operate across all scales. In biology, our own <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000171">research</a> – as well as <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/276/5309/122.long">that</a> of Geoffrey B West, James H Brown, and Brian J Enquist – shows that the fundamental mechanism at work is the structure and flow of vascular networks. It turns out that blood vessels tend to efficiently span the body and deliver resources to all of a creature’s cells while reducing the strain on the heart. This simple insight has given birth to a growing batch of successful theories that use the idea of an optimised biological structure to predict phenomena such as the distribution of <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/106/17/7040">trees in a forest</a>, how long we need to <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/104/3/1051">sleep</a>, the rate of growth of a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022973">tumour</a>, the largest and smallest <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5281582/">sizes of bacteria</a>, and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0020551">the tallest possible tree</a> in any environment.</p>



<p>However, biology can also give rise to its own unique questions. For example, as our colleagues <a href="http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/375/2109/20160338">Jessica Flack</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438816000246?via%3Dihub">David Krakauer</a> at the Santa Fe Institute have shown, the information-processing and decision-making capabilities of agents (such as primates, neurons and slime moulds) lead to unique types of feedback, adaptability and causation that differ from purely physical systems. It remains to be seen if the additional complexities of biological systems can be explained by expanding on physics-inspired perspectives such as information theory. It might be that the study of biology and complex systems in general will progress one day to insurmountably hard questions – or that a brilliant recasting of the questions will lead to the elimination of current challenges. This might show a path to easier answers, as Charles Darwin did by reformulating questions about the origins and diversity of life in terms of natural selection and variation.</p>



<figure><img src="https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/729/Aeon-Essay-Hardness-Figure-02.001.jpg" alt="" title=""><figcaption>The complexity of systems measured along two axes: 1) the detail and precision required of the scientific description; 2) the number of mechanisms being combined in a particular phenomenon. The hardest sciences ask detailed questions about systems that are composed of many mechanisms.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In his <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1734697?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">article</a> ‘More Is Different’ (1972), the physicist Philip Anderson highlighted the dangers of attempting to reduce everything to the most microscopic level. He focused instead on jumps in complexity that occur at various scales of natural phenomena – such as moving from quantum mechanics to chemistry. However, readers often overlook his argument that effective theories should rest on building blocks that explain the underlying mechanisms of a system – even if those building blocks are relatively large or medium-sized entities.</p>



<p>Building on this latter perspective, our argument is that we <em>don’t know</em> if black holes are simpler than forests. We <em>can’t</em> know, until we have a general effective theory that explains the existence of forests or until we can observe the most detailed dynamics of black-hole collapse and evaporation. A statement of relative complexity cannot be made without thoroughly defining the type of questions we are asking for each system. There are probably certain types of enquiries where our knowledge will hit a hard edge, but more often that’s about questions we’re posing than about the systems themselves.</p>



<p>So physics <em>can</em> be hard, and biology <em>can</em> be easy. The degree of difficulty depends more on what questions are being asked than on the field. Within complex-systems science, great advances are often made at the interface between these two perspectives. One path forward is to solve the easy questions first, and then use our answers to try to find principles that are helpful when it comes to more detailed questions and theories. It’s possible that by starting with the easy questions, we can slowly ‘build up’ to the hard ones. Or, in the opposite direction, observing the strange similarity of phenomena across disciplines might incline us to search for brand new mechanisms and principles. This will sometimes demand a less detailed, more abstract perspective – what our colleague John Miller, quoting the Nobel prizewinning physicist Murray Gell-Mann, discusses in his book <em>A Crude Look at the Whole</em> (2016). These crude looks – forced by the remoteness of physics, and obscured by the intimacy of biology – should yield many more deep insights and simplifications in science in the years to come.</p>

<p>EDGAR is the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system used by the SEC. Companies submit regulatory filings (such as quarterly reports) into the system, which are then made public for us to download. These filings are the primary focus of my research. In order to study the market reaction to them, I need to match each filing against a ticker.</p>



<h2>CIK to Ticker</h2>



<p>The SEC identifies both companies and individuals with a 10-digit central index key (CIK). I need to map that CIK to the appropriate time series in my market data (from Kibot), which are identified by ticker.</p>



<p>The starting point is the current mapping provided by the SEC: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/include/ticker.txt">tickers.txt</a>. That aligns fairly nicely with the <a href="http://www.kibot.com/historical_data/All_Stocks_Historical_Intraday_Data.aspx">Kibot ticker list</a>. Most of the effort past this point is dealing with dead tickers, which are important for reducing survivorship bias.</p>



<h2>Ticker extraction from filings</h2>



<p>I augmented my mapping by extracting tickers directly from filings where I could. Certain types of filings, 10-K and 10-Q, sometimes contain a “TradingSymbol” buried in the XBRL. But the richest sources of tickers are the ownership filings, forms 3, 4, and 5. Unfortunately, these are also the noisiest sources, since the ticker is entered by hand. Here is an example – all the unique tickers entered for NORTHWEST INDIANA BANCORP:</p>



<pre>NIWB(OB)<br>NIWIB(OB)<br>NIWIN(OB)<br>NWIB (OB)<br>NWIB(OB)<br>NWIBOB)<br>NWIIN(OB)<br>NWIN<br>NWIN (OB)<br>NWIN()B)<br>NWIN(OB<br>NWIN(OB)<br>NWIN)OB)<br>NWIN.OB<br>NWINOB</pre>



<h2>Company name matching</h2>



<p>Name matching is really tricky to get right. I decided to make <em>some</em> attempt at it, but limited it only a few hours of effort. It would take a crazy amount of work to research thousands of company histories to accurately match name variations. I’ve limited my matching to names that are identical after minor cleanup, and also names that are extremely close, but only after a cursory manual review.</p>



<h3>Levenshtein edit distance</h3>



<p>The Levenshtein distance is the minimum number of edits required to turn one string into another. I used it for fuzzy name matching. Edits include character insertions, deletions, and substitutions. The edit distance can be computed using dynamic programming. Happily, I found a fast C-based implementation is readily available in python:</p>



<pre><code>conda install python-levenshtein</code></pre>



<p>For my company name matching, I looked at each EDGAR company name for which I had not yet found a ticker in the Kibot data, and I compared it to each company name listed by Kibot. I kept any pair that matched with no more than one edit. This left me with about 450 matches to review manually. I didn’t do any research on the names, but rather just went off intuition. Here are some names I think probably <em>do</em> match. One criterion I used was whether I thought one company would sue the other over too similar a name:</p>

<p>There were a lot of borderline cases, but I hope my manual review added some value. The more I match correctly, the less likely I’ll have survivorship bias. But the more I match incorrectly, the more noise I’ll introduce into my research.</p>



<h2>Mapping by date</h2>



<p>Tickers change over time, so my ticker map is also keyed by date. I ended up doing something pretty simple. For each issuer CIK, I collect all distinct tickers, both from the official ticker mapping and from the filing extractions. Then, for each date, I look at which of any of those tickers I have market data for, and I pick the one with the most volume on the day prior to that date. I use the day before to avoid bias – high volume days tend to be associated with positive returns, which introduces a look-ahead bias. Note the implied assumption that I would want to trade the most liquid share class, even if the filing involved an insider transaction for a different share class.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>My conclusion is that I should probably have searched out a company identifier database to buy, ideally one that included daily prices and corporate actions. Years ago, I used the Compustat dataset which had CIKs. But that was about $25k/year even back then. Once I start making money, I’ll be better able to justify buying higher quality data.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>You are definitely not alone. A recent study by Deindre Barett, a Harvard psychologist, shows a significant increase in unusual and vivid dreams around the globe. Why is this happening and what are the second order effects of it?</p><h2 id="what-are-dreams">What are dreams?</h2><p>Dreams are a small peak into the complex way in which our brains make sense of the world. They usually don't make a lot of sense themselves and are rarely representative of your desires or beliefs. Think of them as a background process that keeps your brain in tune with the world around you<sup><a href="#references">1</a></sup>. </p><p>Dreams become more vivid when there are changes in your sleep quality and timing. Stress, anxiety &amp; uncertainty affect your sleep quality. Think of the night before a big event like a job interview. Falling asleep gets that much harder, and your sleep quality is usually worse. This leads to more vivid dreams.</p><h2 id="dreams-as-a-function-of-rem-sleep">Dreams as a function of REM sleep</h2><p>Dreams mostly occur during the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) stage of your sleep <sup><a href="#references">2</a></sup>. Every night you go through 3 different types of sleep - Light, Deep &amp; REM - in a cyclical process that lasts about 90 minutes. The time you spend in each type of sleep depends on the time of night. Earlier in the night you spend majority of the 90 minutes in light &amp; deep sleep. Earlier in the mornings is when you get most of your REM sleep. </p><p>The amount of REM you get each night is also controlled by how much REM sleep you've been getting over the past few days. Get too little REM sleep? Your body compensates for it by spending longer periods in REM sleep. This is why you experience a lot of dreams in the morning after a heavy night of drinking. Alcohol is a REM depressant and once its effects wear off, your body tries to catch up on REM sleep. Its a phenomenon called REM rebound. </p><p>Amount of time in REM this cycle = f(Current time, Amount of REM sleep over the past few days)</p><p>The pandemic has caused many changes in the way we live and work. Not having a morning commute means many people have the chance to sleep in. If you've been REM deprived in the past, and are spending more time in the morning sleeping, you are in REM rebound. This can lead to more vivid and frequent dreams. If your sleep schedule is inconsistent, you are getting a lot of REM on some nights and much less on others. This also leads to REM rebound and more vivid dreams.</p><h2 id="heightened-dream-recall">Heightened dream recall</h2><p>The emotions felt on a daily basis govern our dreams. Bizarre and negative dreams are a way of coping with everyday stressors. Dreams activate a neuron called serotonin 5-HT2A <sup><a href="#references">3</a></sup>. This neuron turns off a part of the brain called the dorsal prefrontal cortex. The result is “emotional disinhibition” a state in which emotions flood the consciousness.</p><p>We dream many times a night but our dream recall is usually poor. A sudden increase in anxiety and uncertainity leads to decrease in sleep quality. Poor sleep quality results in more night-time awakenings. Its much easier to remember your dreams when you keep waking up in the middle of the night.</p><p>The pandemic has raised anxiety &amp; stress levels across society. The dreams we experience reflect these emotions. Throw in high dream recall, and you get vivid, weird &amp; frequent dreams. </p><p>None of this is cause for much alarm. If you are generally REM deprived, your body will catch up to it. If you're sleep schedule is inconsistent, switch to a consistent wake up time. If your dreams are bothering you, there is early evidence that "dream mastery" techniques can reduce the intensity <sup><a href="#references">4</a></sup>.</p><p>Humans are good at coping with changes long-term. As we start accepting this new normal, odds are these "Pandemic dreams" will subside. </p><p>If you'd like to learn more about sleep and techniques to improve sleep, check out our <a href="https://www.sleepedy.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">website</a>!</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><ol><li><p><a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Understanding-Sleep" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Brain Basics: Understanding Sleep</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11121/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Possible Functions of REM Sleep and Dreaming</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2015.00225/full" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The role of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in memory and cognition</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0005789419300267?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mediators of Change in Imagery Rescripting and Imaginal Exposure for Nightmares: Evidence From a Randomized Wait-List Controlled Trial</a></p></li></ol></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ok, I want to preface this article by stating that it is entirely anecdotal and based on my experience working as a doctor in the emergency room of one of the big hospitals in Stockholm, Sweden, and of living as a citizen in Sweden. As many people know, Sweden is perhaps the country that has taken the most relaxed attitude of any towards the covid pandemic. Unlike other countries, Sweden never went in to complete lockdown. Non-essential businesses have remained open, people have continued to go to cafés and restaurants, children have remained in school, and very few people have bothered with face masks in public.</p>



<p>Covid hit Stockholm like a storm in mid-March. One day I was seeing people with appendicitis and kidney stones, the usual things you see in the emergency room. The next day all those patients were gone and the only thing coming in to the hospital was covid. Practically everyone who was tested had covid, regardless of what the presenting symtom was. People came in with a nose bleed and they had covid. They came in with stomach pain and they had covid.</p>



<p>Then, after a few months, all the covid patients disappeared. It is now four months since the start of the pandemic, and I haven’t seen a single covid patient in over a month. When I do test someone because they have a cough or a fever, the test invariably comes back negative. At the peak three months back, a hundred people were dying a day of covid in Sweden, a country with a population of ten million. We are now down to around five people dying per day in the whole country, and that number continues to drop. Since people generally die around three weeks after infection, that means virtually no-one is getting infected any more. If we assume around 0.5 percent of those infected die (which I think is very generous, more on that later), then that means that three weeks back 1,000 people were getting infected per day in the whole country, which works out to a daily risk per person of getting infected of 1 in 10,000, which is miniscule. And remember, the risk of dying is at the very most 1 in 200 if you actually do get infected. And that was three weeks ago. Basically, covid is in all practical senses over and done with in Sweden. After four months.</p>



<p>In total covid has killed under 6,000 people in a country of ten million. A country with an annual death rate of around 100,000 people. Considering that 70% of those who have died of covid are over 80 years old, quite a few of those 6,000 would have died this year anyway. That makes covid a mere blip in terms of its effect on mortality.</p>



<p>That is why it is nonsensical to compare covid to other major pandemics, like the 1918 pandemic that killed tens of millions of people. Covid will never even come close to those numbers. And yet many countries have shut down their entire economies, stopped children going to school, and made large portions of their population unemployed in order to deal with this disease.</p>



<p>The media have been proclaiming that only a small percentage of the population have antibodies, and therefore it is impossible that herd immunity has developed. Well, if herd immunity hasn’t developed, where are all the sick people? Why has the rate of infection dropped so precipitously? Considering that most people in Sweden are leading their lives normally now, not socially distancing, not wearing masks, there should still be high rates of infection.</p>



<p>The reason we test for antibodies is because it is easy and cheap. Antibodies are in fact not the body’s main defence against virus infections. T-cells are. But T-cells are harder to measure than antibodies, so we don’t really do it clinically. It is quite possible to have T-cells that are specific for covid and thereby make you immune to the disease, without having any antibodies. Personally, I think this is what has happened. Everybody who works in the emergency room where I work has had the antibody test. Very few actually have antibodies. This is in spite of being exposed to huge numbers of infected people, including at the beginning of the pandemic, before we realized how widespread covid was, when no-one was wearing protective equipment.</p>



<p>I am not denying that covid is awful for the people who do get really sick or for the families of the people who die, just as it is awful for the families of people who die of cancer, or influenza, or an opioid overdose. But the size of the response in most of the world (not including Sweden) has been totally disproportionate to the size of the threat.</p>



<p>Sweden ripped the metaphorical band-aid off quickly and got the epidemic over and done with in a short amount of time, while the rest of the world has chosen to try to peel the band-aid off slowly. At present that means Sweden has one of the highest total death rates in the world. But covid is over in Sweden. People have gone back to their normal lives and barely anyone is getting infected any more. I am willing to bet that the countries that have shut down completely will see rates spike when they open up. If that is the case, then there won’t have been any point in shutting down in the first place, because all those countries are going to end up with the same number of dead at the end of the day anyway. Shutting down completely in order to decrease the total number of deaths only makes sense if you are willing to stay shut down until a vaccine is available. That could take years. No country is willing to wait that long.</p>



<p>Covid has at present killed less than 6000 in Sweden. It is very unlikely that the number of dead will go above 7,000. An average influenza year in Sweden, 700 people die of influenza. Does that mean covid is ten times worse than influenza? No, because influenza has been around for centuries while covid is completely new. In an average influenza year most people already have some level of immunity because they’ve been infected with a similar strain previously, or because they’re vaccinated. So it is quite possible, in fact likely, that the case fatality rate for covid is the same as for influenza, or only slightly higher, and the entire difference we have seen is due to the complete lack of any immunity in the population at the start of this pandemic. </p>



<p>This conclusion makes sense of the Swedish fatality numbers – if we’ve reached a point where there is hardly any active infection going on any more in Sweden in spite of the fact that there is barely any social distancing happening then that means at least 50% of the population has been infected already and have developed immunity, which is five million people. This number is perfectly reasonable if we assume a reproductive number for the virus of two: If each person infects two new, with a five day period between being infected and infecting others, and you start out with just one infected person in the country, then you will reach a point where several million are infected in just four months. If only 6000 are dead out of five million infected, that works out to a case fatality rate of 0.12 percent, roughly the same as regular old influenza, which no-one is the least bit frightened of, and which we don’t shut down our societies for.</p>

			I am a practicing physician in Stockholm, Sweden. Every day I get asked questions by my patients about health, diet, exercise, supplements, and medications. There is a lot of misinformation on the internet and it is easy to get the wrong advice, and hard to tell what is right and what is wrong if you don’t have advanced scientific training. The purpose of this blog is to share what the science actually says.			<a href="https://sebastianrushworth.com/author/doctorsebastian/" rel="author">

<p>In past projects at <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/">Qvault</a> we had an application that typically ran with <strong>~2GB</strong> in memory at any given time. By simply changing the order of some <code>uint</code> variables we managed to drop the memory usage to less than <strong>1.4GB</strong>. The vast majority of this allocated memory is due to an enormous slice of <code>stats</code> structs.</p>



<p>The <code>stats</code> struct has the following type definition:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">type stats struct {
	NumPosts uint8
	Reach    uint16
	NumLikes uint8
}</code></pre>



<p>In theory, this struct will take a use a measly 4 bytes. Each <code>uint8</code> uses 1 <code>byte</code>, and the single <code>uint16</code> needs 2. We began to suspect that we had some wasteful memory issues, so I built the following little program to show how memory is being used by our struct:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"reflect"
	"runtime"
)

type stats struct {
	NumPosts uint8
	Reach    uint16
	NumLikes uint8
}

func main() {
	typ := reflect.TypeOf(stats{})
	fmt.Printf("Struct is %d bytes long\n", typ.Size())
	n := typ.NumField()
	for i := 0; i &lt; n; i++ {
		field := typ.Field(i)
		fmt.Printf("%s at offset %v, size=%d, align=%d\n",
			field.Name, field.Offset, field.Type.Size(),
			field.Type.Align())
	}

	allStats := []stats{}
	for i := 0; i &lt; 100000000; i++ {
		allStats = append(allStats, stats{})
	}

	printMemUsage()
}

func printMemUsage() {
	var m runtime.MemStats
	runtime.ReadMemStats(&amp;m)
	fmt.Printf("Alloc = %v MiB", bToMb(m.Alloc))
	fmt.Printf("\tTotalAlloc = %v MiB", bToMb(m.TotalAlloc))
	fmt.Printf("\tSys = %v MiB", bToMb(m.Sys))
	fmt.Printf("\tNumGC = %v\n", m.NumGC)
}

func bToMb(b uint64) uint64 {
	return b / 1024 / 1024
}</code></pre>



<p>On my MacBook using Go 1.14.1 the above program prints:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">Struct is 6 bytes long
NumPosts at offset 0, size=1, align=1
Reach at offset 2, size=2, align=2
NumLikes at offset 4, size=1, align=1
Alloc = 1084 MiB        TotalAlloc = 3012 MiB   Sys = 2713 MiB  NumGC = 19</code></pre>



<p>Notice that even though <code>NumPosts</code> only has a size of 1 byte, the next field, <code>Reach</code>, still starts at offset 2. A whole byte is being wasted! The same thing happens with the <code>NumLikes</code> field, it starts at offset 4 with a size of 1, but the struct still takes up the full 6 bytes.</p>



<p>This may not seem like a big deal, but when you are storing millions of these structs in memory the bloat starts to add up quick.</p>



<p>If we change the <code>stats</code> struct such that the <code>uint16</code> isn’t defined between the <code>uint8</code>s:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">type stats struct {
	Reach    uint16
	NumPosts uint8
	NumLikes uint8
}</code></pre>



<p>Then the output of the program becomes:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">Struct is 4 bytes long
Reach at offset 0, size=2, align=2
NumPosts at offset 2, size=1, align=1
NumLikes at offset 3, size=1, align=1
Alloc = 694 MiB TotalAlloc = 1927 MiB   Sys = 1391 MiB  NumGC = 19</code></pre>



<p>The total allocated memory drops from 3 GB to less than 2, and each instance of the struct now only uses 4 bytes.</p>



<h2>Why?</h2>



<p>Modern CPU hardware performs reads and writes to memory most efficiently when the data is&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">naturally aligned</a></em>. The memory that is stored side by side should be accessible using a common multiple, so the Go compiler makes sure that it is.</p>



<p>With our first struct, the Reach field is between the NumPosts and NumLikes fields, which means that the compiler will add some padding to keep things nice and even. </p>

<p>In our updated struct however, we have grouped the smaller fields, and since they add up to the same amount of memory as the larger <code>Reach</code> field we can save some space!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
    
    <p>by Jeffrey Kegler</p>
    <p>The story of Gödel's citizenship hearing had been much repeated over the years.
      What was known was that on 5 December 1947, Kurt Gödel went to his citizenship hearing in Trenton, New Jersey.
      The examiner was Judge Philip Forman.
      As his witnesses, Gödel brought his two closest friends, Oskar Morgenstern and Albert Einstein.
      Gödel was granted citizenship, and took his oath on 2 April 1948.
      Those were the reliably established facts.
    </p>
    <p>Afterwards, Morgenstern told many people that he and Einstein had had their hands full preventing the brilliant, but politically naive, Gödel from derailing his citizenship chances.
      No account directly from Morgenstern or anyone else at the hearing had survived, but hearsay versions circulated widely.
      The hearsay versions show considerable variation, but their burden is something like the following:
    </p>
    <p>Gödel, in his usual manner, had read extensively in preparing for the hearing.
      In the course of his studies, Gödel decided that he had discovered a flaw in the U.S. Constitution --
      a contradiction which would allow the U.S. to be turned into a dictatorship.
      Gödel, usually quite reticent, seemed to feel a need to make this known.
      Morgenstern and Einstein warned Gödel that it would be a disaster to confront his citizenship examiner with visions of a Constitutional flaw leading to an American dictatorship.
    </p>
    <p>Arriving in Princeton, the trio had no idea who the examiner would be.
      They happened to run into Judge Forman.
      Forman was a friend of Einstein's --
      when Einstein became a citizen, Forman had administered the oath.
      How lucky this was became apparent almost immediately during the questioning.
      Forman happened to remark how fortunate it was that the US was not a dictatorship, which Gödel took as a cue to explain his discovery.
      A surprised Forman exchanged glances with Einstein and Morgenstern, cut Gödel off, and forced-marched the hearing through to a successful conclusion.
    </p>
    <h2>The History, and the Legend</h2>
    <p>Nobody seems to know what Gödel's proof was.
      Many versions of the hearing that circulated featured invented dialog.
      In faculty room yarns this would be unfortunate, but not surprising.
      More startling is the presence of such dialog in the version given
      in the extremely scholarly and very carefully edited Gödel's
      <cite>Collected Works</cite>, Vol. I, p. 12.
      A footnote in
      <cite>Collected Works</cite>
      admits that its version is pure hearsay.
    </p>
    <p>I've learned to distrust such sources.
      When I was in graduate school, studying Theory of Computation, Kurt Gödel was still alive.
      I heard many tales of Gödel's eccentric behavior from mathematicians.
      Gödel certainly was eccentric, and first-hand tales of this abound,
      but I later discovered that every single anecdote I'd gotten second- or third-hand was almost certainly false.
    </p>
    <p>1997 marked a turning point in Gödel biography,
      with the publication of John Dawson's careful and reliable biography of Gödel:
      <cite>Logical Dilemmas</cite>.
      When Dawson wrote, all four participants in the hearing were dead.
      Morgenstern refers, briefly and cryptically, to the hearing in his diary, but does not say enough to fully support the story.
      Dawson in general, and quite correctly, rejected the use of hearsay.
      But this story was the most well-known story about Gödel, and nobody doubted that it had a basis in truth.
    </p>
    <p>Dawson apparently decided that some reference to this story must be made, regardless of sourcing difficulty.
      Given no alternative to using hearsay, Dawson was careful to seek out what could reasonably be thought of as the
      source of the best hearsay -- Morgenstern's widow.
      She certainly would have heard the story many times, and directly from Morgenstern.
      Dawson interviewed her on 17 October 1983.
      Dawson's account in
      <cite>Logical Dilemmas</cite>
      (pp. 179-180) is based on that interview and Morgenstern's diary entry.
    </p>
    <h2>The Lost Document</h2>
    <p>According to Dawson (p. 300), Morgenstern had written up an account of this matter for publication, but Dawson was unable to locate it.
      Dorothy Morgenstern was sure that she'd once had her husband's write-up,
      and that she'd sent it to someone.
      But she could not remember who.
      This wasn't exactly promising for the accuracy of her retelling.
      But best evidence is best evidence -- you take it how it comes.
    </p>
    <p>In dealing with the matter as a Wikipedia editor,
      I took the position that Dawson's account of this hearing was the final word.
      The other versions were either retellings of the Dawson account,
      hearsay from less reliable sources or pure speculation.
      Regardless of which of the three they were, they were to be rejected as sources for the Wikipedia article.
    </p>
    <p>When dealing with the matter as a novelist, the God Proof,
      I took the position that this story had become a legend as much as any tale of an 11th century saint.
      Since it was a legend, I was free as a writer of fiction to add any incident or dialog I thought to be in the spirit of the thing.
    </p>
    <p>But now the "lost" Morgenstern document has reappeared.
      Apparently the IAS has had it all these years.

        Morgenstern says that he did not check dates, and that corrected ones would be needed.

        The ones above are from Dawson and presumably correct.
        The "Examinor" (sic) referred to is Judge Forman.

    <div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p><strong>Quote of the Day</strong> is a simple protocol that is used to deliver daily
quotes. Although its usage is almost nonexistent these days, there are still a
few public servers. The protocol is defined by <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc865">RFC
865</a>. According to the RFC, a QOTD server is
run on <strong>port 17</strong> for TCP and UDP connections.</p>

<p>The RFC recommends that;</p>

<ul>
  <li>The quotes should be limited to the ASCII printable characters, spaces and
newlines.</li>
  <li>They should be less than 512 characters.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the protocol is only used to send quotes to terminals, these aren’t hard
requirements. But a server should still follow these recommendations in order to
be compatible with the other servers and clients.</p>

<p>Despite the name being Quote of the <em>Day</em>, a server does not have to serve
daily quotes. It can change the quote at any interval or send random quotes at
each connection.</p>

<h2 id="tcp-connections">TCP Connections</h2>

<p>When a QOTD server gets a connection, it sends a quote and closes the
connection, discarding any received data. Basically, a server should do the
following</p>

<ul>
  <li>Listen to connections on port <code>17</code>.</li>
  <li>Accept a connection.</li>
  <li>Choose a random quote.</li>
  <li>Send the quote to the client.</li>
  <li>Close the connection.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="udp-connections">UDP Connections</h2>

<p>A UDP server is a bit different from a TCP one. Since UDP has no concept of
<em>connections</em>, a server just sends the quote after getting a UDP datagram.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Listen to UDP datagrams on port <code>17</code>.</li>
  <li>When you get a UDP packet:
    <ul>
      <li>Discard any data in the packet.</li>
      <li>Send a UDP datagram containing the quote back to the client.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It turns out that the root cause behind several previously disclosed speculative execution attacks against modern processors, such as <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2018/01/meltdown-spectre-vulnerability.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meltdown</a> and <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2018/08/foreshadow-intel-processor-vulnerability.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Foreshadow</a>, was misattributed to ‘prefetching effect,’ resulting in hardware vendors releasing incomplete mitigations and countermeasures.</p>
<p>Sharing its findings with The Hacker News, a group of academics from the Graz University of Technology and CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security finally revealed the exact reason behind why the kernel addresses are cached in the first place, as well as presented several new attacks that exploit the previously unidentified underlying issue, allowing attackers to sniff out sensitive data.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.02307.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new research explains</a> microarchitectural attacks were actually caused by speculative dereferencing of user-space registers in the kernel, which not just impacts the most recent Intel CPUs with the latest hardware mitigations, but also several modern processors from ARM, IBM, and AMD — previously believed to be unaffected.</p>

</div>
<p>“We discovered that effects reported in several academic papers over the past 4 years were not correctly understood, leading to incorrect assumptions on countermeasures,” the researchers told The Hacker News.</p>
<p>“This <a href="https://gruss.cc/files/prefetch.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prefetching effect</a> is actually unrelated to software prefetch instructions or hardware prefetching effects due to memory accesses and instead is caused by speculative dereferencing of user-space registers in the kernel.”</p>
<p>Besides analyzing the actual root cause of the prefetching effect, some other key findings from the research are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discovery of several new attacks exploiting the underlying root cause, including an address-translation attack in more restricted contexts, direct leakage of register values in specific scenarios, and an end-to-end Foreshadow exploit targeting non-L1 data.</li>
<li>A novel cross-core covert channel attack that, in some instances, could let attackers observe caching of the address (or value) stored in a register without relying on shared memory.</li>
<li>Spectre ‘prefetch’ gadgets can directly leak actual data, which not only makes <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2019/11/zombieload-cpu-vulnerability.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ZombieLoad attack</a> efficient on Intel CPUs to leak sensitive data from internal buffers or memory but also impact non-Intel CPUs.</li>
<li>The speculative dereferencing issue — in certain attacks like <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2020/03/rowhammer-vulnerability-ddr4-dram.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rowhammer</a>, cache attacks, and DRAMA — could let attackers recover the physical addresses of JavaScript variables and exfiltrate information via <a href="https://gruss.cc/files/rowhammerjs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transient execution</a> remotely via a web browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, researchers also demonstrated that the Foreshadow vulnerability on Intel CPUs could be exploited even when the recommended mitigations are enabled. This is made possible due to the fact the attack can be mounted on data not residing in L1 cache on kernel versions containing ‘prefetch’ gadgets.</p>
<h2>From Address Translation Attack to Foreshadow</h2>
<p>The idea behind this is straight-forward. System software relies on the CPU’s address translation mechanism to implement isolation among different processes. Each process has its own virtual memory space and cannot access arbitrary physical memory addresses outside of it.</p>
<p>[embedded content]</p>
<p>Address translation, thus, acts as an intermediate layer that maps the virtual address space, which is used by a program, to the physical address to a physical address.</p>
<p>The virtual address space also includes a kernel address space to house Linux kernel threads, thus making it easy for the underlying hardware to handle privileged instructions from user threads in kernel mode.</p>
<p>While operating system kernels can be secured against prefetch side-channel attacks via a technique called kernel page-table isolation (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_page-table_isolation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KPTI</a> or <a href="https://gruss.cc/files/kaiser.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KAISER</a>) — which enforces a strict kernel and userspace isolation such that the hardware does not hold any information about kernel addresses while running in user mode — the researchers found that it does not guarantee full protection from address-translation attacks, where an attacker tries to check if two different virtual addresses map to the same physical address.</p>
<p>Put differently, the “address-translation attack allows unprivileged applications to fetch arbitrary kernel addresses into the cache and thus resolve virtual to physical addresses on 64-bit Linux systems.”</p>
<p>While the original line of thought was that such attacks were related to prefetch instructions, the new finding proves otherwise, thereby validating that KAISER isn’t an adequate countermeasure against microarchitectural side-channel attacks on kernel isolation.</p>
<p>Instead, it exploits a Spectre-BTB-SA-IP (Branch Target Buffer, same address, in-place) gadget to cause information leakage, causing speculative execution, and further carry out Meltdown and Foreshadow (L1 Terminal Fault) attacks by bypassing current L1TF mitigations.</p>
<p><a href="https://thehackernews.com/2018/11/meltdown-spectre-vulnerabilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectre-BTB-SA-IP</a> is a variant of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.05441.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectre vulnerability</a> that exploits the Branch Target Buffer — a cache-like component in CPUs that’s used for branch prediction — to perform attacks within the same address space and the same branch location.</p>
<p>“The same prefetching effect can be used to perform Foreshadow,” the researchers said. “If a secret is present in the L3 cache and the direct-physical map address is derefenced in the hypervisor kernel, data can be fetched into the L1. This reenables Foreshadow even with Foreshadow mitigations enabled if the unrelated Spectre-BTB mitigations are disabled.”</p>
<p>“The consequence is that we are able to mount a Foreshadow attack on older kernels patched against Foreshadow with all mitigations enabled and on a fully patched kernel if only Spectre-v2 mitigations are disabled.”</p>
<h2>Enable Spectre-BTB mitigations such as Retpoline</h2>
<p>To highlight the impact of the side-channel attacks, the researchers established a cache-based covert channel that exfiltrated data from a process running on an Intel Core i7-6500U CPU to another stealthy process, achieving a transmission rate of 10 bit/s to relay a total of 128 bytes from the sender to the receiver process.<br>Furthermore, the researchers disclosed that it’s possible to leak register contents from an SGX enclave of Intel CPUs using a register that’s speculatively dereferenced (called “Dereference Trap”), using it to recover a 32-bit value stored in a 64-bit register within 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Lastly, ‘certain attacks’ can now be mounted remotely using JavaScript in a web browser, and “fill 64-bit registers with an attacker-controlled value in JavaScript by using WebAssembly.”</p>
<p>To mitigate these attacks, it’s recommended that current CPUs enable Spectre-BTB mitigations, including <a href="https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7625886" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retpoline</a> (short for “return trampoline”), which aims to <a href="https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/insights/deep-dive-retpoline-branch-target-injection-mitigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prevent branch-target-injection</a> by isolating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor#Indirect_branch_predictor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">indirect branches</a> from speculative execution.</p>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596822933010_17046"><div><p>While learning code for free, you can use a variety of resources for free: online courses, books, video lectures, and interactive tutorials.</p><p>I also encourage using different types of learning materials to drive the same lessons. For example, pair a book with a course or a video tutorial with an interactive tutorial.</p><p><strong>What type of learner are you? </strong>My bet: you are someone who needs variety — both hands-on, practical instruction and theory-based study.</p><p>The following sections describe each type of learning resource.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596822933010_20005"><div><h4>Books 📚</h4><p>Of course <strong>books</strong> come first, as this site is called <em>Books on Code</em> and we have a bias! Why do we love books as a learning resource for coding? With a book, you can slow down and embark on truly deep learning.</p><p><strong>When learning with books, consuming <em>conceptual</em> information is best. Taking notes by hand is a powerful way to etch ideas into your mind.</strong></p><p>I personally love books for this reason. I can have a hard time with video lectures when they breeze by <em>an important concept</em>. I think, “That makes sense,” only for the information to be gone forever.</p><p>With video lectures, I feel a level of shame pausing the video and replaying the same point over and over to capture every nuance of a quickly-drawn diagram and explanation. I love taking notes by hand, and sometimes video lectures are not great for that format.</p><p>With books, I comfortably spend as much time as I want contemplating a diagram or how each piece of code works.</p><p>Books are as slow or as fast as you want them to be. That’s why I love them.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596822933010_21212"><div><h4>Blogs ✍</h4><p><strong>Blogs. </strong>They’re obviously ‘free’, but they should not be overlooked as a way of learning code for free. In the coding community, many of us are also tech bloggers (myself included).</p><p>When programmers encounter a problem in their code, they often feel its their duty to chronicle their problem and how they solved it.</p><p>Blogging is a part of dev culture. It’s our way of life. 🙂</p><p>The best blog posts are often gathered in round-up email newsletters, with my favorite being <a href="https://frontendfoc.us/">Frontend Focus</a>. Many tech bloggers solve specific problems that you will likely only encounter during a Google search when trying to solve a problem.</p><p>Blogs are great reading when you are actively working on a project.</p><p>Blogs are also great learning when you yourself are actively writing your own blog. A great way to learn is to teach others. Starting your own blog, or contributing to the DEV community, is a great way to trace over the problems that you solved so that you can remember your solution forever.</p><p>To browse blogs, I recommend  joining tech blogging communities like the <a href="https://dev.to/">DEV community</a>. Their email list shares the weekly Top-7. By the way, my article, <a href="https://booksoncode.com/articles/cracking-the-code-interview" target="_blank">7 Effective Steps to Cracking the Code Interview</a> made the Top-7. That’s my humble brag for the day.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596822933010_22368"><div><h4>Video Courses 💻</h4><p>If you’re a visual learner, you may find huge value in <strong>video courses</strong>.</p><p>What I love about video courses is just how <em>consumable</em> video content is. I personally cannot binge enough YouTube videos. When I was learning merge sort, I watched <em>every </em>explanation I could get my hands on. I wasn’t getting it. Until I finally did.</p><p>I absolutely love video courses: both tutorials and conceptual information. However, the biggest negative for me is retention. I do not retain information as well from a video lecture as I do from a tutorial, a blog, or a book. Why? It’s all about the <em>effort</em> you put into retention — and with videos, it’s just too easy to be passive.</p><p>Nevertheless, video courses are among the most popular forms to learn code. Companies that offer this service tend to be video only, with no graded assignments. These courses take the form of lectures with slides and may walk through a tutorial, encouraging you to follow along on your own.</p><p>Popular platforms that offer video courses are Udemy, Scrimba, Pluralsight, and Frontend Masters. You can find great tutorial videos on YouTube as well (which are free!).</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596822933010_23439"><div><h4>Interactive Tutorials ⌨</h4><p>Another top coding resource in learning how to code for free is <strong>interactive coding courses</strong>. These courses have actual deliverables, quizzes, and <em>real coding assignments</em> that are either peer reviewed or checked by a computer. These are sometimes paired with videos, but not always. </p><p>Codeacademy and freeCodeCamp come to mind as resources that rely primarily on interactive tutorials. While other resources, like Coursera’s <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=AX2rU1%2FE%2FPo&amp;offerid=759505.38&amp;subid=0&amp;type=3" target="_blank">Fundamentals of Computing Specialization</a>, is a combination of video lectures and machine-graded assignments that take several hours, similar to a university computer science course.</p><p>Great interactive tutorials are rarer than other resources, because interactive tutorials are just more expensive to produce. Everything else is consumed passively, but interactive tutorials themselves requires thoroughly thought out assignments as well as a computational way to grade.</p><p>I absolutely love what freeCodeCamp has to offer. It is one of my absolute favorite ways to learn to code for free. But there is a downside to interactive tutorials: you can code to ‘win the game’ instead of code to learn. Instead of actually <em>analyzing</em> what I am doing, I try some stuff, solve the problem, and then don’t think about it again.</p><p>That’s not how it should go. Even the founder of freeCodeCamp emphasizes that <strong>all learning is about repeated exposure</strong>.</p><p>Because interactive tutorials are gamified, they can give the illusion of learning while you are not actually learning.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596506852511_13158"><div><h2>Why So Many Quality Resources are Free</h2><p>Now, you might be wonder: <strong><em>if there is an abundance of quality resources that rival paid material, why are they free at all?</em></strong></p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596430288319_16272"><div><h3>Why Books Are Free 📚</h3><p>Like with blogs, books are free for many of the same reasons that other products are free. The more generous authors are, the more likely these books are to end up in people’s hands, and the more it generates buzz.</p><p>Programmers who are sick of seeing the same mistakes made over and over sometimes just want their <em>wisdom out there</em>. </p><p>However, many books that are free still manage to make money.</p><p>Many free books charge for a print copy or have a suggested contribution, but do not require the contribution. Asking for payment, without <em>requiring</em> payment, can often work in the author’s favor. If readers appreciate the value the book gives, they are still likely to pay even if they can get it for free.</p><p>This concept is called reciprocity: when people receive great value, they want to return the favor.</p><p>Some books, like <em>Eloquent Javascript</em>, has a <strong>bonus model</strong>: the entire book is free, but if you pay for a print copy, you get a bonus chapter or other bonus materials.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596430288319_18099"><div><h3>Why Blogs are Free ✍</h3><p>Alright. I’m sure this sounds silly. <em>Of course</em> blogs are free. It’s kind of obvious.</p><p>But hear me out: many of the awesome resources we have for free online are <em>so good</em> that someone <em>would</em> pay for them. These resources include Interneting is Hard, the Front-End Developer Handbook, or the Complete Guide to Flexbox — things that are just <em>gold</em>.</p><p>One reason for this: amazing resources offer digital marketing and brand exposure.</p><p>Tools like the <em>Front-End Developer Handbook</em> is sponsored by the video learning platform, Front-End Masters. While the handbook provides immense value, the guide advertises their own courses throughout.</p><p>Individual bloggers, like <a href="https://www.byte-by-byte.com/" target="_blank">Sam Gavis-Hughson’s blog on Byte by Byte</a>, offers concise and valuable blogs and freebies on recursion and discrete math concepts. As many blogs do, the freebies lead to an email list, which promotes the business, …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

<p>As the third part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/24/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-farmers/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/31/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-big-farms/">II</a>) of our look at the basic structure of food production in the pre-modern world (particularly farming grain to make bread) we’re going to finally look at how one actually <em><strong>farms grain to make bread</strong></em>.  Now that we have all of our farmers in place, both the<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/31/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-big-farms/"> big ones </a>and <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/24/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-farmers/">the little</a> ones, we can get down to the earth and the mechanics of making some food.  As a result, this part is going to be a bit more descriptive and a bit less analytical.</p>



<p>This is not going to be a how-to guide (farming is complicated), but I want to give a sense of what our cereal farmers are doing at each stage of the year, the labor and tool demands of those tasks, and how they impact farming overall, along with the major processing stages (threshing, milling, baking) and the sorts of people who were involved with them.  <strong>I should note that our look<em> </em>at <em>processing</em> especially is going to be much more closely connected with the ancient and medieval Mediterranean, as a function of where I feel like I have a decent grasp on the structure of milling and baking as industries.</strong></p>

<p>((Also as a reminder, the selected bibliography for all of this is back <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/24/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-farmers/">in the first post</a>.)</p>



<h2>Farming in Season</h2>



<p>Since we have our farmers in place, <strong>let’s look at the activities of a single farming season in sequence</strong>.  Again, just to point out the necessary caveats,: different crops have different steps (these are the steps for wheat and barley), but also this is just a general overview and I am sure there are any number of important tasks that a farmer will spot that I’ve missed.</p>



<p>Now as I noted in the first post, the planting and harvest times move depending on if winter wheat was used (planted in autumn, harvested in early summer) or spring wheat (planted in spring, harvested in fall).  These are actually different <em>strains</em> of wheat (<em>triticum aestivum</em>).  Local soil conditions, especially seasonal moisture levels, are going to determine which variety of wheat is used.  Barley likewise can be a summer crop (especially in temperate areas) or a winter crop (in very warm areas; barley tolerates salty soil and dry conditions, but does poorly in cold winters).<em>  </em>I am going to follow the timings, roughly, for winter wheat (because it was the most common in the ancient Mediterranean, where my expertise lies).  When a spring wheat or barley is used, it is sown in the spring, with weeding in the summer, and with reaping, threshing and winnowing in the fall, so if you like, you can follow along, converting over to spring wheat timings.</p>

<p>But with winter wheat, that means our cycle begins late in the summer, getting ready for the planting season.  We have already pulled in and processed the previous harvest (in early summer), had our harvest festivals, banqueted our neighbors and are now preparing for planting.  The first step is <strong>plowing</strong>.  The plow – a wood or metal board pushed into the earth – carves grooves in the soil (making those distinctive little ridges in farmland) and turning up the lowest soil and putting it on top.  Plow design is actually something we can observe archaeologically; plows tended to improve over time, particularly their ability to deal with heavy, dense soils (though taking a heavy, deep-soil plow into lighter shallow soil is perilous, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl">as various farmers</a> have found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward">at points in history</a>); I won’t get into the details here, but Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plough">actually has a pretty capable list of forms</a>.  That said, while plow technology did steadily improve (only occasionally fast enough for our sources to notice, e.g. Plin. <em>Nat. Hist</em>. 18.172), the average peasant farmer is going to use the plow that is common in their region, which may or may not be the best for the task from a <em>global</em> or <em><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/diachronic">diachronic </a></em>inventory of plow-types.  <strong>Technological change for subsistence farmers was <em>slow</em>, so even unsuitable plows might last in regions for decades or centuries before a more suitable design was developed or imported</strong>.  Whatever design you had, you were largely stuck with it, at least in a time-frame measured by decades instead of generations or centuries.</p>



<p>(An aside: being American, I am using the American spelling ‘plow.’  The British spelling, which you may see, is ‘plough.’  As is common, the British spelling has no particular claim to antiquity – the Old English is <em>plōh</em>, which in turn gives the Middle English word, spelled alternately as ‘plow,’ ‘plouh’ and ‘plough,’ among other variations.  British ‘ou’ for ‘o’ spellings are frequently either Latin or Old English words <em>originally</em> spelled with just the ‘o’ (e.g. Latin,<em> honor</em>, <em>color</em> and here Old English <em>plōh</em>), which acquired their ‘u’ with the admixture of French.  Not that there is anything special about Americanisms; merely to note that just because a usage is British does not make it old or original, as far as I can tell in any case the American word is about as likely to be the original older spelling as the British one)</p>



<p>A<strong> field was generally <em>plowed more than once</em> in order to get an ideal soil situation</strong>.  The Romans seem to have assumed a normal field would be plowed three times before planting (with denser soils potentially requiring more runs): once to break up the soil (which will have spent the growing season compressing and hardening; you want it light and loose), then a run ‘cross-plowing’ (plow-lines perpendicular to the first effort), before the third plowing on the original direction (‘ridging’) leaving the distinctive farming ridges in the dirt.  In some cases, a different plow might be used for the steps, with the first step (or first two) carried out with an <em>ard</em>-plow (sometimes called a ‘breaking’ plow), which has no mouldbord and so merely cuts the earth but does not invert it and the last step carried out by a mouldboard plow, which has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plough#Mould-board_plough">mouldboard </a>designed to basically ‘flip’ the soil as it moves, exposing the clods of dirt in the lower layers to the air.  The plowings could be spaced out; the advice for a fallowed field (one where there was no crop growing in the previous year) was to plow once each in spring, summer and autumn.  The schedule might be compressed for rich land continually cropped.</p>

<p>Now as we’ve noted, the very poorest of farmers are not going to have regular access to a plow-team.  While they may have used human power to move a plow, the more common expedient here was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoe-farming">hoe-farming</a> using hoes, digging sticks or small ‘hard ards.’  That was slow, inefficient and backbreaking work, so getting access to a plow-team was important if at all possible.  Even for an animal-drawn plow (with a plow-team, normally oxen) there’s quite a lot of muscle work to be done to keep the furrows (the grooves left by the plow) straight – the straighter and more even the better – and to keep the plow down in the earth (pushing down on it may be necessary).  Remember: you are not only moving the weight of the plow, but the weight of all of the earth it is turning up.  <strong>This is one of the advantages of an animal plow team</strong> – <strong>oxen, being big, strong things can pull a much deeper plow</strong>.  Of course a lot of land needed to get plowed and in a relatively constrained time window; as you might imagine, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/31/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-big-farms/">the fellows who might <em>own</em> the plow teams</a> would thus be in a position to make sure their lands were plowed during the most favorable time windows.</p>



<p><strong>Plowing does a number of important things to enable farming</strong>.  The thing that everyone generally has in mind is that it upturns the earth, bringing deeper soil up; since crops exhaust the nutrients in the soil, plowing ‘shuffles the deck.’  <strong>But it also crucially cuts through the root-systems of weeds and disrupts the life-cycle of various pests</strong> (both by disrupting larva or eggs, but also by killing the plants those pests might feed on).  Removing the weeds by plowing was especially important in dry climates because otherwise the roots of those weeds would bring moisture out of the ground into the leaves of the weeds where it would evaporate; killing the weeds at the roots conserved the moisture for the crop.  Finally, plowing served to loosen up the dirt to allow the seeds to germinate better.</p>



<h2>Planting and the Growing Season</h2>



<p>Things get busy as we get to the sowing season.  If the field is going to be treated with manure, that gets laid down before the final plowing (which would come around September for an autumn-planting/summer harvest), with seeds being sown with that last plowing.  Manuring before the final plowing (with a mouldboard plow that upturns the soil) ensures that the nutrient-rich manure ends up buried and mixed into the soil; if left on the surface the manure will dry out and decompose, wasting the nutrient-value.</p>

<p>The RaDVaC intranasal vaccine is simple to both make and take for those with basic training in the biomedical sciences, chemistry, and related fields. You will find extensive documentation on all protocols, materials, and methods in our&nbsp;<a href="https://radvac.org/white-paper/">White Paper</a>, but for easier access and convenience, key protocols are summarized below.</p>



<h2><strong>Preparation of chitosan nanoparticle vaccine</strong></h2>



<p>Given that the vaccine is being used in pandemic conditions, to ensure that the vaccine is free of infectious virus contaminants during administration, solutions should be sterilized prior to mixing. Small volumes of chitosan/peptide and of TPP can be rendered free of infectious virus by heating in capped conical tubes to 55° C for at least 10 minutes, allowed to cool to room temperature, then mixed in a small beaker while magnetic stirring rapidly (&gt;500rpm) for a few minutes.</p>



<p><strong>Stock solutions</strong></p>



<p>Once prepared, heat stock solutions to 55° C (15 minutes for 50 ml conical tube; 10 minutes for 15 ml conical tube) to ensure that they are free of infectious virus. 5 M NaCl does not require heat sterilization but can be treated at the same time for an added safety precaution. Container sizes and amounts of each solution will depend on the number of doses of vaccine being produced. Multiple batches of 25 doses each can be made with the following stock volumes.</p>



<ul><li>dH2O</li><li>5M NaCl (in dH2O)</li><li>3 mg/ml chitosan in 150 mM NaCl:<ul><li>Add 48.5 ml dH2O to a 50ml conical tube</li><li>Add 1.5 ml 5M NaCl to the tube</li><li>Weigh 150 mg chitosan on a jeweler’s scale, and add to the tube</li><li>Cap the tube and shake well until the chitosan is dissolved</li><li>Dilute to desired working concentration. To make 10 ml working concentration of 1.2 mg/ml chitosan in 60 mM NaCl, add 4 ml stock solution to 6 ml dH2O</li></ul></li><li>1.0 to 1.5 mg/ml peptide solution(s). Mix peptides into dH2O&nbsp;</li><li>10 mg/ml Na<sub>5</sub>P<sub>3</sub>O<sub>10</sub>&nbsp;(sodium triphosphate, a.k.a. tripolyphosphate, TPP) in 100 mM NaCl</li></ul>



<p><strong>Working solutions</strong></p>



<ul><li>1.2 mg/ml chitosan in 60 mM NaCl</li><li>1.0 to 1.5 mg/ml peptide solution(s)</li><li>1 mg/ml TPP in 10 mM NaCl</li></ul>



<p><strong>Mixing the vaccine – sample protocol to make about 25 doses of vaccine (about 12 doses plus priming waste)</strong></p>



<ol><li>Heat the working solutions to 50 to 60 deg C (15 minutes for 50 ml conical tube; 10 minutes for 15 ml conical tube) to ensure they are virus free.</li><li>Sterilize the small beaker and stir bar by cleaning with soap and water, and then drying by wiping with an alcohol-soaked paper towel.&nbsp;</li><li>Place the beaker with the magnetic stir bar inside on a magnetic stir plate.&nbsp;</li><li>Add 7.2 ml chitosan working solution to the beaker.&nbsp; Turn on the stir plate and slowly increase the stir speed to at least 500 rpm.</li><li>Add peptide solutions up to 1.5 ml (total of 1500 to 2500 micrograms peptide). If adding less peptide solution, make up the volume in dH2O to bring the total to 1.5 ml.</li><li>Slowly add 1.3 ml TPP solution one drop at a time, and after the last drop is added continue to stir for at least 5 minutes.</li><li>Aliquot 800 microliters vaccine into sterile capped microfuge or 2 ml tubes. Each tube provides excess for priming the nasal sprayer, and about a 500 microliter dose.</li></ol>



<h2><strong>Administration of the vaccine</strong></h2>



<p>Two strategies have been used to achieve higher vaccine effectiveness (VE), especially in older people: high doses and multiple doses over time (a prime dose followed by booster doses). We have employed both of these strategies for increasing the likelihood of successful vaccination.</p>



<p><strong>Dosage amount.</strong>&nbsp;Human studies have successfully used as little as 7.5 micrograms inactivated virus or other replication incompetent antigen. The intranasal inactivated influenza vaccine trial in healthy human adults conducted by Illum and colleagues used 7.5 micrograms and 15 micrograms per dose, with greater than double vaccine effectiveness  at the higher dose. We have used 50 micrograms to 100 micrograms total peptide for the initial priming and boost doses. Typical doses have been in the range of 70 micrograms. As of mid July, 2020, over twenty self-experimenters have shown good tolerance for this dose.</p>



<p><strong>Booster schedule.</strong>&nbsp;The vaccine should be used 3 times, minimum (as shown by animal studies and human clinical trial data): a priming dose, and administration of 2 booster doses. Booster doses have been taken as soon as a few days after the prior dose, or as long as a few weeks. Ideally, doses are spaced by about weeks. As of mid-July, 2020, members of the Boston RaDVaC  group have taken as few as 3 and as many as 8 doses of progressive generations of vaccine. Groups in other locations have taken between 3 and 4 doses each. Given that this is rapidly evolving research, these numbers are subject to frequent change.</p>



<p><strong>Pre-administration.</strong>&nbsp;To assess immunity, it is ideal to obtain saliva, nasal wash or swab, and blood draws prior to vaccination. Of these, blood draw is most difficult, and possibly least important, although it is easier to compare results to known standards.</p>



<p><strong>Administration.</strong>&nbsp;Vaccination is achieved by nasal administration with the use of a small (5ml to 20ml) commercial nasal sprayer. Depression of the sprayer top of our bottle delivers approximately 100ul of fine mist. This should be tested empirically by spraying into a small tube or beaker, and measuring by pipette. Dose is adjusted accordingly. Spray should be directed into each nostril. The sprayers we obtained come as a top sprayer unit, and either opaque white plastic or clear bottle. The sprayer unit stem stretches to the bottom of the bottle. The delivered total volumes of vaccine should be in the range of 200 to 500 microliters, which is too small to be delivered reliably using the bottle. Therefore, we do not use the bottle for vaccination, and instead place the sprayer stem directly into the smaller vaccine vial. The stem of our sprayer unit is slightly longer than a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube. We pipette an aliquot of vaccine into the tube, then place the stem of the sprayer into the vaccine for spray administration.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Protocol for vaccine administration</strong></p>



<p>To administer vaccine, it is ideal to wear gloves and have a spray bottle of 70% alcohol (ethanol or isopropanol) to sterilize your gloved hands, vials, and equipment. Select a well lit work surface that can be sterilized with alcohol.</p>



<p>Required materials:</p>



<ul><li>Clean and well lit work surface</li><li>Gloves (nitrile, latex, etc)</li><li>70% alcohol (ethanol or isopropanol), preferably in a spray bottle</li><li>Small (5ml to 20ml) commercial nasal sprayer bottle</li><li>Vial of vaccine containing 1 dose plus extra for priming the sprayer (total,&nbsp; 800 microliter)</li><li>Clean and preferably sterile paper towels or tissues</li><li>OPTIONAL: saline wash solution and collection tube(s)</li><li>OPTIONAL: rack or holder for vaccine vial</li></ul>



<ol><li>Sterilize the work surface with alcohol. Place a paper towel or tissue on the clean work surface, and spray with alcohol. You can place items on the surface and use the towel or tissue to dab or wipe items (e.g. the sprayer stem) while maintaining sterility.</li><li>Wipe the vaccine vial with an alcohol wipe. Loosen the cap so that it can be removed by lifting it off, but leave the cap in place, and set the vial upright on the work surface. If you choose to use a tube holder or rack for the vial, make sure it is sterilized.</li><li>Blow your nose thoroughly with a tissue or paper towel to clear your nasal passages. Use an alcohol soaked wipe or tissue to clean the outer area of the nose and just inside each nostril. This will help prevent inadvertent contamination of the sprayer tip with infectious virus that might be present on or just inside the nose. We do not recommend cleaning deep into the nasal passage; this is likely to do more harm than good.</li><li>Sterilize your spray bottle by placing 2 to 4 ml of 70% alcohol into the spray bottle, screw on the cap, and deploy the sprayer until a fine mist is sprayed.</li><li>Remove the spray top, and spray the residual alcohol. While you are doing this&nbsp;<strong>DO NOT TOUCH THE SPRAYER TIP OR STEM</strong>&nbsp;to maintain sterility. After sterilization or the following optional nasal wash, do not return the spray top to the bottle prior to using the vaccine.</li><li><strong>OPTIONAL</strong>. You can use the sterilized spray top apparatus at this point to spray 100 mM NaCl into nostrils for collection of nasal wash samples. Spray saline into nostrils, inhale slightly, and then evacuate nasal wash into a collection tube. Collect at least 500 microliters.</li><li>While holding the spray top in one hand, uncap the vaccine vial with the other hand, and place the clean and sterile stem of the sprayer directly into the vaccine vial so that the stem touches the bottom of the vial.&nbsp;</li><li>Grasp the vaccine vial with one hand, and the spray top with the other hand so that your index finger and middle finger are on the side handles of the sprayer.&nbsp;</li><li>Deploy the sprayer until you see a fine mist. Spray once more to clear residual alcohol and/or saline from the sprayer.</li><li>Insert the spray tip into a nostril. While inhaling through the nose, depress the sprayer (ideally, a total of about 100 microliters per spray). Sniff in the vaccine. Repeat the dosing, for a total of 200 microliters into each nostril. The entire procedure can take seconds or minutes but don’t let the vaccine drip out of the nose, and don’t blow your nose for at least an hour.</li></ol>

Autopsy continues to capture and analyse failure data to provide an insight into the reasons why companies fail and what key data and lessons derived from their failure can be useful for future startups and other stakeholders in the space such as Venture Capitalists.</p><p><strong>Data analysis on 300 failed tech startups:</strong></p><p>Autopsy ran an analysis on 300 failed startups to understand what are the common reasons for failure. After a deep dive of reading and analysis into each submitted story on Autopsy, we’ve gathered the top 10 reasons for failure. For the sake of this article, we will be focusing on the top 5 reasons for failure with relevant examples from our Autopsy submissions.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1548757075982_68925"><div><p><strong>#1 Not The Right Team:<br></strong>Up to 20% of autopsies stressed the reason for their failure was due to having a poor team/not the right team. Having a diverse team with the relevant skills is of utmost importance as stated by majority of founders of failed startups. CEO and Co-founder of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.instigatorblog.com/postmortem-analysis-of-standout-jobs/2010/10/05/" target="_blank"><span>Standout Jobs</span></a>&nbsp;a B2B recruiting portal, Ben Yoskovitz, which went on to raise a Series A round of $1.8m, and closed after three years in existence. Stated in his autopsy&nbsp;<em>‘we raised too much money too early with the wrong team. Our founding team couldn’t build an MVP on its own’</em>&nbsp;he continued on to say&nbsp;<em>‘if the founding team can’t put out product on its own (or with a small amount of external help from freelancers) they shouldn’t be founding a startup. We could have brought on additional co-founders, who would have been compensated primarily with equity versus cash, but we didn’t.’</em></p><p>On the flip side, Founder of venture backed failed mobile app startup Sonar, Brett Martin, claimed he had a strong team with the relevant skills and heightened the importance of a culture that would enforce a good and harmonised team. In his post-mortem he stresses that a startup working culture mirrors that of its founder&nbsp;<em>‘maybe the best thing that you can do is work hard to get clear on who you are. Write that down and share it with your team. If you’ve been honest, every action you take will reinforce your values.’</em></p><p><strong>#2 Wrong Business Model:<br></strong>Building a product without a clear business model was the case for 18.7% of failed startups. The core purpose of a business model which outlines exactly how the company is to make money through which revenue channels and a pricing model to compliment the business and it’s customers tends to be a challenge faced by most startups. Cart, a US based startup that tried to create a model through which grocery stores can buy into a programme that reduces transportation barriers to their stores, realised early on that they were faced with a business that had an unsustainable business model.</p><p><em>‘We were able to test 8 key hypothesis to see if our technology, the market segmentation, and economic model could become a sustainable business which could improve long-term food access for Detroiters. After analysing the pilot data, talking to a variety of stakeholders about our findings, and ongoing customer discovery, we came to the conclusion that our current model is not economically viable. We contemplated a series of pivots, but have come to the conclusion that these are also not economically viable.’</em></p><p>Some cases of startups having had a clear business model but with one revenue channel proved to also be categorised under the poor business model failure category as this inability to explore multiple revenue channels seems unscalable to investors thus affected some startups follow on funding.</p><p><strong>#3 Product Not a Hit:<br></strong>Nearly 14% of autopsies claimed the implementation of a poor product was the cause of failure.</p><p>Through our analysis, we discovered London based startup, Karhoo, a taxi comparison app which closed 6 months after launch despite reportedly raising $250m. Karhoo lost a significant amount of money due to having a very poor product.</p><p>Considering how capital intensive the transport services industry is, the company was looking for more investors and executed a campaign to entice people to use the service and show potential investors that the app was indeed widely used. As a promotional tool, they offered free rides to passengers. The problem was that app codes never seemed to expire and people would use £100 worth in free rides. There were also bugs within the app that sometimes prevented the app from accepting credit cards payments.</p><p>According to some staff members, they stated that they should have seen the warning signs earlier-&nbsp;<em>“When you look back, there were chinks in the armour. Thousands of pounds worth of promotional codes given to customers every week is lunacy. There was a lot of vanity here.”</em></p><p>Despite their reported amount of funding, Karhoo faced poor product execution and the app only had 50,000–100,000 downloads and was ranked number 86 in transport apps in the UK.</p><p><strong>#4 No market Need:<br></strong>Another common case for failure is no market need which equates to 11% of autopsies. Startup founders which expressed this as the cause of failure, admittedly stated that they fail if they are not tackling a problem that serves a large enough market need.</p><p>Moped, a Berlin based free messaging app startup claimed it was going after the ‘sweet spot’ of sharing files over messaging. After having raised $1m and continuous efforts to target more users, it failed to attract a large enough of pool of users and lost a high number of its initial user base. The app’s popularity and the number of users saw a steady decrease over the startup’s lifetime. The inability to achieve user retention and customer acquisition led to inefficiency in the product and detracting further investment from investors. The Moped app was shut down on December 31st 2013 and its messaging app technology was acquired by Berlin-based company 6Wunderkinder, founders of Wunderlist.</p><p>The app was claimed to be somewhat ahead of its time solving a problem that served a very small proportion of users.</p><p><strong>#5 Outcompeted:<br></strong>9.13% of failures on Autopsy stated the emergence of competition being the main cause of death. Throughout our analysis of submitted autopsies, we came across multiple on-demand food delivery companies which predominantly launched in 2013 and closed in 2016. The year 2016, being at the height of failure for most on-demand food delivery companies saw the failure of&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@adrienroose/from-0-to-1-000-000-to-ecb4e2f863c7" target="_blank"><span>Take Eat Easy</span></a>. An on-demand food delivery service covering Belgium, UK and France, had closed €16.4m in its last Series B round claimed it&nbsp;<em>faltered under fierce competition&nbsp;</em>from the likes of Deliveroo and Ubereats as the cause of its death in July 2016.</p><p>Burning through its Series B round quickly, Take Eat Easy searched for Series C investors. However, due to the competitive market, the company failed to find investors after being turned down by 114 VCs.&nbsp;<em>‘We haven’t been able to raise additional capital to fuel the company until break-even,’</em>&nbsp;wrote Take Eat Easy CEO and cofounder Adrien Roose&nbsp;. “<em>We’ve started working on our Series C in October 2015. We knew we had to gear up as one of our own investors [Rocket Internet] acquired and invested aggressively in a direct competitor, now Foodora, and Deliveroo had just raised a massive round of funding. Unfortunately for us, they raised and announced an even bigger round a couple of weeks later. That didn’t help.”</em></p><p><strong>To gain more insight into why startups fail and key lessons learnt, sign up to Autopsy here:&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://bit.ly/2sQHUoZ" target="_blank"><span><strong>Autopsy Subscriber List</strong></span></a></p><p><strong>If you have had a past failed startup, we would love to hear from, please submit your Autopsy here:&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://bit.ly/2TqJhpW" target="_blank"><span><strong>Submit an Autopsy</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></a></p></div></div></div>]]>

Along this journey, the nature of the techniques used has shifted from fixed-pipeline algorithms based mostly in heuristics and little data to resource-intensive general-purpose models that require both heavy computing power and a lot of data. This shift, while unlocking new capabilities, presents some drawbacks.</p><p>Most of the work done at the research level is fragmented because researchers, by the very nature of good research, need to focus on one aspect at a time when planning their experiments. And while there are papers on unifying techniques, the difficulty to evaluate, and the requirements on what a novel contribution is being so stringent, these are few and apart. Most of these works come from non-academic initiatives such as <a href="http://fast.ai/">fast.ai</a>.</p><p>The objective of research is to present and validate a novel approach to a problem. Being that their end goal, the focus is on results and the published paper, not on the code used to run those experiments. Even when code is made publicly available, more often than not, it tends to be hard to extend, optimize, or integrate with other pieces of code.</p><p>Commercially available APIs may solve this issue since they are usually easy to use and integrate. However, they come with another set of problems.</p><p>First and foremost, code is not auditable. Since they are commercial solutions, code is not open source, so you cannot be certain what the code is doing. You may trust the company you are working with, but that may not be enough for other stakeholders. Plus, it is always nice to be able to check what is being done. Also, since they are usually cloud solutions, you have to share your data with them. This is a no-go for some companies, since the data may be somewhat sensitive.</p><p>There are some great services by some big-name companies, which may work fine for some set of problems. Nevertheless, their "best" models remain behind closed door. In addition to this, the technique that it is used may be unknown. While you can easily use Amazon Rekognition or Google Vision AI, you can't know what's under the hood. This may be fine for some scenarios, but for other cases you may need to have a sense of in which cases the solution fails, or which biases it has.</p><p>We believe that there's a place for an open-source initiative focusing on addressing the above
points.</p><p>That's where <a href="https://terran-project.com/">Terran</a> comes in.</p><p><img src="https://pento.ai/images/blog/terran-faces.png" alt="Terran Face Detection"></p><p>An example of Face Detection made with Terran</p><p>An open-source human perception library. We focus on providing open, auditable, and performant alternatives to closed approaches. Solutions that can run on your computer or device and that will adapt to the environment that it's in. But most importantly, code that you can test (without piling-up costs), understand and modify to your needs.</p><p>We strive for code that is easy to integrate and understand. While it is open-source, it is not specifically targeted for researchers. We want to make computer vision accessible to anyone who can code, and enable them to create innovative applications. To achieve this, Terran was built with these guiding principles in mind:</p><ul><li>A self-explanatory API that tells you what you are doing.</li><li>No intricate configuration files.</li><li>Simplest I/O operations for any kind of videos and images.</li></ul><p>The focus is on being a production-grade library, not a toy project. Only models whose performance can be assessed and with reasonable (and knowable) computational and memory requirements will be included.</p><p><img src="https://pento.ai/images/blog/terran-poses.png" alt="Terran Pose Estimation"></p><p>An example of Pose Estimation using Terran</p><p>Let's see a small example of what we can build with it.</p><p>We could do our own image album creator grouping photos of the same people. That's a use case that all cloud providers (such as Google Photos and Apple Photos) do. For the sake of keeping it simple and focusing on Terran, lets do the core of this problem: finding on which photos someone is present.</p><p>We will start with some imports:</p><pre><pre><code>import click

from pathlib import Path
from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine

from terran.face import extract_features, face_detection
from terran.io import open_image, resolve_images
from terran.vis import display_image, vis_faces
</code></pre></pre><p>We will use <code>click</code> to create a small CLI tool (we love click — highly recommended). We will use <code>pathlib</code> to handle paths and a measure of distance from <code>scipy</code>. Finally, we import some functions from Terran's modules: from face, core functions to detect faces and extract features; from io, utility functions to resolve paths and open images; from vis, some visualization functions (extremely important and useful when working with images!).</p><ol><li>from <code>terran.face</code>, we import core functions to detect and extract features from faces</li><li>from <code>terran.io</code>, utility functions to resolve paths and open images</li><li>and finally, from <code>terran.vis</code>, we import some visualization functions that are extremely important and useful when working with images!</li></ol><p>Now we will create a function that deals with the problem of finding the photos where a person is present. You'll see how easy it is with Terran!</p><pre><pre><code>@click.command(name='match-dir')
@click.argument('reference')
@click.argument('image-dir')
@click.option('--batch-size', type=int, default=1)
@click.option('--threshold', type=float, default=0.5)
@click.option('--display', is_flag=True, default=False)
def match_directory(reference, image_dir, batch_size, threshold, display):

    reference = open_image(reference)
    faces_in_reference = face_detection(reference)

    if len(faces_in_reference) != 1:
        click.echo('Reference image must have exactly one face.')
        return

    ref_feature = extract_features(reference, faces_in_reference[0])
</code></pre></pre><p>Our function takes in two arguments: a reference image and a directory where we should scan the photos. Then, our first step is to get a set of features out of our reference image that represents the person we are looking for.</p><p>Then, we get the paths to all of the images that we will be scanning:</p><pre><pre><code>    paths = resolve_images(
        Path(image_dir).expanduser(),
        batch_size=batch_size
    )
</code></pre></pre><p>This Terran function gives paths in batches, so you can process them in parallel (if needed).</p><p>So the only thing remaining to do is, for each image, open it, detect the faces, get the features, and compare it with our reference image. Easy enough with Terran!</p><pre><pre><code>    for batch_paths in paths:
        # Open them
        batch_images = list(map(open_image, batch_paths))

        # Detect the faces
        faces_per_image = face_detection(batch_images)

        # Get the features
        features_per_image = extract_features(batch_images, faces_per_image)

        for path, image, faces, features in zip(
            batch_paths, batch_images, faces_per_image, features_per_image
        ):
            for face, feature in zip(faces, features):
                # Compare each feature with our reference feature
                confidence = cosine(ref_feature, feature)

                # If it is a match print it / display it!
                if confidence &lt; threshold:
                    click.echo(f'{path}, confidence = {confidence:.2f}')
                    if display:
                        display_image(vis_faces(image, face))
</code></pre></pre><p>All the code together:</p><pre><pre><code>import click

from pathlib import Path
from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine

from terran.face import extract_features, face_detection
from terran.io import open_image, resolve_images
from terran.vis import display_image, vis_faces

                        display_image(vis_faces(image, face))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    match_directory()
</code></pre></pre><p>With just a few lines of code, you can easily check in which images you are present! From your computer, not needing to upload them anywhere, and tweaking the parameters to fit your case (take a look at threshold). You can also take a look at this example in our <a href="https://github.com/pento-group/terran/blob/master/examples/match.py">Github</a>, and to the rest of Terran and see how it works.</p><p>Right now, Terran has models for Face Detection, Face Recognition, and Pose Estimation. We think that several applications can be created using these features, like controlling your computer with body gestures or changing what gets displayed depending on the presence of a face or not. You can use Terran as an interface to interact to your computer with your body, among several other ideas that one could think of.</p><p>In the future, we plan to:</p><ul><li>Add more models for these same problems, but that are more lightweight, in case you need it to run on a small device.</li><li>Add other models to tackle other problems, e.g. segmentation.</li><li>Add the functionality to train or fine-tune the existing models.</li></ul><p>While this is our current roadmap, feel free to create an issue on github to tell us if you'd like us to work on …</p></article></main></div></div></div></div>

              <p>OK, let’s be fair. The second half of AI does stand for <em>Intelligence</em>, but not the kind you might be thinking about. The I in <em>Intelligence</em> refers to our own, human way of reasoning because the A stands for <em>Augmented</em>. That’s right. If you have been calling it <em>Artificial Intelligence</em> all this time, I propose to pause for a second and consider the term <em>Augmented Intelligence</em>.</p><p>Much of the physical Universe is discrete. Objects are created by a finite number of atoms. Text is a sequence of a finite set of words. Images consist of a finite number of dots each representing one of a finite set of colors. Do you know who is good at working with the discrete world? That’s right, computers.</p><p>I see people marveling at <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/20/1005454/openai-machine-learning-language-generator-gpt-3-nlp/">GPT-3 </a>the same way they did marvel at the myriad of photo style transfer experiments a few years ago. While those examples are by all means outstanding achievements, none would pass a true Intelligence test.</p><p>Specifically, the case of GPT-3 is a well-known application of something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem">Infinite Monkey Theorem</a> (IMT). IMT stipulates that a monkey hitting random keys of a typewriter for an infinite (or very long) amount of time, will eventually produce coherent human text. Like, the works of Shakespeare, for instance. While improbable in a human lifespan, IMT makes sense from a theoretical standpoint. Producing a 500-character piece of readable text is only a matter of hitting 30^500, or ...</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>

And while hitting the keys, we can "tell" the machine to observe the frequency of certain characters appearing next to each other. Then, to certain character pairs co-occurring in the same word. Then, to certain words frequently appearing in the same sentence. Suddenly, what was once a tedious brute-force random hit-and-miss process, turned into a tamed version of the same. The machine would still rely on a random factor, but a much smaller one, thanks to all the stats collected in the first phase. One might think of it as shaving all the zeroes down from the umber above - a more down-to-Earth number for a machine to crunch.</p><p>This is in essence how GPT-3, or for that matter, all of what you call AI works. By all means, a very complex process, but one void of magic there or signs of thought emergence. It's a strictly definite and discrete problem, and the machines of today seem to be doing a good job of solving it.</p><h2 id="ai-is-a-mirror-and-a-prism-of-human-subjectivity">AI Is a Mirror and a Prism of Human Subjectivity</h2><p>Here comes the tricky bit. If a machine can crack Shakespeare, it could probably generate other pieces of text, many of which equally groundbreaking. Ones, that the human mind has not produced so far. Right?</p><p>Yes and no. A machine may babble coherent text (or any other form of content) out <em>ad infinitum. </em>Yet it has no way of understanding whether the output is good or bad. Five machines will look at a certain piece of content and come up with the same answer of whether it matches what they were initially fed with. In contrast, five people will look at the same and come up five different answers. Get those five people to do the same over time and chances are, their answers will also change over time.</p><p>To be human is to be different, to be subjective. The machine has no concept of subjectivity or a personal bias. Those can only come from the true reasoning of the human mind. This is the reason the machine learning algorithms in production today are biased towards one aspect of society or another. A human fed them with biased inputs containing one's subjectivity. Feed them with someone else's subjective inputs, and they will start acting correspondingly.</p><h2 id="towards-augmented-intelligence">Towards Augmented Intelligence</h2><p>The fact that I tried to diminish the impact that AI is having on society shouldn't stop us from trying to improve it. We should do this however, with the right idea of what AI can do to <em>augment</em> the human intelligence, not that it will one day replace us altogether.</p><p>Augmented Reality (AR) is not trying to replace reality, but make it more interactive and accessible. Similarly, AI won't replace the human brain, but can help it focus on the bigger picture. Take the example of GPT-3 again. We can let AI produce text, but someone has to give the AI the initial spark of what to produce. Afterwards that same one has to comprehend the produced content and apply a subjective judgment, of whether it is good or bad. That same one may tweak the output and feed the algorithm with it, achieving a version of the original output that is even more to the liking of the human being. If another human goes through the same process, the result will be different.</p><h2 id="the-curse-of-ai">The Curse of AI</h2><p>This is the sweet spot of AI - using it to express human uniqueness in new ways. This is also its biggest threat to humanity. Not because intelligence may suddenly emerge and annihilate us all. Rather, because AI is a mirror that one may not always know one is looking at. Similar to an animal looking at a physical mirror, one may look at the outputs of an AI algorithm and think those are real, simply, because the mirror was shaped with the certain individual's implicit inputs.</p><p>By our mere interaction with the world, we leave implicit traces. A smart individual can use those to create filter bubbles we may never get out of. As I am writing this, millions of individuals are receiving their daily portion of algorithmically cooked up filter bubble. Who knows, maybe this isn't a text written by a human, but only commissioned by a human, targeting a group of sceptics and conspiracy theorists. Who knows. The point remains valid though - AI won't do us harm alone. It's the humans behind, whose intentions might. Thus, combating the dark side of AI isn't about fighting an invisible enemy, but a real one, flesh and blood. One with fears and biases.</p><p>AI is an augmentation of our strengths, but also, of our biases and fears. It can be our biggest friend, or our biggest foe. It's up to us to get to know it better and use it for the right cause. First and foremost, we need to agree on what to call it, though.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
              <p>In this article, we will discuss the step-by-step process of implementing the OAuth Authorization Code Grant in a Vue.js app. We’ll use FusionAuth as the IdP and also show you how to configure FusionAuth.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>At the end, your app will be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Log users in</li>
  <li>Log users out</li>
  <li>Read user data from FusionAuth</li>
  <li>Write user data to FusionAuth</li>
</ul>

<p>We will use Express for our backend server, which will act as a middleware between our Vue client and FusionAuth. It will securely store the access token, client id, client secret, and other information.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Knowledge of Vue and Express concepts.</li>
  <li>Docker (optional, but preferred for installing FusionAuth).</li>
  <li>Node(12.x)/NPM on your local machine.</li>
  <li>Any code editor of your choice.</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll also want to make sure your system meets the <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/system-requirements">memory, storage and CPU requirements</a> for FusionAuth.</p>

<p>If you get stuck at any time, feel free to refer to the finished app’s <a href="https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-example-vue">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-fusionauth-with-docker-compose">Setting up FusionAuth with Docker Compose</h2>

<p>If you don’t already have FusionAuth installed, we recommend the Docker Compose option for the quickest setup:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-o</span> docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/docker-compose.yml
curl <span>-o</span> .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/.env
docker-compose up
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://fusionauth.io/download">FusionAuth download page</a> for other installation options (rpm, deb, etc) if you don’t have Docker installed. You can also follow the <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/fusionauth-app">FusionAuth Installation Guide</a> for more detailed steps.</p>

<p>Once FusionAuth is running (the default address is http://localhost:9011/), create a new application. This tutorial uses an application named <code>fusionauth-vue-example</code>.</p>

<p>Then, configure your application. There are only two configuration settings that you need to change for this tutorial. In your application’s <strong>OAuth</strong> tab:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set <code>Authorized redirect URLs</code> to <code>http://localhost:9000/oauth-callback</code>. This is the Express server URL that will handle processing the FusionAuth callback after a user signs in.</li>
  <li>Set <code>Logout URL</code> to  <code>http://localhost:8081</code>. This is the URL where the FusionAuth server will redirect us after logout. It is also where the Vue app lives. After logout a user ends up on the main landing page of the application.</li>
</ul>

<p>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/oauth-vuejs/application-configuration.png" alt="OAuth settings for the new application."></p>

<p>Next, add our current user to the new application. Select <strong>Users</strong> on the dashboard, select <strong>Manage</strong> and go to the <strong>Registration</strong> tab. Then click <code>Add Registration</code>, and add yourself to the application you just created.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/oauth-vuejs/user-configuration.png" alt="User settings for the new application."></p>

<p>Finally, navigate to <strong>Settings</strong> and then <strong>API Keys</strong>. You should have an API key present, but feel free to create one. For this tutorial, we won’t limit permissions, but you should for production deployments. Record the API key value for later.</p>

<p>We won’t cover this today, but you can create multiple applications and configure multi-tenancy in FusionAuth. This would be useful if you had multiple applications and wanted all their user data to be stored in FusionAuth.</p>

<p>Now you’re done configuring FusionAuth. We can start working on our initial Vue app.</p>

<h2 id="project-structure">Project structure</h2>

<p>Here is what this project directory looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>fusionauth-example-vue
├─client
└─server
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All the Express or server-side code will be in the <code>server</code> folder, and our Vue app will reside in the <code>client</code> folder. You don’t need to create the folders right now; we will be doing so in the next steps.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-vue-app">Creating the Vue app</h2>

<p>We will use the official Vue CLI to initialize our project. This is the best way to scaffold Single Page Applications (SPAs). It provides batteries-included build setups for a modern front-end workflow. It takes only a few minutes to get up and running with hot-reload, lint-on-save, and production-ready builds. You can read more about <a href="https://vuejs.org/">the Vue CLI here</a>.</p>

<p>Before we create our Vue app, I recommend installing the official Vue.js browser extension to make debugging and inspection easier. You can <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools">download it here</a>.</p>

<p>Use the following command to install Vue CLI globally:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>npm <span>install</span> <span>-g</span> @vue/cli
<span># OR</span>
<span>$ </span>yarn global add @vue/cli
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, create a project by running the following command inside the project directory:</p>



<p>You will be prompted to pick a preset. You can choose the <strong>default preset</strong> which comes with a basic <strong>Babel + ESLint</strong> setup or a manual option, by choosing <strong>Manually select features</strong>. The latter will allow you to customize features according to your needs. This project will use the default preset. You can <a href="https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html">learn more about it here</a>.</p>

<p>Once the project is initialized, start the development server by running the following command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cd </span>client
<span>$ </span>npm run serve <span>--</span> <span>--port</span> 8081
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Open a browser up and look at http://localhost:8081/. This is how your app will look:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/oauth-vuejs/default-vue-application.png" alt="The default Vue application screen."></p>

<h2 id="remove-the-sample-code">Remove the sample code</h2>

<p>Now you need to clean up and remove some of the sample code that the CLI generated.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Based on the configuration you choose, you might see different project structures. If you are not sure how to clean it up, just stick to this example.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Delete <code>components</code>, <code>views</code>, <code>router</code>, and  <code>assets</code> folders in <code>src</code> and then modify your <code>main.js</code> file to look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>Vue</span> <span>from</span> <span>'</span><span>vue</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>App</span> <span>from</span> <span>'</span><span>./App.vue</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>

<span>Vue</span><span>.</span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>productionTip</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>

<span>new</span> <span>Vue</span><span>({</span>
  <span>render</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>h</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>h</span><span>(</span><span>App</span><span>),</span>
<span>}).</span><span>$mount</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>#app</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, modify your <code>App.vue</code> file to look like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>template</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;div</span> <span>id=</span><span>'app'</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>template</span><span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>app</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>components</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>},</span>
<span>};</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;</span><span>style</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>style</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Visiting http://localhost:8081/ will show you a blank screen now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>FUN FACT: You can load environment variables in most SPA templates like Vue or React without installing any extra dependencies. A minor difference for Vue is that you must add <code>VUE_APP_</code> in front of every environment variable. You can read more about this in the <a href="https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/mode-and-env.html#environment-variables">Modes and Environment Variables</a> Vue documentation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s set aside the client for a bit, and focus on the Express server</p>

<h2 id="using-express-as-our-backend-server">Using Express as our backend server</h2>

<p>We will use <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a> as our backend server. It is a popular library that is widely used by developers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>FUN FACT: The letter <strong>E</strong> in stacks like <strong>MERN</strong>, <strong>MEVN</strong>, or <strong>MEAN</strong> stands for Express.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Inside our root directory, we will create another folder named <code>server</code> and initialize a NodeJS application in it. Run the following command in your root application directory:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>mkdir </span>server
<span>$ </span><span>cd </span>server
<span>$ </span>npm init <span>-y</span>
<span>$ </span>npm <span>install </span>express cors morgan nodemon dotenv axios express-session query-string
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We installed a lot of packages, so let’s look at them:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors">cors</a> - This is a middleware that helps us to make cross-origin requests.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan">morgan</a> - This is an HTTP request logger middleware for node.js, you can use this for production.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon">nodemon</a> - Restarting server every time we make a change is a hassle. Nodemon automatically restarts the node application when file changes are detected.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv">dotenv</a> - This loads environment variables from an <code>.env</code> file. We will use this to secure our API key and client configuration.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios">axios</a> - This allows us to make HTTP requests.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session">express-session</a> - This stores our access token securely.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/query-string">query-string</a> - This is used to stringify form data that we send using <code>axios</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since we have installed <code>nodemon</code>, to use it inside <code>package.json</code> simply add the following scripts:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//...</span>
<span>"</span><span>scripts</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>"</span><span>start</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>node index.js</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>dev</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>nodemon index.js</span><span>"</span>
<span>},</span>
<span>//...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, set up your environment variables. Inside the <code>server</code> folder create a <code>.env</code> file and store your configuration, such as client information, ports, or API credentials in it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>SERVER_PORT <span>=</span> 9000
FUSIONAUTH_PORT <span>=</span> 9011
CLIENT_ID <span>=</span> <span>'c8642b18-5d1d-42b4-89fb-a37a5b750186'</span>
CLIENT_SECRET <span>=</span> <span>'oo06PflPxQrpfxqP8gY9ioOmfzQxARIW5R3BjJrlbS4'</span>
REDIRECT_URI <span>=</span> <span>'http://localhost:9000/oauth-callback'</span>
APPLICATION_ID <span>=</span> <span>'c8642b18-5d1d-42b4-89fb-a37a5b750186'</span>
API_KEY <span>=</span> <span>'Dy9bphElA3L3_ayW86T5KvrZkyK1Gj5EDV_2m9i39ow'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You might notice that every environment variable is in CAPITAL LETTERS. It’s not a rule, just a convention to separate environment variables from variables in code.</p>

<p><code>REDIRECT_URI</code> is the same as the URL you configured in the FusionAuth <code>Authorized redirect URLs</code> field. <code>APPLICATION_ID</code> is the same as the <code>CLIENT_ID</code>. You can change <code>SERVER_PORT</code> to whatever port you want; this tutorial will use port <strong>9000</strong> for the Express server. Use the API key you created above.</p>

<p>Now, you may wonder where to get all this information for your <code>.env</code> file. Go to the application that you made earlier in the FusionAuth dashboard and click the <code>View</code> button. It is the green magnifying glass. You can copy/paste <code>CLIENT_ID</code> and <code>CLIENT_SECRET</code> from there:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/oauth-vuejs/oauth-configuration.png" alt="Client Id and Client Secret settings for the application."></p>

<p>Below is the code for a basic Express server. Notice that we use the <code>dotenv</code> package by adding the following code inside our <code>index.js</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//...</span>
<span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>dotenv</span><span>"</span><span>).</span><span>config</span><span>();</span>
<span>//...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can then read environment variables by writing <code>process.env.</code> in front of the environment variable’s name whenever we need them in our code.</p>

<p>Since the <code>.env</code> file is ignored by git because of the <code>.gitignore</code> file, you will notice an <code>.env.example</code> file in the source code. To run on your local machine, rename that file to <code>.env</code> and add your Client Id, Client Secret, etc.</p>

<p>Here is the sample code for an Express server that makes use of all our installed packages:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>express</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>express</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
<span>const</span> <span>cors</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>cors</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
<span>const</span> <span>morgan</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>morgan</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>

<span>// dotenv</span>
<span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>dotenv</span><span>"</span><span>).</span><span>config</span><span>();</span>

<span>const</span> <span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>express</span><span>();</span>

<span>// Use our middlewares</span>
<span>app</span><span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span><span>cors</span><span>({</span> <span>origin</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>credentials</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span> <span>}));</span>
<span>app</span><span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span><span>morgan</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>common</span><span>"</span><span>));</span>
<span>app</span><span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span><span>express</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>());</span>

<span>// Provide a default port </span>
<span>const</span> <span>port</span> <span>=</span>  <span>process</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>.</span><span>SERVER_PORT</span> <span>||</span> <span>3000</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Listen to server  </span>
<span>app</span><span>.</span><span>listen</span><span>(</span><span>port</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`Listening on port </span><span>${</span><span>port</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>);</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To access our server from the browser, we need the <code>cors</code> middleware. Remember to use the options <code>{ origin: true, credentials: true }</code> with <code>app.use(cors())</code> call. You can read more about this <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">here</a>.</p>

<p>Run the following command, in a new terminal window, to start the development server:</p>



<p>This might be the only time we will start the server; since we have installed <code>nodemon</code>, the server will restart …</p></div></div>

<p>by Bill Atkinson, as told to Leo Laporte</p>
<p>In 1985 I swallowed a tiny fleck of gelatin containing a medium dose of LSD, and I spent most of the night sitting on a concrete park bench outside my home in Los Gatos, California.</p>

<p>I gazed up at a hundred billion galaxies each with a hundred billion stars, and each star a giant thermonuclear fusion reaction as powerful as our Sun. And for the first time in my life I knew deep down inside that we are not alone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I knew that life on planet Earth is not the only pocket of consciousness in the universe, and likely not the most advanced. But we still have a role to play in the unfolding drama of creation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It seemed to me the universe is in a process of coming alive. Consciousness is blossoming and propagating to colonize the universe, and life on Earth is one of many bright spots in the cosmic birth of consciousness.</p>

<p>But the stars are separated by enormous distances of darkness and vacuum, which may hinder communication between them. I lowered my gaze and saw the street lamps below glowing brightly, each casting a pool of light but surrounded by darkness before the next lamp. As above, so below.</p>

<p>The street lamps reminded me of bodies of knowledge, gems of discovery and understanding, but separated from each other by distance and different languages. Poets, artists, musicians, physicists, chemists, biologists, mathmeticians, and economists all have separate pools of knowledge, but are hindered from sharing and finding the deeper connections.</p>

<p>My vision distorted by thick eyeglasses, I witnessed the curvature of the Earth’s horizon, and I felt the pull of gravity toward its center, such that every one of us is standing at the very apex. Each of us stands at the top of planet Earth, and each of us is a leader or captain of the “Blue Marble” team.</p>

<p>How could I help? By focusing on the weak link. If I were captain of a soccer team, I would look for the weak link and work on it. If the goalie was letting too many through, I would spend extra practice time with him, and the whole team would prosper.</p>

<p>It occurred to me the weak link for the Blue Marble team is wisdom. Humanity has achieved sufficient technological power to change the course of life and the entire global ecosystem, but we seem to lack the perspective to choose wisely between alternative futures. But I was young, without much life experience or wisdom myself.</p>

<p>Knowledge, it seemed to me, consists of the “How” connections between pieces of information, the cause and effect relationships. How does this action bring about that result. Science is a systematic attempt to discover the “How” connections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wisdom, it seemed to me, was a step further removed, the bigger perspective of the “Why” connections between pieces of knowledge. Why, for reasons ethical and aesthetic, should we choose one future over another?</p>

<p>I thought if we could encourage sharing of ideas between different areas of knowledge, perhaps more of the bigger picture would emerge, and eventually more wisdom might develop. Sort of a trickle-up theory of information leading to knowledge leading to wisdom.</p>

<p>This was the underlying inspiration for HyperCard, a multimedia authoring environment that empowered non-programmers to share ideas using new interactive media called HyperCard stacks.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img data-attachment-id="2922" data-permalink="https://www.mondo2000.com/2018/06/18/the-inspiration-for-hypercard/mtiymzi2odgxmjywntyznzm3/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.mondo2000.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MTIyMzI2ODgxMjYwNTYzNzM3.jpg?fit=600%2C424&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="600,424" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="MTIyMzI2ODgxMjYwNTYzNzM3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.mondo2000.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MTIyMzI2ODgxMjYwNTYzNzM3.jpg?fit=300%2C212&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.mondo2000.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MTIyMzI2ODgxMjYwNTYzNzM3.jpg?fit=600%2C424&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.mondo2000.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MTIyMzI2ODgxMjYwNTYzNzM3.jpg?resize=600%2C424" alt="" width="600" height="424" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.mondo2000.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MTIyMzI2ODgxMjYwNTYzNzM3.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.mondo2000.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MTIyMzI2ODgxMjYwNTYzNzM3.jpg?resize=300%2C212&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.mondo2000.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MTIyMzI2ODgxMjYwNTYzNzM3.jpg?resize=210%2C148&amp;ssl=1 210w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>

<p>Each card in a HyperCard stack included graphics, text, interactive buttons, and links that took you to another card or stack. Built-in painting tools, drag-and-drop authoring with a library of pre-fab buttons and fields, and simple event based scripting made HyperCard flexible and easy to use.</p>

<p>It took a lot of hard work and a dedicated team to complete this mission. Apple shipped HyperCard in August 1987, and included it free with every Mac so any user could create and share HyperCard stacks. Many creative people expressed their ideas and passions, and several million interactive HyperCard stacks were created.&nbsp;</p>

<p>HyperCard was a precurser to the first web browser, except chained to a hard drive before the worldwide web. Six years later Mosaic was introduced, influenced by some of the ideas in HyperCard, and indirectly by an inspiring LSD experience.</p>

<p><em>Leo Laporte did a great interview with me in April 2016. You can <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/triangulation/episodes/247?autostart=false">watch it here</a>&nbsp;—&nbsp; with the part about hypercard inspiration starting at 22:43&nbsp;</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-layout-label="Post Body" data-type="item" data-updated-on="1596817511541" id="item-5f2d800ee99e336759aabd3c"><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-e8c1e43fbaf39c964f47"><div><p>11 years ago when I was doing my first ever tech project, which turned into my startup that self-taught me everything and started my tech career, I remember finding out about analytics tools and being blown away. “You mean you can find out exactly where users are dropping off, which features they use the most, and essentially gauge how happy they are with specific features?”</p><p>As I went on in my career, working at various startups as a UX Designer with Product Management duties, I was surprised to see how underutilized these analytics tools were. I thought “oh it’s because they’re just a scrappy startup”. They seemed like something every startup had installed, because they’re supposed to, but never actually used. When I started working as a Product Manager working with a Y Combinator team that had just been acquired into a bigger corporation, ‘scrappy startup’ was no longer an excuse in my mind as to why user analytics was under utilized. In this case I realized it’s because as one of a few Product Managers for a banking iPhone, Android, mobile web, and web app, there just wasn’t enough time to balance all the agile meetings and feature requests from c-level executives, developers, the marketing team, app store user feedback, and also make data based product decisions.</p><p>For the last 5 years I’ve been working with various Fortune 500 and startups, and I’ve also noticed that at best “yes, we track analytics and everything is installed, yes, we want to be data driven but no, we haven’t actually looked at our data in a way to guide product decisions”. Maybe I just haven’t come across a company that has the culture of being truly data driven, but otherwise I have some theories as to why user analytics data is underutilized in product decision making.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Not enough bandwidth for product managers to analyze and make sense of data</p></li><li><p>Analytics tracking gets out-dated with every new iteration and feature</p></li><li><p>Data doesn’t feel statistically significant</p></li><li><p>Too many questions on “how” to interpret the data</p></li></ul><p>As a part of UX consulting, I have been conducting usability tests, and have found that a simple Net Promoter Score survey on each user test is an easy way to gauge improvements upon each iteration of the clickable prototype or product shown in the user test. For example when there is a 2 point jump with every 5 user tests, the latest iteration, without a doubt, is much better.</p><p>So I came up with a hypothesis, what if products ran NPS surveys, within various sections of their product, and maybe even compared the NPS scores against each other. Since it’s one data point, there isn’t a need for much bandwidth for interpretation. Since NPS is a type of qualitative data, they don’t need much traffic for it to have statistical significance. Since it’s simple, “how” to interpret the data doesn’t become a point of argument.</p><p>I looked online and found some solutions that provide this functionality, but found them too complex in terms of user experience or pricing, or they lacked the capability to measure NPS scores contextually.</p><p>So I built a basic minimal viable product to test this hypothesis, Userglee.com for <a href="http://www.userglee.com/"><span>actionable Net Promoter Scores</span></a>. There is a lot I can add to it and a lot of directions I can take it, but currently looking for feedback on the bare-bones MVP to see if there is anything worth pursuing further.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

According to <a href="https://www.cato.org/publications/survey-reports/poll-62-americans-say-they-have-political-views-theyre-afraid-share">a recent poll by the Cato Institute</a>, a third of Americans say that they are personally worried about losing their jobs or missing out on career opportunities if they express their real political opinions. Americans in all walks of life have been publicly shamed, pressured into ritualistic apologies or summarily fired.</p><p>But critics of the critics of cancel culture make a powerful retort. Accusing others of canceling can, they claim, be a way to stigmatize legitimate criticism. As Hannah Giorgis <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/07/harpers-letter-free-speech/614080/">writes in the </a><em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/07/harpers-letter-free-speech/614080/">Atlantic</a></em>, “critical tweets are not censorship.”</p><p>So what, exactly, does a cancellation consist of? And how does it differ from the exercise of free speech and robust critical debate? </p><p>At a conceptual level, the difference is clear. Criticism marshals evidence and arguments in a rational effort to persuade. Canceling, by contrast, seeks to organize and manipulate the social or media environment in order to isolate, deplatform or intimidate ideological opponents. It is about shaping the information battlefield, not seeking truth; and its intent—or at least its predictable outcome—is to coerce conformity and reduce the scope for forms of criticism that are not sanctioned by the prevailing consensus of some local majority.</p><p>In practice, however, telling canceling apart from criticism can be difficult because both take the <em>form</em> of criticizing others. That is why it is probably impossible to devise a simple bright-line test of what should count as a harmful instance of cancelation.</p><p>A better approach might therefore be diagnostic. Like the symptoms of cancer, the hallmarks of a cancellation are many. Though not all instances involve every single characteristic, they all involve <em>some </em>of its key attributes. Rather than issuing a single litmus test, the diagnostic approach allows us to draw up a checklist of warning signs. The more signs you see, the more certain you can be that you are looking at a cancel campaign.</p><p>Six warning signs make up my personal checklist for cancel culture. </p><p><strong>Punitiveness</strong></p><p><em>Are people denouncing you to your employer, your professional groups or your social connections? Are you being blacklisted from jobs and social opportunities? Does what is being said to or about you have the goal—or foreseeable effect—of jeopardizing your livelihood or isolating you socially?</em></p><p>A critical culture seeks to correct rather than punish. In science, the penalty for being wrong is not that you lose your job or your friends. Normally, the only penalty is that you lose the argument. Even the phenomenon of retracting papers is new and deservedly controversial, because the usual—and very effective—method has been for science to simply discard mistakes and move on. Wrong answers and bad science die on the vine and disappear. Incentives are mostly positive, not punitive: for being right, you win citations, promotions, fame and fancy prizes. Taking a punitive attitude toward mistakes undermines the scientific process because knowledge advances by trial and error.</p><p>Canceling, by contrast, seeks to punish rather than correct—and often for a single misstep rather than a long track record of failure. A professor <a href="https://spectator.us/academics-get-paper-retracted-some-havent-read-nathan-cofnas/">swears</a> to “ruin [a graduate student’s] reputation permanently and deservedly.” Campaigners against an art curator <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/gary-garrels-departure-sfmoma-1893964">declare</a> he “must be removed from his job, effective immediately.”</p><p>The point is to make the errant suffer. </p><p><strong>Deplatforming</strong></p><p><em>Are campaigners attempting to prevent you from publishing your work, giving speeches or attending meetings? Are they claiming that allowing you to be heard is violence against them or makes them unsafe?</em></p><p>A critical culture tolerates dissent rather than silencing it. It understands that dissent can seem obnoxious, harmful, hateful and, yes, <em>unsafe</em>. To minimize unnecessary damage, it goes to great lengths to encourage people to express themselves in a civil manner. But it also understands that, every so often, an obnoxious dissenter is right—and so it opposes silencing and deplatforming.</p><p>Canceling, by contrast, seeks to shut up and shout down its targets. Cancelers often define the mere act of disagreeing with them as a threat to their safety or even an act of violence. Staffers at the <em>New York Times </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/07/business/media/new-york-times-washington-post-protests.html">claimed</a> that the mere act of publishing a controversial op-ed piece endangered them. Staffers at the <em>New Yorker</em> demanded that Steve Bannon be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/opinion/bannon-new-yorker-festival-remnick.html">deplatformed</a>. Shout-downs, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjYkNS36ILrAhVUYDUKHWcADuIQFjAAegQIARAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thefire.org%2Fresearch%2Fdisinvitation-database%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ONE1G9KXx27R20K-ezA56">disinvitations</a> and demands for retractions and withdrawals are cancelers’ stock in trade.</p><p><strong>Organization</strong></p><p><em>Does criticism appear to be organized and targeted? Are the organizers recruiting others to pile on? Are you being swarmed and brigaded? Are people hunting through your work and scouring social media to find ammunition to use against you?</em></p><p>Critical culture relies on persuasion. The way to win an argument is to convince others that you are right. Often, of course, schools of thought form, and arguments between them can grow heated; but organizing pressure campaigns against political or ideological targets is usually considered out of bounds.</p><p>By contrast, it’s common to see cancelers organize hundreds of petition-signers or thousands of social media users to dig up and prosecute an indictment. Recently, for example, campaigners picked through the social media posts of the psychologist (and member of <em>Persuasion</em>’s Board of Advisers) Steven Pinker in the hope of digging up some kind of case against him. Though they only came up with <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2020/07/05/the-purity-posse-pursues-pinker/">trivial charges</a>, such as that he had twice used the terms “urban crime” and “urban violence,” they got hundreds of signatories to join a group denunciation.</p><p><strong>Secondary Boycotts</strong></p><p><em>Is there an explicit or implicit threat that people who support you will get the same punitive treatment that you are receiving? Are people putting pressure on employers and professional colleagues to fire you or stop associating with you? Do people who defend you, or criticize the campaign against you, have to fear adverse consequences?</em></p><p>With its commitments to exploring a wide range of ideas and correcting rather than coercing the errant, a critical culture sees no value in instilling a climate of fear. But instilling fear is what canceling is all about. By choosing targets unpredictably (almost anything can trigger a campaign), providing no safe harbors (even conformists can get hit), and implicitly threatening anyone who sides with those who are targeted, canceling sends the message: “you could be next.”</p><p>Thus, a canceled journalist was quickly dropped by his employer, his professional association and his publisher, becoming “<a href="https://reason.com/2019/08/23/im-radioactive/">radioactive</a>,” as he put it. (At last check, he was applying to law schools.) In the resulting climate, people will often join public denunciations or <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/stand-up-for-the-wrongly-accused-341">refrain from defending targets they believe to be innocent</a>, to avoid becoming controversial themselves.</p><p><strong>Moral Grandstanding</strong></p><p><em>Is the tone of the discourse ad hominem, repetitive, ritualistic, posturing, accusatory, outraged? Are people flattening distinctions, demonizing you, slinging inflammatory labels and engaging in moral one-upmanship? Are people ignoring what you actually say—talking about but not to you? </em></p><p>Precisely because speech can be hurtful, critical culture discourages extreme rhetoric. It encourages people to listen to each other, to use evidence and argumentation, to behave reasonably and to avoid personal attacks.</p><p>Cancel culture is much more invested in what philosophers Justin Tosi and Brandon Warmke call “<a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/grandstanding-9780190900151?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">moral grandstanding</a>”: the display of moral outrage to impress one’s peer group, dominate others, or both. Grandstanders who condemn someone are not interested in persuading or correcting her; in fact, they are not really talking <em>to</em> her at all. Rather, they are using her as a convenient object in a campaign to elevate their own status. Pile-ons, personal attacks and bidding wars to show the most outrage are all ways of engaging in moral grandstanding.</p><p><strong>Truthiness</strong></p><p><em>Are the things being said about you inaccurate? Do the people saying them not even seem to care about their veracity? Do they feel at liberty to distort your words, ignore corrections and make false accusations?</em></p><p>Concern for accuracy is the north star of a critical culture. Not everyone gets every fact right, nor do people always agree on what is true; and yet people in a critical culture try to present their own and others’ viewpoints honestly and accurately. Though I may fail to live up to this standard in some cases, I recognize that I should address what you actually said, not an inflammatory caricature or some out-of-context quotation.</p><p>One of many reasons Donald Trump is a menace to democracy is that he views truth instrumentally, as something to use, abuse or ignore depending on the needs of the moment. He repeats discredited assertions <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/12/10/meet-bottomless-pinocchio-new-rating-false-claim-repeated-over-over-again/">again and again</a>—or shifts ground <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-says-it-doesnt-really-matter-if-iranian-general-posed-an-imminent-threat/2020/01/13/c9f7ea1c-362e-11ea-9541-9107303481a4_story.html">to another</a> when one assertion is definitively debunked. Cancelers often play the same kind of <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/rhetorical-calvinball">rhetorical Calvinball</a>.</p><p>Cancelers’ characterizations of a paper by the philosopher Rebecca Tuvel, for example, were <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/05/transracialism-article-controversy.html">demonstrably incorrect</a>. The person who initiated the campaign even admitted to <a href="http://www.butterfliesandwheels.org/2017/can-we-get-this-person-fired/">not having read</a> the supposedly objectionable paper. “So little of what has been said … is based upon people actually reading what I wrote,” Tuvel <a href="http://dailynous.com/2017/05/01/philosophers-article-transracialism-sparks-controversy/">lamented</a> in a public statement. </p><p>But that did not stop anybody. For canceling is not about seeking truth or persuading others; it is a form of information warfare, in which <a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/63ite2/the-colbert-report-the-word---truthiness">truthiness</a> suffices if it serves the cause.</p><p>Those are my six warning signs. If you spot one or two, you should fear that a canceling may be happening; if you see five or six, you can be sure.</p><p>Obviously, mine is not the only approach. Other people, such as <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/a-taxonomy-of-fear">Emily Yoffe</a> and <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/04/whats-the-best-way-to-protect-free-speech-ken-white-and-greg-lukianoff-debate-cancel-culture/">Greg Lukianoff</a>, have made their own attempts at characterizing the current climate of fear or defining cancel culture. Hopefully, many more suggestions and refinements will follow. </p><p>As with most other concepts, we might never come to a complete consensus about its best definition. Still, I predict …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <div>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <p>My brain is kind of funny. When I see "free" money in some newfangled service backed by venture capitalists, I try to scheme a way that would make that free money mine. All of these schemes while potentially fruitful, are typically way to much work to be worth it, but I love coming up with them.</p>
<h3 id="just-this-week--">Just this week -</h3>
<p>I came up with a scheme on how to gross $120 each week from my newest "gambling" obsession <a href="https://withyotta.page.link/Mky6HvgTUtmhDkqb6">Yotta Savings</a> (click it, sign up, and get 100 free "lottery" tickets), it is a new (to the US) type of savings account <strong>that is FDIC insured</strong>, called a reward backed savings account. It's basically a traditional savings account, but on top of the 0.2% interest the account would normally pay out, each week you pick (or have it pick) numbers for a weekly lottery drawing, and they add your winnings to your account. </p>
<h3 id="that-is-enough-free-advertising-let-me-continue">That is enough free advertising, let me continue.</h3>
<p>I was reading their official rules, and it seems that you can get up to 10,000 tickets each week either by</p>
<ul>
<li>For every $25 in your account (up to $250k) entitles you to 1 ticket.</li>
<li>For every single handwritten sheet of paper with your name, phone, email, address, and optionally your numbers. <em>Limit 1 request per envelope. Automation is prohibited.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>That sent me on a downward spiral toward finding the game to that second "free" ticket rule.</p>
<h3 id="as-with-all-projects-try-the-naive-approach-first">As with all projects, try the naive approach first</h3>
<p>Mailing a single sheet of paper in an #10 envelope with a stamp. This approach would cost around $0.60. A forever stamp is now $0.50, an envelope is around $0.10 and a sheet of paper is about a penny.</p>
<p>10,000 requests would cost $6,000. Depending on the odds, that might be worth it.</p>
<p>Some quick (probably kind of wrong) math it looks like statistically 10,000 tickets should gross an average of $120 each week.</p>
<p>It was plain to see, as with most naive approaches, this would not work.</p>
<p>Now knowing that I have to make 10,000 requests to statistically average $120 each week, I need to get the cost per request down to $0.012.</p>
<h3 id="break-even--0012request">Break even = $0.012/request</h3>
<p>Now my brain started turning. Delivery is the biggest expense. How can I get that cost down? </p>
<p>The address to deliver the requests is in NYC, and I could just drive the requests down. I only live 40 miles north of the city. If I nursed the throttle, I would use about $5 in gas, with careful planning, tolls would cost around $6, and parking COULD be free on the street.</p>
<h3 id="remaining--00109request">Remaining = $0.0109/request</h3>
<p>Next biggest expense was material costs. How can I get all this paper I needed cheaper? A ream of paper is 500 sheets and costs about $11 on amazon, a 10 ream box costs about $50, (awesome! half the price per ream), but there is a weird 8 ream box that costs only $30 or about 1/3 the cost per ream. <strong>Sold!</strong> I have 4000 sheets of paper at less than a penny a sheet, but now I need envelopes. </p>
<h3 id="envelopes-are-expensive">Envelopes are EXPENSIVE.</h3>
<p>For just a folded piece of paper with a little glue on it, I wouldn't have thought they would cost so much, but I was WRONG. I actually couldn't find an envelope for less than $0.05, and that was buying 5000 envelopes at a time.</p>
<p>So buying envelopes are out of the question. I was about to throw in the towel when Engineer brain kicked back in. Make the damn envelopes your self. But it was painfully obvious that with 1 sheet of paper costing $0.0075, I wouldn't break even if I used 2 sheets of paper per request, and then it clicked.</p>
<h3 id="tiny-requests">Tiny requests!</h3>
<p>Why can't I just make the request smaller. What is a "sheet of paper" anyway???</p>
<p>So I pull out my little paper cutter, grab a sheet of paper and decided randomly to make the tiny sheets of paper 3 inches by 2 inches. I had no reasoning behind it, it just seemed correct. What is crazy about 3x2, is you actually get 14 tiny pages out of it with one 2x2 square left over, and only a tiny bit of waste. An envelope has to be slightly bigger than 1Wx2H the tiny sheet of paper to fully envelop the contents, so I made it 3.5 inches wide and 4.25 inches long.</p>
<p>A tiny sheet of paper costs $0.0005, and a tiny envelop costs $0.00125, for a total materials and shipping cost of $0.00285.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-the-glue-that-shuts-the-envelopes">What about the glue that shuts the envelopes!?</h3>
<p>Oh my, you are correct. This one was much more complex to figure out. I would need to tape these requests shut on 3 sides if folded like an actual envelope. Alas, I thought of this. And with some not so difficult "origami" you can make the envelop close with only a single piece of tape or dot of glue. Bulk clear office tape can be had for only $10 for 11,000 inches of tape. Used sparingly (1/2 inch per envelope, it will only add $0.00045 to the cost of the request.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-penspencilsink">What about pens/pencils/ink???</h3>
<p>According to the research at The University of Reading, the average ballpoint pen will ink 900 meters, or roughly 61,000 characters, now BIC claims their cheap crystal ballpoint pens last 2.5 kilometers, or 170,000 characters per pen. So if I were to use their pens, and their claim is genuine, I would run through 5 pens over the 10,000 requests. And a pack of 10 pens is around $5, so that would add another $0.00025 per request.</p>
<h3 id="these-numbers-just-keep-climbing">These numbers just keep climbing</h3>
<p>Probably all in, you are looking at a cost of $0.00355 per request, or $35.50 each week to earn an average of $120. Oh, and about 50 hours of cutting, folding, taping, writing really tiny, handcramps, and frustration.</p>
<h3 id="is-it-worth-it">Is it worth it?</h3>
<p>The exercise in figuring something like this out is worth it, actually executing this plan is totally NOT worth it.</p>
<p>And that tends to always be the case with my brain, it realizes something else that is not going to work, but instead of giving up, I dive into more research, and soon enough an entire day has passed me by and all I have to show for it is a paper cut, and a pile of confetti on my desk.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>If you’ve used a web app in the last decade, you’ve probably signed in using <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-sso">Single Sign-On (SSO)</a>. Clicked “Sign in with Twitter” or built an integration to allow users to sign in with Google? That’s SSO. SSO is a popular authentication mechanism that’s enabled application developers to register and sign in users easily, while allowing users to use a single service for their identity. Implementing SSO enables users to sign in using their Google credentials rather than remembering passwords for another service. </p><p>While SSO authentication lowers the barrier to entry to your product, it also presents new user experiences as you start to consider the actual mechanics of signing into your application. The SSO handshake involves validation between two parties - the Identity Provider (e.g. Okta) and the service provider (e.g. your app). Enterprise users now have two unique flows to sign into your application - via an Identity Provider (IdP) initiated flow or via a Service Provider (SP) initiated flow. &nbsp;</p></div><h2>IdP-initiated SSO</h2><p>SSO Identity Providers typically offer an application marketplace / dashboard that shows an enterprise user all of the applications they have access to. For example, Okta offers a browser extension that provides a quick way to see and sign in to the applications you have access to. IdP-initiated sign on is when an enterprise user clicks on your application from one of these places. The sign-on is initiated by the IdP provider, hence it’s called “IdP-initiated SSO.”<br></p><figure id="w-node-72914696f046-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f2c523fead65f22b3c3b05a_SSO_Hero_Image-Desktop_Mobile.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Your Okta application dashboard might look like this (<a href="https://www.okta.com/products/single-sign-on/">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>A Service Provider cannot solely rely on IdP-initiated sign on for users to access their application. Some Identity Providers don’t support IdP-initiated sign on and some app developers don’t build in the ability to use IdP-initiated sign on. On the other hand, consider the user experience of enterprise users who come directly to your website wanting to use your application. Only allowing IdP-initiated SSO requires users to always go through their Identity Provider dashboard, something users may forget. <br></p><h2>SP-initiated SSO</h2><p>Service Provider initiated sign on is when an enterprise user signs in by visiting an application’s website directly. If you decide to allow your enterprise users to sign in to your application from your own website, you have a few UX options, but one aspect is absolutely crucial no matter what you chose to do: <em>you must obtain an enterprise user’s domain</em>. The domain is used to map the user to the enterprise - without it, how will you know which user belongs to which enterprise? There are a few different approaches to Service Provider initiated sign on that we commonly see utilized by applications:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Subdomain your tenants</li><li>Signing in with SSO</li><li>Separating the email and password fields</li><li>Dynamic password fields <br></li></ul><h2>1. Subdomain your tenants</h2><p>One approach you can take would be to serve your application at a subdomain per tenant / enterprise. Slack is one web application that does this. When you visit <a href="https://slack.com/">slack.com</a> and click on the Sign In button, you’re taken to this page:<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f2c5283468662a73c040719_image%20(7).png" alt=""></p></figure><p>If we consider WorkOS here, a WorkOS employee would enter <strong><em>workos</em></strong> into the input, Slack looks up what sign in options are allowed for <strong><em>workos</em></strong>, and on the next page offers the user the various methods their organization may use for signing in.<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f2c52a7ead65f409ac413a7_Screen%20Shot%202020-08-04%20at%201.09.57%20PM.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>2. Sign in with SSO</h2><p>A second approach would be to put a link or button on your login page for <strong><em>Sign in with SSO</em></strong>. One thing to remember is the <a href="https://indieweb.org/NASCAR_problem">NASCAR Problem</a> - where a cluster of 3rd party branded buttons creates both visual noise and confusion on behalf of the user.<br></p><figure id="w-node-3086f52aa857-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f2c52c519f125323b9f5a1a_0_4fYlCDFKodWOMQlX.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>That’s a lot of login buttons! (<a href="https://medium.com/code-oil/oauth-introduction-for-busy-managers-engineers-d9d792504888">Source</a>) </figcaption></figure><p>Cypress takes this approach, but is careful to only offer a couple of sign in options that are relevant to their user base:<br></p><figure id="w-node-df6971397a76-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f2c710a9c652c0f3c9af534_image%20(8).png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Clicking the Single Sign-On link takes you here:<br></p><figure id="w-node-9d11dcad3940-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f2c71b0260f332d32d30720_image%20(9).png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>3. Separate email / password fields</h2><p>Take a look at the initial login screens of two of the world’s largest tech companies. Notice anything missing?<br></p><figure id="w-node-d7f7ce9329f4-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f2c72843b75e571dba65898_image%20(10).png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Where is the password field?</figcaption></figure><p>They separate the login process into multiple steps or pages. When signing into Apple’s developer portal, it first asks only for your email then your password, because between the steps, Apple is doing a lookup to see if your domain is SSO-enabled. If it is SSO-enabled, instead of showing your password, it will take you though the SSO flow instead. Here at WorkOS, we even use it for our login page.<br></p><figure id="w-node-ecfa60f44263-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f2c72a49fd1df81c7694b71_Screen%20Shot%202020-08-03%20at%2012.56.18%20PM.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>4. Dynamically hide the password field<br></h2><p>An extension to the previous approach is dynamically hiding the password field - but only for domains which have SSO enabled. This is a bit more complicated to implement, but it provides a nicer and more “unified” user experience. An example of this style is implemented on the Dropbox login form. <br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f2c72b88e63c617c8e4154e_ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif" alt=""></p><figcaption>Disclaimer: Please, don’t try to hack into Marc’s Dropbox account because you see this gif. </figcaption></figure><div><p>Dropbox has implemented SSO, but that’s not immediately apparent from their login screen. As a user, for example <strong><em><a href="https://workos.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="701d1102133003111c1503161f0213155e131f1d">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em></strong>, types their email into the respective field,&nbsp;a search is being executed on the backend on every keypress to check if a matching SSO-enabled domain exists. Once a match is found, the password experience is replaced with the <strong><em>Single sign-on enabled</em></strong> flow. Now, the user just clicks <strong><em>Continue</em></strong> to sign in.</p><p>In our opinion, this is the smoothest SSO UI/UX, but again, we understand it’s more work to implement and test.</p></div><h2>The SSO journey doesn’t end here</h2><div><p>Adding SSO doesn’t mean you can get rid of usernames and passwords altogether. Users without SSO-based login still need some way to access your product. Even with SSO-enabled accounts, admin users need to be able to <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/saml/#implementing-a-backdoor">login using username / password</a> so they can configure SSO for all users or get into the system in the event SSO isn’t working. </p><p>Your login page is the gate to your application, and it’s important to make it a polished experienced. A third-party service like <a href="https://workos.com/features/sso">WorkOS</a> can help you build it faster so you can focus on the details.</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Did you know that one of the most fundamental stumbling block in our fight against climate change is a very rudimentary cognitive illusion?</p>



<p>In this hugely insightful talk, at Nudgetstock 2019, Robert Frank demystifies this cognitive illusion and also provides the way to tackle it. This talk is a must-watch if you deal with similar situation in your professional life where cognitive biases prevent your customers or your employees from taking an action which can lead to collective improvement but because of their fear, they don’t take that action.</p>

August 7, 2020 | https://formcake.com/blog/aws-activate-and-our-four-thousand-dollar-mistake | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://formcake.com/blog/aws-activate-and-our-four-thousand-dollar-mistake">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently we signed up for the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/activate/">AWS Activate</a> program, which provides startups / small internet businesses like us with a variety of benefits - from AWS credits to free business-tier support.</p>
<p>We signed up for AWS Activate as part of our application to the Stripe Atlas program, which we're <a href="https://formcake.com/our-experience-with-stripe-atlas">big fans</a> of, but you don't need to be a part of Stripe Atlas to sign up for Activate.</p>
<p>When signing up for Activate though you <em>do</em> need to know you'll be faced with a question that can drastically shape the number of credits you ultimately receive.</p>
<h2 id="the-mistake">The Mistake</h2>
<p>When we first went through the process we very simply answered that question wrong. We encountered the following screen, outlining the different sign up paths for bootstrapped vs funded startups.</p>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/aws-activate-screen.png" alt="AWS Activate bootstrapped vs funded startups"></p>
<p>When we first signed up, we did so as a bootstrapped startup: We're not accepting any funding, or even incorporating as a C Corp so we can have shares and an officer structure. We're incorporated as an LLC because we want to slowly build our way to profitability, so "bootstrapped" as a term seemed to described us.</p>
<p>We received $1,000 in AWS credits and were happy, but <a href="https://formcake.com/stripe-atlas-includes-five-thousand-credits-this-is-what-we-got">raised the issue with Stripe</a> that we were curious if there was a chance at getting the $5,000 that the Stripe copy seemed to suggest.</p>
<p>Stripe not only got back to us but fought for us to <a href="https://formcake.com/how-an-email-got-us-five-thousand-aws-credits">receive the full $5,000 in credits from AWS</a>.</p>
<p>But in their email it became clear what the issue was: <strong>We signed up under the wrong option</strong>.</p>
<p>Even though we're not accepting proper funding rounds, we are "sponsored" by Stripe in a sense through the Atlas program. That means we have an organization code/ID we can plug into the AWS Activate signup process signifying that we're a "funded" startup.</p>
<p>Doing so appears to net you a cool $5,000 in AWS credits.</p>
<p>Luckily we pestered Stripe to the point where we were able to receive not just the extra money ($5,000) but also keep the original, $1,000 amount. Since we're a small startup that's on an all-AWS infrastructure, this money was pretty critical to us, and provides a nice runway.</p>
<h2 id="the-takeaway">The Takeaway</h2>
<p>If you're signing up for the AWS Activate program, consider looking for a program like Stripe Atlas to sign up with. If you're able to find this kind of sponsorship and sign up with your corresponding organization ID, you can probably expect more credits. Don't be like us and potentially leave this much money (well, credits) on the table.</p>
<p>If you're anything like us, that difference between $1,000 and $5,000 is something you can feel!</p>

<p>NASA’s launched the MAVEN mission to Mars in 2013 alongside India’s popular Mangalayaan spacecraft, both of which started orbiting the red planet the year after. In the six years since, MAVEN has been unravelling how exactly Mars loses its atmosphere to space, providing clues on how and when the planet lost its water.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/maven-mars.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/maven-mars.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/maven-mars.jpg?resize=200%2C113&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/maven-mars.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/maven-mars.jpg?w=1041&amp;ssl=1 1041w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Artist’s concept of the NASA MAVEN spacecraft orbiting Mars. <a href="credit: NASA">Credit: NASA</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<h3><strong>Why NASA launched MAVEN?</strong></h3>



<p>Earth’s magnetic field protects us from high-energy particles coming from the Sun by deflecting them away from the planet, avoiding our atmosphere from being stripped away. Mars doesn’t have a magnetic field of its own, so solar radiation strikes its atmosphere directly, knocking atoms off into space. Scientists think this is how Mars lost most of its once dense atmosphere 3 billion years ago, turning a warm, watery planet into a chilly, dry desert world.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars_landscape_dry_wet.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars_landscape_dry_wet.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars_landscape_dry_wet.jpg?resize=200%2C113&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars_landscape_dry_wet.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars_landscape_dry_wet.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars_landscape_dry_wet.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars_landscape_dry_wet.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>This artist’s concept depicts the cold, dry environment seen on Mars today (left) versus the early wam Martian environment (right), believed to contain liquid water. <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/8337/the-look-of-a-young-mars/">Credit: NASA</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Without much of an atmosphere, Mars lost its surface water, essential for life as we know it, which once flowed freely on Mars. This is <a href="https://www.planetary.org/multimedia/space-images/mars/minerals-around-the-jezero-delta-on-mars.html">evident in features</a> resembling dry riverbeds and minerals that only form in the presence of liquid water. MAVEN is studying Mars’ atmosphere to help us understand exactly what happened in Mars’ past. This gives us clues about possible past life there, and what planetary processes make Earth a haven for life.</p>



<p>MAVEN is part of NASA’s <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/programs/mars-exploration">Mars Exploration Program</a>, an unprecedented, multi-decade campaign to comprehensively understand Mars and its suitability to host past or present life. Within just weeks of arriving at Mars, MAVEN <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/october/nasa-mission-provides-its-first-look-at-martian-upper-atmosphere/">observed</a> oxygen, carbon and hydrogen escaping from the planet’s atmosphere into space. These atoms were once a part of carbon dioxide and water vapor molecules near the surface.</p>

<p>MAVEN found that Mars’ atmospheric loss is <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/news/nasas-maven-reveals-most-of-mars-atmosphere-was-lost-to-space/">primarily driven by the Sun</a>. The Sun emits a stream of hot, highly energetic particles collectively known as the solar wind. When this solar wind hits the unprotected Martian atmosphere, it imparts energy to atmospheric atoms and molecules, giving them enough velocity to escape martian gravity. MAVEN learned that the solar wind <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press/goddard/2014/december/nasa-s-maven-mission-identifies-links-in-chain-leading-to-atmospheric-loss">penetrates more deeply</a> into Mars’ atmosphere than previously thought.</p>

<p>Because of its egg-shaped orbit, Mars is closer to the Sun at some points than others. MAVEN saw that Mars <a href="http://www.astrobio.net/also-in-news/nasas-maven-mission-observes-ups-downs-water-escape-mars/">lost 10 times more hydrogen</a> at the nearest points than at its farthest. This is due to Mars receiving about 40% more sunlight and solar wind there, as well as increased summer heat kicking off gases from near the surface to the upper atmosphere, where the atmospheric loss strengthens.</p>



<p><strong>Aurorae on Mars</strong></p>



<p>Aurorae on Earth are caused by energetic charged particles from space crashing down into the atmosphere along Earth’s magnetic field lines, causing gases to glow near the poles. Since Mars has no strong magnetic field, the solar wind penetrates deeper and causes <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/large-solar-storm-sparks-global-aurora-and-doubles-radiation-levels-on-the-martian-surface">bright, planet-wide aurorae</a>.</p>

<p>MAVEN’s <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press/2015/march/nasa-spacecraft-detects-aurora-and-mysterious-dust-cloud-around-mars">observations</a> helped scientists understand that increased upper atmospheric gases during summer cause enhanced atmospheric loss as well as <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/goddard/2019/mars-proton-aurora-common">increased auroral glow</a>, linking the two phenomena together.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Can Mars be terraformed?</strong></p><p>While life on Earth was taking shape and spreading over three billion years ago, Mars was rapidly losing its atmosphere and water, including carbon dioxide that would have kept the planet warm for a longer period. In fact, data from recent NASA’s Mars orbiters have <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8358/mars-terraforming-not-possible-using-present-day-technology/">pointed out</a> Mars has so little carbon dioxide left that artificially warming the planet up to make it habitable isn’t possible with present-day technologies. This means that any liquid water introduced on Mars’ surface would evaporate and eventually escape. Sorry, would-be Martians: Mars can’t be terraformed!</p></blockquote>



<p>MAVEN has also contributed to other aspects of martian science, like <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/november/mars-spacecraft-reveal-comet-flyby-effects-on-martian-atmosphere/">observing pristine metallic comet dust</a> in Mars’ atmosphere after a comet flew by the planet, and detecting <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/goddard/2020/mars-layers-and-rifts">mirror-like plasma layers</a> in Mars’ upper atmosphere, the same kind that causes radio interference on Earth. MAVEN <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/goddard/2019/mars-wind-map">created a global wind map</a> of the planet’s upper atmosphere, a first for any planet other than Earth and saw <a href="https://www.planetary.org/multimedia/space-images/mars/maven-view-of-clouds-on-mars-in-uv.html">huge clouds</a> spanning hundreds of kilometers being formed in a matter of hours!</p>



<p>MAVEN also acts as a high-speed communications relay between surface spacecraft and Earth, allowing us to get more science data back from Mars than would be otherwise possible.</p>







<p>One of MAVEN’s flagship <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/maven/spacecraft/index.html">instruments</a> is the Imaging UltraViolet Spectrograph, or IUVS, a camera tailored to ‘see’ ultraviolet light. This helps MAVEN directly see and measure gases leaving Mars’ atmosphere since they reflect and scratter ultraviolet light. The same instrument also allows MAVEN to observe the planet-wide aurorae whose gases glow in ultraviolet.</p>



<p>MAVEN also detects solar wind entering Mars’ upper atmosphere using a mass spectrometer, a device that determines the elemental makeup of materials passing through it. A magnetometer on the spacecraft measures the electrical charge created when the solar wind hits atmospheric particles, which creates a weak magnetic field that accelerates the particles away from the planet.</p>

<p>By continuously and extensively tracking the upper atmosphere for almost three Martian years i.e. roughly six Earth years, MAVEN has shown for the first time how exactly Mars loses its atmosphere and at what rate. MAVEN Remote Sensing Team member Justin Deighan of the University of Colorado, Boulder <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/october/nasa-mission-provides-its-first-look-at-martian-upper-atmosphere/">said</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“With these maps we have the kind of complete and simultaneous coverage of Mars that is usually only possible for Earth.”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>In 2019, mission operators <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/nasa-s-maven-spacecraft-shrinking-its-mars-orbit-to-prepare-for-mars-2020-rover">lowered MAVEN’s orbit</a> so that it can relay data between Earth and NASA’s Perseverance rover. MAVEN has enough fuel to be operational until at least 2030, so it will be increasingly tasked with replacing communication relay responsibilities of aging orbiters like <a href="https://www.planetary.org/explore/space-topics/space-missions/mro.html">MRO</a> and Mars Odyssey. While not conducting relay communications, MAVEN will continue to study Mars’s atmosphere.</p>

<p>
We have talked a fair <a href="https://www.hellovirology.com/2020/07/what-is-mrna-vaccine.html">amount</a> <a href="https://www.hellovirology.com/2020/07/antibody-hope-in-sars-cov-2.html">about</a> antibodies, and much of the SARS-CoV-2 discussion is focused on antibodies as indicators, treatments, or vaccines. However, antibodies produced by B-cells are only one part of the larger immune picture, albeit one of the most accessible parts. To develop a comprehensive treatment strategy for SARS-CoV-2, we will likely need to understand how the broader network of immune cells responds to the virus. Today, we’ll take a closer look at the T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and what it says about long-term immunity.
</p>
<h3>A robust T cell response</h3>


<p>
A brief refresher: T cells, <a href="https://www.hellovirology.com/2020/06/adaptive-immune-cells.html">you may remember</a>, are adaptive immune cells. Each T cell has a unique T cell receptor that recognizes a different set of foreign peptides, and if a T cell’s receptor is activated, that T cell clones itself and produces an army of similar T cells capable of fighting off the invader that was recognized. T cells come in several varieties, the two most prominent of which are CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. CD4+ T cells are responsible for surveying peptides (that is, short protein fragments) presented by antigen-presenting cells like B cells and macrophages and starting a signaling cascade that activates the rest of the immune system, and are thus referred to as “helper” T cells. CD8+ T cells survey peptides presented by normal tissue cells throughout the body, and, if they recognize one of the presented peptides as foreign, they kill the cell under the assumption that it has been infected. CD8+ T cells are thus called “killer” T cells.</p><p><img height="441" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/VHihcE0ie5EooWOw2mc8MzfuYgaOlru5R7lLNl22U_DTENRS9eBrKdPNZd1a0q609Hhyl7WZLuQpw8lVU3fO2ZsWAYwdT_anu_JpkUAMOyP1IkBQ_TGsvrYS4geTdOtRC1TVjQLU=w499-h441" width="499"></p><p>Given these critical roles in immune system activation, scientists are studying the extent to which CD4+ and CD8+ T cells recognize peptides from SARS-CoV-2. In <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2550-z">one recent paper</a>, Grifoni et al. created pools of peptides that tile the entire set of proteins that make up SARS-CoV-2. In one pool, they created a peptide for every set of 15 amino acids from the Spike protein, tiled such that each length-15 chain overlapped by ten amino acids with the next peptide in the pool. In another pool, they computationally predicted which peptides would be efficiently held by antigen presenting cells like macrophages, and made peptides that covered the rest of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. A similar pool was made for the peptides predicted to be efficiently held in the MHC class I molecules that CD8+ T cells recognize.</p> <p><img height="250" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/zUoM8PrduU9w1Tw6QW9QYVvR_PE7ctTnUvJyqoBkLcEO6jqFuuZwkc97g5hStxr7hNOl4ceN3bcB4PBHx0GrHLioF1cOAWLW9-eK3K7Xk6U_rw-ZTmx9oj5FiyisoABi1VRZ7fYv" width="241"></p><p>
Scientists regularly create overlapping peptides that tile proteins of interest when studying which pieces of a protein immune cells recognize. This is a generic example showing overlap strategies from Mimotopes.com, a company that creates and sells custom peptides.
</p>
<p>
To test out the effects of these peptide pools, the researchers collected blood from patients who tested positive for COVID-19 but were not hospitalized, 20 - 35 days after symptom onset. The researchers extracted the Peripheral Mononuclear Blood Cells (PBMCs) from the blood, as these include circulating T cells and other immune cells, and then ran a series of experiments to see how the T cells responded to the peptide pools. The number of patients was small (20 patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2, and 20 unexposed controls), but even so, the results were consistent: all recovered COVID-19 patients showed evidence of a robust T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 peptides. 100% of patients had CD4+ T cells that recognized and became activated in response to peptides from the Spike pool as well as peptides from the non-Spike peptide pool. These activated cells were able to produce inflammatory cytokines (immune signaling molecules) and to quickly clone themselves. The response of the patients’ CD8+ T cells was less universal, but still robust: 70% of patients had CD8+ T cells that were activated in response to the SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools. 
</p>
<h3>Memories of infections past</h3>


<p>
What does this T cell response mean? For starters, it indicates that recovered COVID-19 patients have a stronghold of “memory” T cells— T cells that have seen SARS-CoV-2 and learned its patterns so that they are ready to respond more quickly in the future. It’s unclear whether these T cells are able to confer long-term immunity for the patients, but there is some evidence that they might: another paper published by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2550-z">Le Bert et al.</a> ran a similar set of peptide/T cell experiments, but they were able to include a set of long-recovered SARS-CoV-1 patients. They found that even after 17 years, these patients had T cells that were able to quickly respond to both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 peptides, which gives us hope that T cell memory of SARS-CoV-2 will be similarly long-lived.
</p>
<p>
These cross-reactive T cells were not limited to SARS-CoV-1 patients, either. Both Grifoni et al. and Le Bert et al. used PBMCs drawn from donors without any exposure to COVID as controls, but these unexposed controls proved more interesting than the “zero baseline” we might have expected, as up to 50% of the unexposed controls showed some degree of reactivity to peptides from SARS-CoV-2, though these reactions were skewed toward the non-spike peptide pools. The researchers reason this is likely due to previous exposure to coronaviruses that cause common colds, and indeed, all unexposed controls had antibodies for two common coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63. If true, this cross-reactivity between common cold coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 could explain some of the variability in severity of COVID-19 across different people; some immune systems may already be primed to react to SARS-CoV-2 by prior infections. Further, given that the cross-reactive responses were more pronounced for non-spike proteins, this finding lends support to the idea that we should have a multi-target approach to vaccination and treatment, rather than a Spike-only approach.
</p>
<p>
(We should pause for a moment here to address a nagging question: wait, if even the unexposed controls showed responses to SARS-CoV-2 peptides, how do we know any of these responses are real? Isn’t the whole idea of a control to give a baseline to compare to? There are several reasons to believe these results are legitimate: peptide assays are fairly robust in immunological studies; the amplitude and targets of the control response are distinct from the COVID-19-exposed response; and multiple studies from multiple labs found the same results with the same peculiarities. That said, the sample size is very small, and the lack of a non-reactive control should always be concerning, so more studies in this area should be conducted before we draw any strong conclusions here.)
</p>

<p>
COVID-19-exposed cells (top row) showed a robust response to a number of SARS-CoV-2 targets, but the unexposed controls also showed some responsiveness, especially among lesser-known viral peptides.
</p>
<h3>Reading the T leaves</h3>


<p>
Taken all together, these T cell experiments demonstrate that, well, T cells matter, too. A robust immune response requires many cells, and the evidence of consistent T cell activation in recovered patients indicates that T cells play an important role in the natural clearance of the virus. It stands to reason, then, that an effective vaccination strategy will likely have to consider how and when to activate T cells. These studies identify a number of distinct peptides that activate T cells across patients, and could therefore be used along with antibodies as part of a vaccination strategy.

<p>Last time I have <a href="https://bkamins.github.io/julialang/2020/08/02/post_juliacon_1.html">posted</a> about the take-aways for DataFrames.jl from
<a href="https://juliacon.org/2020/">JuliaCon 2020</a>. This time I wanted to share my general conclusions
from attending different talks at this extremely successful event.</p>

<p>I have spent 20 years now deploying data science related projects in corporate
environments (back then it was not called data science, but we were already
training neural networks to make predictions) and have many colleagues who are
deeply into enterprise software development. Quoting a discussion with
Tomasz Olczak I had some time ago, who is a genuine one-man army in
delivering complex enterprise projects:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Julia is fast, and has a very nice syntax, but its ecosystem is not mature
enough for use in serious production projects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For many years I would agree with it, but after <a href="https://juliacon.org/2020/">JuliaCon 2020</a>
I believe we can confidently announce that</p>

<p>
  <b><i>Julia is production ready!</i></b>
</p>

<p>Let me now give a list of key (in my opinion) presentations given during
<a href="https://juliacon.org/2020/">JuliaCon 2020</a> that make me draw this conclusion.</p>

<p>I will not comment here on functionalities related to number crunching, as it
is clear that Julia shines here, but rather I want to focus on the things that
make Julia a great tool for deployment in production (still I skip many
interesting talks in this area — check out the detailed <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/agenda/">agenda</a> to
learn more).</p>



<p>In <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/Y3H7FG">this talk</a> <a href="https://github.com/quinnj">Jacob Quinn</a> gives an end to end tutorial how
to build and deploy in an enterprise setting a microservice using Julia.
He gives ready recipes how to solve typical tasks that need to be handled in
such contexts: logging, context management, middleware setup, authentication,
caching, connection pooling, dockerization, and many other, that
are bread and butter of enterprise projects.</p>

<p>As an addition be sure to check out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/Z8TE39">shippable apps</a> talk, where <a href="https://github.com/KristofferC">Kristoffer Carlsson</a> guides you
through creating executables which can be run on machines that do not have Julia
installed.</li>
  <li>the <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/N39HSX">Julia for scripting</a> presentation, during which
<a href="https://github.com/fredrikekre">Fredrik Ekre</a> discusses the best practices for using Julia in contexts
where you need to execute short code snippets many times.</li>
  <li>the <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/DTLBM9">Genie.jl</a> talk, in which <a href="https://github.com/essenciary">Adrian Salceanu</a> shows that it is currently
a mature, stable, performant, and feature-rich Julia web development framework.</li>
</ul>



<p>The two talks <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/PLFURQ">Pkg.update()</a> and <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/RXAN8F">What’s new in Pkg</a> show that
currently Julia has best in class functionalities for enterprise grade dependency
management for your projects. The list of provided functionalities is so long
that it is hard to list them all here.</p>

<p>Let me just mention one particular tool in this ecosystem, that is presented in
<a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/9WMAVU">BinaryBuilder.jl</a> talk that explains how to take software written in compiled
languages such as C, C++, Fortran, Go or Rust, and build precompiled artifacts
that can be used from Julia packages with ease (which means that no compilation
has to take place on client side when you install packages having such dependencies).</p>



<p>A natural topic related to dependency management is how to integrate Julia with
external tools. This area of functionality is really mature. Here is a list of
talks that cover this topic:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/7MALUA">Make your Julia code faster and compatible with non-Julia code</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/NNVQQF">Wrapping a C++ library using CxxWrap.jl</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/XGHSWW">Julia and C++: a technical overview of CxxWrap.jl</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/Y7ERM9">Introducing the @ccall macro</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/PHGCKB">Integrating Julia in R with the JuliaConnectoR</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/Q88P8U">Integrate Julia and Javascript using Node.js extensions</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Here it is worth to add Julia has had a great integration with Python for many
years now, see <a href="https://github.com/JuliaPy">JuliaPy</a>.</p>

<p>A good end to end example of doing some real work in Julia that requires integration
is <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/KK9S9V">Creating a multichannel wireless speaker setup with Julia</a>
talk that show how to easily stitch things together (and in particular featuring
ZMQ.jl, Opus.jl, PortAudio.jl, and DSP.jl).</p>

<p>Another interesting talk showcasing integration capabilities is
<a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/GFE3DB">JSServe: Websites &amp; Dashboards in Julia</a>
that shows a high performance framework to easily combine interactive plots,
markdown, widgets and plain HTML/Javascript in Jupyter / Atom / Nextjournal and
on websites.</p>



<p>The two great talks <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/DWCJUK">Juno 1.0</a> and <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/HBTFT7">Using VS Code</a> that current IDE
support for Julia in VS Code is first class. You have all tools that normally you
would expect to get: code analysis (static and dynamic), debugger, workspaces,
integration with Jupyter Notebooks, and remote capabilities.</p>



<p>I do not want to cover many different ML algorithms that are available in Julia
natively, as there are just too many of them (and if something is missing you
can easily integrate it — see the integration capabilities section above).</p>

<p>However, on top of particular models you need frameworks that let you manage
ML workflows. In this area there are two interesting talks, one about
<a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/DMHZCC">MLJ: a machine learning toolbox for Julia</a> and the other showing
<a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/AD7TQW">AutoMLPipeline: A ToolBox for Building ML Pipelines</a>. From my experience
such tools are crucial when you want to move with your ML models from data scientist’s
sandbox to a real production usage.</p>



<p>Obviously, I have omitted many interesting things that were shown during
<a href="https://juliacon.org/2020/">JuliaCon 2020</a>. However, I hope that the aspects I have covered here,
that is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enterprise grade patterns to create microservices and applications in Julia,</li>
  <li>robust dependency management tools,</li>
  <li>very flexible and powerful capabilities to integrate Julia with existing code
bases that were not written in Julia,</li>
  <li>excellent developer tooling in VSCode,</li>
  <li>mature packages that help you to create production-grade code for ML solutions
deployment,</li>
</ul>

<p>show that already now Julia can (and should) be considered as a serious option
for your next project in enterprise environment.</p>

<p>What I believe is crucially important is that not only we have required tools
ready but also we have great practical showcases how they can be used to build
robust production code with.</p>

		<p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>4</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p>











<p>If you’re coming from a professional background in salaried positions, the chances are that you’ve never hired anyone before. And even if you have, hiring someone for your own business will be a daunting task.</p>



<p>It certainly was for me. I thought that I could manage all that work by myself just fine, so why bother hiring. But I limited myself by doing things that kept me from doing more meaningful work. I was spreading myself too thin, trying to multitask when each task would have deserved my full attention.</p>



<p>Sure, it’s great to help customers through live chat. But should I not have spent the time fixing the very issues they complained about? Could someone else not have a friendly conversation and show them a link to the article in the knowledge base where all the steps were laid out? Most importantly, did it really need to be me?</p>



<p><strong>The Mistakes I Made When I Thought I Didn’t Need to Hire</strong></p>



<p>My first mistake was to think that it would only be reasonable to hire when there would be enough work for a full-time position. To this day, I don’t know why I didn’t think of hiring someone part-time, but to me, a job was a full-time endeavor. This resulted in a strange scenario: I never felt it would be enough work for a hire, because not only could I do it myself, but I would also fit other things into my workday. The fact that I worked 12 hours or more every day of the week seemed to not have registered in my entrepreneurial brain.</p>



<p>Hiring someone could have saved me countless hours of work every day, freeing my mind from focusing on the mundane parts of the business at all times. Sometimes, in between customer service chats, I would get a glimpse of what that life could be. I just shrugged it off, but I should have acted on that initial feeling and hired someone to help me.</p>



<p>My second mistake was to think that onboarding a new hire would be too much work. It turned out that waiting to onboard a new hire is even more work, as it just adds all the tasks you don’t get to delegate on top of the onboarding efforts. I completely misjudged how effective other people can be at learning a new task. I also underestimated the impact of being well-prepared by having built a sellable business.</p>



<p>If you’re using Standard Operating Procedures in your business, the effort of onboarding will be rather low, as you can just give the new employee access to the relevant processes and documentation. Provided that you created meaningful, exhaustive, and instructive documentation, your new hire can explore the scope of their job and prepare for what is to come.</p>



<p><strong>How and Whom to Hire</strong></p>



<p>You always hear that you should hire slowly. That’s true; you don’t want to waste resources when you could do it yourself or build automation to take care of it. But once you see that you’re stuck doing work you don’t enjoy that others could do for you, hire quickly.</p>



<p>Choosing what position to hire for will be a very subjective decision. After all, your preferences and tolerance for doing certain jobs are uniquely yours. Only you know when enough is enough.</p>



<p>In most SaaS businesses, customer service positions will be the first ones for which you may want to hire. While software can scale indefinitely, you can’t. Once your customer base grows, you can automate as much as possible, but there will still be unforeseen problems at random points in time. Finding someone to triage these issues and sending only the most important ones through to you will free up significant space on your calendar and in your mind.</p>



<p>Marketing and sales positions can also be hired for quite early. For all three roles, you, as a founder, must instill the voice and tone of the messaging into your early employees. Until now, you have always been yourself, speaking to the customers the way you speak. It’s essential to keep this style consistent.</p>



<p>Hire someone for the work that annoys you most. Repeat until you enjoy all the work you do.</p>



<p><strong>How to Find Your Perfect Hire</strong></p>



<p>There are two places that I recommend checking out before you head over to the regular job portals and recruiting agencies: expert communities and within your customer base. I’ve found both to yield excellent results in multiple startups I’ve been with.</p>



<p>Expert communities work extremely well for finding developers, designers, and marketers. As a bootstrapped founder, you are at least partially a developer, designer, and marketer. During your entrepreneurial journey, you will have encountered the communities where other professionals hang out. You will likely even have asked a few questions or chatted with other founders. When you are looking into hiring someone, go into the communities that you found most inviting, and offer the job there first. You’ll pre-filter your applicants that way, and have a much higher chance of finding someone who will fit your culture.</p>



<p>Your customers can be a hunting ground for potential employees as well. Particularly for marketing and customer service positions, there are a lot of opportunities when searching for candidates among your customers. No one knows more about the struggles and needs of your customers than your customers themselves. That makes them ideal candidates to take over the jobs that involve talking to prospective or existing patrons of your business. They speak their language, and they know their pain even more than you. They are destined to build bridges and foster relationships with people they innately understand.</p>



<p>I had great success with both kinds of communities both within FeedbackPanda and at a previous startup. Hiring customer service experts from within our customer base was particularly effective in both cases. If you find a person who is looking for something new and is already aware of your company, all it takes is for them to have a background in the field. As people change jobs every few years, it’s not uncommon to find a marketing expert who has become a teacher or a customer service professional who also is interested in local food logistics. You don’t know what talent slumbers among your customers until you ask.</p>



<p>It will always be hard to convince people to join a small business. You’ll need to have a good pitch ready, as you will need to convey your vision of the business and the part that your new employee will play. You’ll need to make clear how they can grow professionally in their new position. This may be a hard thing to verbalize, particularly when you’re looking for someone to take over tasks that you find tedious. But don’t worry, people love all kinds of work. That’s why we have accountants who actually enjoy their jobs. And after all, that’s what you want for your business: everyone should love all the work they’re doing. That’s why you’re hiring. You’re giving people who crave certain tasks a chance to do them for you, for your business, and ultimately for their own enjoyment and livelihood.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There is a wide variety of tools out there to deploy software to a Kubernetes cluster. In the context of these tools, even a new *Ops term emerged: <a href="https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitOps</a>. This article will not be another comparison of Kubernetes deployment tools but a comparison of the underlying deployment concepts.</p><h2>Deployment concepts (push and pull)</h2><p>In essence there are only two different approaches the tools use: push and pull. Both have their pros and cons. While researching these principles, we stumbled across <a href="https://medium.com/faun/gitops-comparison-pull-and-push-88fcbaadfe45" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this article</a>, which already explains nicely most of the aspects.</p><p>But in our opinion, it is missing some major problems with the pull approach. We think these problems are worth an article of its own rather than a comment on the above-mentioned article.</p><h2>The bootstrap problem</h2><p>What most pull-based deployment tools hide with some <code>kubectl</code> example is the problem that you have to somehow install them inside the Kubernetes cluster. This seems to be trivial at first glance, it’s just one command. But what about updates? Does your automation start after you manually configured your automation tool?</p><p>Some tools base their functionality on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Custom Resources</a> to configure the deployment pipelines. How do you update these pipelines?</p><p>Some might argue that you could solve these problems after you’ve overcome the initial bootstrap problem. But we will take a look at this in the next section.</p><h2>The rollout problem</h2><p>For me, one more drawback is the dynamic nature of Kubernetes clusters. Everyone talks about highly dynamic clusters which scale up and down or move pods to distribute the load. What happens to your pull deployment when the Pod, executing this deployment, has to move because the Kubernetes cluster or the cluster operator thinks so?</p><p>To be fair, this could also happen to push deployments in the form of disrupted network connections. But we think chances are higher for pull deployments to run into such problems as they are applying changes to the environment they are running in.</p><p>To come back to the above-mentioned bootstrap problem: what happens when an operator running inside the cluster tries to update itself?</p><p>Some might argue you could circumvent such problems with <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PodDisruptionBudget</a> or rolling updates, but what happens if your node crashes?</p><h2>The security concerns for push and pull</h2><p>Some people think the pull principle is more secure than the push principle because you don’t have credentials saved in your CI/CD system. But you could prevent this problem by combining your CI/CD pipeline with a proper secret management solution.</p><p>For the pull approach, your Kubernetes cluster contains an agent which is capable of changing things inside your cluster. Think back some months, when Helm v3 <a href="https://helm.sh/docs/faq/#changes-since-helm-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">removed Tiller</a> (an agent inside the Kubernetes cluster) because of security considerations. The security concerns that led to the complete removal of Tiller in Helm v3 are also valid for the pull-based deployment approach in general. Tiller was removed because it was difficult for operators to lock it down with RBAC to only let it do what it should be allowed to.</p><p>We think neither push nor pull is more secure than the other approach. It depends on how you implement and secure your environment.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>What should have been a comparison of Kubernetes deployment concepts might look like a rant against pull-based deployments. But that isn’t our intention. We wanted to make clear that pull cannot exist without some sort of push (for bootstrapping and maintenance). The other point is that the term GitOps is not bound to pull-based deployments, which was our impression when we read the Weave works blog posts. But, for example, Google combines <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/gitops-cloud-build#create_the_trigger_for_the_continuous_delivery_pipeline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitOps with a push-based</a> approach. <a href="https://twitter.com/vitorsilva/status/999978906903080961/photo/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This tweet</a> doesn’t contain push nor pull at all to explain GitOps. And finally, you might encounter a scenario where you have to use pull because you don’t have a setup where your CI infrastructure has network access to your Kubernetes cluster.</p><p>We hope this article helps to implement the right GitOps deployment solutions for your environment. It should help you get a better impression of the questions to ask and the decisions to take for the implementation.</p></div></div>]]>

		<div>
		<p><span>Security is one of the most important aspects of software development. Gone are the days when companies focused on the amount of code developers produce. Nowadays, they care about the quality and security of your code.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The increasing number of</span><a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-in-2019/"> <span>security breaches over the past years</span></a><span> is alarming. Too often, we hear scary stories about how millions of people’s personal information and financial records were exposed following a data breach. With this trend, every developer should focus on building more secure systems.</span></p>

<p><span>In this article, I will put together a list of practices that, in my view, offer a solid foundation for building more secure applications. Having worked with hundreds of developers in multiple companies for the past few decades, I’ve had the privilege to interact and learn a great deal from various development professionals.</span></p>

<p><span>So, here are my ground rules for writing more secure code.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><b>Secure By Design</b></h2>

<p><span>Writing</span><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.228.5794&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf#page=70"> <span>clean and secure code</span></a><span> begins long before creating the first class or forming the first loop. When designing systems, I see some architects focusing more on the functional requirements but sidelining the security side of things. They tend to assume that access controls and other security measures will be implemented later in the development stage.</span></p>

<p><span>This is wrong. Instead, development teams should embrace the</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_by_design"> <span>secure by design</span></a><span> concept during application development.</span></p>

<p><span>During the design stage, prepare a list of technical and regulatory security requirements for your project. Think of every component that will be used in application development, from the class-level language to API endpoint authorization.</span></p>

<p><span>Having security in mind right from project inception is the best way to eliminate weaknesses inherent in the architecture of a product. Furthermore, it becomes harder to implement security controls or address vulnerabilities as the system develops.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The most effective approach is enforcing security controls right from the design stage.</span></p>

<h2><b>Model Threats to Your Code</b></h2>

<p><span>Threat modeling is a cost-effective approach to implementing security in the application design phase. It involves identifying potential threats to software, analyzing their risks, and developing mitigations strategies to be implemented in the design, coding, and testing stages.</span></p>

<p><span>By modeling threats to your code, you can anticipate the kind of threats that may affect your application way before coding begins. For instance, if you deal with credit card numbers, personally identifiable information, or intellectual property, it will be easier to identify possible security risks and devise ways of protecting your application.</span></p>

<p><span>If you can imagine an attack on your code, you can keep the threat in mind when designing and implementing the system.</span></p>

<h2><b>Don’t Trust User Data</b></h2>

<p><span>If you look at the vast majority of software vulnerabilities, you will realize they share a common trait in that they stem from</span><a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html"> <span>improper input validation</span></a><span>. Think of SQL injections, cross-site scripting, LDAP injections, xPath injections, buffer overflow, uncontrolled string format, and other common security gaps.</span></p>
<p><span>So, I’ll insist on this – always treat all input as untrusted until proven otherwise. Sometimes being skeptical pays. As long as the data is coming from an external source, there’s every reason to verify it.&nbsp; This should be done regardless of whether the input comes from environment variables, network interfaces, command line arguments, or user controlled files.</span></p>

<p><span>When developing a PHP application, for instance, you need to validate several elements. Here is an example class you can call to validate user input from your forms.</span></p>



	</div>
	</div>
</section><section id="b-text-2">
	<div>
		<div>
		<h2><span>the</span><span> Principle </span><span>o</span><span>f Least Privilege</span></h2>
<div>
<p><span>Some developers give users access to all features and permissions they might need to avoid restructuring their code in the future. This leaves a pathway that attackers can abuse upon getting their hands on your system.</span></p>

<p><span>A good practice is to limit privileges by giving each account the appropriate</span> <span>(least)</span><span> amount of privilege. Access within applications should be designed in a way that attackers are denied most functionalities.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Ideally, base your access controls on permission as opposed to exclusion. In doing this, access is denied by default so that the protection scheme will determine the conditions under which access is granted.</span></p>


<h2><span>Sanitize Data Sent </span><span>to</span><span> Other Systems</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Data passed to an output subsystem may contain malicious content, especially if it originates from an untrusted source. If not escaped or sanitized properly, this data can be used to facilitate injection attacks. For this reason, output sanitization as vital as proper input validation to prevent attacks.</p>
<div>

<p><span>To prevent attackers from taking advantage of unused functionality in output data, always sanitize the data before invoking another system component. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The only code that can identify malicious characters is the code responsible for output in a given context. This is where you should add a contextual escaping functionality before displaying data to the user.</span></p>

<p><span>For instance, when building SQL, you can use parameterized query features to ensure proper escaping:</span></p>

</div>




<p><span>Below is a simple non-compliant code that uses the </span><span><a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/spring-mvc-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="https://www.javatpoint.com/spring-mvc-tutorial">Java MVC concept</a></span><span> to display data to users without escaping or encoding it. The code below sends data to a web browser, which means it is subject to XSS and HTML injection attacks.</span></p>




	</div>
	</div>
</section><section id="b-text-3">
	<div>
		<div>
		<p><span>To fix this, I can create a ValidateOutput class that will normalize the output and sanitize it using a whitelist. Note that you can use a different whitelisting pattern depending on your output fields.</span></p>



<h2><b>Adopt Secure Coding Standards</b></h2>

<p><span>Every developer has been in at least one lecture about</span><a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/How_to_write_insecure_code"> <span>secure coding practices</span></a><span>. It might get boring, but it’s important to safeguard your code.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Some secure coding standards you should follow at every stage of the application development process include:</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span>Avoid using language functions and other components with known security vulnerabilities.</span></li>
<li><span>Use proper encyprion techniques to protect user data.</span></li>
<li><span>Avoid revealing internal implementation through error messages.</span></li>
<li><span>Do not implement your own authentication and authorization system. Instead, consider adding an extra security layer through 2-factor authentication.</span></li>
<li><span>Effective monitoring and logging of user activity.</span></li>
<li><span>Scan and analyze your codebase for dependency vulnerabilities.</span></li>
<li><span>Stay on top of security releases.</span></li>
<li><span>Perform quality assurance checks through rigorous testing and source code audits.</span></li>
<li><span>Integrate the right security tools in your IDE, source repository, bug tracking systems, and other environments used during development.</span></li>
<li><span>Make necessary security documentation.</span></li>

<h2><b>Wrap Up</b></h2>

<p><span>Code security is the ultimate measure of code quality, and it’s not hard to achieve. I’ve seen most of my colleagues complicate stuff by overthinking secure designs. At the end, they have a strangely complex system that’s even harder to secure.</span></p>

<p><span>The best approach is keeping your designs as simple as you possible. This way, you can understand and prove the security of your system.</span></p>

<p><span>Embrace the above practices as you write your code. It’s a sure way of contributing to a safer world today.</span></p>

<p>Ever seen a Sprint board that’s a big bucket of completely unrelated tickets? For many teams, that describes pretty much all of them. I call them Mishmash Sprints. These teams have skipped over one of my favorite parts of Scrum: the Sprint Goal.</p>



<p>The Scrum Guide defines the <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#:~:text=The%20Sprint%20Goal%20is%20an%20objective%20set%20for%20the%20Sprint%20that%20can%20be%20met%20through%20the%20implementation%20of%20Product%20Backlog.">Sprint Goal</a> as:</p>



<blockquote><p>The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog. It <strong>provides guidance</strong> to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment. It is created during the Sprint Planning meeting. The Sprint Goal <strong>gives the Development Team some flexibility</strong> regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint. The selected Product Backlog items deliver one coherent function, which can be the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Goal can be any other coherence that causes the Development Team to <strong>work together rather than on separate initiatives</strong>.</p><cite>The Scrum Guide (emphasis mine)</cite></blockquote>



<p>It’s right there in core Scrum, but many so-called “Scrum Teams” ignore it. That’s a crying shame. The Sprint Goal is a game changer for those teams because it brings:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Team cohesiveness</strong>. When everyone is working towards the same goal each sprint, there’s not nearly as much siloing. Teams jell faster. Work is more visible. The number of “only Susan knows how to do that” things goes down.</li><li><strong>Less work in progress</strong>. Mishmash Sprints lead to long cycle times for features. When the team works on 10 goals at once, it takes 10 times as long for the team to finish any of them. Remember that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development#Eliminate_waste">WIP is waste</a> and cut it out!</li><li><strong>An actual valuable iteration</strong>. When each Sprint completes a real goal, then you can be sure that you’re actually delivering value with each iteration. Mishmash Sprints often don’t deliver value until it all comes together at the end of the project. That’s not Agile, that’s Waterfall.</li><li><strong>Development Team ownership</strong>. “The Sprint Goal <em>gives the Development Team some flexibility</em> regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint”. With the Sprint Goal as the guiding light, the Development Team (consulting with the Product Owner) can decide how that goal should be achieved. Mishmash Sprints make it too easy for developers to be ticket takers and code monkeys.</li></ul>



<p>If you’re struggling to come up with a Sprint Goal, just ask yourself: if we only had one more sprint to work on this before launching, what would be the most important thing to do? There’s your Sprint Goal.</p>

            <div><div>
  <div><p>OK. What is hashing? Let's just take a look.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>hash("thomas hartman") =&gt; b73d127e8e76ff01b5cb833980b9712cf1dbc92064b1d2fae700105c8227121b</p></div><div><p>This beast is a 64 digit hex number. Instead of the usual 10 digits 0-9, it has the 16 digits 0-9a-f. But, it's just a number. In decimal it would be</p></div><div><p>82881156605080050388863774003735601367246355697689529077366882559854056509979</p></div><div><p>You could also use 1s and 0s, in which case there would be 256 binary 0-1 digits (bits). I'm going to go back to using hex because it will make googling for historically important hashes easier, further on. </p></div><div><p>Hashing takes some some data, my name in this case, and applies some gnarly, but basic -- but tedious -- arithmetic and cut paste type transformations to produce a 256 bit numerical output. The transformation has a lot of steps but is <a href="https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/SHA-256">completely deterministic</a>. You could do it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3dqhixzGVo">by hand</a> if you were extremely careful, and extremely patient. It takes 10 hours for a human to compute a hash using pen and graph paper. My MacBook computes a hash in microseconds. </p></div><div><p>There are hundreds of websites where you play around with hashing, and reproduce the hashes we will be discussing. Just google for "sha256 calculator".</p></div><div><p>You could think of a hash as a kind of fingerprint for some arbitrary data. It is theoretically possible, but in practice impossible, for two inputs to hash to the same result. And you can't reverse a hash. If I present you with f04b773b796ddb607c9c0df477b4738a690a626e49f59bc91a37dd0cd05b70eeÂ&nbsp; and ask you to come up with an input that hashes to that, you will never, ever, find one. Unless you have a multi trillion years life span and galactic core black hole level of energy. Then, I suppose, you would get it eventually. Or, I could tell you a secret...</p></div><div><p>hash("joshua summers") =&gt; f04b773b796ddb607c9c0df477b4738a690a626e49f59bc91a37dd0cd05b70eeÂ&nbsp; </p></div><div><p>Moving on, if you tweak the data in a tiny way, say by tacking on the string "123" at the end, you get a completely different result.</p></div><div><p>hash("joshua summers" + "123") =&gt; hash("joshua summers123") =&gt; 304d0d26fd5ebb3bd3f56fcb48f6fdc6c8b0dbf9be088b34835b3ec988be1ab7</p></div><div><p>Completely different looking from the original "joshua summers" hash. We call "123" a nonce. A bit of NONSEnse data that you tack onto some fixed data, that is, data that you care about. The nonce can change and it doesn't matter. The fixed data matters, so it can't change.</p></div><div><p>Hashing always produces a 64 hex digit output. What if we had some fixed data ("joshua summers"), and we wanted a nonce that would make the first digit of the resulting hash 0? "123" didn't work. The first digit of the resulting hash was 3. Let's keep looking... sitting at my macbook, I try nonces manually by incrementing 123 until...</p></div><div><p>hash("joshua summers" + "134") =&gt; hash("joshua summers134") =&gt; </p></div><div><p>0120353865b8576fc09988444bdeed6f44a1d9433a7058064911d66eafda43e3</p></div><div><p>Found one! Took eleven tries. (134-123)</p></div><div><p>And that is hash mining. By producing a nonce and a hash with zero in the first digit, I PROVED I did some WORK connected to the fixed data. The nonce with the hash is like a stamp of authenticity that proves that, for some reason, I care about sacrificing some work attached to the fixed data "joshua summers".</p></div><div><p>Work is another word for energy. Each hash costs my macbook battery a tiny bit of chemical energy. Recall, I could do this by hand instead of using a computer,Â&nbsp; taking 10 hours for each try. I would need feeding, since eleven hashes on graph paper would keep me busy (going slowly insane) for four days. Like my macbook, my body needs energy to hash. </p></div><div><p>On average, I would expect to have to try 16 nonces to get a hit. I got slightly lucky with 11 nonces. If you asked me for a hash that starts with 2 zeros, I would expect to have to try 16 times more nonces, 256 instead of 16. The more zeros, the more energy. </p></div><div><p>For all my hashes, you need to compute just one hash to convince yourself that my work was valid. The proof had better be cheaper than the work (and it is). Just as assaying gold to stop counterfeiters had better be cheaper than digging the gold itself up, or why bother. </p></div><div><p>Now let's talk about bitcoin. With bitcoin mining, instead of your name, the fixed data is an "unconfirmed" (ie unstamped) block. An unconfirmed block is a group of bitcoin ledger transactions, along with a hash of the previous confirmed (stamped) block. The link to the previous block, via that block's hash, is what forges individual blocks into a blockchain. Miners try nonces till they find a stamp (nonce + hash) for that unstamped block that proves they did some work. It is the same as in the example I gave before, just with more zeros. </p></div><div><p>Visually, the difficulty condition is a bunch of zeros at the beginning of the hash. The more zeros required, the more valuable the stamp. Each additional zero makes the search for the stamp 16 times harder. </p></div><div><p>In 2009, the very first bitcoin block, called the genesis block, hashed to </p></div><div><p>000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f (google this) </p></div><div><p>Satoshi mined this block. I picture him with a bunch of scavenged laptops in his mother's basement. He uses multiple laptops to try as many nonces as possible, all hashing at the same time, working in parallel. </p></div><div><p>There are ten zeros of difficulty required for this first block.</p></div><div><p>16*16*16*16*16*16*16*16*16*16 =&gt; 1,099,511,627,776</p></div><div><p>So, satoshi had to try a trillion more nonces than I just did to find a nonce that worked. It took satoshi and his little cluster of computers (his mine) about ten minutes to crack this first block. This is specified in the bitcoin protocol. Blocks should take ten minutes, on average.</p></div><div><p>The energy spent to to find the nonce makes the block precious. Like the diesel spent on earthmoving equipment to find gold makes gold precious. Gold is a precious metal. A bitcoin block hash is a precious number. The more zeros you see at the beginning of a block hash, the more precious the hash. </p></div><div><p>Now let's look at a recent hash, from today (2020)</p></div><div><p>0000000000000000000081f22162e5603c4349b66f12a6b4f4274dff14bdc3bc (you can google this too)</p></div><div><p>It doesn't look that different. It's just 20 zeros instead of 10. But, as we saw before, ten zeros means a trillion times harder. If modern miners were using the same hardware as satoshi, that would be a trillion times as many computers mining, to find the hash in the same ten minutes. A trillion times as much electricity. In fact it's a bit less than that. Modern miners use special single purpose computers, called asics, that are a lot more energy efficient than the general purpose CPUs satoshi started out with. But it's still an enormous amount of hardware and electricity, trying an enormous number of nonces, to solve the next block.</p></div><div><p>All these giant warehouses full of racks and racks of miners are hashing away, because if you solve a block stamp, you receive a block reward of 6.25 bitcoin (currently), plus some transaction fees. Altogether it's about $60k, up for grabs every ten minutes. So, mining is a lottery that pays $60k every ten minutes. If the price of bitcoin goes up, or even if people just expect it to, more miners join. Bitcoin starts to be found too quickly... nine minutes instead of ten minutes... eight minutes... then the protocol adjusts to require enough zerosÂ&nbsp; so he block time goes back to ten minutes. (Slightly hand waving there, but close enough.) This difficulty adjustment happens every two weeks. The increased difficulty (more zeros) means bitcoin got more secure, and this in turn drives price goes up. </p></div><div><p>This is the double ratchet effect that I believe will continue until bitcoin occupies its market niche and replaces money as a global utility in a decade or so. It's worked so far. Three more zeros in the difficulty (around 4000x increase in difficulty) and bitcoin has replaced printed fiat from central banks. ($10 million/bitcoin, as opposed to around $10k today.) It may feel like a lot of ground to cover, but if you just count zeros in the difficulty, bitcoin has practically already won.</p></div><div><p>As mentioned before, each block includes the hash of the previous block. This makes a sequence of blocks, that is, a chain. A blockchain is a chain of blocks. Blocks are expensive.Â&nbsp; So a blockchain is very expensive. </p></div><div><p>The bitcoin protocol says the most expensive blockchain in terms of physical energy, measured in total hashes,Â&nbsp; is the true gold. There can be only one most expensive chain. This is extremely important. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J3VeogFUOs">There can be only one</a>. </p></div><div><p>An unconfirmed block has no proof of work, so you can't trust the transactions in it if someone just paid you with one of them. The miners haven't approved it. There is no work behind it. So, these expensive stamps of approvals that each block gets (the precious hashes) prevent cheating, that is, double spending the same bitcoin. Mining is a security system. Miners are the bodyguards of bitcoin. </p></div><div><p>You have toÂ&nbsp; pay your bodyguards, or they turn on you. In fact, the largest bitcoin miner, Bitmain, attacked bitcoin in 2017. As the whitepaper foretold, the attack failed. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of hashes were sacrificed for nothing, and bitmain was nearly driven into bankruptcy. Bodyguards are not hired for their brains. </p></div><div><p>Anyways, miners are paid in block reward, which is newly minted bitcoin, plus transaction fees. The bitcoin supply is finite, with minting scheduled to end in the year 2140. The reward halves every 4 years. For bitcoin to succeed, the transaction fees have to be sufficiently high to motivate miners to keep working hard enough to make bitcoin safe after the block reward eventually goes away. Transaction fees may ultimately stabilize at thousands of dollars per transaction (pennies now). Only power users like banks and pension funds will then be able to afford the blockchain. </p></div><div><p>If this happens, and I think it will, most users will never touch the blockchain directly, but will use second layer systems such as lightning. So far, the gradual replacement of block rewards with transaction fees appears to be working …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>The M/M/c model may not behave like you expect.</p>


<p>I have a system with <code>c</code> servers, each of which can only handle a single concurrent request, and has no internal queuing. The servers sit behind a load balancer, which contains an infinite queue. An unlimited number of clients offer <code>c * 0.8</code> requests per second to the load balancer on average. In other words, we increase the offered load linearly with <code>c</code> to keep the per-server load constant. Once a request arrives at a server, it takes one second to process, on average. How does the client-observed mean request time vary with <code>c</code>?</p>

<p><img src="https://mbrooker-blog-images.s3.amazonaws.com/erlang_c_plot.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Option A is that the mean latency decreases quickly, asymptotically approaching one second as <code>c</code> increases (in other words, the time spent in queue approaches zero). Option B is constant. Option C is a linear improvement, and D is a linear degradation in latency. Which curve do you, intuitively, think that the latency will follow?</p>

<p>I asked my Twitter followers the same question, and got an interestingly mixed result:
<img src="https://mbrooker-blog-images.s3.amazonaws.com/erlang_twitter_poll.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Breaking down the problem a bit will help figure out which is the right answer. First, names. In the terminology of queue theory, this is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M/M/c_queue">M/M/c</a> queuing system: Poisson arrival process, exponentially distributed client service time, and <code>c</code> backend servers. In teletraffic engineering, it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agner_Krarup_Erlang">Erlang's</a> delay system (or, because terminology is fun, M/M/n). We can use a classic result of queuing theory to analyze this system: Erlang's C formula <em>E<sub>2,n</sub>(A)</em>, which calculates the probability that an incoming customer request is enqueued (rather than handled immediately), based on the number of servers (<code>n</code> aka <code>c</code>), and the offered traffic <code>A</code>. For the details, see page 194 of the <a href="https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-d/opb/stg/D-STG-SG02.16.1-2001-PDF-E.pdf">Teletraffic Engineering Handbook</a>. Here's the basic shape of the curve (using our same parameters):</p>

<p><img src="https://mbrooker-blog-images.s3.amazonaws.com/erlang_c_result.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Follow the blue line up to half the saturation point, at 2.5 rps offered load, and see how the probability is around 13%. Now look at the purple line at half its saturation point, at 5 rps. Just 3.6%. So at half load the 5-server system is handling 87% of traffic without queuing, with double the load and double the servers, we handle 96.4% without queuing. Which means only 3.6% see any additional latency.</p>

<p>It turns out this improvement is, indeed, asymptotically approaching 1. The right answer to the Twitter poll is A.</p>

<p>Using the mean to measure latency is controversial (although <a href="http://brooker.co.za/blog/2017/12/28/mean.html">perhaps it shouldn't be</a>). To avoid that controversy, we need to know whether the percentiles get better at the same rate. Doing that in closed form is somewhat complicated, but this system is super simple, so we can plot them out using a Monte-Carlo simulation. The results look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://mbrooker-blog-images.s3.amazonaws.com/sim_result.png" alt=""></p>

<p>That's entirely good news. The median (p50) follows the mean line nicely, and the high percentiles (99<sup>th</sup> and 99.9<sup>th</sup>) have a similar shape. No hidden problems.</p>

<p>It's also good news for cloud and service economics. With larger <code>c</code> we get better latency at the same utilization, or better utilization for the same latency, all at the same per-server throughput. That's not good news only for giant services, because most of this goodness happens at relatively modest <code>c</code>. There are few problems related to scale and distributed systems that get easier as <code>c</code> increases. This is one of them.</p>

<p>There are some reasonable follow-up questions. Are the results robust to our arbitrary choice of 0.8? Yes, they are<sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>. Are the M/M/c assumptions of Poisson arrivals and exponential service time reasonable for typical services? I'd say they are reasonable, albeit wrong. Exponential service time is especially wrong: realistic services tend to be something more like log-normal. It may not matter. More on that another time.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> Dan Ports responded to my thread with a fascinating <a href="https://twitter.com/danrkports/status/1291517540280070144">Twitter thread</a> pointing to <a href="https://drkp.net/papers/latency-socc14.pdf">Tales of the Tail: Hardware, OS, and Application-level Sources of Tail Latency</a> from SoCC'14 which looks at this effect in the wild.</p>

<p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><a name="foot1"></a> Up to a point. As soon as the mean arrival rate exceeds the system's ability to complete requests, the queue grows without bound and latency goes to infinity. In our case, that happens when the request load exceeds <code>c</code>. More generally, for this system to be stable <code>λ/cμ</code> must be less than 1, where <code>λ</code> is the mean arrival rate, and <code>μ</code> is the mean time taken for a server to process a request.</li>
</ol>

Whether an update becomes visible sooner rather than later depends on the guarantees offered by the database. </p><p>Some databases come with counter-intuitive consistency guarantees to provide high availability and performance.

    </span></p><p>The best guarantee a database can provide is that the request executes somewhere between its invocation and completion time. You might think that this doesn’t look like a big deal - after all, it’s what you are used to when writing single-threaded applications - if you assign 1 to x and read its value right after, you expect to find 1 in there, assuming there is no other thread writing to the same variable. But, once you start dealing with data stores that replicate their state on multiple machines for high availability and scalability, all bets are off. To understand why that’s the case, we will explore the trade-offs a system designer has to make to implement reads in a simplified model of a distributed database.</p><p>Suppose we have a distributed key-value store, which is composed of a set of replicas. The replicas elect a leader among themselves, which is the only node that can accept writes. When the leader receives a write request, it broadcasts it asynchronously to the other replicas. Although all replicas receive the same updates in the same order, they do so at different times. </p><p>You are tasked to come up with a strategy to handle read requests - how would you go about it? Well, a read can potentially be served by the leader or a replica. If all reads were to go through the leader, the throughput would be limited by what a single node can handle. Alternatively, any replica could serve any read request - that would definitely scale, but then two clients, or observers, could have a different view of the system’s state, as replicas can lag behind the leader and between them.</p><p>Intuitively, there is a trade-off between how consistent the observers’ views of the system are, and the system’s performance and availability. To understand this relationship, we need to define precisely what we mean by consistency. We will do so with the help of <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency">consistency models</a>, which formally define the possible views of the system’s state observers can experience. </p><h2 id="strong-consistency"><a href="#strong-consistency" aria-label="strong consistency permalink"></a>Strong Consistency</h2><p>If clients send writes and reads exclusively to the leader, then every request appears to take place atomically at a very specific point in time as if there was a single copy of the data. No matter how many replicas there are or how far behind they are lagging, as long as the clients always query the leader directly, from their point of view there is a single copy of data.</p><p>Because a request is not served instantaneously, and there is a single node serving it, the request executes somewhere between its invocation and completion time. Another way to think about it is that once a request completes, it’s side-effects are visible to all observers:</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>Since a request becomes visible to all other participants between its invocation and completion time, there is a real-time guarantee that must be enforced - this guarantee is formalized by a consistency model called <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency/models/linearizable">linearizability</a>, or strong consistency. Linearizability is the strongest consistency guarantee a system can provide for single-object requests. </p><p>What if the client sends a read request to the leader, but by the time the request gets there, the server that received the request thinks it’s still the leader, but it actually was deposed? If the ex-leader was to process the request, the system would no longer be strongly consistent. To guard against this case, the presumed leader first needs to contact a majority of the replicas to confirm whether it still is the leader. Only then is it allowed to execute the request and send back the response to the client. This considerably increases the time required to serve a read.</p><h2 id="sequential-consistency"><a href="#sequential-consistency" aria-label="sequential consistency permalink"></a>Sequential Consistency</h2><p>So far, we have discussed serializing all reads through the leader. But doing so creates a single chokepoint, which limits the system’s throughput. On top of that, the leader needs to contact a majority of replicas to handle a read. To increase the read performance, we could allow the replicas to handle requests as well.</p><p>Even though a replica can lag behind the leader, it will always receive new updates in the same order as the leader. If a client A only ever queries replica 1, and client B only ever queries replica 2, the two clients will see the state evolving at different times, as replicas are not entirely in sync:</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>The consistency model in which operations occur in the same order for all observers, but doesn’t provide any real-time guarantee about when an operation’s side-effect becomes visible to the observers, is called <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency/models/sequential">sequential consistency</a>. The lack of real-time guarantees is what differentiates sequential consistency with linearizability. </p><p>A simple application of this model is a producer/consumer system synchronized with a queue - a producer node writes items to the queue, which a consumer reads. The producer and the consumer see the items in the same order, but the consumer lags behind the producer.</p><h2 id="eventual-consistency"><a href="#eventual-consistency" aria-label="eventual consistency permalink"></a>Eventual Consistency</h2><p>Although we managed to increase the read throughput, we had to pin clients to replicas - what if a replica goes down? We could increase the availability of the store by allowing a client to query any replica. But, this comes at a steep price in terms of consistency. Say there are two replicas 1 and 2, where replica 2 lags behind replica 1. If a client queries replica 1 and right after replica 2, it will see a state from the past, which can be very confusing. The only guarantee a client has is that eventually, all replicas will converge to the final state if the writes to the system stop. This consistency model is called eventual consistency. </p><p>It’s challenging to build applications on top of an eventually consistent data store because the behavior is different from the one you are used to when writing single-threaded applications. Subtle bugs can creep up that are hard to debug and to reproduce. Yet, in eventual consistency’s defense, not all applications require linearizability. You need to make the conscious choice whether the guarantees offered by your data store, or lack thereof, satisfy your application’s requirements. An eventually consistent store is perfectly fine if you want to keep track of the number of users visiting your website, as it doesn’t really matter if a read returns a number that is slightly out of date. But for a payment processor, you definitely want strong consistency.</p><h2 id="pacelc-theorem"><a href="#pacelc-theorem" aria-label="pacelc theorem permalink"></a>PACELC Theorem</h2><p>There are more <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency">consistency models</a> than the ones presented in this post. Still, the main intuition behind them is the same: the stronger the consistency guarantees are, the higher the latency of individual operations is, and the less available the store becomes when failures happen. This relationship is formalized by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PACELC_theorem">PACELC theorem</a>. It states that in case of network partitioning (P) in a distributed computer system, one has to choose between availability (A) and consistency (C), but else (E), even when the system is running normally in the absence of partitions, one has to choose between latency (L) and consistency (C). </p><p>In my <a href="https://systemdesignmanual.com/">system design book</a>, I explore other tunable trade-offs data stores make to guarantee high availability and performance, like the isolation guarantees that prevent a group of operations within a transaction from interfering with other concurrently running transactions. </p><hr></article></div>]]>

<p>Julia programming has quickly gained traction in the data science community due to numerous advantages such as speed and usability over Python and other prominent programming languages. And in a continuous effort, Julia Computing has further improved the Julia programming language and released its latest version — 1.5 — earlier this week.</p>



<p>The release of Julia 1.5 has a lot of significant advancements like struct layout and allocation optimizations, multithreading API stabilization and improvements, per-module optimization levels, other latency improvements, implicit keyword argument values, the return of “soft scope” in the REPL, faster random numbers, automated rr-based bug reports, among others.</p>



<p>Julia programming language’s update doesn’t usually aim at specific features but follows timed releases. However, this time around, there are major features updates that one must know.</p>



<p><strong>Also Read</strong>: <a href="https://www.analyticsdrift.com/openai-invites-for-its-scholars-program-will-pay-10k-per-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenAI Invites For It’s Scholars Program, Will Pay $10K Per Month</a></p>



<h3><strong>Allocation Optimizations</strong></h3>



<p>One of the most relevant updates is the ‘struct layout and allocation optimizations.’ According to Julia Computing, this was a long-desired optimization that significantly reduced heap allocations. As Julia programming language has both mutable and immutable objects that enable flexibility to programmers in using objects according to their requirement, handling immutable objects has significant limitations.</p>



<p>When an immutable object is pointed to a heap-allocated mutable object, it would need to be heap-allocated too. To address this challenge, Jameson Nash enhanced the compiler’s performance as it would now track multiple roots inside object fields. This simplified the use of immutable objects irrespective of the type of object it is pointing to.</p>



<h3><strong>Multithreading API</strong></h3>



<p>Threading was introduced in v0.5 for enabling parallelism to increase performance. Over the last couple of releases, the threading was added with safety and new features. One of the major use cases was the multithreaded CSV parsing, which provides an edge to Julia programming language from other data science-friendly languages.</p>



<p>After being labeled as ‘experimental’ for years, it has been moved to a stable category with newer updates: improved safety for top-level expressions (type definition, global assignments, modules), improvements to task switch performance, and more.</p>



<h3><strong>Per-Module Optimization</strong></h3>



<p>Julia programming language uses -O2 optimization, which is similar to -O2 in GCC or clang. Although this method is effective while setting up benchmarks, for some plotting and non-inner-loop support tasks, -O2 is not the ideal optimization as it delays the process. Consequently, Julia programming language introduced -O1 optimization level that can be used to provide level hints in each module.</p>



<p>While there are other updates like default package manager and faster random number generation, we listed the most important enhancements. However, you can read more <a href="https://julialang.org/blog/2020/08/julia-1.5-highlights/#per-module_optimization_levels">here</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
 		
<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>Sparked by <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1273307320911450112">an interesting Twitter discussion</a>, I’ve spent a lot of time recently thinking about different proof-of-work mechanisms. </p>



<p>When I say proof-of-work, I’m not talking about consensus algorithms like the ones that some crypto currencies use. I’m talking about social networks.</p>



<p>At their core, social networks are primarily about one thing: Building social capital through signaling. As I wrote in <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling as a Service</a>, signaling can be broken down into three different components:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Signaling Message</strong><br>A hidden status subtext you’re trying to convey about yourself</li><li><strong>Signaling Distribution</strong><br>The channel through which you’re communicating your signaling message</li><li><strong>Signaling Amplification</strong><br>Ways to boost your signaling message to compete against status rivals</li></ul>



<p>For example: A Patagonia vest signals both a prosocial attitude (<em>“I care about the environment</em>“) as well as wealth (“<em>I can afford to spend $500 on a jacket</em>“). Depending on where you live, it might also signal something about <a href="https://vcstarterkit.com/">your occupation</a>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/patagucci.png"></p><p>In order to signal these messages to others and build actual social capital you need a signaling distribution channel. One option would be to wear the vest in public where others can see it – but there are obvious physical constraints to the size of the audience you’d be able to reach.</p>



<p>This is where social networks come in.</p>



<p>Their primary role is to distribute signaling messages at scale and transform them into quantifiable social capital (in the form of likes and followers).</p>



<p>As social networks grow, they increase the potential reach of your signaling messages – but they also get crowded with status rivals. This is why social networks typically provide you with a set of signaling amplification tools. These tools help you boost your signaling messages and stand out from the crowd.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling as a Service</a> I compared signaling amplification to <a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service">Eugene Wei’s idea of proof-of-work hurdles</a>, which he describes as follows:</p>



<p><i>Almost every social network of note had an early signature proof of work hurdle. For Facebook it was posting some witty text-based status update. For Instagram, it was posting an interesting square photo. For Vine, an entertaining 6-second video. For Twitter, it was writing an amusing bit of text of 140 characters or fewer. Pinterest? Pinning a compelling photo. You can likely derive the proof of work for other networks like Quora and Reddit and Twitch and so on. Successful social networks don’t pose trick questions at the start, it’s usually clear what they want from you.</i></p>



<p>But the more I think about it, the less I like the comparison. I actually think that Eugene’s proof-of-work theory only scratches the surface of what social networks actually do.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>02</span> A closer look at proof mechanisms</p>



<p>Take a look at this very cliché Instagram picture. The photographer clearly put a lot of thought and effort into its composition and applied different filters and editing tools to make it look nicer.</p>



<figure>
<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/creativework.png">
<figcaption><span>Full disclosure: I actually took this picture from Unsplash. No influencers were harmed during the production of this blog post.<br></span>
</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s a perfect example of Eugene’s definition of proof-of-work. <br>Proof-of-<strong><em>creative</em></strong>-work, to be more exact. </p>



<p>Editing your photo helps to amplify your signaling message and sets you apart within Instagram’s status arena (aka the newsfeed). It also adds additional signaling messages to your post: <em>“Look how great a photographer I am”</em> or <em>“I’m a creative person”</em>.</p>



<p>But those are not the main signaling messages you are communicating here. What you really want to tell your followers with this photo is something along the lines of <em>“I’m a world-traveler”</em> and <em>“I’m in a happy relationship”</em> <span>(which in turn are also just signaling proxies for wealth and mating worthiness)</span>. </p>



<p>The photo and the location tag are your proof points.</p>



<figure><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/igexample02-1.png">
<figcaption><span>If you look closely, you’ll notice additional hidden signaling messages in the form of Allbirds sneakers and what’s most likely a Patagonia vest → proof-of-ownership<br></span>
</figcaption></figure>



<p>Social networks are therefore not only signaling distribution (and amplification) networks – they also allow users to prove their signaling messages. </p>



<p>The creative proof-of-work is just pretext and helps to boost your post. What’s more important are the additional proof mechanisms that social networks provide. In the case of Instagram those are photos and location tags.</p>



<p>Instagram is essentially “pics or it didn’t happen”-as-a-service.</p>



<p><span>03</span> Implications for new social networks</p>



<p>When new social networks emerge they have to introduce new proof mechanisms to differentiate themselves from existing incumbents. These can either be novel proof-of-creative-work hurdles or completely new proof-of-x mechanisms.</p>



<p>TikTok is a good example for proof-of-<em>creative</em>-work innovation. The app provides creators with a powerful set of video editing tools that have opened a whole new level of creativity. </p>



<p>The cost to participate in TikTok’s status game is a lot higher than Instagram’s <span>(compare a well-made dance choreography on TikTok to your median Instagram travel post)</span> – but its powerful feed algorithms also make discovery easier and thus reward users faster and with more social capital. </p>



<p>TikTok doesn’t add any new proof points beyond its novel creative work hurdle though. You can signal and prove your creativity but you could achieve the same by uploading your video to Instagram.</p>



<p>Strava, on the other hand, introduced an entirely new proof mechanism: Proof-of-physical-activity. By using your phone’s GPS sensor (or a 3rd-party fitness tracker), users can actually prove how much and fast they ran or cycled. In contrast to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/20/grounded-private-jet-hire-helps-russians-fake-lavish-lifestyles/">Instagram</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/da/article/wdaqgw/instagrams-ballers-discount-private-jets-324">photos</a>, Strava’s proof mechanism is a lot harder to fake <span>(though there are <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fake+strava+5k+downhill&amp;oq=fake+strava+5k+downhill">exceptions</a>)</span>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stravaproof.png"></p><p>What’s great about Strava is that it reinforces a behavior that’s actually good for you: While the status game that initially got you into the app might be zero sum, the actual physical exercise you have to put in to compete has a very positive, compounding effect.</p>



<p>The question is: What other social networks should we build that could have similar positive feedback loops? And what are their proof mechanisms?</p>



<p><span>04</span> Strava for X</p>



<p>Let’s start with the two examples in <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1273307320911450112">this tweet</a>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tweetstrava.png"></p><p>I love the idea of a <strong>Strava for Cooking</strong> – but I’m very skeptical that it can be built. Why? Because the necessary proof mechanisms don’t exist.</p>



<p>The primary metric you optimize on when cooking is taste. But how would you measure or quantify taste? The closest proxy to taste that we have is optics: How good does the meal that you cooked look? This can easily be proved with a photo .. but that’s a proof-of-work mechanism that Instagram already offers (including filters to make your food look nicer). As long as no one comes up with a better proof mechanism for cooking, I think it’s unlikely that we will see a successful social network in the space.</p>



<p>I’m more optimistic about <strong>Strava for Learning</strong>.</p>



<p>While the activity of learning itself might be hard to quantify, you can measure the outcome of learning: knowledge. Has anyone built a multiplayer version of <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> yet? Flash cards would be a perfect proof-of-knowledge mechanism and could easily be turned into a game where you compete against friends.</p>



<p>Similar to physical activity in the Strava example, learning is not something that most people enjoy doing. As TikTok founder <a href="https://youtu.be/wTyg2E44pBA?t=245">Alex Zhu points out</a>, education goes a little against human nature. In combination with a strong enough signaling mechanism however, you can get users to participate. It’s kind of the opposite of <a href="https://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network">Chris Dixon’s famous “Come for the tool, stay for the network” strategy</a>. Come for the status, stay for the tool.</p>



<p>A related product I’d love to see is <strong>Strava for Reading</strong>. Imagine an eBook reader that not only tracks how much time you spend reading but also *what* you are reading. Based on these proof-of-(reading)-work mechanisms you could build streaks or GitHub-contributions-like visualizations that incentivize users to read more (and more regularly).</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/githubforreading.png"></p><p>You could even build leaderboards for different topics based on the content of the books and articles you read. Or think about a score that indicated how balanced your reading behavior per topic was (to incentivize users to read takes on political topics from different perspectives).</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I think it’s unlikely that we will see a product like I described anytime soon. <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1086659965719404544">The world’s largest bookstore, most popular eBook reader, and biggest social network for books</a> are all owned by a company that has very little competency in design and user-facing product innovation.</p>



<p>(Side note: Amazon’s monopoly on books might be the most underrated sub-optimal equilibrium in tech.)</p>



<p>Another app that would be interesting is a social investing app. Think “Robinhood but as a social network”. It seems like investing is already quite a social activity – just look at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-26/reddit-s-profane-greedy-traders-are-shaking-up-the-stock-market">communities like r/wallstreetbets</a>. As <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1250703738634829824">patio11 pointed out</a>, Robinhood already feels more like a game than a finance app.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/robinhood.png"></p><p>So why not build an investing app that opens with a feed of all your friends’ investments and their returns over time? Instead of sharing screenshots on Reddit and Instagram you could prove your investments right in the app.</p>



<p><strong>Note that an app like this would not be about signaling wealth. It’s about signaling <em>being right</em> and the ability to prove it</strong>. This is probably an even stronger and more engaging mechanism than signaling wealth – and the reason why I’m still bullish on prediction markets.</p>



<p>Perhaps a well-designed, consumer-friendly prediction market app would be the ultimate proof-of-x social network. <strong>Strava for being right.</strong></p>

<p><em>[86] Published 6. August 2020.</em></p><p>
  This is my response to the
  <a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-072/">
  Perl Weekly Challenge #072</a>.
</p>


<h2>Challenge #072.1: Trailing Zeroes</h2>
<div><p>
  You are given a positive integer <code>$N (&lt;= 10)</code>.
  </p><p>
  

  Write a script to print number of trailing zeroes in <code>$N!</code>.
  </p><p>
  

Example 1
<code><pre>Input: $N = 10
Output: 2 as $N! = 3628800 has 2 trailing zeroes
</pre></code>

Example 2
<code><pre>Input: $N = 7
Output: 1 as $N! = 5040 has 1 trailing zero
Peak: [ 47, 32, 39, 36 ]
</pre></code>

Example 3
<code><pre>Input: $N = 4
Output: 0 as $N! = 24 has 0 trailing zero
</pre></code></p></div>

<p>
  <code>!</code> is the faculty operator (in a matemathical sense, as
  neither Raku nor Perl has it). <b><em>N</em> Faculty</b> is defined
  as all the consecutive integers from <code>1</code> to <code>N</code>
  multiplied together. 
</p>

<p>
  So e.g. <b>5 Faculty</b> is the same as <code>1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120</code>.
</p>

<p>
  <a id="[] (Reduction Metaoperator)"></a>We can use the <em>Reduction Metaoperator</em>
  <code>[]</code> to compute the value for us. In REPL:
</p>

<p><code><pre>&gt; [*] 1 .. 5;  # -&gt; 120
&gt; [*] 1 .. 6;  # -&gt; 720
</pre></code></p><p>
  <i></i> See
  <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#Reduction_metaoperators">
  docs.raku.org/language/operators#Reduction_metaoperators</a> for more information about
  <em>Reduction Metaoperators</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Now we have the value, and we need to extract the number of trailing zeroes in it.
  We can do this with a regex:
</p>

<p><code><pre>&gt; 120 ~~ /(0*)$/; say $0.chars;  # -&gt; 1
&gt; 121 ~~ /(0*)$/; say $0.chars;  # -&gt; 0
&gt; 200 ~~ /(0*)$/; say $0.chars;  # -&gt; 2
</pre></code></p><p>
  Then we can wrap it up in a program:
</p><p>

File zero-faculty
<code><pre>#! /usr/bin/env raku

subset PosInt of Int where * &gt;= 1;           # [1]

unit sub MAIN (PosInt $N, :v(:$verbose));    # [2]

my $faculty = [*] 1 .. $N;                   # [3]

say ": $N Faculty: $faculty" if $verbose;

$faculty ~~ /(0*)$/;                         # [4]

say $0.chars;
</pre></code></p><p>[1] <a id="subset"></a>We use a custom type (set up with <code>subset</code>)
  to ensure that <code>$N</code> is an integer, with the value 1 or higher.
</p><p>[2] Note the way we can set up <em>aliases</em>. Khaled M. Elboray pointed
  this out for me after the previous challenge. This language keeps surprising
  me... See
  <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Signature#index-entry-argument_aliases">
    docs.raku.org/type/Signature#index-entry-argument_aliases</a> for more
  information.</p>
<p>[3] Compute the value.</p>
<p>[4] Count the trailing zeroes.</p>

<p>
  <a id="subset"></a><i></i> See
  <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/typesystem#index-entry-subset-subset">
    docs.raku.org/language/typesystem#index-entry-subset-subset</a>
  for more information about <code>subset</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Running it:
</p>

<p><code><pre> ./zero-faculty -v 1
: 1 Faculty: 1
0

$ ./zero-faculty -v 2
: 2 Faculty: 2
0

$ ./zero-faculty -v 3
: 3 Faculty: 6
0

$ ./zero-faculty -v 4
: 4 Faculty: 24
0

$ ./zero-faculty -v 5
: 5 Faculty: 120
1

$ ./zero-faculty -v 6
: 6 Faculty: 720
1

./zero-faculty -v 14
: 14 Faculty: 87178291200
2
</pre></code></p><p>
  Looking good.
</p>

<p>
  It is tedious to enter all those command lines. A shell script
  wrapper printing all the values from 1 to the specified limit
  could do the job, but it is better to extend the Raku program
  itself.
</p><p>
  
File: zero-faculty-upto
<code><pre>#! /usr/bin/env raku

subset PosInt of Int where * &gt;= 1;

unit sub MAIN (PosInt $N, :v(:$verbose), :$u($upto);

$upto
  ?? (1 .. $N).map({ say faculty-of($_) })  # [1]
  !! say faculty-of($N);                    # [2]

sub faculty-of ($value)                     # [3]
{
  my $faculty = [*] 1 .. $value;
  say ": $value Faculty: $faculty" if $verbose;
  $faculty ~~ /(0*)$/;
  return $0.chars;
}
</pre></code></p><p>[1] In «upto» mode, print all the values up to the limit. Note the use of
  <code>map</code> instead of a loop.</p>
<p>[2] One value only.</p>
<p>[3] Compute the actual value.</p>

<p>
  Running it:
</p>

<p><code><pre>./zero-faculty-upto --upto  10
0
0
0
0
1
1
1
1
1
2

$ ./zero-faculty-upto -u -v 10
: 1 Faculty: 1
0
: 2 Faculty: 2
0
: 3 Faculty: 6
0
: 4 Faculty: 24
0
: 5 Faculty: 120
1
: 6 Faculty: 720
1
: 7 Faculty: 5040
1
: 8 Faculty: 40320
1
: 9 Faculty: 362880
1
: 10 Faculty: 3628800
2
</pre></code></p><p>
  But why bother computing the faculty each time, as we already
  have the previous value (printed on the line above it in the output)?
</p><p>

file: zero-faculty-upto-loop
<code><pre>#! /usr/bin/env raku

subset PosInt of Int where * &gt;= 1;

unit sub MAIN (PosInt $N, :v(:$verbose), :u(:$upto));

my $faculty = 1;

for 1 .. $N -&gt; $value
{
  $faculty *= $value;
  
  if $upto || $value == $N   # [1]
  {
    say ": $value Faculty: $faculty" if $verbose;
    $faculty ~~ /(0*)$/;
    say $0.chars;
  }
}
</pre></code></p><p>[1] Print the <em>last</em> value, and all the others if we have requested
  «upto» mode.</p>

<h3>A Perl Version</h3><p>
  This is pretty much a straight forward translation from the last
  Raku version:
</p><p>

File: zero-faculty-perl
<code><pre>#! /usr/bin/env perl

use strict;
use feature 'say';

my $N = shift(@ARGV) // die 'Please specify $N';
my $verbose;
my $upto;

while ($N eq "--verbose" || $N eq "-v" || $N eq "--upto" || $N eq "-u")
{
  $verbose++ if $N eq "--verbose" || $N eq "-v";
  $upto++    if $N eq "--upto"    || $N eq "-u";

  $N = shift(@ARGV) // die 'Please specify $N';
}

die '$N must be an integer &gt;= 1' unless int($N) == $N &amp;&amp; $N &gt;= 1;

my $faculty = 1;

for my $value (1 .. $N)
{
  $faculty *= $value;
  
  if ($upto || $value == $N)
  {
    say ": $value Faculty: $faculty" if $verbose;
    $faculty =~ /(0*)$/;
    say length $1;
  }
}
</pre></code></p><h3>Raku! Bonus!</h3>
<p>
  I said earlier that Raku did not have a Faculty operator. That is true, but
  it is very easy to add one. The reason this one is missing is perhaps just
  to make it easy for writers such as myself to show off the extensibility of
  Raku?
</p><p>

File: faculty  
<code><pre>#! /usr/bin/env raku

sub postfix:&lt;!&gt;($n)
{
  return [*] 1 .. $n;
}

for 1 .. 20 -&gt; $int
{
  say "$int! = { $int! }";
}
</pre></code></p><p>
  Running it:
</p>

<p><code><pre>$ ./faculty
1! = 1
2! = 2
3! = 6
4! = 24
5! = 120
6! = 720
7! = 5040
8! = 40320
9! = 362880
10! = 3628800
11! = 39916800
12! = 479001600
13! = 6227020800
14! = 87178291200
15! = 1307674368000
16! = 20922789888000
17! = 355687428096000
18! = 6402373705728000
19! = 121645100408832000
20! = 2432902008176640000
</pre></code></p><p>
  <i></i> Note that defining custom operators
  does not work in REPL.
</p>


<h2>Challenge #072.2: Lines Range</h2>
<div><p>
  You are given a text file name <code>$file</code> and range <code>$A</code> -
  <code>$B</code> where <code>$A &lt;= $B</code>.
  </p><p>
  

  Write a script to display lines range <code>$A</code> and <code>$B</code> in
  the given file.
  </p><p>
  
  
  <b>Example</b></p><p>
  

  Input:
<code><pre>$ cat input.txt
L1
L2
L3
L4
...
...
...
...
L100
</pre></code>

<code>$A = 4 and $B = 12</code></p><p>
  

Output:
<code><pre>L4
L5
L6
L7
L8
L9
L10
L11
L12
</pre></code></p></div>

<p>
  This is trivial in Raku:
</p><p>


File: line-range
<code><pre>#! /usr/bin/env raku

subset PosInt of Int where * &gt;= 1;

unit sub MAIN (Str $filename, PosInt $A, PosInt $B where $B &gt;= $A,  # [1]
               :v(:$verbose));

die "No such file $filename" unless $filename.IO.e;                 # [2]
die "Not a file $filename" unless $filename.IO.f;                   # [2a]
die "Cannot read from $filename" unless $filename.IO.r;             # [2b]

my $count = 0;                                                      # [3]

for $filename.IO.lines -&gt; $line
{
  $count++;

  say ": Considering line $count: $line" if $verbose;

  next if $count &lt; $A;          # [4]

  say $line;
  
  last if $count == $B;         # [5]
}
</pre></code></p><p>[1] The constraints on the two variables <code>$A</code> and <code>$B</code>
  are easy to set up.</p>
<p>[2] <a id="IO.e"></a>
  <a id="IO.f"></a>

  is not a file  (<code>IO.f</code>), and finally if it is not readable by the
  program (<code>IO.r</code>).</p>
<p>[3] Keep track of the line number.</p>
<p>[4] Before the requested start, skip it.</p>
<p>[5] After the requested end, exit.</p>

  for more information about those file tests.
</p>

<p>
  We can simplity this considerably, with an array slice:
</p><p>

File: line-range-slice
<code><pre>#! /usr/bin/env raku

subset PosInt of Int where * &gt;= 1;

unit sub MAIN (Str $filename, PosInt $A, PosInt $B where $B &gt;= $A,
               :v(:$verbose));

my @lines = $filename.IO.lines;          # [1]
my $lines = @lines.elems;                # [3]
my $start = min($lines -1, $A -1);       # [4]
my $stop  = min($lines -1, $B -1);       # [5]

say ": $start .. $stop" if $verbose;

say @lines[$start .. $stop].join("\n");  # [2]
</pre></code></p><p>[1] Reading the whole file like this is generally not a problem, as it does so
  lazily. It will only read the lines from the file when actually needed.</p>
<p>[2] The array slice, simplicity itself... But we have to ensure that the indices
  exist, or we'll get an error.</p>
<p>[3] We cannot read more lines than actually exist, and <code>elems</code> gives
  us the number of lines in the file. The problem is that is has to <em>read the
    whole file</em> to be able to figure this out.</p>
<p>[4] Ensure that the first line to print actually exist. The <code>-1</code>
  part is caused by the array indices starting with zero, and the line numbers at
  1.</p>
<p>[5] Ditto for the last one.</p>

<p>
  Running it:
</p>

<p><code><pre>$ ./line-range-slice line-range-slice 999 999
say @lines[$start .. $stop].join("\n");

$ ./line-range-slice -v line-range-slice 999 999
: 13 .. 13
say @lines[$start .. $stop].join("\n");
</pre></code></p><p>
  The program chooses to print the last line in the file, if both indices are out
  of bound. That is not good.
</p>

<p>
  <i></i> This program is unsuitable when run
  with very large files, as it reads the entire file before orinting anything.
  So we should discard it.
</p>

<p>
  We can just go ahead with indices, and get rid of undefined values (missing rows) with
  <code>grep</code>:
</p><p>

File: line-range-grep:
<code><pre>#! /usr/bin/env raku

subset PosInt of Int where * &gt;= 1;

unit sub MAIN (Str $filename, PosInt $A, PosInt $B where $B &gt;= $A);

say $filename.IO.lines[$A -1 .. $B -1].grep( *.defined ).join("\n");
</pre></code></p><p>
  We can put the <code>say</code> statement at the end of the last line,
  to make it even easier to read:
</p>

<p><code><pre>$filename.IO.lines[$A -1 .. $B -1].grep( *.defined ).join("\n").say;
</pre></code></p><p>
  But you are probably used to seeing output statements at the start of
  the line, so this change may actually <em>reduce</em> readability.
</p>

<p>
  Verbose mode has gone as well, as there is nothing left to be verbose about.
</p>

<p>
  Running it:
</p>

<p><code><pre>$ ./line-range-grep line-range-grep 1 1
#! /usr/bin/env raku
</pre></code>

<code><pre>$ ./line-range-grep line-range-grep 999 999

</pre></code></p><p>
  Yes, we got an empty line. That is caused by the <code>say</code> statement.
</p>


<p>
  <i></i> Note that we get a large array with
  undefined values if we run it with a high <code>$B</code> value on a file with a
  small number of lines. This is not very efficient.
</p>

<p>
  So we can discard this one as well, and stick with «line-range».
</p>

<br/>
August 7, 2020 | https://qvault.io/2020/08/05/hmac-and-mac-explained-simply-building-secure-auth-with-jwts/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://qvault.io/2020/08/05/hmac-and-mac-explained-simply-building-secure-auth-with-jwts/">archive.org</a>

<p>HMACs and MACs are authentication codes and are often the backbone of JWT authentication systems. Let’s take a look at how they work.</p>



<h2>MAC – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code">Message Authentication Code</a></h2>



<p>MACs are exactly what they sound like; small codes that allow receivers of messages to know who the sender was (authentication). A MAC code is calculated by using a message and a secret key as inputs. Anyone who has a copy of that secret key can then verify that that code and message were created by someone with the same key.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-12-at-7.49.24-AM.png" alt="MAC diagram" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-12-at-7.49.24-AM.png 788w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-12-at-7.49.24-AM-300x127.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-12-at-7.49.24-AM-768x326.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-12-at-7.49.24-AM-100x42.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" data-srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-12-at-7.49.24-AM.png 788w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-12-at-7.49.24-AM-300x127.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-12-at-7.49.24-AM-768x326.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-12-at-7.49.24-AM-100x42.png 100w" data-src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-12-at-7.49.24-AM.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure></div>



<p>One way this is accomplished is by using a <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/01/very-basic-intro-to-hash-functions-sha-256-md-5-etc/">hash function,</a> for instance, <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/07/08/how-sha-2-works-step-by-step-sha-256/">SHA-256</a>. Simply put, a hash function takes an input and then returns an output, where:</p>



<ul><li>The output is very unlikely to be the same for different inputs</li><li>The output is always the same for the same inputs</li><li>The output is not predictable – changing the input even slightly results in a seemingly random and large change to the output</li></ul>



<p>Given this, a naive example of MAC generation by the sender could be:</p>



<pre><code>message = 'my message here'
macCode = sha256('thisIsASecretKey1234' + message)
// send macCode and message</code></pre>



<p>Then the verification by the receiver would be:</p>



<pre><code>// receive macCode and message
if (macCode == sha256('thisIsASecretKey1234' + message)){
  // verified!
}</code></pre>



<p>Note that MACs don’t <em>necessarily</em> need to use a hash function, but a hash <em>can</em> be used as the “signing” mechanism.</p>



<h2>HMAC – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC">Hash-Based Message Authentication Code</a></h2>



<p>An HMAC is a kind of MAC. All HMACs are MACs but not all MACs are HMACs. The main difference is that an HMAC uses two rounds of hashing instead of one (or none). Each round of hashing uses a section of the secret key. As a naive example:</p>



<pre><code>sha256('thisIsASe' + sha256('cretKey1234' + 'my message here'))</code></pre>



<p>Which is a simplified version of the function given in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2104">RFC-2104</a>.</p>



<p>Why use HMAC? Why do we need to hash twice?</p>



<p>With many hash functions, it is possible to change the message (without knowing the key) and obtain another valid MAC. We call this a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_extension_attack">length extension attack</a>. No known extension attacks are known against the current HMAC specification.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever implemented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token">JWTs</a> for authentication schemes within a web app, then you know that JWTs are wonderful for keeping track of who is who. A JWT (when using HMAC as the signing scheme) is basically just an HMAC message where the message data is a JSON object.</p>



<p>The interesting thing about the JWT system is that the sender and the receiver of the JWT are typically the same entity, that is, the webserver. Look at the following example:</p>



<ul><li>User gives the server an username and password</li><li>Server verifies the username and password are correct</li><li>Server generates a JWT using HMAC:</li></ul>



<pre><code>hmacCode = sha256('thisIsASe' + sha256('cretKey1234' + '{"email":"lane@qvault.io"}'))</code></pre>



<ul><li>The server responds with the following (decoded) JWT:</li></ul>



<pre><code lang="javascript">header.{"email":"lane@qvault.io"}.hmacCode</code></pre>



<ul><li>User decides to update his/her profile picture by sending the following request:</li></ul>



<pre><code>PUT /users/profile_picture
Authentication: Bearer header.{"email":"lane@qvault.io"}.hmacCode

{"new_picture": "http://linktopicture.com/mypic"}</code></pre>



<ul><li>The server parses the JWT. The JWT says the user is <em>“lane@qvault.io”</em></li><li>The server verifies that the user really is Lane by validating the HMAC code. Only someone with access to the secret key <em>‘thisIsASecretKey1234’ </em>could have made the HMAC code that corresponds to the ‘lane@qvault.io’ message</li><li>If verification is successful, then the server updates Lane’s profile picture</li></ul>

<p><em>“At a market cap of $755 billion (at point of writing) Facebook’s per user value is around $288. If Facebook is some leading indicator for the pinnacle of per user value for social media, then at $50 billion for the roughly 85 million American users, TikTok’s per user value would be $588.”</em></p>



<p>As talks of TikTok’s ban or potential acquisition picks up steam, Microsoft is navigating rocky waters in an attempt to extrude some kind of deal amid the crossfire between Beijing and Washington – not to mention the multitude of big tech forces shaping the narrative. Whether the deal takes place, for what price and for how much of TikTok’s operations will have a resounding impact on the competition between Instagram, Facebook, Microsoft and even Amazon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s break down speculation around the deal first:</p>



<p><strong>Price:</strong> The estimated value of the US arm is currently ranging between $20-50 billion. The exact amount depends on a plethora of factors and several discordant stakeholders coming to consensus. The best speculative guess we can make has to be grounded in as much context as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Bytedance valuation:</strong> Bytedance, TikTok’s parent company has a private-market valuation of more than <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-20/tiktok-owner-s-value-surpasses-100-billion-in-private-markets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$100 billion</a>, reaching up to $140 billion based on a small private sale made by early stakeholder Cheetah Mobile. Some analysts have predicted that Bytedance could IPO at a valuation north of this, going up as far as $180 billion.</p>



<p><strong>TikTok share of Bytedance:</strong> Bytedance revenue in 2019 was estimated to be around $17 billion, of this TikTok (including DouYin) revenue made up about $179.6 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>TikTok projected revenue 2020:</strong> $1 billion, 315 million downloads globally in Q1 (TikTok and DouYin)</p>



<p><strong>Tiktok projected revenue 2021</strong>: TikTok expects to bring in $6 billion in revenue in 2021 according to TikTok management but outsiders have expressed that this is an aggressive estimate, putting a more reasonable range at around $4 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>American Share of TikTok: </strong>Of the 2019 revenue China’s DouYin arm accounted for $122.9 million (69%) while the American market accounted for about $36 million (20%). In April of 2020 in-app purchases on the app increased ten-fold to $78 million where the Chinese market accounted for 86.6% followed by an 8.2% contribution from the American market. At the moment it is predicted that there are about 85 million monthly active TikTok users in the U.S.</p>



<p>There have been reports of investors valuing TikTok around $50 billion in the takeover bid, this is approximately 50 times its projected revenue for 2020. Many publications have compared this to SnapChat’s market capitalization which sits around $33 billion at the moment (15 times its 2020 projected revenue). While Snapchat exists within the same social media ecosystem the comparison has to account for two factors.&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>TikTok vs Snapchat’s position in the growth cycle</li><li>TikTok vs Snapchat’s core proposition&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>Snapchat is vastly different on both fronts. For this reason, it’s difficult to gauge whether the current 50x pricing model is absurd or not in relative terms. A reference point, despite being more distant, that I find more revealing is the 2012 Facebook acquisition of Instagram for $1 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time Instagram represented an up and coming giant in the social media landscape (which in and of itself was quite new) and was doing for photo sharing what TikTok has been doing for short video content (at least, doing more effectively than any of its predecessors). Facebook acquired Instagram at an average price of about $30 per user, when its own platform was valued at about $100 per user. Given that social media in 2012 represented a far less developed market and the almost ten year lead time, it’s difficult to directly compare Instagram to TikTok. Today Instagram is valued at over $100 billion and has over 1 billion users, placing its per user rate at $100. At a market cap of $755 billion (at point of writing) Facebook’s per user value is around $290. If Facebook is some leading indicator for the pinnacle of per user value for social media, then at $50 billion for the roughly 85 million American users, TikTok’s per user value would be $588 (this doesn’t change significantly when accounting for the Australian/Canadia/NZ markets given low penetration).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>Where Instagram made up less than a third of Facebooks per user value at the point of acquisition, TikTok is hovering around double or more and more than 5x Instagrams current per user value. Of course, Instagram had no revenue generation and far few users (33 million) in 2012 while TikTok’s rapid growth has made it a giant in its own right. What we’re then looking at, assuming a $50 billion valuation is a complete market disruptor. Even at a $30 billion takeover bid, Microsoft would be paying $352 per user. </p>



<p>Microsoft isn’t negotiating a price range between $20-50 billion based on revenue projections of which a majority are derivative of the Chinese Douyin market, they are at the table on the basis of becoming potentially larger than the largest social media platform in the world. Rather than how this valuation pans out for investors, the longer-lasting and more pertinent question is how does this change the entire social media landscape and Microsoft’s role in the next decade. With such weighty questions up in the air, a 50x pricing model of revenue projection doesn’t seem so absurd – rather a significant turning point in the decade’s narrative around big tech.</p>

<h3>I made a mechanical keyboard with 3d-printed switches</h3>
<p><i>Fri  7 August 2020</i></p>
<p><i>Tagged: <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/tags/3dprinting.html">3dprinting</a>, <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/tags/keyboard.html">keyboard</a></i></p>
<p>The keyboard is done! This is basically the result of what I've been working on for the past 2 months, which has
involved 3 iterations of testing machines, over 100 printed switches, and now finally a keyboard that I can type on.
Unfortunately it is not a very good keyboard, but you can't win them all.</p>
<p>Here's some pictures of the keyboard:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2843"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2843"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2844"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2844"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2845"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2845"></a></p>
<p>And here's a video of me typing on it:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iEBbCk1WJUk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>(In the video it is a bit wobbly because the back is propped up to take the pressure off the exposed wiring. I have subsequently printed a couple of small legs to raise up
the back of the keyboard and now it is a lot <i>less</i> wobbly, but it could still do with some soft feet).</p>
<p>I am very happy with how the keyboard looks, and also happy that I have managed to produce a working keyboard using 3d-printed switches in the first place. I believe
this may be a world first.</p>
<p>That said, I started using the jesboard to write this blog post, and it was too annoying to type on so I went back to the Filco. Spending some time typing
on my homemade switches has given me a newfound appreciation for just how good Cherry MX switches are. I'm not sure what it is that makes the
jesboard so unpleasant to type on, there's just a general vagueness to it that makes typing frustrating. Pressing a single key up and down feels basically fine, which is why I hadn't
noticed this problem while developing the switches. But trying to use it as an actual keyboard, and type at a sensible speed, just feels <i>really</i> bad. It
is genuinely the worst keyboard I have ever used. So that's disappointing.</p>
<p>I think to improve upon this you'd probably want to reduce the activation force (that's easy, just make the spring thinner) and add some tactile feedback so it is easier to tell
when the switch has actually been pressed. Beyond that, I'm not sure.</p>
<h2>Switches</h2>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2841"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2841"></a></p>
<p>If you want to learn more about the switches, I would recommend looking at some of my other <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/tags/keyboard.html">posts tagged "keyboard"</a>, but in short:
pressing on the stem at the top compresses the spiral spring (I copied the spring design from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSsm4h2ccJMdR6bsAFyIu6A">Riskable 3D Printing</a>, he
is also developing 3d-printable keyboard switches, but using magnet sensors instead of making mechanical switches himself). Once
the stem is pressed down far enough, a contact wire bridges the 2 contacts at the bottom, activating the switch. As the switch is pressed further, the leaf spring compresses, allowing
the stem to move further down while allowing the contact wire to remain in place. Eventually the spiral spring bottoms out against its casing and then stem movement stops. When the key is released,
the spiral spring pushes everything back up to the top.</p>
<p>The leaf spring has a section in its bend that is narrow in the "other" axis, to allow it easily tilt side-to-side to ensure good contact with both of the contact wires.</p>
<p>I don't have a good photo of the latest switch design, but I have this of an earlier version:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2757"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2757"></a></p>
<p>The working principle is the same but the new version is a bit shorter.</p>
<p>The switches are printed in PETG. If you want to see them in action, you might enjoy my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBQBf6jzFM">video of operating the switch tester</a>.
The final incarnation of the switch design lasted over 350k presses in all cases, and some instances still hadn't failed at 500k presses. This is a lot lower than the "tens of millions" that might be
expected of a commercial switch, but it's a big improvement over <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/keyswitch-failure.html">13907</a> which is where the first iteration failed, and that was on an extremely
gentle machine.</p>
<p>I said I was going to experiment with moving the activation point down to 75% of the plunger travel so as to reduce the strain on
the leaf spring. I did test this on the <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/another-new-tester.html">new machine</a>, with 5 of the old design and 5 of the new design side-by-side, and the new design lasted almost
twice as long, so that was a good improvement.</p>
<p>The gold-plated "jewellery wire" that I bought off eBay ended up working well and soldering well (so I conclude it was not varnished),
and 4 metres (costing £4) was <i>just</i> enough to do the entire keyboard.</p>
<p>If you want, you can <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/interest/3dpswitch.tar.gz">download the switch CAD</a>, including STL and FreeCAD files.</p>
<h2>Case</h2>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2805"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2805"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2804"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2804"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2832"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2832"></a></p>
<p>The case is split into 2 halves that are then glued together, so that it fits on the bed of the 3D printer. There is a large rectangular hole at the top and bottom in each half, and a long bit of plastic
inside joining them, to add a bit more strength to the joint. There's not a lot to the case design really, it is just a shape to fit the switches into,
with a bulge at the top to house the microcontroller, an exit hole for the cable, stabiliser mounts, and a cool-looking logo. I made the general shape of the case halves in FreeCAD, and then imported the resulting STL
into OpenSCAD to cut out the holes for the switches, because I found it easier to get the layout correct with code.</p>
<p>I printed the logo in a different colour by having the printer stop and wait for me to change the filament at the layer height where the colour changes, using the
<a href="https://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/M600.html">M600</a> G-code command. PrusaSlicer has a nice GUI for setting this up, so I didn't even need to manually edit the G-code.</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2846"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2846"></a></p>
<p>If I were to make another keyboard, I would give myself more space to work with underneath by reducing the thickness of the "solid" middle part that the switches are mounted in.
I found that there was not really enough room to run the diodes and wires. I would also add provision for a few screws to attach a bottom cover to protect the wiring inside.</p>
<p>The case and keycaps are printed in Prusament Galaxy Black PLA, which I think gives a really nice finish.</p>
<h2>Keycaps</h2>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2848"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2848"></a></p>
<p>The keycaps were designed using <a href="https://github.com/rsheldiii/KeyV2">KeyV2</a>, a free parametric keycap library for OpenSCAD. If you want to design
some keycaps, you should check out KeyV2. Its creator, <a href="https://github.com/rsheldiii">Bob</a>, is friendly and gave me helpful advice and assistance.</p>
<p>There are several different ways to make an ISO (UK-style) enter key in KeyV2, but I couldn't find any combination of settings that would let me have rounded corners, sloping top,
and dished top, so I ended up making the enter key by hand in FreeCAD.</p>
<p>I was originally going to use "outset" legends on the keycaps, like I used on the <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/3pct-keyboard.html">macro keypad</a>. But I read this comment in the KeyV2 source
which changed my mind, so I used inset legends instead:</p>
<pre><code>// make legends outset instead of inset.
// broken off from artisan support since who wants outset legends?
$outset_legends = false;</code></pre>
<p>But having printed all the keycaps, I'm not sure whether I think inset legends actually <i>are</i> better. They range from "perfectly fine" to "almost invisible" depending on the lighting. I'd
say the outset legends were easier to read.</p>
<h2>Wiring</h2>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2836"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2836"></a></p>
<p>The switches are hand-wired in a 15x5 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_matrix_circuit">keyboard matrix</a>, with diodes allowing current to pass only in one direction. 14x5 would be enough
if you thought about it a bit more than I did, but 15x5 is fine.</p>
<p>Originally I was planning to use an Arduino for the microcontroller, which has only 16 IO pins. This would allow for an 8x8 matrix, but when I went to layout the wiring, I came up with this, where
red is columns and green is rows:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2824"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2824"></a></p>
<p>Obviously this is too complicated to wire up in real life, particularly in the small amount of space provided in the bottom of my case. You may also notice it was too complicated for me to
lay out in GIMP, as I have failed to connect the full-stop and apostophe keys to any row. For these reasons I decided to use a <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/">Teensy</a> 2.0 instead, which allowed me to use a more sensible matrix layout:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2835"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2835"></a></p>
<p>(I laid this out on <a href="https://kbfirmware.com/">kbfirmware.com</a>).</p>
<p>The other part of the wiring is that the USB cable has to reach the microcontroller. I left a 4mm hole in the side of the case for the cable to run through, but this is too small for the connector
on the end. I was originally planning to cut the connector off and solder the wires directly to the USB pads on the micocontroller board, but they were too small and annoying to access, so instead
I just soldered the MiniUSB end back on and plugged it in. It's a tight fit but it does the job.</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2847"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2847"></a></p>
<p>In hindsight, I am not sure whether I regret hand-wiring the keyboard. I toyed with the idea of getting a PCB made up that I could directly solder my switches to. It would certainly have
made it easier to put the keyboard together, but I thought outsourcing the manufacturing of a PCB kind of takes the edge off making your own switches...</p>
<h2>Stabilisers</h2>
<p>Here's a clip showing how the stabilisers work:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZTvDP3Qutwk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The idea is that when you press down on one side you cause the bar to rotate, which then pulls down on the other side of the switch, forcing the key to move down parallel (instead of rocking)
and activate the switch properly. The bar is made of 1.75mm stainless steel wire bent into a suitable shape. Thick stainless wire is quite hard to cut, but doable with a big-ish pair of nippers.</p>
<p>While trying to fit the stabilisers for the spacebar, I managed to break off the mounts attached to the case. This is bad news because the case halves are about a 10-hour print each, and aside from
that I had already soldered up all of the switches. To reprint the case halves would involve undoing all of my soldering work, and then 20 hours of printing, and then redoing all of the soldering.</p>
<p>I wasn't interested in redoing all of that work, so as a last resort I drilled a hole into the case in the position of each stabiliser mount, and printed 2 new stabiliser mounts, long enough to fit
in the holes. I printed the mounts in PETG so that they'd be less likely to break.</p>

<p>This worked really well, disaster averted! The mounts were a tight fit in the drilled holes so I didn't even need to use any glue.</p>
<h2>QMK</h2>
<p>I used <a href="https://qmk.fm/">QMK</a> for the keyboard firmware, running on a Teensy 2.0. I found it quite hard to get started with my custom keyboard, because almost all of the documentation
is geared towards the case where you are using an off-the-shelf keyboard which is already defined in QMK. The key point I needed to know was that you can use the script "<tt>./util/new_keyboard.s…</tt></p></div></div>

<p>One of the main issues related to internet security is the topic of email privacy.</p>



<p><em>Did you know the reasons </em><a href="https://utopia.fans/privacy/5-reasons-why-online-privacy-matters/"><em>Why Online Privacy Matters</em></a><em>? It’s high time to pay attention to this.</em></p>



<p>Every day, we send and receive hundreds of emails related to our personal lives and work issues as well.</p>



<p>However, it is increasingly common to see news about <a href="https://utopia.fans/privacy/data-leak-of-telegram-user-base/">users’ data leaks</a>. This applies to password hacks and various special programs that apps use to copy user data.</p>



<p><em><u>-How do I protect myself from information leaks?&nbsp;</u></em></p>



<p>Many internet users have seriously thought about this problem. Most often, they either install additional software that protects their data or they completely change the applications and tools they use for communicating on the net.</p>



<p><em>Still using unreliable apps and messengers? Read </em><a href="https://utopia.fans/security/why-is-secure-messaging-important-in-2020/"><em>Why Is Secure Messaging Important</em></a><em> and change your approach to online communication.</em></p>



<p>As a rule, when choosing a particular tool, they pay attention to the security technologies that are used and the reviews of other users.</p>



<p>When considering the best way to protect your communication, a choice must be made between two types of systems: centralized and decentralized. And more often, people choose the latter one – decentralized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what are the <a href="https://accountlearning.com/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-decentralization/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">advantages of decentralized mail</a> that affect the final choice of these users?</p>



<p>In this article, we’ll look at the main advantages of such emails and tell you about several reliable variants of decentralized emails.</p>



<h3>Definitive benefits of decentralized email</h3>



<p>Decentralization is a new word in the lexicon of data security. This type of system is becoming more and more popular. Decentralized email means both security and privacy.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/decentralized-email.jpg.webp" alt="Benefits of decentralized email" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/decentralized-email.jpg.webp 1024w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/decentralized-email-300x225.jpg.webp 300w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/08/decentralized-email-768x575.jpg.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>As a rule, such systems are based on blockchain technology. It transmits messages and then reliably saves your history of correspondence, but not in any central location. This technology automatically protects data from unauthorized access.</p>



<p>In addition, using decentralized email has several advantages:</p>



<ul><li>No central server where all messages are stored.</li><li>No one can access your emails except you.</li><li>No one can hack your email.</li></ul>



<p><em>You can read more on this topic in the article </em><a href="https://utopia.fans/networks/centralized-vs-decentralized-network-whats-better-for-your-security/"><em>Centralized vs Decentralized Network</em></a><em> and choose the best system to protect your data.</em></p>



<p>Some other advantages include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Privacy.</strong> Manage your data yourself. Control your business and personal life.</li><li><strong>No censorship.</strong> Express your opinions and defend freedom of speech. A complete absence of external control and censorship.</li><li><strong>Security.</strong> Each message is securely encrypted using the latest data encryption methods.</li><li><strong>Anonymity.</strong> Remain anonymous, and do not disclose your data. Choose the data storage method.</li></ul>



<p><em><u>-What are the reliable decentralized systems?&nbsp;</u></em></p>



<p>Our team has prepared a selection of email services to protect you and your data on the internet.</p>



<h3>The best decentralized emails</h3>

<p>Utopia is a closed ecosystem that is built on <strong>the principle of decentralization</strong>. It does not have a single server for storing data. Instead, during anonymous registration, it creates <strong>a separate server</strong> for each user.</p>



<p>All user data is securely stored and protected using sophisticated encryption based on<strong> an elliptical core and 256-bit AES</strong>. This method allows you to eliminate any data leaks and hacks.</p>



<p>Utopia has several built-in tools such as <strong>instant messenger, anonymous browser, crypto container, private email, </strong>and more<strong>.</strong> Each of these tools is multi-functional, and in addition to stable and safe operation, it offers <strong>a convenient and friendly interface</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>uMail</strong> is the ecosystem’s encrypted p2p email that sends and receives confidential messages from anywhere in the world. Each message is encrypted with <strong>a private key</strong> that the sender of the message has. Only the recipient can decrypt the code using their private key. In other words, no third parties are involved in transmitting messages.</p>

August 7, 2020 | https://microtica.com/how-to-create-simple-ci-cd-pipeline/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://microtica.com/how-to-create-simple-ci-cd-pipeline/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>Cloud-native applications are on the rise thanks to the scalability and flexibility they provide. However, this type of architecture has its own challenges. Implementing a CI/CD pipeline will solve most of them, like <strong>defining delivery procedures, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://microtica.com/cracking-the-continuous-deployment-code/" target="_blank">delivering applications independently</a>, and gaining observability of the numerous building blocks in a system</strong> are some of them.</p>



<p>A CI/CD pipeline is the key to <strong>automating the steps of the software delivery process</strong>. This includes initiating code builds, running automated tests, and deploying to a testing or production environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One CI/CD <strong>pipeline</strong> consists of multiple steps executed one after another or in parallel. There are two known pipeline syntaxes — <strong>Scripted </strong>and <strong>Declarative</strong>. The key difference between them is their flexibility. </p>



<p>Although both syntaxes are based on Groovy DSL, the <strong>Scripted Pipeline Syntax</strong> is less restrictive. It also allows almost anything that can be done in Groovy. This means that the script can easily become hard to read and write.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, the <strong>Declarative syntax </strong>is more restrictive and provides a well-defined structure, which is ideal for simpler CI/CD pipelines. This syntax supports the “pipeline as code” concept. Therefore, you can write in a file that can be checked into a source control management system like Git. </p>



<p>In order to make it more convenient for developers to set up a CI/CD pipeline, <strong><a href="https://www.microtica.com/">Microtica</a> supports the Declarative syntax to define build procedures along with the source code</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Declarative CI/CD pipelines</strong></h2>



<p>For the pipeline process to work, each component/microservice should have a file named <strong><em>microtica.yaml </em></strong>on the root level in its source code. This file contains the specification of the build process. </p>



<p>During the build process, Microtica extracts the specification from the code. Then, it creates a state machine to drive the defined process.</p>



<blockquote><p>In order to ensure a single source of truth for pipeline specification, Microtica does NOT allow changes in the Build pipelines from the UI. Changes will only take effect from the YAML file provided in each source code repository. We find this very helpful in avoiding possible confusion of definition, maintenance, and, most importantly, debugging problems in the process.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<h2><strong>Define a CI/CD pipeline</strong></h2>



<p>There are no limitations to the steps of the build pipeline that you can define. Here is one example of a <strong><em>microtica.yaml </em></strong>file that defines a <strong>build pipeline for NodeJS application</strong>. This pipeline executes three particular commands defined in the <em>commands </em>section.</p>



<pre><code>Pipeline:
 StartAt: Build
 States:
   Build:
     Type: Task
     Resource: microtica.actions.cmd
     Parameters:
       commands:
       - npm install
       - npm test
       - npm prune --production
       sourceLocation: "$.trigger.source.location"
       artifacts: true
     End: true</code></pre>



<ul><li><strong><em>Pipeline</em></strong><em> — </em>is the root key which defines the start of the pipeline section</li><li><strong><em>StartAt</em></strong><em> — </em>defines the first action of the pipeline</li><li><strong><em>States</em></strong><em> — </em>defines a list of states for the particular pipeline</li><li><strong><em>Type</em></strong><em> — a </em>type of pipeline action. Always set it to <em>Task</em>.</li><li>Resource — an action that the engine will use. Currently, we support <em>microtica.actions.cmd</em>, an action that executes bash scripting.</li><li>Parameters — a set of parameters that are given to the action<ul><li><strong><em>commands</em></strong><em> — </em>a list of bash commands. Here, you define your custom scripts for build, test, code quality checks, etc.</li><li><strong><em>sourceLocation</em></strong> — the location where the action can find the source code. You should NOT change this. Once pulled from the Git repository, Microtica stores the artifacts on a location specified by the user for the particular component/microservice. <em>$.trigger.source.location</em> defines that location.</li><li><strong><em>artifacts</em></strong> — a value that defines that this build will produce artifacts which will be stored in S3 and used during deployment. Set this value should to <em>false</em> in case the artifact of the build is Docker image</li></ul></li><li><strong><em>End</em></strong><em> — </em>defines that this is the last action in the pipeline.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://www.microtica.com/">Microtica</a> supports bash commands for the execution action. In the future, we are planning to allow developers to define their own custom actions.</p>



<h2>Getting a Docker image ready for deployment</h2>



<p>Let’s create an extended pipeline from the example above, adding an additional step to prepare a Docker image for deployment:</p>



<pre><code>Pipeline:
  StartAt: Build
  States:
    Build:
      Type: Task
      Resource: microtica.actions.cmd
      Parameters:
        environmentVariables:
          pipelineId: "$.pipeline.id"
          version: "$.commit.version"
        commands:
        - echo Starting build procedure...
        - npm install
        - npm test

        - echo Logging in to Amazon ECR...
        - $(aws ecr get-login --region $AWS_REGION --no-include-email)

        - echo Checking if repository exists in ECR. If not, create one
        - repoExists=`aws ecr describe-repositories --query "repositories[?repositoryName=='$pipelineId']" --output text`
        - if [ -z "$repoExists" ]; then aws ecr create-repository --repository-name $pipelineId; fi

        - awsAccountId=$(echo $CODEBUILD_BUILD_ARN | cut -d':' -f 5)
        - artifactLocation=$awsAccountId.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/$pipelineId

        - echo Build Docker image...
        - docker build -t $pipelineId .
        - docker tag $pipelineId $artifactLocation:$version
        - docker tag $pipelineId $artifactLocation:latest

        - echo Push Docker image
        - docker push $artifactLocation
        sourceLocation: "$.source.location"
        artifacts: false
      End: true</code></pre>



<p>In this example, we first inject environment variables in the step runtime with <em>environmentVariables</em> parameter (<em>$.pipeline.id</em> and <em>$.commit.version</em> are both provided by Microtica).</p>



<p>The CI/CD pipeline in the latest example starts by executing necessary instructions to build and test the code. Once this is done, Microtica creates an ECR repository if it doesn’t already exist.</p>



<p>Once we have the ECR repository in place, the last step is to build a new Docker image and then push it in the repository.</p>

<p>After you define the <strong><em>microtica.yaml </em></strong>file with the build pipeline, you can <strong>automate</strong> your build process in Microtica when you create the component or microservice with the wizard in the portal. This option will add a webhook to your repository. </p>



<p>A webhook is a listener that triggers a build process whenever you <strong>push new code to your repository branch</strong>. This way, you can be sure that you’re always working with the newest changes.</p>



<p>Building the docker image gave us an artifact so we can deploy it in a Kubernetes cluster.&nbsp;<strong>You can do this from&nbsp;<em>Microservice details — Add to Cluster</em>, or in the<em>&nbsp;Kubernetes Dashboard — Microservices — Deploy.</em></strong></p>

<p>Once you trigger a build manually or automatically, follow the build process in the portal and see the events in real-time. If the build fails, it will mark it with red on the screen and it will show the error in the logs.</p>



<p>Follow all the pipelines for your components and microservices in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portal.microtica.com/pipelines" target="_blank">Pipelines overview page</a> and track their status. Microtica will mark a pipeline as not healthy if there are several failed builds detected. </p>



<p>From this page, you can access any build in the history of your project. More importantly, you can also and inspect the logs to find the problems.</p>

<p>We are strong advocates for automated pipelines as they <strong>remove manual errors.</strong> Moreover, they are crucial for reliable and sustainable software delivery. </p>



<p>They make software developers <strong>more productive,</strong> releasing them from the need to perform pipeline steps manually. Most importantly, they reduce the stress around new product releases.</p>

These biologically determined differences, the argument goes, explain why&nbsp;women aren't cut out to reach the higher echelons of science.&nbsp;</p>  <p>In her new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gender-Our-Brains-Neuroscience-Explodes/dp/1524747025" target="_blank">"Gender and Our Brains: How new neuroscience explodes the myths of the male and female minds," </a>neuroscientist <a href="https://www2.aston.ac.uk/lhs/staff/az-index/rippong" target="_blank">Gina Rippon</a> busts that myth, and offers&nbsp;a new perspective&nbsp;based on modern neuroscience that focuses on how our brain is moldable by&nbsp;our life experiences, and it's those experiences, rather than our biology, that have the biggest&nbsp;impact on our&nbsp;interest and aptitude&nbsp;for&nbsp;science.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Rippon is an expert on brain-imaging techniques and a Professor Emeritus of Cognitive Neuroimaging from Aston University in Birmingham, U.K. Here's part of her conversation with <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks"><em>Quirks &amp; Quarks</em></a> host Bob McDonald:&nbsp;</p>  <hr>  <p><em><strong>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</strong></em></p>  <p><strong>Bob McDonald: </strong>You really engage strongly with the idea that biology is destiny, that our biological sex determines what we can do in life. Why is that important to you?</p>  <p><strong>Gina Rippon:</strong> I challenge quite a lot of what's called the biological determinist perspective that we have the brains that we're born with and they are what determine our skills, personalities, temperaments, etc. My thesis is very much to say that brains are very important, but they are also very flexible and moldable by the world that they're functioning in, by the stereotypes they encounter and the attitudes they encounter.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5291507.1568998207!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/gender-and-our-brains.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5291507.1568998207!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/gender-and-our-brains.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5291507.1568998207!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/gender-and-our-brains.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5291507.1568998207!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/gender-and-our-brains.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5291507.1568998207!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/gender-and-our-brains.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5291507.1568998207!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/gender-and-our-brains.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Neuroscientist Gina Rippon's new book is called "Gender and Our Brains: How new neuroscience explodes the myths of the male and female minds" <!-- --> <!-- -->(Pantheon)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p><strong>BM: </strong>So what do you see as the main lingering misconceptions about women's aptitude for science compared to men?</p>  <p><strong>GR:</strong> I think the key focus is very often on a cognitive skill called spatial cognition — our ability to actually understand the relationship between objects either as two dimensionally represented or three dimensionally represented. Being able to envisage different objects changing in relationship to each other is very important in understanding all sorts of aspects of science, and it has been claimed to be one of the most robust sex differences in that men on average tend to perform better in the kind of laboratory tasks which measure this skill than women. We also get the classic men being map readers and women being multitasking type dichotomy. So there is the thinking that there is some biologically based spatial skill, which is essential for success in science, and women are less likely to have sufficient quantities of that particular skill.</p>  <p><strong>BM: </strong>Well, walk me through some of the issues you have with the studies that led to those conclusions.</p>  <p><strong>GR: </strong>I think there's a whole range of things. First of all, if you look at the different ways of measuring that particular skill, sometimes women do just as well if not better. So I would challenge the idea that there's a kind of universal ability called spatial cognition that women are less well endowed with. But it's also the case that it's a skill that we know is trainable. So if you get individuals who are poor at those kinds of tasks, you can give them a range of different training opportunities and they will improve over time and their spatial cognition will improve.</p>  <p>Also, we've been able to show that their brains change, so it's not something which is predetermined at birth,&nbsp; which is quite often claimed. It's something which may well reflect the kind of training opportunities that individuals have. So if you've had a lifetime of playing with construction toys, moving on to perhaps hobbies and sports which are to do with spatial manipulation of objects, then you've had many more training opportunities than other people who've not been given those kinds of skills. Very often, those two groups are actually divided along gender lines, so it's much more likely that boys will play with Lego and construction toys.</p>  <p><strong>BM:</strong> So you're saying that it's the type of test that is the problem, or that they're not taking into account things like cultural differences, or occupations or things like that?</p>  <p><strong>GR: </strong>I think that's absolutely right. There was a big survey done in the States about two years ago where they were interested in spatial cognition in college students. They found as expected that on average, the boys did better than girls. But when they took videogame experience into account and asked individuals questions like&nbsp; 'do you play video games?' 'how long have you played them?' 'how long do you play them for,' which gave them a very good measure of the kind of video game experience the individuals, the sex difference disappeared. So girls who'd had as much video game experience as boys were doing just as well on the spatial cognition task.</p>  <p><strong>BM:</strong> So other than spatial cognition, what other issues do you have with studies that have shown differences between male and female brains?</p>  <p><strong>GR: </strong>&nbsp;I think one of the things that's important to realize when we talk about differences and the kind of everyday use of that term makes you envisage that you know a male brain is like this and a female brain is like that when we actually look at the data that we have on brains from men and brains from women, you can see that there's a huge amount of variability within each population and that the two sets of data are hugely overlapping. So there's very tiny differences between the groups but very large differences within the groups, but the history of science has been such that we've always focused on those tiny little differences rather than the source of variability within each group.</p>  <p><strong>BM: </strong>So you're saying that there could be just as much difference between two boys as there would be between a boy and a girl or two girls.</p>  <p><strong>GR:</strong> Yes, that's absolutely right.</p>  <p><em><strong>The entire audio interview is available at the top of this page</strong></em><em><strong> </strong></em></p>  <hr>  <p><em>Produced and written by <a href="https://twitter.com/SonyaBuyting" target="_blank">Sonya Buyting</a></em></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<p>The next version is under active non-public development from scratch and will be released as <em><b>MithrilDB</b></em> and <code>libmithrildb</code> for libraries &amp; packages. Admittedly mythical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithril">Mithril</a> is resembling silver but being stronger and lighter than steel. Therefore <em>MithrilDB</em> is a rightly relevant name. </p><blockquote>
<p><em>MithrilDB</em> will be radically different from <em>libmdbx</em> by the new database format and API based on C++17, as well as the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0 License</a>. The goal of this revolution is to provide a clearer and robust API, add more features and new valuable properties of the database. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Historically, <em>MDBX</em> is a deeply revised and extended descendant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Memory-Mapped_Database">Lightning Memory-Mapped Database</a>. At first the development was carried out within the <a href="https://github.com/erthink/ReOpenLDAP">ReOpenLDAP</a> project. About a year later <em>libmdbx</em> was separated into a standalone project, which was <a href="http://www.highload.ru/2015/abstracts/1831.html">presented at Highload++ 2015 conference</a>.</p>
<p>Since 2017 <em>libmdbx</em> is used in <a href="https://github.com/erthink/libfpta">Fast Positive Tables</a>, and development is funded by <a href="https://www.ptsecurity.com/">Positive Technologies</a>.</p>

<article id="post-498">

	

	
	<div>
		
<p><a href="https://raku.org/archive/rfc/168.html">Proposed on 27 August 2000</a>, frozen on 20 September 2000, which was a generalization of&nbsp;<a href="https://raku.org/archive/rfc/26.html">RFC 26: Named operators versus functions</a> proposed on 4 August 2000, frozen on 28 August 2000, also by&nbsp;<em>Johan Vromans</em>.</p>



<p>Johan’s proposal was to completely obliterate the difference between built-in functions, such as&nbsp;abs, and functions defined by the user. In Perl,&nbsp;<code>abs</code>&nbsp;can be called both as a prefix operator (without parentheses), as well as a function taking a single argument.</p>



<p>You see, Perl has this concept of built-in functions that are slightly different from “normal” subroutines for performance reasons. In Perl, as in Raku, the actual name of a subroutine, is prefixed with an ‘<code>&amp;</code>‘.  In Perl, you can take a reference to a subroutine with ‘<code>\</code>‘, but that doesn’t work for built-in functions.</p>



<p>Nowadays, in Raku, the difference between a subroutine taking a single positional argument, and a built-in prefix operator whose name is acceptable as an identifier, is already minimal. Well, actually absent. Suppose we want to define a prefix operator&nbsp;<code>foo</code>&nbsp;that has the same semantics as&nbsp;<code>abs</code>:</p>



<pre><code>sub foo(Numeric:D $value) {
    $value &lt; 0 ?? -$value !! $value
}

say abs -42;  # 42
say foo -42;  # 42

say abs(-42); # 42
say foo(-42); # 42</code></pre>



<p>You can’t really see a difference, now can you? Well, the reason is simple: in Raku, there&nbsp;<strong>is</strong>&nbsp;no real difference between the&nbsp;foo subroutine, and the&nbsp;abs&nbsp;prefix operator. They’re&nbsp;<strong>both</strong>&nbsp;just subroutines: just look at the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/Real.pm6#L170">definition of the&nbsp;<code>abs</code>&nbsp;function for&nbsp;<code>Real</code> numbers</a>.</p>



<p>But how does that function for infix operators?  Those aren’t surely subroutines as well in Raku?  How can they be?  Something like&nbsp;“+”&nbsp;is not a valid identifier, so you cannot define a subroutine with it?</p>



<p>The genius in the process from the RFC to the implementation in Raku, has really been the idea to give a subroutine that represents an infix operator, a specially formatted name.  In the case of infix&nbsp;+&nbsp;operator, the subroutine is known by the name <code>infix:&lt;+&gt;</code>. And if you look at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/Numeric.pm6#L210">its definition</a>, you’ll see that it is actually quite simple: the left hand side of the infix operator becomes the first positional argument, and the right hand side the second positional argument. So something like:</p>



<pre><code>say 42 + 666;</code></pre>



<p>is really just syntactic sugar for:</p>



<pre><code>say infix:&lt;+&gt;(42, 666);</code></pre>



<p>Does this apply to&nbsp;<strong>all</strong>&nbsp;built-in operators in Raku? Well,&nbsp;<em>almost</em>. Some operators, such as&nbsp;||, <code>or</code>,&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;and&nbsp;are&nbsp;<em>short-circuiting</em>.  This means that the value on the right hand side, might&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;be evaluated if the left hand side has a certain value.</p>



<p>A simple example using the&nbsp;<code>say</code>&nbsp;function (which always returns&nbsp;<code>True</code>):</p>



<pre><code>say "foo" or say "bar"; # foo</code></pre>



<p>Because the infix&nbsp;or&nbsp;operator sees that its left hand side is already&nbsp;True, it will not bother to evaluate the right hand side, and thus will&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;print “bar”.  There is currently no way in Raku to mimic this short-circuiting behaviour in “ordinary” subroutines.  But this will change when macro’s will finally also become first-class citizens in Raku land. Which is expected to be happening in the coming year as part of&nbsp;<em>Jonathan Worthington</em>‘s work on the <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/gp_rakuast">RakuAST grant</a>.</p>



<p>Going back to the original RFC, it also mentions:</p>



<pre><code>In particular, it is desired that every built-in
- can be overridden by a user defined subroutine;
- can have a reference taken;
- has a useful prototype.</code></pre>



<p>So, let’s check that those points:</p>



<h4>can be overridden by a used defined subroutine</h4>



<p>OK, so infix operators have a special name. So what happens if I declare a subroutine with that name? Well, let’s try:</p>



<pre><code>sub infix:&lt;+&gt;(\a, \b) { a + b }
say 42 + 666;</code></pre>



<p>Hmmm… that doesn’t show anything, that just hangs! Well, yeah, because we basically have a case of a subroutine here calling itself without ever returning!</p>



<p><strong>This code example eats about 1GB of memory per second,</strong> <strong>so don’t do that too long unless you have a lot of memory available!</strong></p>



<p>The easiest fix would be to&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;use the infix&nbsp;‘<code>+</code>‘&nbsp;operator in our version:</p>



<pre><code>sub infix:&lt;+&gt;(\a, \b) { sum a, b }
say 42 + 666;  # 708</code></pre>



<p>But what if we want to refer to original&nbsp;<code>infix:&lt;+&gt;</code>&nbsp;logic?  It’s just a subroutine after all! But where does that subroutine live?  Well, in the core of course!  And for looking up things in the core, you use the&nbsp;CORE::&nbsp;PseudoStash:</p>



<pre><code>sub infix:&lt;+&gt;(\a, \b) {
    say "plussing";
    CORE::&lt;&amp;infix:&lt;+&gt;&gt;(a, b)
}
say 42 + 666; # plussing\n708</code></pre>



<p>You look in the&nbsp;<code>CORE::</code>&nbsp;pseudostash for the full name of the infix operator:&nbsp;<code>CORE::&lt;&amp;infix:&lt;+&gt;&gt;</code>&nbsp;will then give you the subroutine object of the core’s infix&nbsp;<code>+</code>&nbsp;operator, and you can call that as a subroutine with two parameters.</p>



<p>So that part of the RFC has been implemented!</p>



<h4>can have a reference taken</h4>



<p>For the infix&nbsp;<code>+</code>&nbsp;operator, that would be&nbsp;<code>&amp;infix:&lt;+&gt;</code>, as basically is shown in the example above. You could actually store that in a variable, and use that later in an expression:</p>



<pre><code>my $foo = &amp;infix:&lt;+&gt;;
say $foo(42,666);  # 708</code></pre>



<p>Note that contrary to Perl, you do not need to take a reference in Raku.  Since everything in Raku is an object, <code>&amp;foo</code> and <code>&amp;infix:&lt;+&gt;</code> are just objects as well.  You can just use them as they are.  So literally this part of the RFC could never be implemented because Raku does not have reference.  But for the use case, which is obtaining something that can be called, the RFC has <em>also</em> been implemented.</p>



<h4>has a useful prototype</h4>



<p>Perl’s prototypes basically morphed into Raku’s&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Signature"><code>Signature</code></a>s. But that’s at least one blog post all by itself.  So for now, we just say that the “prototypes” of Perl in 2000 turned into signatures in Raku. And since you can ask for a subroutine’s signature:</p>



<pre><code>sub foo(\a, \b) { }
say &amp;foo.signature;  # (\a, \b)</code></pre>



<p>You can also do that for the infix&nbsp;<code>+</code>&nbsp;operator:</p>



<pre><code>say &amp;infix:&lt;+&gt;.signature;  # ($?, $?, *%)</code></pre>



<p>Hmmm… that looks different?  Well, yes, it does a bit, but what is mainly different is that both positional parameters are optional. And that&nbsp;<strong>any</strong>&nbsp;named parameters will also be accepted. As to why that is, that’s really the topic of a yet another blog post about meta-operators. Which we’ll also leave for another time.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>RFC’s 168 and 26 have been implemented completely, although maybe not in the way the original RFC’s envisioned. In a way that nowadays just feels very natural. Which allows us to build further, on the shoulders of giants!</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>When faced with the decision if something is worth automating or not, the default reaction for most developers and product managers will be simple: estimating the time spent on a manual task, and comparing it with the time it would take to automate the task away. Whatever takes the least time wins. When building <a href="https://www.offen.dev/">Offen</a>, the decision of what to automate came up quite a few times as well, and I have realized that only looking at time spent might be a bit short-sighted.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="optimize-for-the-ability-to-forget">Optimize for the ability to forget</h2>

<p>Instead of purely optimizing for time spent, I think you can also optimize for removing mental overhead. Instead of having to do the mental bookkeeping (how do I run the build, how do I do a release or how do I update some license info) for all of these tasks you could automate them away and simply <strong>forget about the need to do something as well as its implementation details</strong>. This might not necessarily be cost-effective when looking at time factors only, but once you have actively forgotten about whatever you just automated away, it will let you <strong>think about problems you still need to solve in a more outright manner</strong>.</p>

<p>To give you a concrete example: <a href="https://github.com/offen/offen">Offen</a> does need to keep track of the third-party code that is used and generate a NOTICE file to be included in the binary distribution bundle. This is something you could of course do manually: every time some dependency is added or removed (which honestly does not happen very often), you go and update that NOTICE file. Automating this is a complex task involving lots of custom scripting to iron out the multitude of problems modern dependency management brings. Yet, even though I would have never spent as much time manually updating the NOTICE file as I have spent automating this process, I have found doing it to be the right decision to make. Instead of having this backlog of mundane and simple tasks I need to do from time to time, I can solely think about what I can improve on the product. <strong>Instead of being a part-time bureaucrat, I can now be a full-time creator</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="start-early-on">Start early on</h2>

<p>If you make optimizing for the ability to forget your guideline, it can help you get a project off the ground really quickly. Instead of waiting for the perfect moment to set up that CI pipeline that does your builds and your releases, you start off by implementing that pipeline. Once done, you can forget about it. In case you need to know how it works, it’s there in your codebase.</p>

<p>Looking at the time spent is only one aspect when deciding what to automate. I can definitely recommend not making it your only guideline.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><span>07 Aug 2020</span></p><p>Do not be afraid, this short blog post is about databases and does not contain
any unreasonable metaphysical references. In fact, it’s a result of a journey
through couple of whitepapers and books with an unexpected intersection of two
rather different fields. I will try to describe everything step by step, so
that we can see if chess has anything in common with database query optimizer.</p>

<h2 id="database-query-optimizer">Database query optimizer</h2>
<p>Let’s prepare some background and definitions. PostgreSQL
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/planner-optimizer.html">documentation</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The task of the planner/optimizer is to create an optimal execution plan. A
given SQL query (and hence, a query tree) can be actually executed in a wide
variety of different ways, each of which will produce the same set of
results. If it is computationally feasible, the query optimizer will examine
each of these possible execution plans, ultimately selecting the execution
plan that is expected to run the fastest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And later in the optimizer <a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/optimizer/README;h=d174b8cb73a8a94529b71196db177d7a5fb2f047;hb=HEAD">readme</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the planning/optimizing process, we build “Path” trees representing
the different ways of doing a query. We select the cheapest Path that
generates the desired relation and turn it into a Plan to pass to the
executor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, the optimizer prepares an optimal way to execute a query and represent it
in the form of Path trees. Everything sounds clear and simple. Except that it
isn’t, mostly thanks to <a href="https://wp.sigmod.org/?p=1075">cardinality estimation</a> despite
years of progress. As an example one can find couple of
<a href="https://db.in.tum.de/~leis/papers/lookingglass.pdf">works</a> from the past, when a common observation about
PostgreSQL is that cardinality under-estimates sometimes make optimizer to
select nested-loop joins even when other join methods could be more efficient
(it would be interesting to check if it’s still a thing).</p>
<h2 id="everyone-can-learn">Everyone can learn</h2>
<p>Unless you’ve spent last several years in an underground bunker you probably
have noticed raise of interest to machine learning as well as its applications.
Databases are also not an exception, in the last couple of years we see a lot
of whitepapers and projects devoted to leverage various machine learning
techniques to improve databases performance, e.g. <a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol12/p1705-marcus.pdf">Neo</a> (which is in fact
the main source of inspiration for this blogpost) or
<a href="https://github.com/postgrespro/aqo">Adaptive query optimization for PostgreSQL</a>. For me, as an amateur in
machine learning, the idea sounds approximately like “lets make optimizer to
learn from its own mistakes”. Surprisingly this idea is not exactly new,
<a href="https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy460/pdf/leo-db2.pdf">LEO DB2’s learning optimizer</a> was suggested already in 2001, although of
course a lot of progress has being done since then. Let’s see in more details
how it works based on Neo example:</p>
<p><img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/neo.png" width="100%"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First Neo collects expertise based on the sample workload and hints from a
normal database query optimizer. It is important to provide an expert
knowledge, since otherwise learning time will be too big for any practical
usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on collected expertise a deep neural network (called “Value Model”) is
trained. The purpose of this neural network is to predict the final execution
time of any given query execution plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For any real incoming query it’s being transformed into a set of features
that represent e.g. join order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having a set of features and “Value Model” at hands Neo performs best-first
search of the plan space for the most efficient plan suitable for the query.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially the algorithm takes an existing expertise and learn to predict how
good or bad an execution plan would be. Then for every query it performs a
non-exhaustive search in the plan space guided by learned experience. Sounds
interesting, but what does it have to do with chess again?</p>
<h2 id="games">Games</h2>
<p>The book “The art of doing science and engineering” mentions an interesting
example of self-learning programms. It was a checker playing program developed
by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel">Arthur Samuel</a> with an interesting idea. In the core of the program
was a scoring function for measuring the chances of winning. To improve this
function Samuel made the program play thousands of games against itself to tune
formula parameters.</p>
<p>This book was originally published in 1996, and Richard Hamming mentioned that
AI and self-learning algorithms is a topic one cannot afford to ignore. In 1997
in the second match of six games a reigning world chess champion Garry Kasparov
was defeated by a supercomputer Deep Blue under tournament conditions for the
first time in the history.</p>
<p>What seemed to be an end of chess as we know them was once again changed in
2017, when DeepMind team released a preprint introducing another chess
algorithm <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01815.pdf">AlphaZero</a>. Interestingly this work did not bring more
misery for human chess players, but rather some signs of hope. The reason for
that is the style of AlphaZero, much more human like and creative than anything
before. For example the book “Game changer: AlphaZero’s Groundbreaking Chess
Strategies and the Promise of AI” contains this beautiful game:</p>

<p>What is interesting about this game is that the position after White’s 20th
move repeats another brilliant game after White’s 21st move. But the latter one
was played by human players, namely Gata Kamsky and Yasser Seirawan in 2012 in
US Championship!</p>
<p>Why was it so important and what is the difference between AlpaZero and any
other chess engine?</p>
<p>Well, usually engines like e.g. <a href="https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish">Stockfish</a> evaluate positions on a
chess board using features provided by human players and carefully tuned
weights. They’re combined with a high-performance alpha-beta search that
expands a search tree using numerous clever heuristics and domain-specific
adaptations to provide the final result.</p>
<p>AlphaZero uses another approach and utilizes a deep value network, which takes
a board position and move probabilities to evaluate how good or bad this
position is. All the values and probabilities are learned by AlphaZero from
self play, as there is no provided heuristic or any human knowledge except the
game rules. The resulting neural network is being used to guide the search for
a next move using Monte-Carlo tree search (interesting enough, it could be also
improved via <a href="https://proceedings.icml.cc/book/2020/file/310cc7ca5a76a446f85c1a0d641ba96d-Paper.pdf">model-free policy-optimization algorithm</a>). Does it sound
familiar?</p>
<h2 id="pulling-bits-together">Pulling bits together</h2>
<p>Indeed, the similarity between what we have seen in Neo and AlphaZero is so
striking that the authors of former mentioned “the architecture of Neo closely
mirrors that of AlphaGo”, where AlphaZero could be considered as a more
generalized variant of the AlphaGo. And it’s should not be surprising, since
both query optimization and chess share the same idea of searching for the
optimal solution based on the existing experience! Probably one could even
speculate that the same approach could be used in other fields to solve similar
problems.</p>
<p>This sounds very exciting, but as always there are couple of concerns that need
to be addressed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Learning techniques can outperform other approaches in average case, but fail
miserably in the worst cases (tail performance). This could be true even for
AlphaZero, but in a different form. It had learned everything without an
opening books, and there is a chance of falling into a known opening traps.
The book “Game changer” mentioned the game above as an example (note, that
it’s one of not that many games lost by AlphaZero).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To make learning techniques practical training time should be reasonably
small and an algorithm should allow some form of retraining to take into
account new data. This question is tightly connected with whether provide an
existing human knowledge for an algorithm or not. In case of Neo it’s an
important way of speeding up training (otherwise it would be tremendously
slow, since one has to execute not optimal queries over and over again), but
AlphaZero avoids that, because prise of training is smaller and eliminating
existing knowledge allows discovering new tactics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to debug and explain decisions made in self-learned way is itself
a subject of research and not straightforward at all.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>To repeat Richard Hamming again, learning algorithms is a topic one cannot
afford to ignore, including its application in databases. Obviously the
approach of predicting an execution plan efficiency is not the only way of
doing query optimization. Another interesting <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03814.pdf">example</a> is a learning
algorithm that optimizes not a plan itself, but a set of plan hints that could
steer query optimizer in one or another way. And I’m sure there are many others
exist, taking into account general nature of the question, when the same ideas
could be applied for completely different set of problems.</p>
<p>Thanks to authors of all mentioned papers and books for sharing those
fascinating insights!</p>

<p>Have you ever saw a recruiter in your company chat going like:</p>

<blockquote><strong>@here</strong> does anybody have the
experience with Language X to review the challenge of a candidate?</blockquote>

<p>It is not hard to see it for what it is. It is a cry for help.</p>

<p>What recruiters are looking for is a hiring decision, and they need an engineer
to do it for them.</p>



<p>If everything goes well, one of your engineers will speak up and will accept the
task of reviewing this code.</p>

<p>The process may look something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Recruiter forwards an email with an attached archive containing the
solution.</li>
<li>The engineer receives and cracks it open to try to figure out what it is.</li>
<li>They may have to install missing software on their laptops to open the
challenge files. For example, you work in Ruby, but the challenge is in
Java.</li>
<li>Once opened, they will then check if there are any tests that they can run.</li>
<li>If there are tests, they will read them first to check what exactly the
candidate is testing. And whether the tests are reasonable and sensible in
the first place.</li>
<li>The engineer may run those tests, and they may or may not work. That may get
the engineer into fixing mood. Are tests broken or incorrect? Or are they
failing because of a different environment? In both cases, a couple of hours
will pass by.</li>
<li>The engineer will not be able to perform a correctness check. Not unless
they created the testing infrastructure for this challenge in advance.
Reading source code is not enough to verify it is correct. Thus, they will only
check that there are no grave errors. And that it follows the corporate style
and personal preferences. After all, that is what they do on every pull
request.</li>
<li>After a couple of hours of reading, the engineer may get a perception of the
code quality. Unfortunately, they still have no proof if it will work in
production, or not. Even after all this time and effort invested.</li>
</ol>

<p>Yet, the engineer will need to make a hiring decision to move on with their
day, or whatever of it remains.</p>

<h2 id="the-decision-costs">The decision costs</h2>

people requires skill and experience. The engineers that can do that are
usually the most tenured ones of your team (and likely the ones earning the
most). Reviewing the solutions will consume the time of your most seasoned
veterans. The very same engineers you rely on to build your product.</p>

<p>They will have to stop what they are doing and likely spend their whole day
doing the submission review.</p>

<p>People are generally decent, and they will try to be fair. If the code they are
reviewing has no tests, what will they do? They will try their best to see if a
tainted first impression still hides a good developer beneath it. They will try
to get the best out of the candidate solution. The better they do, the more
time it will consume.</p>

<p>The worst-case scenario is that this goodwill—or high pressure to hire
someone—will translate into a bad hire. And it will bring all the added
costs of it spreading through the company and impacting your teams.</p>

<h2 id="should-you-worry">Should you worry</h2>

<p>If you look closely and honestly, you can see that most of what your engineers
are doing is toil.  Repeated work which brings little to no value. Highly
inefficient use of your engineering time.</p>

<p>We ran hundreds of such classic interviewing loops. What we have discovered is
that reviewing about 40% of the code challenges sent by candidates is a waste
of time. Some were incomplete, and others did not fit the description of the
problem. Sometimes they were simply a complete trainwreck.</p>

<p>Another 20% will not pass a thoughtful review process. And only the remaining
40% will be the pool out of which you can hire. Not to mention that
distribution, naturally, will be heavily skewed towards junior-level developers.
Less than 10% of your original pool of applicants will be senior-level people
and above.</p>

<p>Around 60% of the submissions will yank your people away from their tasks only
to end up in a direct rejection. They will impact your product development
without any return on investment. Do this often enough, and your whole
development pipeline will grind to a halt.</p>

<p>(Note: we processed about six hundred candidates when we calculated those
percentages.)</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do">What to do</h2>

<p>If you repeat, again and again, things that leave you off in a worse place than
before—stop doing them!</p>

<blockquote><pre>           __
          /  \        _____________
          |  |       /             \
          @  @       | Stop making |
          || ||      | bad hiring  |
          || ||   &lt;--| decisions!  |
          |\_/|      \_____________/
          \___/
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Only then can you move forward. Counterintuitively, the path forward is not
complicated or obscure as it could seem. What you need to do is improve your
filtering.</p>

<p>Stop burning time in candidates that have zero chance to go through. Here we
are talking about the initial 60% of the challenges you get back. Every hour
invested here is a wasted hour. Your senior people should focus on building and
maintaining your product instead. On a side note, you are also saving them from
the frustration of reviewing the lousy solutions. After all, the happier they
are, the better your company is.</p>

<p>Define a set of rules and metrics that you expect from a solution. Then,
communicate them to the candidates in all fairness. No unit tests are a no-go?
So be it, but let the candidate know it in advance, so the expectations are
clear. That not only makes it a fair game but also provides you with the tools
to apply those rules.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-did-and-what-worked-for-us">What we did, and what worked for us</h2>

<p>We applied a simple rule for our challenges: it has to work in production.</p>

<p>Immediate improvement was that we did not have to spend any time on the 60% of
solutions that were not working. Some candidates did not reply, and others did
not consider the test to be engaging or even fair. Some still insisted on the
interview, while being unable to ship something that works. We freed our
engineers from reviewing all those submissions.</p>

<p>That alone resulted in more than a 2x decrease in time spent on reviews. We
returned hundreds of hours of engineering time to the company by removing all
this toil. And on top of that, we removed all the not-fun work only!</p>

<p>For us, it resulted in happier engineers across the company. For candidates, it
improved transparency. They now understood what to expect upfront and how well
they are doing during the challenge. Overall, that increased our interview to
offer rate by roughly 50%.</p>

<h2 id="trying-it-out">Trying it out</h2>

<p>This simple change yielded fantastic results for us. So we have built it as a
product to help all the companies that want to hire smartly.  Engineering time
is an invaluable resource, so start saving it with
<a href="https://ais.autoiterative.com/demo">AutoIterative</a>. Reinvest it back into your
company and focus on your product, while we do the filtering for you.  Then you
can focus on interviewing the people who can deliver and meet the bar that you
set.</p>

They made a calculator to calculate how much it costs to make an app and the calculator calculated the cost by asking 10 questions related to the app. They embedded it on their website and it helped them to generate a lot of leads. From there on, founders came up with an idea of Outgrow to help people create interactive marketing tools to boost their lead generation. Initially, Outgrow was launched on Product Hunt and Hacker News to gauge the interest of the people before developing it further.</span></p><p><strong>PH launch method</strong></p><p><span>Saksham has done around 30 launches for Outgrow on Product Hunt. The method they use to launch the product on Product Hunt is to first analyze the trend on Product Hunt and then make a product around that trend. For Outgrow, their social media manager is responsible for analyzing the trend on PH and conveying the relevant information to the marketing team to create a product around it. Implementing the same strategy, they launched a gender pay gap calculator on International Women’s Day which brought a lot of leads and was among the top 5 products on the Product Hunt.</span></p><p><strong>Capitalizing the situation</strong></p><p><span>During the Covid-19, restaurants in Europe were badly affected due to their closure. High end restaurants which were not offering takeaways were looking for a solution to streamline their new takeaway operation. Saksham capitalized on the situation by creating a POS system on Outgrow for the restaurants. It went really well and in the short span of time other restaurants started using Outgrow to streamline their takeaways.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Advice for marketers</strong></p><p><span>To launch a product on Product Hunt, first understand what your product is and what problem it solves. Then, look for marketing trends as marketers are nowadays deriving strategies not from what other marketers are doing but from key marketing trends prevalent in the world.&nbsp;</span></p></div>

  <p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) automates network architecture engineering. It aims to learn a network topology that can achieve best performance on a certain task. By dissecting the methods for NAS into three components: search space, search algorithm and child model evolution strategy, this post reviews many interesting ideas for better, faster and more cost-efficient automatic neural architecture search.</p>
</blockquote>

<!--more-->

<p>Although most popular and successful model architectures are designed by human experts, it doesn’t mean we have explored the entire network architecture space and settled down with the best option. We would have a better chance to find the optimal solution if we adopt a systematic and automatic way of learning high-performance model architectures.</p>

<p>Automatically learning and evolving network topologies is not a new idea (<a href="http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf">Stanley &amp; Miikkulainen, 2002</a>). In recent years, the pioneering work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02167">Baker et al. 2017</a> has attracted a lot of attention into the field of Neural Architecture Search (NAS), leading to many interesting ideas for better, faster and more cost-efficient NAS methods.</p>

<p>As I started looking into NAS, I found this nice survey very helpful by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05377">Elsken, et al 2019</a>. They characterize NAS as a system with three major components, which is clean &amp; concise, and also commonly adopted in other NAS papers.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Search space</strong>: The NAS search space defines a set of operations (e.g. convolution, fully-connected, pooling) and how operations can be connected to form valid network architectures. The design of search space usually involves human expertise, as well as unavoidably human biases.</li>
  <li><strong>Search algorithm</strong>: A NAS search algorithm samples a population of network architecture candidates. It receives the child model performance metrics as rewards (e.g. high accuracy, low latency) and optimizes to generate high-performance architecture candidates.</li>
  <li><strong>Evaluation strategy</strong>: We need to measure, estimate, or predict the performance of a large number of proposed child models in order to obtain feedback for the search algorithm to learn. The process of candidate evaluation could be very expensive and many new methods have been proposed to save time or computation resources.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/NAS-high-level.png" alt="High-level categorization of NAS"></p>
<p><em>Figure 1. Three main components of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) models.  (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05377">Elsken, et al. 2019</a> with customized annotation in red)</em></p>



<h2 id="search-space">Search Space</h2>

<p>The NAS search space defines a set of basic network operations and how operations can be connected to construct valid network architectures.</p>

<h3 id="sequential-layer-wise-operations">Sequential Layer-wise Operations</h3>

<p>The most naive way to design the search space for neural network architectures is to depict network topologies, either CNN or RNN, with a list of <em>sequential layer-wise operations</em>, as seen in the early work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a> &amp; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02167">Baker et al. 2017</a>. The serialization of network representation requires a decent amount of expert knowledge, since each operation is associated with different layer-specific parameters and such associations need to be hardcoded. For example, after predicting a <code>conv</code> op, the model should output kernel size, stride size, etc; or after predicting an <code>FC</code> op, we need to see the number of units as the next prediction.</p>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/NAS-search-space.png" alt="The sequential layer-wise operation search space"></p>
<p><em>Figure 2. (Top) A sequential representation of CNN. (Bottom) A sequential representation of the tree structure of a recurrent cell. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a>)</em></p>

<p>To make sure the generated architecture is valid, additional rules might be needed (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a>):</p>
<ul>
  <li>If a layer is not connected to any input layer then it is used as the input layer;</li>
  <li>At the final layer, take all layer outputs that have not been connected and concatenate them;</li>
  <li>If one layer has many input layers, then all input layers are concatenated in the depth dimension;</li>
  <li>If input layers to be concatenated have different sizes, we pad the small layers with zeros so that the concatenated layers have the same sizes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The skip connection can be predicted as well, using an <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log%20/2018/06/24/attention-attention.html">attention</a>-style mechanism. At layer \(i\) , an anchor point is added with \(i−1\) content-based sigmoids to indicate which of the previous layers to be connected. Each sigmoid takes as input the hidden states of the current node \(h_i\) and \(i-1\) previous nodes \(h_j, j=1, \dots, i-1\) .</p><p>

\[P(\text{Layer j is an input to layer i}) = \text{sigmoid}(v^\top \tanh(\mathbf{W}_\text{prev} h_j + \mathbf{W}_\text{curr} h_i))\]

</p><p>The sequential search space has a lot of representation power, but it is very large and consumes a ton of computation resources to exhaustively cover the search space. In the experiments by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a>, they were running 800 GPUs in parallel for 28 days and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02167">Baker et al. 2017</a> restricted the search space to contain at most 2 <code>FC</code> layers.</p>

<h3 id="cell-based-representation">Cell-based Representation</h3>

<p>Inspired by the design of using repeated modules in successful vision model architectures (e.g. Inception, ResNet), the <em>NASNet search space</em> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07012">Zoph et al. 2018</a>) defines the architecture of a conv net as the same cell getting repeated multiple times and each cell contains several operations predicted by the NAS algorithm. A well-designed cell module enables transferability between datasets. It is also easy to scale down or up the model size by adjusting the number of cell repeats.</p>

<p>Precisely, the NASNet search space learns two types of cells for network construction:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Normal Cell</em>: The input and output feature maps have the same dimension.</li>
  <li><em>Reduction Cell</em>: The output feature map has its width and height reduced by half.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/NASNet-search-space.png" alt="NASNet search space"></p>
<p><em>Figure 3. The NASNet search space constrains the architecture as a repeated stack of cells. The cell architecture is optimized via NAS algorithms. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07012">Zoph et al. 2018</a>)</em></p>

<p>The predictions for each cell are grouped into \(B\) blocks (\(B=5\) in the NASNet paper), where each block has 5 prediction steps made by 5 distinct softmax classifiers corresponding to discrete choices of the elements of a block. Note that the NASNet search space does not have residual connections between cells and the model only learns skip connections on their own within blocks.</p>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/cell-prediction-steps.png" alt="5 prediction steps in one block"></p>
<p><em>Figure 4. (a) Each cell consists of \(B\) blocks and each block is predicted by 5 discrete decisions. (b) An concrete example of what operations can be chosen in each decision step.</em></p>

<p><a name="ScheduledDropPath"></a>During the experiments, they discovered that a modified version of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07648"><em>DropPath</em></a>, named <em>ScheduledDropPath</em>, significantly improves the final performance of NASNet experiments. DropPath stochastically drops out paths (i.e. edges with operations attached in NASNet) with a fixed probability. ScheduledDropPath is DropPath with a linearly increasing probability of path dropping during training time.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05377">Elsken, et al (2019)</a> point out three major advantages of the NASNet search space:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The search space size is reduced drastically;</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_motif">motif</a>-based architecture can be more easily transferred to different datasets.</li>
  <li>It demonstrates a strong proof of a useful design pattern of repeatedly stacking modules in architecture engineering. For example, we can build strong models by stacking residual blocks in CNN or stacking multi-headed attention blocks in Transformer.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="hierarchical-structure">Hierarchical Structure</h3>

<p>To take advantage of already discovered well-designed network <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_motif">motifs</a>, the NAS search space can be constrained as a hierarchical structure, as in <em>Hierarchical NAS</em> (<strong>HNAS</strong>; (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00436">Liu et al 2017</a>)). It starts with a small set of primitives, including individual operations like convolution operation, pooling, identity, etc. Then small sub-graphs (or “motifs”) that consist of primitive operations are recursively used to form higher-level computation graphs.</p>

<p>A computation motif at level \(\ell=1, \dots, L\) can be represented by \((G^{(\ell)}, \mathcal{O}^{(\ell)})\), where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(\mathcal{O}^{(\ell)}\) is a set of operations, \(\mathcal{O}^{(\ell)} = \{ o^{(\ell)}_1, o^{(\ell)}_2, \dots \}\)</li>
  <li>\(G^{(\ell)}\) is an adjacency matrix, where the entry \(G_{ij}=k\) indicates that operation \(o^{(\ell)}_k\) is placed between node \(i\) and \(j\). The node indices follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">topological ordering</a> in DAG, where the index \(1\) is the source and the maximal index is the sink node.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/hierarchical-NAS-search-space.png" alt="Hierarchical search space"></p>
<p><em>Figure 5. (Top) Three level-1 primitive operations are composed into a level-2 motif. (Bottom) Three level-2 motifs are plugged into a base network structure and assembled into a level-3 motif. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00436">Liu et al 2017</a>)</em></p>

<p>To build a network according to the hierarchical structure, we start from the lowest level \(\ell=1\) and recursively define the \(m\)-th motif operation at level \(\ell\) as</p><p>

\[o^{(\ell)}_m = \text{assemble}\Big( G_m^{(\ell)}, \mathcal{O}^{(\ell-1)} \Big)\]

</p><p>A hierarchical representation becomes \(\Big( \big\{ \{ G_m^{(\ell)} \}_{m=1}^{M_\ell} \big\}_{\ell=2}^L, \mathcal{O}^{(1)} \Big), \forall \ell=2, \dots, L\), where \(\mathcal{O}^{(1)}\) contains a set of primitive operations.</p>

<p>The \(\text{assemble}()\) process is equivalent to sequentially compute the feature map of node \(i\) by aggregating all the feature maps of its predecessor node \(j\) following the topological ordering:</p><p>

\[x_i = \text{merge} \big[ \{ o^{(\ell)}_{G^{(\ell)}_{ij}}(x_j) \}_{j &lt; i} \big], i = 2, \dots, \vert G^{(\ell)} \vert\]

</p><p>where \(\text{merge}[]\) is implemented as depth-wise concatenation in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00436">paper</a>.</p>

<p>Same as NASNet, experiments in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00436">Liu et al (2017)</a> focused on discovering good cell architecture within a predefined “macro” structure with repeated modules. They showed that the power of simple search methods (e.g. random search or evolutionary algorithms) can be substantially enhanced using well-designed search spaces.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02639">Cai et al (2018b)</a> propose a tree-structure search space using path-level network transformation. Each node in a tree structure defines an <em>allocation</em> scheme for splitting inputs for child nodes and a <em>merge</em> scheme for combining results from child nodes. The path-level network transformation allows replacing a single layer with a multi-branch motif if its corresponding merge scheme is add or concat.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Not too long ago, a friend and new contributor to a large codebase I work with was surprised to learn that an automatic linter rule will block the merge of any pull request containing the string FIXME. “This rule is ill-considered”, he cried out, exasperated.</p>
<p>Judging from his reaction, I didn’t do a good job of explaining the rationale behind our rule. Our use of FIXMEs is unorthodox, but we decided to adopt it for a reason. In fact, in my opinion treating FIXMEs as merge blockers is among the most effective techniques for reducing cognitive overload. In this post, I will explain how FIXMEs unclutter the mind. My goal is to show that automatically enforced FIXMEs are an effective tool for teams working on hard problems.</p>

<p>Code comments are as old as programming itself. Codetags are also not a recent innovation. In the 1980s, programmers started attaching special significance to short tags like FIXME or TODO.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Tags were added as a heads-up that the author wasn’t entirely satisfied with a solution, both as a <em>note to self</em> and for the benefit of other readers. The use of uppercase letters not only made tags stand out visually, it also makes it easy to grep for them.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Codetags are in wide use today, though semantics vary from team to team. While often initially vague, over time more specific meanings tend to materialize, much like emojis in Slack communities gradually acquire a more definite meaning. In my team, a clear line separates FIXMEs from TODOs. The distinction between the two is not universal - it’s an arbitrary convention, but a very useful one. A TODO annotation means that the code in question could be optimized or cleaned up. Crucially, however, delaying the suggested improvement is acceptable, perhaps even preferable from a project-management perspective. A TODO is a gentle nudge. FIXMEs, on the other hand, signal that the code isn’t ready to merge until the author addresses the problem. Our automated linter adds reality to this stringent judgment: FIXMEs fail the CI build, while TODOs are given a pass.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Tags with an agreed-upon meaning aid communication between team members while the pull request is in progress. “FIXME or TODO?” you might ask your colleague while pairing, requesting clarification of the status and priority of a less-than-satisfying solution. Similarly, during code review a FIXME left in the code signals that the line annotated requires close attention. It’s a cry for help: “I’m stuck! Can we talk about this?”</p>
<p>While there are valid use cases for TODOs (more on that below), it is FIXMEs that are the more powerful of the two. In particular, FIXMEs have an important role to play before code is ready to review, which is the aspect I will focus on in this post. When encountering a stumbling block — a thought that will lead you away from your path — what you can do is to introduce a FIXME comment:</p>
<pre><code>// FIXME: hardcoded user-id

// FIXME: O(n2) time complexity, check if fast enough</code></pre>
<p>Some FIXMEs concern small detours, like retrieving a user-id from inside an existing function. Other issues are more substantial and will require serious thought to resolve. Either way fixing the issue demands mental bandwidth, which is in short supply. While it’s tempting to jump into the FIXME right away, the best choice is often to leave it to one side for the moment.</p>
<h2 id="two-examples-of-using-fixmes">Two examples of using FIXMEs</h2>
<p>Let’s look at two specific maneuvers made possible by FIXMEs. The first, <em>hardcoding</em>, is a form of wishful thinking. When the structure of the code makes it awkward to use a value, a refactoring safari is often needed. The maneuver is to delay this step. Wishful thinking begins with the what-if question. What if we had access to the id here? Well, let’s just pretend that we already do by hardcoding the value. This won’t work except in a very specific case, of course, so it’s not a generic solution — quite the opposite. But hardcoding an absurdly specific solution will allow you to make progress on the design while bracketing insignificant details. The generic solution will come later.</p>
<p><em>Stubbing</em>, the second maneuver, helps when multiple cases need to be considered. You start with a stub, replacing the missing case with an active FIXME:</p>
<pre><code>switch (v) {
   case 1:
   // do something
   break;
   case 2:
   // do something
   break;
   default:
   throw new Error("FIXME: Not implemented");
}</code></pre>
<p>With the partial implementation in place, can now experiment with and get a feel for the code. When you hit the missing case, it will fail loudly and clearly, with an exception and a stacktrace. But the FIXME is not only active at runtime. It will also ensure that you won’t forget to fill in the missing case before finishing your branch.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="juggling-concepts-and-virtual-memory">Juggling concepts and virtual memory</h2>
<p>Pausing a train of thought by converting it into a FIXME improves the flow of deep work, and we can see why by remembering that so many of us struggle to manage our daily priorities. As unfinished work piles up, we develop a nagging doubt in the back of our minds, a fear that there’s something important we’re forgetting, with all the bad consequences that entails. As a solution, David Allen’s Getting Things Done famously proposes a system of lists and weekly review sessions.<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Lists work because writing a task into a notebook permits you to forget about it temporarily. Keeping a written list of <em>IN</em> tasks helps you relax about your obligations, so that instead of incessantly worrying about things falling through the cracks, you can be confident that the task is stashed away in a secure place. You know you’ll return to the tasks in your review session, which has a pre-scheduled spot in your calendar.</p>
<p>Let’s apply this idea to coding. FIXMEs are powerful because programming is a cognitively demanding activity. There are limits to how many concepts we can grasp at any given time. In juggling, the number of balls an average person can keep in the air is three.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> How many ideas can a person actively keep in their head at the same time? Perhaps more than three, but by most counts the number of ideas we can juggle is depressingly low. To switch metaphors, the programmer’s RAM or working memory is a scarce resource. Sure, there’s a spectrum here – some people can retain more data in memory than others. But if not careful, even the best programmer quickly runs out of heap.</p>
<p>We can push the analogy even further. Think of how effective pair programming is when working through a hard problem. The Linux virtual memory system allows the user to double their RAM by making use of spare hard drive capacity. Similarly, the pairing partner temporarily expands the programmer’s working memory by allowing them access to part of their cognitive capacity. Writing down FIXMEs achieves a similar effect. Whereas in a pairing session you extend your cognitive capacity with help from your partner, FIXMEs allow you to swap to disk. You remove an idea from your working memory, with the intention of paging it back in as needed, usually at the end of the session.<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="focus-on-the-inherent-complexity">Focus on the inherent complexity</h2>
<p>The net effect of temporarily transferring inessential questions to swap space is improved focus on the inherent complexity of the problem, the solution to which is the ultimate goal. Accidental complexity has a talismanic quality. We have an unfortunate but understandable tendency to get distracted by mere details of how to express an idea in code. It is true that eventually we will need a decision about the accidental aspects of the problem, but as a rule it is better to tackle the essential complexity first. The rest is FIXMEs.</p>
<p>Your brain is prone to worrying that you may after all forget about the hardcoded value left in the code or the quadratic complexity that might blow up in production. People will be angry at you, or, what may be worse, you’ll blame yourself. Whether we like it or not, emotions and other sub-conscious processes play a big role in our ability to focus. The unconscious mind will not allow itself to stop worrying about a task unless it is written down, with a system in place ensuring you will circle back to the topic without risking emotional backlash. Writing down FIXMEs has a liberating effect. With CI as a safety net, the brain can relax.</p>
<h2 id="three-ways-of-eliminating-fixmes">Three ways of eliminating FIXMEs</h2>
<p>After moving the distraction out of the way, you can focus on the core problem. When your RAM isn’t cluttered with inessential details, the clearer view gives you a better shot at seeing the solution. At some point, of course, you will need to go back to the problem you snoozed. Having reached this point, eliminating the FIXME can take one of three possible forms.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Perhaps surprisingly, you may be able to simply delete the FIXME at this point. Sometimes things fall into place. In the process of implementing the main logic, you often end up solving the incidental issue as a consequence of the approach chosen, perhaps without even realizing it. Additionally, addressing the essential complexity puts you in a better position to understand the original incidental problem. Equipped with this knowledge, you may realize there’s nothing left to fix. Perhaps in practice n is always 3, so O(n2) complexity is perfectly fine. Or you recognize that, with the confidence gained from completing an implementation, your worry was about something that wasn’t worth worrying about in the first place.</p></li>
<li><p>Another possible resolution is to face the problem head-on by performing the task you anticipated initially, for instance refactoring the code to get access to the user-id you needed or rewriting the algorithm to require O(n) iterations instead of O(n2). Frequently, a test case needs to be added as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally you can choose to downgrade the FIXME to TODO status. A TODO can remind you that the concern should be addressed at some point in the future. Often, filing a follow-up issue in your bug tracker will help make sure that the matter is not forgotten.<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Filing a follow-up is not always what we would prefer, but it’s a valuable tool, especially when …</p></li></ol></div></div></div></div>

August 7, 2020 | https://redtachyon.me/post/personal-website/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://redtachyon.me/post/personal-website/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So, as you might have noticed, this is a fresh website. Setting it up was, at first, pretty frustrating, so if you’re also thinking about setting up your own piece of internet to write posts like this, hopefully it’ll help you avoid most of the problems.</p><p>If you want to get on to the technical stuff – just go to the
<a href="#setup">Setup</a> part, since I know how frustrating it is to read the author’s entire autobiography before they get to the point. However, I’d like to give you an idea of what to expect in terms of difficulty and features included – basically a rationale for what I did what I did, and perhaps a more interesting narrative to read through.</p><p><img src="https://redtachyon.me/post/personal-website/inception.png" alt="A screenshot of the main page of this website" title="Sup dawg, I heard you like websites in your websites"></p><p>As I’m about to begin a PhD, I looked back to my undergrad days – ambitious, hopeful, looking up everyone at my university who works with similar stuff to get some research experience. And one thing I immensely appreciated was when researchers have personal websites detailing their research and invited visitors to contact them.</p><p>Another thing is that apparently, notoriety is useful in research – and to this end, while I could probably just start a
<a href="https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1274782757907030016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twitter storm</a> (as a side note: I’m team LeCun here), but a much more productive method would likely just be writing about my research (which I intend to do – as soon as I start it).</p><p>Lastly, every once in a while I like making small programming projects. Just some visualization, maybe a game or an animation on HTML Canvas, and it’d be cool to host it on the internet somehow, under my own domain without having to setup a whole backend for that, worrying about security and all that.</p><p>So to summarize, what I wanted was a nice-looking blog platform that handles most boring stuff for me, allows some convenient functionality to show off my projects, and any ability to just host some HTML files under a URL path to do whatever I come up with. And of course, ideally I’d like it to be free.</p><p>And as an extra bonus, because I’m a stats nerd, it’d be cool to have some usage analytics to see where all the five visitors are from. Google Analytics maybe?</p><p>Spoiler alert: I managed all of this. So if it sounds like something you’d want, keep on reading.</p><p><img src="https://redtachyon.me/post/personal-website/skills.png" alt="The second section of my homepage showcasing my skills" title="Not a CSS in sight"></p><p>To give you an idea of my technical skill, at the time of writing, I just finished a Master’s degree in Autonomous Systems and am preparing to begin a PhD in Artificial Intelligence. I’m pretty comfortable with Python and to a smaller degree, other languages (of which the most relevant is probably JS, or preferably TS), and know enough web dev to write a simple server and a simple front-end… but that’s about it in the web dev department.</p><p>Most notably, I’m severly lacking in any kind of graphic design skills, which messes things up a little bit. After all, if you’re making a portfolio website, you want it to be pretty, and I’d rather eat my thesis than do a major project with CSS.</p><p>Fortunately, all that you need to know for this process is how to use the terminal, how to use Git (at least the very basics) and how to edit text documents. So in all likelihood, you’re good to go. But even if Git sounds intimidating – trust me, it’s not, just make sure you have it installed (Mac/Linux) or install it (Windows), enter the commands in the article and the linked tutorials, and you’ll be good to go.</p><p><img src="https://redtachyon.me/post/personal-website/success.jpg" alt="An image showing that the road to success can be twisted and with many dead ends" title="Sure, it's a tiny bit cringy, but I guess some motivation isn't always bad"></p><p>My first thought was using GitHub Pages – it’s techy, it’s hip, I know a bunch of people with personal pages there, why not? I had actually tried it out with Jekyll a year ago or so, but didn’t really like it – I found the customization to be somewhat complicated, setting up the domain was more complicated than I would’ve liked it to be, and the website just looked… boring.</p><p>Of course, with some more effort, you can also use other static site generators. There’s a bunch of them, and the one that caught my eye was Hugo. Seemed to have decent reviews, with a bunch of nice themes, should still be hostable on GitHub Pages, right?</p><p>Wrong. I mean, I’m sure it’s possible, it’s probably also not that hard if you know what you’re doing, but it just didn’t happen in my case. I chose the Academic theme, which seems to be a whole beast in of itself. So from Hugo tutorials and quickstarts, I quickly moved on to Hugo Academic documentation, which made the local version of the website look really nice from the get-go, but for some reason, GitHub Pages just returned a build error, seemingly stemming from some unused file in the Academic theme.</p><p>Then I went into the rabbit hole of trying to make my own fork of the Academic theme with the required change, to removing the submodule relation of a directory, all of that failing in the end. Sure, it worked on my localhost, but after pushing the changes to GitHub it was still broken.</p><p>In all of this I was so dead-set on using GitHub Pages that I ignored any other options, even the ones handed to me on a silver platter. You see, Hugo Academic has a one-click quickstart for Netlify. I was skeptical – it’s a service I’m not particularly familiar with, and the default domain name you get for free is something like
<a href="https://ecstatic-volhard-8cf203.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ecstatic-volhard-8cf203.netlify.app</a> – yea, that’s not going to work for my hip research blog.</p><p>Thing is, when I set it up (for free), it worked like a dream. The page is instantly live under that ugly URL, so it might be worth giving it a shot? And what can I say – it still worked great, I was able to tweak the website and have the new version live within a minute of pushing it to GitHub.</p><p>So how hard is it to get a domain anyways? Pretty easy, as it turns out, at least if you’re a student. See, there’s this thing called
<a href="https://education.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Education</a> where you can get free access to a whole lot of free software – be sure to check it out! One of the offers is a free .me domain on Namecheap for a year. Pretty cool, huh? If you’re not a student – well, you’ll probably have to dish out a few bucks for the domain, but otherwise the process should be the same.</p><p>So to summarize what we’ll be building – a Hugo blog using the Academic theme, hosted on Netlify from a GitHub repository, available through a free Namecheap domain.</p><p>First things first, if you somehow don’t already have one, get a free
<a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> account. If you’re a student, make sure you sign up also for the
<a href="https://education.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Education</a> pack to get that sweet sweet free domain.</p><p>As mentioned before, we’ll be using Hugo which is a static website generator built in Go, but don’t worry – I didn’t need to write or read a single line of Go, and neither will you. So head over to the
<a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hugo Quickstart page</a> and if you’re anything like me and want to get at least a sense of what’s happening, go through the tutorial to get a sense of what it is and how it works. But you can easily just skip this as well – you can just look stuff up as you go in the future. If you want to do some development on your local machine (recommended, but not mandatory), go ahead and install Hugo according to the quickstart. And if you’re fine with just testing in production by modifying files directly on GitHub… I mean, I’m not going to stop you, you can skip this entire paragraph and move on to the…</p><p>You might have noticed we haven’t <em>really</em> set up the website. That’s because the Academic theme and Netlify are coupled together so well that it really just happens automatically. You can see that for yourself – just head over to the
<a href="https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/install/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hugo Academic Getting Started</a> page and just follow their instructions – click the nice looking button shown below and create a Netlify account.</p><p><img src="https://redtachyon.me/post/personal-website/button.png" alt="A button" title="Button"></p><p>And just like that – you have a live website! Sure, it’s slightly lackluster and it’s literally just a premade template, but hey – once you figure out how to customize it and add some content, you’ll be pretty much done, right?</p><p>Well, almost. As mentioned before, by default you get a domain name like
<a href="https://redtachyon.me/post/personal-website/ecstatic-volhard-8cf203.netlify.app">ecstatic-volhard-8cf203.netlify.app</a> which just doesn’t sound that memorable. That being said – go to your
<a href="https://app.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admin panel</a> and check it out to make sure it works, even under that ugly address since now we’re about to fix that.</p><p>Here, you generally have several viable options. For one, there’s the Domains tab in your admin panel where you can buy a domain directly through Netlify, which I’m sure should be completely seamless and easy, so if that sounds good to you – I’m sure you’ll figure it out. Thing is, I’m stingy and don’t want to pay. Luckily, I’m a student – and here’s where GitHub Education comes in. Head on over to
<a href="https://education.github.com/pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://education.github.com/pack</a> and go through the necessary process to Get the Pack. It could take a bit to get all the credentials confirmed – if that’s the case, just skip this section for now and come back when it’s approved.</p><p>Once you have your Education Pack, check out the
<a href="https://education.github.com/pack/offers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offers</a>. As you can see, there’s a lot of them – be sure to see if there’s anything else you’d like! But right now just find the Namecheap offer and, per their suggestion,
<a href="https://nc.me/github/auth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connect your GitHub account to Namecheap</a>. You can then choose a domain and, provided it’s still available, get it completely for free for a full year!</p><p>Now we just need to connect the parts. If you go to the admin panel of Netlify, you should see a button that says Domain settings - go ahead and click it. Alternatively, you can just go to the Settings tab and choose Domain management. Either way, you’ll be presented with a Custom domains window which should prompt you to add a domain. Add it, confirm you’re the owner and you’ll likely see some warning or error message – don’t worry! Just investigate it, and you should see some gibberish about an A-record and some IP address. Copy that address and head over to Namecheap. Log in, go to Manage on your freshly obtained domain, and switch to the Advanced DNS tab.</p><p>Full disclosure – I’m not a web developer, I only have a vague idea of how this works, but since it does work, I have no reason to complain. In Advanced DNS, under Host Records, there will be some records. Go ahead and remove all A Records, and then create a new one. Again, you want it to be an A Record, with @ as the Host (don’t ask me what that means though), and the Value set to the IP you copied earlier.</p></div></div>

          <h2>AM011</h2>

<blockquote>
<h2>Heads up!</h2>
<p>This is a short story exploring technical blogging as narrative non-fiction.
It reads like a tale, and while it aims to entertain and be relatable, it
attempts to expose a set of underlying technical points.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A file somewhere feels its bits munged around, as our programmer saves it.</p>
<p>"ERROR!", yells the terminal output again. Eyes roll. What was it this time?
They wondered. Did I pass in the wrong variable? Was it the wrong property
name?</p>
<p>"Silly me", mutters the programmer. It was indeed a typo. "'email', not
'emial'".</p>
<p>You see, this programmer had been learning to code using an old <em>statically
typed</em> language, so they were still not used to computers yelling out loud
"you're making mistakes" this fast, this often, and often even showing how to
fix the mistakes. But as programmers do, this one was picking up pace. Today a
few lines, tomorrow a few modules.</p>
<p>Quickly they learned that these things, "types", don't <em>just</em> mix very well
unless you're very explicit about it. That everything needs to have the right
name. That sometimes you make modules that deal with a "thing", and you hide
what that thing is from everyone else.</p>
<p>We say "let everyone in on...", but we really mean that if some code was a
person and some other was another person, these people would share some
information.</p>
<p>As time passed, our coder grew fond of this imaginary companion that would yell
at them on every turn, letting them discover the wondrous world of computing
through their fascinating, buggy programs.</p>
<h4>First Job</h4>
<p>HR sent the email that morning, announcing our programmer they would be joining
a new company! Excitement. On a team that used a modern <em>dynamically typed</em>
language. Doubt.</p>
<p>"How is it possible", our protagonist wondered, "that the compiler doesn't know
what things are? Bytes flowing out of control throughout the controls of the
program without anyone knowing what was what at any point in time? Madness"</p>
<p>Our programmer, you see, was used to defining what things were upfront. In this
new project, there seemed to be no way to do this that was well accepted. In
fact, this language seemed to have a split community of users that couldn't
even agree with each other on whether they liked this unstructured,
metamorphing data in the first place!</p>
<p>Some, bent to the will of the language, moved bytes in the hopes that they will
be what they should, aggressively checking everywhere before using them.</p>
<p>Others insisted in using something gimmick of the language that <em>looked like a
type</em> but wasn't quite the same. It was a trick, played to give you the sense
of security.</p>
<p>And our programmer struggled to find their place in this world, without their
imaginary companion showing them how it could be better.</p>
<h4>Amalgamating</h4>
<p>One, and then two tests printed yes. A third test goes red. Now the first one
is broken. "Ughhhh why is it so hard to refactor this f*cking thing", someone
complained on the back.</p>
<p>A chair turns around, and rolls over, offering help. It seems that someone
changed the underlying structure of one of these objects, and while there was
no tests that proved it was broken, production code was failing.</p>
<p>"I mean I get it, we're not making a class for this, since we are functional
programmers or whatever but wouldn't it be nice if we had a single definition
of what this thing looks like", argued the complainer pointing at a stacktrace.
It was ridden with irrelevant details, but if you squinted, you maybe would
find that they had tried to access some data that no longer resided inside of
the object. "I'd love it we could catch these things earlier on".</p>
<p>Long ago our coder used to work with a companion that would complain very early
on, very often, and very loudly. Long ago they used to write one module per
"thing", whatever that thing was. Sometimes creating a "thing" meant it must
have passed certain requirements, so the rest of the code wouldn't need to
check for these things later on. But that was a long time ago.</p>
<p>And our programmer, wondering why not just make a module for this thing,
shared:</p>
<p>"I mean, sure, we don't quite have a compiler complaining at us on every new
line we write, but I've noticed it does complain about <em>some things</em>...</p>
<p>So hear me out, what if we just make a new module with functions to both
create, but also access and alter this thing."</p>
<p>"Ugh more code?", the complaining continued.</p>
<p>"Yeah so instead of just passing that data around, you would be forced to use
this module, and then if we need to change something like a name of one of its
properties, then the function names will change and the compiler will complain
about that. I mean it can't tell the property name has changed, but it can tell
that the function name has, right?", our programmer proposed, sketching
pseudocode.</p>
<pre><code>module(OurThing) {
  %% fields: A, B, C

  fun create(a, b, c) {
    %% check if they're good
  }

  fun a(thing) { thing[0] }
  fun with_a(thing, newA) { {...thing, 0: newA} }

  fun b(thing) { thing[1] }
  fun with_a(thing, newB) { {...thing, 1: newB} }

  %% etc
}
</code></pre>
<p>This made sense to our programmer. What else could be changed from how the code
was written in this new language to leverage whatever information the compiler
was already giving?</p>
<p>A dismissive voice across the room joined the conversation without a lot of
interest. There seems to always be at least one of these. "Pff, that's just
creating your own shitty classes again".</p>
<p>"Sort of", rebutted our protagonist, "except then we would control the internal
structure, and nobody could accidentally rely on it without like clearly
breaking through that barrier of abstraction!</p>
<p>Classes would look like regular objects to everyone else, and they'd invite the
coupling.</p>
<p>We could do this for every piece of data we work with, just one tiny module,
you know, and it could even do the minimum validation we need to make sure the
data is good, which would save other layers of the code from having...to double
check...these things..."</p>
<p>Something clicked in our programmers heads.</p>
<p>The rest of the team turned towards the discussion, curious and inquisitive, as
the programmer started sketching onto a whiteboard squares and arrows,
illustrating the problems they were having, explaining why this kind of
abstraction made sense when working with a different language and how it solves
the problems they have right now while allowing them to build systems that are
more explicitly and intentionally coupled than the accidental spaghetti of data
the project seemed to evolve into.</p>
<p>Question and answer flew back and forth and back again as the team brought code
onto screens and debated the ugliness, effectiveness, efficiency, readability,
maintainability, extensibility, and testability of the code that could be.</p>
<p>And the team agreed to give it a shot.</p>
<p>That was the moment our programmer realized, whatever the language to use at
work, whatever the project that needs to be built, all they needed was a tool
to complain about the way things were at every turn and show them how things
could be fixed, how things could be better. A tool like the one they had
learned with.</p>
<p>From now on, they will always have their own <strong>imaginary compiler</strong>.</p>

                    <p><a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> and <a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a> are both new Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs) that evolved in the recent 10 years. Quoting the introduction to WebAssembly on <a href="https://webassembly.org/">webassembly.org</a>:</p><blockquote>WebAssembly (abbreviated <em>Wasm</em>) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable target for compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.</blockquote><p>and the introduction to RISC-V on <a href="https://riscv.org/">riscv.org</a>:</p><blockquote>RISC-V is a free and open ISA enabling a new era of processor innovation through open standard collaboration. Born in academia and research, RISC-V ISA delivers a new level of free, extensible software and hardware freedom on architecture, paving the way for the next 50 years of computing design and innovation.</blockquote><p>It seems that these two ISAs are quite different. WebAssembly is primarily targeted at JIT compilation and in particular, browsers, while RISC-V is designed for hardware and one of its goals is efficient implementation on FPGAs and circuits. They're like Java and x86 respectively in the old days: A bytecode format, and a hardware instruction set. How can they be related?</p><p>Well, the boundary between bytecodes and real hardware instruction sets is actually a bit blurred. The x86 instruction set, for example, was once executed directly by the circuits that performs control and arithmetic operations. But now on newer Intel and AMD CPUs, x86 instructions are decoded into a internal RISC format on-the-fly and sent into a RISC core for execution - isn't it some kind of hardware "JIT compilation" similar to what JRE does for Java? Meanwhile, there are also experimental hardware implementations for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_processor">Java</a> and <a href="https://github.com/piranna/wasmachine">WebAssembly</a>, though not being as efficient as what a JIT compiler can achieve on a modern, mature CPU.</p><p>Actually, people are already using RISC-V in a position where WebAssembly has usually been used for: smart contract on blockchains. It is the <a href="https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-vm">CKB VM</a>. Across the blurred line between the WebAssembly bytecode format and the RISC-V hardware instruction set, what are the similarities, and what are the differences?</p><p>Let's do a comparison.</p><h3 id="feature-table">Feature table</h3><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The similarities are quite common, so I will focus on the differences here.</p><p><strong>1. Separated code and data</strong></p><p>Most modern architectures use a unique addressing space for code and data, including RISC-V. But WebAssembly doesn't, and actually the running code is not even provided with a way to access itself. Possible reasons:</p><ul><li>Simplicity for JIT compilation. If code can modify itself, then the JIT compiler needs to detect the modification and update the corresponding machine code - which is very complex.</li><li>WebAssembly's assumption about a powerful host environment. Linking, etc. will be done entirely by the host, and the program doesn't need to care about bringing itself up.</li><li>Security. Generating code at runtime is dangerous.</li></ul><p><strong>2. Typing and control flow</strong></p><p>WebAssembly is very "structured": The JIT compiler requires all function calls, loops, jumps and value types to conform to structural constraints. For example, you can't pass two values to a function that accepts three arguments, you can't jump to a location in another function, and you can't execute the floating point add instruction on two integers.</p><p>RISC-V however has none of these constraints. Everything is just values in registers and it's up to the programmer to decide how to use them.</p><p><strong>3. Machine model</strong></p><p>WebAssembly is built upon the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_machine">stack machine</a> model, while RISC-V (along with most other hardware architectures) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_machine">register machine</a>.</p><p>In WebAssembly, <em>semantically</em> any instruction pops its operands (if any) from the value stack, performs the defined operation, and pushes its results (if any) back on to the value stack. However, the structure of the value stack at any point in the program can be statically determined - which is different from the Java bytecode, for example, in that keeping the stack structure statically determinable is not an optimization but a compile-time mandatory requirement.</p><p><strong>4. Memory</strong></p><p>While both ISAs define an untyped, byte-addressable memory, some details are different. Memory in WebAssembly is literally a large byte array: addresses start from zero and continuously span to an upper limit (which can be dynamically increased by executing an instruction). In comparison, RISC-V uses <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory">virtual memory</a></em> where page tables are used to map addresses to the underlying physical memory.</p><figure><img src="https://invariant.me/content/images/2020/03/wasm-riscv-comp.png"><figcaption>Memory layouts</figcaption></figure><p>WebAssembly's memory model, although being simple to implement and efficient when JIT compiled, has several issues compared to RISC-V:</p><ul><li>Address zero is valid, causing programs that assume a crash for dereferencing the null pointer to misbehave.</li><li>No "gaps" are possible. Therefore the guard page trick to prevent stack overflow in a multi-threaded environment won't work.</li></ul><p>Virtual memory usually comes with memory protection where each memory page has a combination of <em>read</em>, <em>write</em> and <em>execute</em> permissions. This is an important security mechanism because it prevents execution and writes on memory regions where such operations aren't expected. RISC-V implements memory protection but WebAssembly does not - maybe it's less important in an architecture where executable code isn't addressable?</p><p><strong>5. Synchronization</strong></p><p>A computing machine needs at least one conditional branch instruction to be turing complete. Similarly, a multiprocessor architecture needs at least one "atomic conditional branch" instruction for proper synchronization. This instruction is <code>i{32,64}.atomic.rmw.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap">cmpxchg</a></code> in WebAssembly, and <code><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load-link/store-conditional">LR/SC</a></code> in RISC-V.</p><p><code>LR/SC</code> has stronger semantics than <code>cmpxchg</code>. With <code>cmpxchg</code> we have the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABA_problem">ABA problem</a>, but <code>LR/SC</code> is not affected. It also means that emulating <code>LR/SC</code> with a <code>cmpxchg</code>-only architecture is much more difficult than the other way; something like a global lock or transactional memory has to be used, greatly increasing the complexity. RISC-V is designed for hardware anyway, but if you ever want to write a software implementation you will have to work around this issue.</p><hr><blockquote>Side note: I worked on/am working on both a RISC-V interpreter, <a href="https://github.com/losfair/FlatRv">FlatRv</a>, and a full WebAssembly JIT runtime, <a href="https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer">Wasmer</a>. Take a look at them and star if you like my work :)</blockquote>

Even if you are working on an internal product, everything has its customer and buyer.</p><p id="0583">There is a saying “He who pays the piper calls the tune”. However, there is a limit, and every request must be considered wisely. Blindly following demands of inexperienced IT stakeholders isn’t a good strategy. It might result in the ludicrous final product, which is conflicting with the quality and professional skills your company offers. It is important to build a long-term relationship with a customer, who has the possibility and willingness to pay regularly and steadily.</p><p id="bb44">A good customer will even increase the contract amount with the growth of the project. This can only be achieved if your work brings value and revenue to the customer.</p><p id="db80">Below I present a list of common principles of work communication with clients. Following them will allow you to build a successful product. These guidelines are applicable to all customer-facing roles in software development.</p><p id="5b4a">This means that you have to put yourself in customers’ shoes and discover the motives of their requests and goals. Motives can be obvious or hidden (see<a href="http://momtestbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the Mom Testbook</a> for more details).</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Customer Affinity." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/1*hFuzGn45iA1LY145pJGmGg.jpeg" width="1400" height="1120" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*hFuzGn45iA1LY145pJGmGg.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*hFuzGn45iA1LY145pJGmGg.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*hFuzGn45iA1LY145pJGmGg.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*hFuzGn45iA1LY145pJGmGg.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*hFuzGn45iA1LY145pJGmGg.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="75d5">If you feel that you don’t have enough information to get a full scope of the task — you need to ask for it. You are about to invest your time in solving these problems. You need to understand all the aspects before setting priorities. Everything has to be completely transparent. If you have received a task or a user story and spot contentious issues or gaps, you have to make sure to fill them in. Try to get the full story to be on the same page with your client. You and your customer look differently at tasks and their solutions. The client may talk about one thing, think about another one, and expect something completely different. By using customer affinity, you will be able to speak one language with your customer and use it for creating a detailed plan for your entire team.</p><p id="7719">Successful implementation of customer affinity practice enables you to see the business concept.</p><ol><li id="ea8d">Most of your clients are using your services to gain profit for their businesses. However, not always they are following their own goals. Sometimes their tasks are not business-focused and even create obstacles for making more money. For example, the client’s acquaintance advised them to add a new feature, or they are asking to create a reporting tool, which they will never use. Features with low or zero business value may take your team a bulk of time. All these issues must be raised, discussed, and pointed at. The majority of the clients are sensible people, so they will see that your arguments make sense.</li></ol><p id="bb21">2. Don’t be overly straightforward. Sometimes clients keep insisting on useless tasks. “I want it this or no other way!” In such a case, try to reveal the hidden motives of your customer by asking questions. Why the task is so necessary to implement? Most often your clients know end-users better than you, and you need to rely on their expertise. A compromise may be to release a ‘feature MVP’ on production and receive first feedback from end-users. If the experience is negative, the customer will admit their mistake. Next time they will follow your advice. However, if the user feedback is positive, you have partly lost your credibility in the eyes of the customer, and you will have to follow their recommendations more often in the future.</p><figure><a href="https://maddevs.io/services?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=pm"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/9600/1*2wcwp-DEheW1MELNB384Rg.jpeg" width="4800" height="1200" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*2wcwp-DEheW1MELNB384Rg.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*2wcwp-DEheW1MELNB384Rg.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*2wcwp-DEheW1MELNB384Rg.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*2wcwp-DEheW1MELNB384Rg.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*2wcwp-DEheW1MELNB384Rg.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></a></figure><p id="b365">Most of the companies are carefully choosing their clients. Therefore, if you have partnered with someone, you have to remember the following:</p><ol><li id="62de"><strong>Honesty</strong>: promptly address any issues or failures you might have, so the client could make arrangements on their side. No one is immune to errors but silencing them will be considered as a sin.</li><li id="dff5"><strong>Respect</strong>: your client might have their quirks. But they chose your services and are willing to pay for them. Just for this they already deserve respect.</li><li id="13de"><strong>Moderation</strong>: try to hold back your emotions when communicating with your client. They might be inconsiderate or have a bad mood, but acting the same way will bring you no good. If you are mad at something, pour it out inside the team. If you missed something during a talk with a client, apologize for it. It doesn’t mean that we are going to put up with their antics. If a customer suddenly stops proper communication and starts being rude all the time, you can terminate the contract. Apart from that everything is manageable and can be negotiated.</li></ol><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2320/1*gSJigMopDJaC1qIfreZ1XA.png" width="1160" height="549" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*gSJigMopDJaC1qIfreZ1XA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*gSJigMopDJaC1qIfreZ1XA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*gSJigMopDJaC1qIfreZ1XA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*gSJigMopDJaC1qIfreZ1XA.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*gSJigMopDJaC1qIfreZ1XA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="5cbf">This is especially important in establishing relationships with remote clients. Here I would like to provide some useful extracts from the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Remote-Office-Required-Jason-Fried/dp/0804137501" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Remote. Office Not Required”</a> by Jason Fried:</p><ol><li id="d43f">Regularly give your client an insight into the project. This is the most effective way to help them cope with natural anxiety. But look, they are paying you a fair amount of money and it’s reasonable that they are going to have some degree of concern from the moment they give you advance fee. When clients see a continuous result of your effort, they are feeling more relaxed.</li><li id="4046">You have to be always available to the client. Considering that you don’t have the opportunity to see each other in person, it is important to timely giveback calls, answer emails, respond in messengers, etc. Those are the basics of business ethics and their relevance is exponentially increasing when working remotely. Even though it may seem like an irrational feeling but if your customer perceives you as a “local”, they will consider you more reliable. But if you and your client are located in different countries, they will suspiciously react to any missed calls and “lost” emails. It is in your best interest to be available.</li><li id="bd80">Involve clients at each stage of the work, they should see the whole process. Let them feel that it is also their project. Yes, you were indeed chosen because of your vast experience, but they are also knowledgeable. Organize shared online access to the project’s schedule, ask clients to give comments and listen to their suggestions, give them tasks (or let them give tasks to you). When the customer feels like they are a part of the project, the feeling of anxiety and nervousness will be replaced by excitement and appreciation.</li></ol><p id="ccb5">Nevertheless, you have to remember that from the moment you signed the contract you and your client are one team. You two go hand in hand to your mutual goal. That’s why establishing a strong bond with a customer should be a priority for the entire technical team. Being respectful, considerate, always open-minded, and available for a discussion is the foundation of a long-standing partnership. Besides, it is essential to ensure that your client is feeling involved and present in the project despite the distance that might keep you apart. A trustful and strong relationship with the client is key to a great experience of working on the project.</p><figure><a href="https://maddevs.io/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=pm"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/9600/1*pFrBAz4SFU8003BPmKKe2Q.jpeg" width="4800" height="1200" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*pFrBAz4SFU8003BPmKKe2Q.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*pFrBAz4SFU8003BPmKKe2Q.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*pFrBAz4SFU8003BPmKKe2Q.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*pFrBAz4SFU8003BPmKKe2Q.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*pFrBAz4SFU8003BPmKKe2Q.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></a></figure></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<h3><strong>We are one step closer to shipping Pocket P.C. with the latest developments.</strong></h3>



<p>The latest D.V.T PCB design is out for production. We expect the PCBs to arrive within 10-12 days.&nbsp; After that, we will be assembling 25 units.</p>



<p>The D.V.T. design brings with it a newly added SPI Flash which will allow <a href="https://pocket.popcorncomputer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket P.C. </a>to more easily boot multiple operating systems on the same <a href="https://pocket.popcorncomputer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket P.C.</a> We also changed the design to a 10-layer PCB stackup vs. 8-layers which will ensure better signal integrity for high-speed signals.</p>



<p>The keyboard layout has been tweaked incorporating feedback from community suggestions and from hands-on the 3D printed prototypes. Thank you to everyone who submitted feedback about our initial layout. The space bar has been extended to allow for it to be pressed from a comfortable hand position and a few other minor changes. You can view the latest layout in our community keyboard thread here: <a href="https://community.popcorncomputer.com/t/pocket-p-c-keyboard-layout-part-2/541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket P.C. Keyboard Layout (Part 2)</a></p>



<p>We learned a lot from the last production run of Original Popcorn. We did not receive the level of support that we were promised from the USB-C IC manufacturer that we chose to handle the USB Power Delivery system. As such, we changed the <a href="https://pocket.popcorncomputer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket P.C.</a> design to incorporate a robust Texas Instruments single-chip solution. With this new solution, we added to the design dedicated port protector ICs with ESD protection and surge protection ICs also from Texas Instruments on every ports. This will make the design more robust to faulty power conditions.</p>



<p>Finally, to ensure that <a href="https://pocket.popcorncomputer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket P.C. </a>has great software support out of the box, we have requested embedded development help from the community. Our goal is to ensure that we get all aspects of our products mainlined so that custom kernels will not be required. In order to accomplish this, a community effort is required to review and test new solutions before submitting them to the Linux Kernel mailing list. If you are interested in following with our development efforts you can join the discussion here: <a href="https://community.popcorncomputer.com/t/embedded-linux-development-help-requested/559/15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Embedded Linux Development Help Requested</a></p>

          <p><em>TL;DR To launch a Continuous Securities Offering, get in touch with us. However, if you're looking to build a custom approach to continuous financing or simply want a smart-contract implementing linear bonding curves, you should definitely consider re-using and integrating our smart-contracts into your product. Fairmint has put a great care into building a set of high-quality smart-contracts that will lay the foundation of continuous financing and, today, we're releasing them in Open Source under GPL v3 license.</em></p><h3 id="security-is-not-an-option">Security is not an option</h3><p>First a bit of context. When we released the initial continuous organization whitepaper in October 2018, many people reached out to know if some smart-contract was already available and - as it wasn't - proposed to start coding a 1st version themselves. At that time, we urged the community to be patient and wait until we release our own smart-contracts. Indeed, we know how difficult it is to develop solid smart-contracts.</p><blockquote>the last thing we wanted, was to have an alpha-quality smart-contract hit the market which would have put users fund at risk and tarnished the potential of continuous financing with it.</blockquote><p>That's why, after we secured some initial funding (with <a href="https://www.boost.vc/">BoostVC</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.ideocolab.com/ventures/">IDEO Ventures</a>), we set out to build reference smart-contracts that the community (including us!) could safely rely on and that's what this post is all about: What did we do that makes us confident that our contracts are worth building upon?</p><h3 id="open-source">Open-source</h3><p>Our solidity smart-contracts are published under GPL v3 and publicly available in our github repository:</p><figure><a href="https://github.com/Fairmint/c-org"><div><p>Fairmint/c-org</p><p>Smart-contracts for continuous organizations.

<p>
The spread of fake news is at an all-time high in the midst of the coronavirus onslaught. Majority of the news currently being circulated on social media platforms have a questionable status; often they have more than one element of falsification.</p>

<p>
This news mainly pertains to details of repatriation flights, preventive measures, treatment for Covid-19, information regarding containment zones or impending lockdowns in various areas, etc.</p>

<p>
Social Media Matters (SMM) along with the Institute for Governance, Policies and Politics (IGPP) carried out a survey regarding Fake News generated and perceived by the regular population during this time. With around 3,752 questionnaires filled out from across India, the survey generated a detailed understanding by a variety of people belonging to different age groups and states across India.</p>

<p>
While the majority of participants lied in the age-group of 18 to 25 (2,766 respondents) it was closely followed by the age-group 25 to 35 with 565 respondents.</p>

<p>
According to the survey supported by Sarvahitey and Youth Online Learning Opportunities:</p>

<p>
69 percent respondents reported receiving fake news regarding COVID-19, during the lockdown</p>

<p>
74 percent of the recipients belonged to the age category of 18-25 years.</p>

<p>
88.4 percent reported the major source of Fake News to be WhatsApp, followed by Facebook (42.5 percent) and Instagram (reported by 21.96 percent)</p>

<p>
70 percent of the respondents reported cross checking and verifying news which seems fake</p>

<p>
The major sources of fact checking were Google Search (48.8 percent) and Government sources (36.6 percent)</p>

<p>
Nearly 84 percent stated that they do not trust such news</p>

<p>
76 percent stated they inform others regarding the spread of fake news, once recognised</p>

<p>
89 percent were aware that the dissemination of fake news is a crime as per the law, only 30 percent stated to report such news.</p>

<p>
95 percent respondents felt that there is a need to raise more awareness regarding the reporting mechanisms for fake news.</p>

<p>
Commenting on the outcomes, Amitabh Kumar, Founder of Social Media Matters said: "Misinformation is probably the most complex phenomenon of the information age, as it attacks the basic fragment of our modern society, which is an informed citizen. We need to take up a systematic approach to ensure we build capacities of fact seeking."</p>

<p>
Dr. Manish Tiwari, Sr. Fellow, Institute for Governance, Policies and Politics said: "Social media is becoming the new carrier of info-demics in these times of pandemic... Almost 70 percent of people in the Country have got some fake news or mis-information about Covid-19 since it started; and 75 percent of these are between the age of 18-25 years. It's clear, young people are being targeted to further spread the misinformation and fake news as they are prime users of all the social media platforms."&nbsp;</p>

<p>by Gertrud U. Rey</p>



<p>As of today, SARS-CoV-2 has infected 18.7 million people and caused 700,000 deaths worldwide. The most realistic way to quickly curb the spread of the virus would require daily identification and isolation of individuals who are contagious, a process that is hampered by cumbersome sampling and testing methods with slow turnaround times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The predominant test for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection is a highly sensitive assay called&nbsp;quantitative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). To carry out a SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR test, a&nbsp;mucus sample is processed to inactivate virus particles and extract the viral RNA. The RNA is converted to DNA (the&nbsp;<em>reverse transcription</em>&nbsp;step), which is then amplified during the&nbsp;<em>polymerase chain reaction</em>&nbsp;portion of the assay. For amplification to occur, a small piece of DNA (a primer) binds to a complementary target sequence in the&nbsp;SARS-CoV-2 DNA, while another piece of DNA (a probe) attaches to a sequence downstream of the primer binding site. Binding of the primer initiates amplification of the target DNA by an enzyme called&nbsp;<em>polymerase,</em>&nbsp;which copies the DNA in one direction towards the probe. Once the polymerase reaches the probe, it cleaves it, which activates a fluorescent marker attached to the probe. The use of this fluorescent probe allows for monitoring of the fluorescent signal&nbsp;<em>quantitatively</em>&nbsp;in real time rather than just detecting an accumulated end product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the qRT-PCR test is very sensitive, it also has multiple limitations. It requires expensive laboratory instrumentation and trained technicians with an estimated cost of about $100 per test, meaning that most people probably only get tested once. Current testing capacities are limited and results often take days or weeks to return, meaning that individuals who don’t know they are infected can transmit the virus during this time. The high sensitivity of qRT-PCR may also be a drawback rather than an advantage, because the test often detects small fragments of RNA that don’t originate from whole virus particles and thus don’t represent transmissible virus. Such RNA fragments can persist in individuals for weeks and months. As illustrated in Figure 1, infection with SARS-CoV-2 usually results in high initial levels of viral replication that peak and begin to decline within a few days. Symptoms don’t usually appear until after that peak has already occurred, and, because most people don’t get tested until they experience symptoms, they are likely already on the downward slope of viral replication and no longer infectious at the time of testing. In the meantime, they have been unknowingly transmitting the virus to others for several days. Clearly, these people need to be identified and isolated during their period of high infectivity.</p>

<p>In late June, Harvard epidemiologist&nbsp;<a href="https://ccdd.hsph.harvard.edu/people/michael-mina/">Michael Mina</a> published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.20136309v2">preprint</a>&nbsp;that evaluates the effectiveness of current SARS-CoV-2 surveillance measures for reducing transmission when considering frequency of testing and delayed reporting of results. Mina and co-authors concluded that infrequent testing with an ultra-sensitive test like qRT-PCR often results in unnecessary quarantine of individuals who are no longer infectious. Notably, it also results in missing pre- or asymptomatic individuals who are at the beginning of their infection and thus highly contagious, allowing them to go about their daily routines and infect others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few days after publication of the preprint, Mina co-authored an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/opinion/coronavirus-tests.html">opinion article</a> in the New York Times in which he discussed the potential for controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by widespread use of frequent, rapid at-home diagnostic tests. One example of such a diagnostic test&nbsp;is a lateral flow device, which is a paper strip that works similarly to a pregnancy test. The strip has a sample pad on one end and contains antibodies that recognize SARS-CoV-2 antigens. One would dip the sample pad portion of the strip into a <a href="https://www.virology.ws/2020/04/23/spit-for-sars-cov-2/">sample of&nbsp;saliva</a> and allow the saliva to wick across the strip. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens in the saliva would be indicated by the appearance of a test line in addition to the control line, while a negative test would only indicate the control line (Figure 2). The test provides results in 10-15 minutes at a cost of about $1-2 per test and does not require any additional equipment. A positive result would indicate the need for self-quarantine and confirmation of test results through a doctor’s office.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.virology.ws/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slide2.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.virology.ws/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slide2.jpeg 720w, https://www.virology.ws/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slide2-300x169.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></figure>



<p>Although these rapid tests are only about half as sensitive as&nbsp;qRT-PCR&nbsp;tests, they detect the presence of viral antigen during the actual window of transmissibility when viral levels are very high. The highly sensitive&nbsp;qRT-PCR&nbsp;assays detect viral RNA for weeks after a patient is no longer transmitting virus, which is irrelevant for quarantine/isolation purposes and does nothing to curb transmission. A less sensitive test that is done on a daily basis and provides immediate results would be more valuable because it would identify individuals while they are actually infectious. This would also alleviate the need for costly contact tracing measures because most infected individuals would be aware of their status and would stay isolated during their period of transmission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rapid lateral flow SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests are already available, but there is concern that the FDA may not approve these products because of their low sensitivity. You can help bring these products to market by writing to your elected officials (see sample letter templates&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/testing-letters/">here</a>), contacting your local TV and radio stations, and telling your friends and family to do the same. Hopefully, with sufficient media attention, the FDA, CDC, and NIH will recognize the value of these tests and make them widely available to the public. This may be the ultimate solution for opening schools and workplaces, and for rebuilding the economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Michael Mina discussed rapid at-home SARS-CoV-2 testing options on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-640/">TWiV 640</a>. Tidbits of that episode were also reviewed on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Sv_pS8MgQ&amp;t=7s">MedCram</a>.]</p>

					<p itemprop="description">Using a Capsule Network as the discriminator network in a GAN model. This model is then trained on FHHQ dataset to generate face images.</p>
				</div><div itemprop="articleBody">
					<p>The idea of Capsule Networks was first presented by Geoffrey Hinton. This network uses the spatial orientation of the images for its classification task. It provides better results than a conventional CNN.</p><p>An adversarial model has the discriminator and generator competing against each other. By implementing the discriminator as a Capsule Network performs better which in turn provides better generator output. The dataset chosen for this project is FHHQ dataset. I used the 128x128 thumbnail images. This dataset&nbsp;consists of 70,000 faces. The images are split into 56,000 training images and 14,000 test images. For evaluating the model FID score was used.</p><p>I used DCGAN model&nbsp;as the&nbsp;baseline model. This model was trained for 160 epochs. During training FID score is being calculated over 100 test images after every 2 epochs (1 epoch = 1 pass over the training dataset). The best FID score for DCGAN is 152.85. The FID score calculated over 50,000 test images is 72.34.</p><p><strong>DCGAN Results:&nbsp;</strong>It is observed that most of the faces are still not&nbsp;properly formed. Some of the faces look realistic but the background is still not being learned.</p><p><img src="https://skillsireupload.s3.amazonaws.com/upload/photos/2020/07/nUGiHiMylPEWV9TZx34w_19_5a3adbec17517b7bd278150fbc3881fc_image.png" alt="" width="782" height="761"></p><p>In a CapsuleGAN, the generator is similar to a DCGAN i.e. a deep CNN. The&nbsp;discriminator of a CapsuleGAN is implemeneted using Capsule layers instead of convolutional layers. During training, the best FID recorded was 126.22. The FID score over 50,000 test images is 31.25. This suggests that the CapsuleGAN is a superior model to than a DCGAN.</p><p>The figure below shows the architecture of Capsule Network which is being implemented in the discriminator. It shows how a MNIST image is converted into capsules. The input for my model is 128x128 image. I have used strided convolutional layers to reduce it to 12x12x256. After this using Reshape layer in keras the primary capsule layer is created which is a 8D vector of size 12x12x32. These 8D vector or capsules now represent different features in the input. This is then passed through a dense layer of 160 nodes where each node is a combination of different capsules from the primary capsule layer. This is then passed to a single node Dense layer which&nbsp;determines if the image provided is real or fake.</p><p><img src="https://skillsireupload.s3.amazonaws.com/upload/photos/2020/07/5885cBKsKP2ujthbugW6_20_3a43517418b4f20c55cc0790d49a437c_image.png" width="717" height="231"></p><p><strong>CapsuleGAN Results:</strong>&nbsp;Some of the results from the CapsuleGAN are shown below. It is observed that in the generated images the structure of the faces are formed much better than the DCGAN. The background is still not formed properly in some of the images. Also,&nbsp;it is noticed that the faces are very diverse. There are men, women&nbsp;as well as children present in these 64 generated images. Also things like spectacles, sunglasses, cap are being generated too.</p><p><img src="https://skillsireupload.s3.amazonaws.com/upload/photos/2020/07/skifK9jTjgHs71fcusqh_20_1399c8ce6ee2eabea0ab6b95fdeb46dd_image.png" width="786" height="765"></p><p><img src="https://skillsireupload.s3.amazonaws.com/upload/photos/2020/07/96KHYwxqaKmHK7yPVP64_20_325ff44451be690a60ce203836d687b8_image.png"></p><p>The above image shows the discriminator loss of both models during training. The x-axis shows the number of iterations. The orange color graph is for DCGAN while blue is for CapsuleGAN. The CapsuleGAN learns much faster than a DCGAN and it can be observed from the graph as the loss of CapsuleGAN decreases rapidly till 100,000 iterations. The graph of CapsuleGAN shows an anamoly at around 200,000 iterations when the loss shoots up. This is mostly because of the generator learning some trick to fool the discriminator. The discriminator then&nbsp;starts to learn this trick of the generator and loss starts to decrease.</p><p><img src="https://skillsireupload.s3.amazonaws.com/upload/photos/2020/07/DOWmrqn54ehJ3KpBv1vr_20_c1f6dca46ca41691df887123fb5df6b6_image.png"></p><p>On comparing the FID score during training which is evaluated on 100 test images, it is observed that CapsuleGAN provides low FID score as early as 15th epoch. This low FID score can be credited to the ability of CapsuleGAN to learn&nbsp;the structure of a face from the capsule network. In comparison to a DCGAN, CapsuleGAN provides better FID score as can be seen from the graph.</p><p><strong>Link to my repository:-</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/NavedSid/CapsGAN">https://github.com/NavedSid/CapsGAN</a></p><p><strong>References:-</strong></p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09829.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09829.pdf</a></p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03968.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03968.pdf</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset">https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/gusgad/capsule-GAN">https://github.com/gusgad/capsule-GAN</a></p>				</div></div>]]>

            		<p>Many companies and organizations would benefit by providing an app to supplement their core products or services. Better yet, broaden their customer base using apps. Among the common business cases are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restaurants, fast-food, and take-outs can provide table reservation or delivery services through an app. Including payment or pre-payment via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pay">Apple Pay</a> – even real-time offers via push notifications.</li>
<li>Radio and television could broadcast wider through the Internet and at better fidelity than what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM_broadcasting">FM</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_high_frequency">UHF</a> band allocations can provide.</li>
<li>Magazine and newspaper companies can extend their subscriptions to electronic media and provide offline electronic copies to subscribers immediately upon publishing.</li>
</ul>
<p>However “making apps” is not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_competency">core competence</a> of these companies. Worse, many are small businesses couldn’t spare the budget to develop, maintain, and continuously enhance bespoke mobile apps.</p>
<p>Enter the <em><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-label_product">white-labeled</a> apps</em> business model. These are <em>generic</em> apps each developed to serve a certain business stereotype — such as <em>Generic Fast-Food App</em>, <em>Generic Radio App</em>, or <em>Generic Magazine App</em> to name a few. The developer would develop the app once and re-sell it into many clients that fits the app’s stereotype. Better yet provide on-going maintenance contract to deliver bug fixes and continuous enhancements as long as the agreement is in place.</p>
<p>Unlike a <em>full custom software development</em> engagement, white-labeled apps affords a limited set of customizations. These are likely the company logo, application icon, and a custom color scheme. The tradeoffs are time and cost. By having a pre-made app, clients would quickly get a functioning app to complement their business without needing large up-front investment nor wait a long time for a custom app to get developed.</p>
<p>Sure these pre-made apps are going to look somewhat similar from one client company to the next, since they use the same code base. But as long as each instance of the app caters for different audiences, users aren’t likely to realize it.</p>
<h2>Apple Hated White Label</h2>
<p>Except for Apple. Notably the <em>app reviewers</em> – gatekeepers of the App Store. They would <em>notice</em> the same app being uploaded multiple times differing in name and icon. The company call this <em>template-based apps</em> and seems to have a dislike towards it.</p>
<p>Apple believes that each app would need to provide <em>a unique user experience</em> to earn a place in the App Store. Understandable for a company whose livelihood hinges on user experience and innovation. However that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldview">world-view</a> doesn’t align with the <em>white label business model</em> which involves identical products which differs in packaging and marketing since they are offered for different target markets – however the all has <em>the same core functionality</em>. It clashes to an extent that Apple rejected white-label apps by means of <em><a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#spam">Guideline 4.3</a></em> and label them as <em>spam</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Spam … Don’t create multiple Bundle IDs of the same app. If your app has different versions for specific locations, sports teams, universities, etc., consider submitting a single app and provide the variations using in-app purchase…</p></blockquote>
<p>A number of developers were “more fortunate” and treated with somewhat more attention than receiving a <em>copy and paste</em> from the App Review Guidelines:</p>
<blockquote><p>We understand that your radio and TV apps are individually branded. However, they share the same concept and feature set. It is no longer appropriate to submit multiple apps that provide the same or similar feature set.</p></blockquote>
<p>That was the end for all white-labeled apps from the store. Because “… multiple apps that provide the same or similar feature set…” is <em>the essence</em> of white-label. Indeed, a number of smaller software companies closed down and in other instances developers were dismissed because of this rule’s enforcement.</p>
<h2>Government Intervention</h2>
<p>Until <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress">congress-member</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/20/apple-revises-its-controversial-guidelines-on-template-based-apps/">Ted W Lieu sent a letter to Tim Cook on 1 December 2017</a> criticizing how the rules were enforced:</p>
<blockquote><p>Recently, I was informed that Apple’s decision to more stringently enforce its policy guidelines regarding design and functionality (Guidelines 4.3 and 4.2.6 respectively) may result in the wholesale rejection of template-based apps from the App Store. It is my understanding that <strong>many small business, research organizations, and religious institutions rely on template apps when they do not possess the resources to develop apps in-house</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then Apple made concession. Template-based apps <em>are now allowed</em> in the App Store as long as it is published by the company which owned its content. These <em>client companies</em> would need to have an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships/">Apple Developer Program</a> (ADP) account and the app would need to be uploaded from that account. Therefore this should prevent an app developer from spamming the App Store with multiple identical apps yet allows organizations not having in-house software development capability to provide apps for their audiences via white-labeled apps.</p>
<p>The change is reflected in the updated App Review <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#minimum-functionality">Guideline 4.2.6</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>… Apps created from a commercialized template or app generation service will be rejected unless they are submitted directly by the provider of the app’s content. These services should not submit apps on behalf of their clients ….</p></blockquote>
<p>The key phrase is ”… on behalf of their clients….” Apple expects to deal with <em>the entity providing the content</em> directly, by means of the ADP account.</p>
<h2>Managing White-Labeled Apps</h2>
<p>If you’re a white-label app provider, you would need to ask your clients to have their own ADP accounts. In turn you upload the client’s customized app bundle via this account, and thus have it appear to be provided directly by the client. You can ask them to register themselves to Apple or you can register it for them.</p>
<p>When you are registering for the client, be sure to have these ready:</p>
<ul>
<li>A copy of the organization’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_of_incorporation">letter of incorporation</a> showing creation of the legal entity (this should have the <em>legal name</em> of the entity, among other details).</li>
<li>The entity’s headquarter address.</li>
<li>The entity’s mailing address.</li>
<li>The entity’s primary <em>legal</em> contact.</li>
<li>The entity’s primary <em>financial</em> contact.</li>
<li>The entity’s primary <em>marketing</em> contact.</li>
<li>The entity’s primary <em>technical</em> contact (that’s likely you since you’re registering the account for them).</li>
<li>The entity’s primary <em>senior management</em> contact.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Universal_Numbering_System">D-U-N-S number</a> for the entity — you can register for one at no cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the ADP account is ready (or your client already has one), you would need to be granted access at least to the <em>Developer</em> and <em>App Manager</em> roles in the account. Unless your client has an employee filling the <em>App Manager</em> role, which in turn would create the app entry for you and assign you with a <em>Developer</em> role for the app(s) you are providing.</p>
<p>To add people to the ADP account and give access to these roles, follow these steps in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store-connect/">App Store Connect</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <em>Users and Access</em>.</li>
<li>Click on the “+” button.</li>
<li>Enter First Name, Last name, and e-mail. Note that the <em>e-mail</em> should also be an Apple ID.</li>
<li>Tick the <em>App Manager</em> and <em>Developer</em> checkboxes.</li>
<li>Click on “Invite”.</li>
</ol>
<p><img title="app-store-connect-new-user@2x.png" src="https://cutecoder.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/app-store-connect-new-user@2x.png" alt="App store connect new user" width="744" height="390" data-lazy-src="https://cutecoder.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/app-store-connect-new-user@2x.png?is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>That’s it. Apple will send an e-mail to the address that the person can signed in and access the ADP account.</p>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>If you currently have white-labeled apps in the store, you should prepare to transition your clients’ apps out from your ADP and into your respective clients’. Otherwise App Review would likely stop the next update with <em>Guideline 4.3 “Spam”</em> rejection. If you reach that point, you <em>could</em> ask for appeal and let that particular update go through, but likely App Review would give you about two months grace period to transition your apps out — which could be risky if any one of your client is lagging behind. To be safe, ensure that <em>all</em> of your clients to have their own ADP before you update any of the white-labeled apps.</p>
<p>When a client have its ADP ready, you can <a href="https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/deved688524f">transfer the existing app</a> into the client’s account. Preferably you would have transferred <em>all</em> white-labeled apps out before you update any of them (or before the release of a new major operating system version which requires you to update).</p>
<p>If you’re thinking to get into the white-labeled app business, take into account that clients need to have their own ADP and pay its annual fees. Either you:</p>
<ul>
<li>register and manage these accounts for them (and build the subscription and management cost into your price structure);</li>
<li>get them to subscribe to ADP themselves and give you access to it; or</li>
<li>provide them with a binary build of the white-labeled app and have a competent IT person from their side to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/code-signing/">re-sign</a> the build and upload it.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s all for now. Stay safe and stay in business.</p>

<p>I recently got a <a href="https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=P0AUX">Behringer UMC22 sound card</a> for video conferencing and DJing. This page documents what I've learned about using this sound card, and USB audio in general, on FreeBSD.</p>

<p>tl;dr: Everything works as long as the sound card follows the USB audio device class specification.</p>

<img src="https://www.davidschlachter.com/thumbnails/freebsd-usb-audio-large.jpg" alt="Behringer UMC22 sound card connected to FreeBSD computer">

<h2>Hardware support</h2>

<p>Which USB sound cards are supported in FreeBSD? The <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/releases/12.0R/hardware.html">hardware notes</a> don't list USB sound cards, and neither does the manual page for the corresponding driver, <code><a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=snd_uaudio">snd_uaudio (4)</a></code>. Inspecting the <a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/sys/dev/sound/usb/uaudio.c?view=co">source code for the <code>snd_uaudio</code> driver</a> lists some cards that require custom tweaks, but a complete list isn't present.
</p>

<p>Hardware support for USB sound cards appears to be based on compliance with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131105223008/http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/audio10.pdf">USB audio device class specification</a>, rather than on specific chipsets or models.
</p>

<p>How can you verify whether a USB audio device is compliant with the specification? In the case of the UMC22, the chip used is the TI PCM 2902. The <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/pcm2902.pdf">specifications for the PCM2902 chipset</a> say somewhat ambiguously that "the whole board design should be considered to meet the USB specification as a USB-compliant product" and indicate that the interface communicates through a "the standard USB request and USB audio class specific request". There doesn't appear to be an explicit statement, but it is implied that the chipset is compliant with the USB audio device class specification. The same chipset is apparently used in other Behringer sound cards such as the UM2, UA222, UCA222, and UCA202.
</p>

<h2>Using the sound card</h2>

<p>When connected to a FreeBSD machine, <code>dmesg</code> shows that the UMC22 is recognized by the <code>uaudio</code> driver. Note the string identifying the PCM2902 chipset from the spec sheet ("Burr-Brown from TI"):
</p>

<p>
uaudio0 on uhub1<br>
uaudio0: &lt;Burr-Brown from TI USB Audio CODEC, class 0/0, rev 1.10/1.00, addr 2&gt; on usbus0<br>
uaudio0: Play: 48000 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit S-LE PCM format, 2x8ms buffer.<br>
uaudio0: Play: 44100 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit S-LE PCM format, 2x8ms buffer.<br>
uaudio0: Play: 32000 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit S-LE PCM format, 2x8ms buffer.<br>
uaudio0: Record: 48000 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit S-LE PCM format, 2x8ms buffer.<br>
uaudio0: Record: 44100 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit S-LE PCM format, 2x8ms buffer.<br>
uaudio0: Record: 32000 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit S-LE PCM format, 2x8ms buffer.<br>
uaudio0: Record: 22050 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit S-LE PCM format, 2x8ms buffer.<br>
uaudio0: Record: 16000 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit S-LE PCM format, 2x8ms buffer.<br>
uaudio0: Record: 11025 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit S-LE PCM format, 2x8ms buffer.<br>
uaudio0: No MIDI sequencer.<br>
pcm3: &lt;USB audio&gt; on uaudio0<br>
uaudio0: HID volume keys found.<br>
</p>

<p>The available sound devices can be listed using <code>cat /dev/sndstat</code>, which shows that the sound card is recognized for both playback and recording (here at pcm3):</p>

<p>
Installed devices:
pcm0: &lt;Realtek (0x0257) (Analog 2.0+HP/2.0)&gt; (play/rec) default<br>
pcm1: &lt;Realtek (0x0257) (Right Analog Mic)&gt; (rec)<br>
pcm2: &lt;Intel Kaby Lake (HDMI/DP 8ch)&gt; (play)<br>
pcm3: &lt;USB audio&gt; (play/rec)<br>
No devices installed from userspace.
</p>

<p>How can the sound card be set as the playback device? Some programs, such as <a href="https://www.mixxx.org/">mixxx</a> or <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>, allow setting the output device in their preferences. Other programs will only use the default output device, which can be set using:<br><code>   sysctl hw.snd.default_unit=3</code><br>with the appropriate number for the device (in this case, <code>pcm3</code> = 3).
</p>

<p>The device number shown in <code>/dev/sndstat</code> corresponds to the device number under <code>/dev/dsp</code> and <code>/dev/mixer</code>. For example, to view the volume levels on the sound card with <code>mixer (8)</code>, you would use:<br><code>   mixer -f /dev/mixer3</code><br>To set the volume, you would use a command such as:<br><code>   mixer -f /dev/mixer3 vol 75</code><br>(If the sound card has been set as the default device, there is no need to specify the device in the <code>mixer</code> command).
</p>


<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>If an application is playing audio from the sound card when the system goes into a suspend state, the system will get stuck until all programs using the sound card close the corresponding device nodes, with a series of messages like this on the console:</p>

<p>
pcm3: unregister: channel pcm3:virtual:dsp3.vp0 busy (pid 45989)<br>
pcm3: Waiting for sound application to exit!
</p>

<p>These messages will continue to repeat until the application releases the audio device, at which point the system will finally be able to enter suspend state.</p>

<p>To work around this, I currently set the default audio device back to ID 0 as part of my pre-suspend script. This will prevent an application using the default device (such as Firefox) from preventing suspend.</p>

<p>However, for applications that set the audio device explicitly, this doesn't work. In fact, they'll often keep the audio device open even when audio isn't playing, hanging the suspend process and eventually forcing a reboot.</p>

<p>To allow suspend to continue, I use my pre-suspend script to just quit any program that has the sound card open before suspend:</p>

<div><p>
# Close up the USB sound card before suspend<br>
sysctl hw.snd.default_unit=0</p><p>

# Close any programs still using the sound card<br>
while fstat | grep dsp3 2&gt;&amp;1; do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fstat | grep dsp3 | cut -w -f 3 | while read pid;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do kill -15 "$pid"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done<br>
done<br>
while [ "$(ls -l /dev | grep -c dsp3)" -gt 1 ]; do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sleep 1<br>
done
</p></div>

<![CDATA[AWS Activate and Our $4k Mistake]]>

August 6, 2020 | https://formcake.com/blog/aws-activate-and-our-four-thousand-dollar-mistake | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://formcake.com/blog/aws-activate-and-our-four-thousand-dollar-mistake">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently we signed up for the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/activate/">AWS Activate</a> program, which provides startups / small internet businesses like us with a variety of benefits - from AWS credits to free business-tier support.</p>
<p>We signed up for AWS Activate as part of our application to the Stripe Atlas program, which we're <a href="https://formcake.com/our-experience-with-stripe-atlas">big fans</a> of, but you don't need to be a part of Stripe Atlas to sign up for Activate.</p>
<p>When signing up for Activate though you <em>do</em> need to know you'll be faced with a question that can drastically shape the number of credits you ultimately receive.</p>
<h2 id="the-mistake">The Mistake</h2>
<p>When we first went through the process we very simply answered that question wrong. We encountered the following screen, outlining the different sign up paths for bootstrapped vs funded startups.</p>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/aws-activate-screen.png" alt="AWS Activate bootstrapped vs funded startups"></p>
<p>When we first signed up, we did so as a bootstrapped startup: We're not accepting any funding, or even incorporating as a C Corp so we can have shares and an officer structure. We're incorporated as an LLC because we want to slowly build our way to profitability, so "bootstrapped" as a term seemed to described us.</p>
<p>We received $1,000 in AWS credits and were happy, but <a href="https://formcake.com/stripe-atlas-includes-five-thousand-credits-this-is-what-we-got">raised the issue with Stripe</a> that we were curious if there was a chance at getting the $5,000 that the Stripe copy seemed to suggest.</p>
<p>Stripe not only got back to us but fought for us to <a href="https://formcake.com/how-an-email-got-us-five-thousand-aws-credits">receive the full $5,000 in credits from AWS</a>.</p>
<p>But in their email it became clear what the issue was: <strong>We signed up under the wrong option</strong>.</p>
<p>Even though we're not accepting proper funding rounds, we are "sponsored" by Stripe in a sense through the Atlas program. That means we have an organization code/ID we can plug into the AWS Activate signup process signifying that we're a "funded" startup.</p>
<p>Doing so appears to net you a cool $5,000 in AWS credits.</p>
<p>Luckily we pestered Stripe to the point where we were able to receive not just the extra money ($5,000) but also keep the original, $1,000 amount. Since we're a small startup that's on an all-AWS infrastructure, this money was pretty critical to us, and provides a nice runway.</p>
<h2 id="the-takeaway">The Takeaway</h2>
<p>If you're signing up for the AWS Activate program, consider looking for a program like Stripe Atlas to sign up with. If you're able to find this kind of sponsorship and sign up with your corresponding organization ID, you can probably expect more credits. Don't be like us and potentially leave this much money (well, credits) on the table.</p>
<p>If you're anything like us, that difference between $1,000 and $5,000 is something you can feel!</p>

            <p>We all love <a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper/">Dapper</a> micro-ORM.</p>

<p>Many developers have realized that although Entity Framework offers some features that Dapper doesn’t, Dapper is still more flexible (and much much faster) than EF. And many have realized that the right tool for the right job sometimes involving using both EF for some things and Dapper for others. And one of the usages where Dapper is the king is for building dynamic queries.</p>



<p>Old-school developers (those who have been coding since the late 90s or early 2000s, probably in VB6, ASP3, or PHP) will probably remember code like this:</p>

<pre><code>string sql = "SELECT * FROM [Product] WHERE 1=1";

if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(Request["ProductName"]))
   sql += " AND Name LIKE '" + Request["ProductName"].Replace("'", "''") + "'"; // this replace!
if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(Request["SubCategoryId"]))
    sql += " AND ProductSubcategoryID = " + Request["SubCategoryId"].Replace("'", "''");  // this replace!

// here is where you pray that you've correctly sanitized inputs against sql-injection
var products = cn.Query&lt;Product&gt;(sql);
</code></pre>

<p>Basically we were all sending dynamic SQL statements directly to our databases. And since user-input can be malicious (see below), we had to manually sanitize user-input to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL-Injection attacks</a>.</p>



<p>If you weren’t sanitizing your input correctly, you were at serious risk. SQL-injection is probably the most popular web-hacking technique. If you forgot to sanitize something like an “id” querystring, you could be opening a huge vulnerability and possibly exposing all your database, not only for reading but also for modifications.</p>

<p><img src="https://drizin.io/images/2020/08/1596752055_e6b3d1c53cbe4d4083b328a69bbb2f75.jpg" alt=""></p>



<p>Even if you’re old school (hey VB6 guy, I’m looking at you again) you probably know that Dynamically building SQL like that is not only error-prone (vulnerable to SQL-injection) but also does not benefit from <a href="https://www.sqlshack.com/understanding-sql-server-query-plan-cache/">SQL Server Cached Execution Plans</a>. You probably used some kind of code-generation tool which helped you to build code like this (maybe to invoke a stored procedure, since 3-tier-architecture and “Windows DNA” were in the hype in the early 2000s):</p>

<pre><code>Dim strSQL As String
Dim cmd As New ADODB.Command

strSQL = "UPDATE MyTable SET " &amp; vbNewLine _
    &amp; " NEEDS_ID     = @NEEDS_ID, " &amp; vbNewLine _
    &amp; " OBJ_ID       = @OBJ_ID, " &amp; vbNewLine _
    &amp; " OBJ_COMMENTS = @OBJ_COMMENTS, " &amp; vbNewLine _
    &amp; " TIME21_ID    = @TIME21_ID, " &amp; vbNewLine _
    &amp; " WHERE ID     = @WHEREID"

With cmd
    .ActiveConnection = Cn
    .CommandText = strSQL
    .Parameters.Append .CreateParameter("@NEEDS_ID", adInteger, adParamInput, 2, 12)
    .Parameters.Append .CreateParameter("@OBJ_ID", adInteger, adParamInput, 2, 23)
    .Parameters.Append .CreateParameter("@OBJ_COMMENTS", adVarChar, adParamInput, 250, "Some text")
    .Parameters.Append .CreateParameter("@TIME21_ID", adInteger, adParamInput, 2, 34)
    .Parameters.Append .CreateParameter("@ID", adInteger, adParamInput, 18, 456)
    .Execute
End With 
</code></pre>

<p>I hope the millennial developers are not so surprised that parameterized SQL already existed in the past century.</p>



<p>Time flew by, Java and .NET emerged (and maybe submerged a little?), Reflection, Bytecode emission, Full-ORMs, Micro-ORMs, 3-tier was deprecated in favor of dozens of modern architectures, and now database access is much easier, right?</p>

<p>Now we don’t have to manually describe each one of our parameters to SQL. Our favorite ORMs will do that for us.</p>

<p><strong>Dapper Example:</strong></p>

<pre><code>var dynamicParams = new DynamicParameters();

string sql = "SELECT * FROM [Product] WHERE 1=1";

if (productName != null)
{
    sql += " AND Name LIKE @productName"; 
    dynamicParams.Add("productName", productName);
}


if (subCategoryId != null)
{
    sql += " AND ProductSubcategoryID = @subCategoryId"; 
    dynamicParams.Add("subCategoryId", subCategoryId);
}

var products = cn.Query&lt;Product&gt;(sql, dynamicParams);
</code></pre>



<p>The example below makes me a little upset for 2 reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have to pass productName twice, both to the <code>sql</code> string and to the <code>dynamicParams</code> dictionary.<br>
Their names should match.</li>
<li>I have to keep those two variables (the SQL statement and the list of parameters) separated, even though they are closely related to each other.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2016/Dec/27/Back-to-Basics-String-Interpolation-in-C">String Interpolation</a> was introduced in C# in 2016.</p>

<p>Instead of doing code like this:</p>

<pre><code>string name = "Rick";
int accesses = 10;
string output = string.Format("{0}, you've been here {1:n0} times.",
                              name, accesses);
</code></pre>

<p>You could do like this:</p>

<pre><code>string name = "Rick";
int accesses = 10;
string output = $"{name}, you've been here {accesses:n0} times.";
</code></pre>

<p>Internally, when you write an interpolated string (starting with <code>$</code>), the compiler generates a <code>FormattableString</code> class, which contains both the template (as if it was <code>{0}, you've been here {1:n0} times.</code>), and also the list of parameters (<code>string name</code> and <code>int accesses</code>).</p>

<p>If your method expects a regular string, the <code>FormattableString</code> will be implicitly converted into a regular string, and you get the same behavior as if you just passed a <code>string.format</code> to your method. However, if your method expects a <code>FormattableString</code> class, then you have access to format and arguments isolated from each other.</p>

<p>FormattableString can be useful for example if we wanted to build parameterized SQL statements while letting users build their strings as if it was just regular string concatenation:</p>

<pre><code>QueryBuilder ParseSQL(FormattableString query)
{
    QueryBuilder myWrapper = new QueryBuilder();

    string dapperSql = query.Format;
    // replace {0} by "@p0", 
    // replace {1} by "@p1", etc..
    myWrapper.SQL = dapperSql;

    var dapperArgs = new Dapper.DynamicParameters();
    var args = query.GetArguments();
    // dapperArgs.Add("p0", args[0]);
    // dapperArgs.Add("p1", args[1]); ...
    myWrapper.Arguments = dapperArgs;

    return myWrapper;
    // now anyone can use Dapper like  
    // var pocos = connection.Query&lt;POCO&gt;(myWrapper.SQL, myWrapper.Parameters);
}
</code></pre>



<p>Based on the idea above, I’ve created <strong><a href="https://github.com/Drizin/DapperQueryBuilder/">DapperQueryBuilder</a> - which is a simple wrapper around Dapper which allows us to pass SQL parameters using string interpolation.</strong></p>

<p>You can code like this:</p>

<pre><code>var query = cn.QueryBuilder($"SELECT * FROM [Product] WHERE 1=1");

if (productName != null)
    query.Append($"AND Name LIKE {productName}"); 

if (subCategoryId != null)
    query.Append($"AND ProductSubcategoryID = {subCategoryId}"); 

var products = query.Query&lt;Product&gt;(); 
</code></pre>

<p>Although it looks like you’re just building a dynamic SQL (with values as inline literals), actually what you get is parameterized SQL.</p>

<p>In case, <code>query</code> will have this underlying statement: <code>SELECT * FROM [Product] WHERE 1=1 AND Name LIKE @p0 AND ProductSubcategoryId = @p1</code>, and will also hold the parameters <code>@p0 = productName</code> and <code>@p1 = subCategoryId</code>.</p>

<p>To sum, instead of using Dapper’s extension <code>.Query&lt;T&gt;</code> which extends IDbConnection and accepts a SQL string and a list of parameters, you use <code>QueryBuilder()</code> extension which creates a QueryBuilder where you can dynamically (and in a single statement) add new parameters and add the associated SQL clause.</p>



<p>If you liked and want to start using right now,</p>

<ol>
<li>Install the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dapper-QueryBuilder">NuGet package Dapper-QueryBuilder</a></li>
<li>Start using like this:<br></li>
</ol>

<pre><code>using DapperQueryBuilder;
// ...

cn = new SqlConnection(connectionString);

// If you have all your parameters at once and just want to benefit from string interpolation:
var products = cn.QueryBuilder($@"
    SELECT ProductId, Name, ListPrice, Weight
    FROM [Product]
    WHERE [ListPrice] &lt;= {maxPrice}
    AND [Weight] &lt;= {maxWeight}
    AND [Name] LIKE {search}
    ORDER BY ProductId").Query&lt;Product&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>Or building dynamic conditions like this:</p>

<pre><code>using DapperQueryBuilder;
// ...

cn = new SqlConnection(connectionString);

// If you want to dynamically add conditions
var q = cn.QueryBuilder($@"
    SELECT ProductId, Name, ListPrice, Weight
    FROM [Product]
    WHERE 1=1 ");

q.AppendLine("AND [ListPrice] &lt;= {maxPrice}");
q.AppendLine("AND [Weight] &lt;= {maxWeight}");
q.AppendLine("AND [Name] LIKE {search}");
q.AppendLine("ORDER BY ProductId");

var products = q.Query&lt;Product&gt;();
</code></pre>



<p>Some people believe incorrectly that <code>WHERE 1=1</code> causes a performance hit. <a href="https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/33958/85815">It doesn’t.</a> So using this fake condition is a great trick so that you can just append additional conditions (if any) like shown in the example above.</p>

<p>Another option is that you can build your whole query but leave the filters to be dynamically defined (and rendered) later. DapperQueryBuilder has this special command <code>Where()</code> which is used to save the filters internally, and later they are replaced.</p>

<pre><code>int maxPrice = 1000;
int maxWeight = 15;
string search = "%Mountain%";

var cn = new SqlConnection(connectionString);

// You can build the query manually and just use QueryBuilder to replace "where" filters (if any)
var q = cn.QueryBuilder(@"SELECT ProductId, Name, ListPrice, Weight
    FROM [Product]
    /**where**/
    ORDER BY ProductId
    ");
    
// You just pass the parameters as if it was an interpolated string, 
// and QueryBuilder will automatically convert them to Dapper parameters (injection-safe)
q.Where($"[ListPrice] &lt;= {maxPrice}");
q.Where($"[Weight] &lt;= {maxWeight}");
q.Where($"[Name] LIKE {search}");

// Query() will automatically build your query and replace your /**where**/ (if any filter was added)
var products = q.Query&lt;Product&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>You can also create OR filters like this:</p>

<pre><code>q.Where(new Filters(Filters.FiltersType.OR)
{
    new Filter($"[Weight] &lt;= {maxWeight}"),
    new Filter($"[Name] LIKE {search}")
});
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can mix and match OR/AND like this:</p>

<pre><code>q.Where(new Filters(Filters.FiltersType.OR)
{
    new Filters(Filters.FiltersType.AND)
    {
        $"[Weight] &lt;= {maxWeight}",
        $"[Weight] &gt;= {minWeight}",
    }
    new Filter($"[Name] LIKE {search}")
});
</code></pre>

<p>And even arrays can be used as interpolated strings:</p>

<pre><code>var categories = new string[] { "Components", "Clothing", "Acessories" };
q.Append($"WHERE c.[Name] IN {categories}");
</code></pre>
