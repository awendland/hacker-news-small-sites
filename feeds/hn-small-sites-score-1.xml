<p>I&nbsp;was&nbsp;listening to a podcast the other day, and&nbsp;the hosts were talking about the scarcity&nbsp;mindset&nbsp;and how it sabotages people’s success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stephen Covey wrote in&nbsp;<em>The Seven&nbsp;</em><em>Habits of Highly Effective People</em>:&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Most people are deeply scripted in what I call the Scarcity Mentality. They see life as having only so much, as though there were only one pie out there. And if someone were to get a big piece of the pie, it would mean less for&nbsp;everyone else.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><br>It occurred to me that we can think this way about our tech skills. I bet you’ve worked with someone that rarely shares vital information (and maybe you do this too!)</p>



<p>Thinking that our knowledge is extremely precious and that there is a finite amount of know-how out there, we keep some (or all!) of the best to ourselves. In the Information Age, our expertise is what gives our position and status – so if someone has a scarcity mindset, they tend to be reluctant to give that away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The thinking is, “if I give away all of the most valuable knowledge, then I will lose my advantage.”</p>



<p>But this equation is wrong. Giving knowledge away is not reducing your advantage. By sharing, you’ve established yourself as their expert – and it increases your stature with them!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The scarcity mindset is a self-limiting behavior.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The scarcity mindset ensures that you’ll get less from those around you. Your thoughts are keeping them from giving as freely to you because they know you’re holding back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re generous with your time and your knowledge, people will reciprocate. I’ve seen it happen time and time again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sharing is contagious – and having generosity embedded in your team’s culture boosts your effectiveness.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The flip side of scarcity is abundance.</strong></p>



<p>Stephen continues,&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>The Abundance Mentality, on the other hand, flows out of a deep inner sense of personal worth and security. It is the paradigm that there is plenty out there and enough to spare for everybody. It results in sharing of prestige, of recognition, of profits, of decision making. It opens possibilities, options, alternatives, and creativity.”&nbsp;</em><br>An abundance mentality is what we should be striving for – there is more than enough for us all to have what we need!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why should you share? Because THE ACT OF TEACHING strengthens your understanding, so you have even MORE knowledge than when you started!</p>



<p>I challenge you to share your knowledge this week. I know you’ll see dividends yourself as you build up those around you.</p>



<p>Best,</p>



<p>Ken</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in July last year Hugo 0.56.0 introduced a powerful Module system. Pretty much like any package solution it allowed any Hugo project defined as a Module, be it a full website or a theme or a component to use any files stored on a repository somewhere and mount it as its own. It also enabled any Hugo project to become a full fledge Hugo Modules with its own config and dependencies which any other project could mount.</p><p>In this article, we’ll see how any Hugo project can use files stored on a distant repository and make them its own using the Module&nbsp;<strong>imports</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>mounts</strong>&nbsp;logic.</p><p>Then, we’ll dive into what exactly constitute a Hugo Module by creating our own!</p><h3 id="init-the-project-as-a-module">Init the project as a Module</h3><p>Before you can import a repository and use its files, your project will need to be initiated as a Hugo Module.</p><p>For this, you need to reference a repository.</p><p>We’ll assume your Hugo project already has a GitHub repo which lives at <code>https://github.com/me-me-me/my-repo</code></p><p>Using the terminal for your project root directory:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">hugo mod init github.com/me-me-me/my-hugo-project
</code></pre></div><p>☝️ The above when successful will generate a file called <code>go.mod</code> at the root. It should look something like the following:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>module</span> <span>github</span><span>.</span><span>com</span><span>/</span><span>me</span><span>-</span><span>me</span><span>-</span><span>me</span><span>/</span><span>my</span><span>-</span><span>hugo</span><span>-</span><span>project</span>

<span>go</span> <span>1.14</span>
</code></pre></div><p>It will also have created a <code>go.sum</code> file. We won’t concern ourselves with that one.</p><h3 id="import-a-distant-repository">Import a distant repository</h3><p>For this very basic examples, we’ll try and incoporate the icons made available by the Bootstrap team through their repo at
<a href="https://github.com/twbs/icons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/twbs/icons</a>
.</p><p>Everything happens in your project <code>config.yaml</code> using the reserved <code>module</code> key and its <code>imports</code> array.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>module</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>imports</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span>- <span>path</span><span>:</span><span> </span>github.com/twbs/icons<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Now if you run <code>hugo</code> you will notice a new file has been dropped, <code>go.sum</code> but we won’t concern ourselves with it. On the other end, our <code>go.mod</code> file just got a new line.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>module</span> <span>github</span><span>.</span><span>com</span><span>/</span><span>me</span><span>-</span><span>me</span><span>-</span><span>me</span><span>/</span><span>my</span><span>-</span><span>hugo</span><span>-</span><span>project</span>

<span>go</span> <span>1.14</span>

<span>require</span> <span>github</span><span>.</span><span>com</span><span>/</span><span>twbs</span><span>/</span><span>icons</span> <span>v1</span><span>.0.0</span> <span>// indirect
</span></code></pre></div><p>That’s good but it does not tell Hugo what to do with those files.</p><p>With the <code>mounts</code> key, attached to our Bootstrap import, we’ll give Hugo more directions:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>module</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>imports</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>   </span>- <span>path</span><span>:</span><span> </span>github.com/twbs/bootstrap<span>
</span><span>     </span><span>mounts</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>     </span>- <span>source</span><span>:</span><span> </span>icons<span>
</span><span>       </span><span>target</span><span>:</span><span> </span>assets/icons<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Mounts are unlimited but for now we just added one with the following settings:</p><ul><li><code>source</code> param points to the location of the mounted files in the distant repo. Here we’re pointing to the <code>icons</code> directory at the root of the repo.</li><li><code>target</code> param points to the location the files should be mounted into our Hugo’s union file system.</li></ul><p>With that mount in place, we will be able to access the icons svgs just like any other files in our project:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go-html-template"><span>{{</span><span> </span><span>with</span><span> </span><span>resources</span><span>.Get</span><span> </span><span>"icons/cart.svg"</span><span> </span><span>}}</span>
  <span>&lt;</span><span>div</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>"fill-current w-4"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>{{</span><span> </span><span>.Content</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>safeHTML</span><span> </span><span>}}</span>
  <span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>{{</span><span> </span><span>end</span><span> </span><span>}}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>That’s it!</p><p>We can safely print this cart SVG without copying it to our project’s directory.</p><p>And in the off chance that this particular cart icon needs to be customized we can rely on Hugo’s union file system!</p><p>All we’d have to do is create an homonymous icon file in our project at <code>assets/icons/cart.svg</code> to have it being used in place of Bootstrap’s own cart icon.</p><p><strong>or…</strong></p><p>We could even go crazier and use the icon from another distant repo just for that cart icon… 🤩</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">- <span>path</span><span>:</span><span> </span>github.com/refactoringui/heroicons<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>mounts</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span>- <span>source</span><span>:</span><span> </span>src/solid/shopping-cart.svg<span>
</span><span>      </span><span>target</span><span>:</span><span> </span>assets/icons/cart.svg<span>
</span><span></span>- <span>path</span><span>:</span><span> </span>github.com/twbs/icons<span>
</span><span>	  </span><span>mounts</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span>- <span>source</span><span>:</span><span> </span>icons<span>
</span><span>      </span><span>target</span><span>:</span><span> </span>assets/icons<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>☝️ Here we are importing two repos, with their own <code>mounts</code> settings.</p><div><p>Note that regardless of the files mounted, Hugo will have to download the whole repository, so you might think twice before importing a 5MB repo for one of its svgs.</p></div><h3 id="upgrading">Upgrading</h3><p>What if the repo is updated? The default behaviour of Hugo Module is, on the first import, to grab the latest release, or if no release is found, the latest head on the default branch. That’s why Hugo wrote <code>v1.0.0</code> after the require directive.</p><p>If <code>github.com/twbs/icons</code> releases <code>v1.1.0</code> and you want that new release you can:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">hugo mod get -u github.com/twbs/bootstrap
</code></pre></div><p>This should update your <code>go.mod</code> file with the latest release.</p><p>Now if you want a specific release rather than the latest, (we’ll use another repo for that example):</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">hugo mod get github.com/twbs/bootstrap@v3.4.0
</code></pre></div><p>If you want a specific commit, you’ll need to @ its long hash like so</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">hugo mod get github.com/twbs/bootstrap@394812b61d4dc80bfb2e090de925ae0dfc4cc29b
</code></pre></div><div><p>You should commit your <code>go.mod</code> and <code>go.sum</code> file of course, so that everybody working on the project uses the same versions!</p></div><h2 id="create-a-hugo-module">Create a Hugo Module</h2><p>The above was interesting as we covered how we can import any repo out there and make its files part of our project. But the real power comes from using full fledge Hugo Modules as they alone can sport template files, asset files, data files, even <strong>content</strong> files!</p><p>And what better way to learn about them than by creating our own!</p><p>For the sake of the example, we’ll create our own Icon Module. It will:</p><ol><li>Import some SVG files from a distant repo</li><li>Create a page listing all available icons on the site.</li><li>Load its own <code>icon</code> partial which will ease up the printing of any icon on the project.</li></ol><p>First we’ll create a directory on our local machine. We’ll give it a poor but short name: <code>hugo-icons</code>.</p><h3 id="1-imports">1. Imports</h3><p>The first thing we need is a <code>config.yaml</code> file for our Module to register its imports.</p><p>Yes, any Hugo project, be it a website or a theme or a component can import other Modules or repo. The import tree is infinite. As we already mentioned, it’s a real dependency solution!</p><p>Our imports and mounts settings will be very similar to what we did before. We’ll just mount the files in a reserved directory to make sure we don’t have file conflicts with other modules.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span># config.yaml</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>module</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>imports</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>   </span>- <span>path</span><span>:</span><span> </span>github.com/twbs/bootstrap<span>
</span><span>     </span><span>mounts</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>	   </span>- <span>source</span><span>:</span><span> </span>icons<span>
</span><span>	     </span><span>target</span><span>:</span><span> </span>assets/hugo-icons/icons<span>
</span></code></pre></div><h3 id="2-creating-the-listing-page">2. Creating the listing page</h3><p>We’ll need two things for that.</p><ol><li>A content files to be mounted on the project.</li><li>A template file for Hugo to render that content file as a page.</li></ol><p>Thanks to the <code>mounts</code> settings, those files don’t have to follow the usual directory structure of a Hugo project. They can live anywhere which makes sense in the context of our componentized module.</p><p>We’ll go crazy and add</p><ul><li><code>page/layout.html</code></li><li><code>page/content.md</code></li></ul><p>Getting back to our updated <code>config.yaml</code> , you’ll note that the <code>mounts</code> settings we are dealing with sit at the root of the <code>module</code> map.</p><p>That’s because mounting is not reserved to imports. You can assign mounting settings to the project at hand with its own <code>mounts</code> key.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span># config.yaml</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>module</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>mounts</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span>- <span>source</span><span>:</span><span> </span>page/index.md<span>
</span><span>      </span><span>target</span><span>:</span><span> </span>content/hugo-icons-listing.md<span>

</span><span>    </span>- <span>source</span><span>:</span><span> </span>page/template.html<span>

</span><span>   </span><span>[</span>...<span>]</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><div><p>Language!</p><p>Note that the <code>lang</code> parameter only matters on multilingual site and even on those, omitting it will simply put the page under the default language site.</p></div><p>And now in those files:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span># page/index.md</span><span>

<span>{{</span><span> </span><span>end</span><span> </span><span>}}</span>
</code></pre></div><div><p>This will break if your project’s or theme’s <code>baseof.html</code> does not have a <code>main</code> block. We’ll let this slide for the purpose of teaching.</p></div><h3 id="3-adding-the-partial">3. Adding the partial</h3><p>I think the partial can live under the module’s <code>partials/icons.html</code> and we’ll register that new mount:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span># config.yaml</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>module</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>mounts</span><span>:</span><span>

</span><span>  </span><span>[</span>...<span>]</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Note we’ll mount it under a reserved directory so users can safely call <code>{{ partial "hugo-icons/icon" "cart" }}</code> . This way we won’t collide with another module having its own <code>icon</code> partial.</p><p>And our very basic partial:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="text">{{/*
  icon
  Will print the icon matching the string passed as "context"

  @author @yourstruly

  @context String (.)

  @access public

  @example - Go Template
    {{ partial "hugo-icons/icon" "cart" }}
*/}}

</code></pre></div><h3 id="wrapping-up-our-module">Wrapping up our Module</h3><p>Our Module now provides the three features we set ourselves to deliver. There’s one critical thing missing from our Module’s config though.</p><p>We are using <code>resources.Match</code> which was introduced in Hugo 0.57.0. Also fine tuned mounting using files and subdirectories got supported only with Hugo 0.64.0.

September 2, 2020 | https://fabriziorinaldi.com/blog/why-we-like-mkbhd-videos | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://fabriziorinaldi.com/blog/why-we-like-mkbhd-videos">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The production quality of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/mkbhd">Marques Brownlee videos</a> is stellar and Marques has developed through the years an incredible talent for visual storytelling.</p>
<p>But I'd like to get more into some of the specific reasons why I believe we love his videos. I'm a technologist, writer, and storyteller, so these things are often on my mind.</p>
<h2>No unnecessary camera movements</h2>
<p>Many people might confuse more camera movements as better storytelling, but 99% of the time it's the exact opposite. Think about how intentional David Fincher is with where he places the camera, and if it will move or won't. One emblematic example: in Gone Girl there's a single hand-held shot (can't find it on YouTube, but it's Ben Affleck running from journalist and other people).</p>
<p>Marques does the same, and most of the time <strong>if the camera moves, there's a reason</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://fabriziorinaldi.com/images/blog/a51599f1-c1d1-4d39-a87a-87661866aae4.jpeg"></p>
<h2>Color balance</h2>
<p>Color is great, and it's a powerful storytelling tool. Just like camera movements though, too much color, or too many colors, can be distracting and overwhelming.</p>
<p>Usually, colors in Marques videos are extremely consistent, and never unnecessarily flashy.</p>
<p><img src="https://fabriziorinaldi.com/images/blog/ffca8a76-ddc9-493f-81f5-d9bf1cd542b3.jpeg"></p>
<h2>Straight to the point</h2>
<p>After a 4 seconds intro, and sometimes a few beautiful shots of the topic of the video, Marques goes straight to the point and doesn't waste any of your time.</p>
<h2>Authenticity</h2>
<p>I don't know how you feel, but for me watching MKBHD feels like being with a techie friend who genuinely wants to tell me about some tech that is new and exciting.</p>
<p>It doesn't feel like marketing, it doesn't feel like overthinking or bullshit, it genuinely feels like someone saying <em>hey check this out</em>.</p>
<p>We've bombarded daily by content of any kind, and so much of it feels useless or fake that <strong>we crave authenticity.</strong></p>
<p>Marques gets it, it doesn't matter how many millions are in his bank account.</p>
<p><img src="https://fabriziorinaldi.com/images/blog/2e1c40b9-c89d-4857-9de1-ad88084dd35c.jpeg"></p>
<h2>Simmetry and composition</h2>
<p>Finally, it's worth mentioning how precise, symmetric and pleasing to watch are Marques shots. They almost have a calming effect, and you can feel how intentional he is when placing objects for the camera.</p>
<p><img src="https://fabriziorinaldi.com/images/blog/e83ee697-72ff-4aaf-9e91-2e466c194def.jpeg"></p>
<p>Do you think there are other core reasons we love his videos? Let me know <a href="https://twitter.com/linuz90">on Twitter</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[I Actively Discourage Online Tooling Like Jwt.io and Online JSON Validators]]>

September 2, 2020 | https://www.jvt.me/posts/2020/09/01/against-online-tooling/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.jvt.me/posts/2020/09/01/against-online-tooling/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Something my colleagues know well is how little I trust online tools like <a href="https://jwt.io/">jwt.io</a>, online JSON validators or online tooling in general, but it also bleeds into <a href="https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2020/08/zebqf/">comments I make online</a> and in my blog posts, too, and I thought I'd share a little bit of a reason as to why.</p><p>Instead of using an online service, I will reach for a way to run it locally, using whichever programming language toolchain I have available. But why? Why wouldn't I recommend something like jwt.io? Or an online JSON validator, especially if they boast client-side functionality, and mean I don't need things installed?</p><p>Let's start with a bit of background. Firstly, I'd just like to caveat this all with the note that <strong>I have no access to Production data, customer or otherwise</strong>. All of these examples are referencing Non-Production examples.</p><p>I also want to caveat this with the fact that this is <strong>not a personal attack</strong> on jwt.io. I am using them as an example as they're a well-known and well-used service, and I've seen issues with it before. Auth0 run it, and are probably one of the few companies we'd want to be running it. It's also <a href="https://github.com/jsonwebtoken/jsonwebtoken.github.io">Open Source</a> <em>but</em> one of the great difficulties of Web-hosted services are that we have no idea if the source code that we're told is being used is actually being used!</p><p>I'm currently working on the Open Banking platform for Capital One. We're fortunate to have very restricted access to Production, which makes things safer for everyone. One thing we strive to do is to treat Non-Production secrets like Production ones where possible - where we shouldn't have access to them at all, and shouldn't be sharing them with external services. Some of these Non-Production secrets may be usable outside of Capital One, for instance Open Banking Sandbox signing certificates.</p><p>We perform a fair bit of testing in our Non-Production environments and sometimes need to debug things, such as what's inside a JWT (as Open Banking introduces several places they're used). I've been burned a number of times by folks putting a Non-Production JWT or an Open Banking Sandbox certificate into jwt.io. Although Non-Production, these are sensitive in of themselves, as they have implementation details for our services, and as mentioned, certain things could be used outside of Capital One.</p><p>The biggest reason I hear from folks using online tooling is that it's easier, and that they'd rather do that than find out how to run it locally. I disagree with this, but am quite biased, as I often have a blog post for many of these common issues. I love sharing my blog with others and having a handy solution, or if I don't have an answer to a problem, I'll find out how and <a href="https://www.jvt.me/tags/blogumentation/">blogument it for later</a>. So I see that reaching for online tooling is more just because we've got folks who aren't aware of how they could do otherwise.</p><p>One great thing about removing the need for an online tool is that you can self-serve it once you have the tools locally. You can run it locally when you've got no internet (which isn't as much of an issue in these Coronavirus times) but also regardless of whether the upstream service is broken. You can use it with other i.e. command-line tooling, for instance how I've set up <a href="https://gitlab.com/jamietanna/dotfiles-arch/-/blob/master/terminal/home/bin/unpack">this command-line script</a> to handle a lot of common data formats I deal with and unpack them to a human-readable format.</p><p>But most importantly, by telling people to put sensitive data (such as credentials, configuration files, etc) it's a really dangerous lesson for our teams. We're teaching people to blindly trust arbitrary websites that they don't have any relationship with, nor have fully audited the source code, when posting potentially sensitive data.</p><p>I realise this may not be something you do when running it locally, but it's less likely for a well-known library running locally to need to reach outbound.</p><p>jwt.io is an interesting example, because although it boasts that it runs as a client-side solution, you may not have been aware that <a href="https://github.com/jsonwebtoken/jsonwebtoken.github.io/commit/b362ab19a9f37e337b5f8ea38987aa680aa6e0a9">until last September</a>, there were metrics being determined which although may have seemed innocent, show that it's easy for other functionality to be hidden in a seemingly client-side-only website. Unless you audit everything, every time, you're in a risky position where you may be leaking data you're not expecting to.</p><p>I feel that we can do something to help services that handle potentially sensitive data with helping educate the user that they should be more careful, because jwt.io's warning definitely doesn't help with folks who don't fully appreciate what the risk is if jwt.io isn't actually as trustworthy as the user thinks:</p><blockquote><p>Warning: JWTs are credentials, which can grant access to resources. Be careful where you paste them! We do not record tokens, all validation and debugging is done on the client side.</p></blockquote><p>What do you think? Am I maybe being a little too sensitive? Am I not being sensitive enough?</p><p>Edit: Based on some conversations being had in response to the post, I thought it'd mention I've written about how to <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/06/13/pretty-printing-jwt-openssl/">pretty-print a JWT locally with OpenSSL</a> and <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2018/08/31/pretty-printing-jwt-ruby/">a Ruby alternative</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Obtaining Corporate Credentials via the Autodiscover Circus]]>

September 2, 2020 | https://lolware.net/2020/09/02/autodiscover-circus.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://lolware.net/2020/09/02/autodiscover-circus.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <div itemprop="articleBody">
                    <div>
                        

<p>It's fairly common for an organisation's website to exist outside the organisation's operational security policies. There's a common justification that for many organisations, the website is a marketing landing page and no sensitive data is ever involved. This in turn oftens leads to the prevance of, for example, shared hosting companies holding dozens of compromised Wordpress sites at a time.</p>

<p>We regularly see this when major businesses are compromised. This is unfortunate.</p>



<p>Anyone who has read the web access log on such a server has probably found themselve Googling what autodiscover.xml is. Here's an example from my own server, of something which may be rare if you have a few users. I grepped an larger organisation's log and found around 1200 hits per day.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">020/09/02 05:54:40 [error] 385#385: *33613 open() "/var/www/html/autodiscover/autodiscover.xml" failed (2: No such file or directory),
    client: 1.2.3.4, server: lolware.net, request: "POST /autodiscover/autodiscover.xml HTTP/1.1", host: "lolware.net"
</code></pre></div>
<p>The reason for this is Microsoft's Autodiscover mechanism. And it's worth noting that while I'm going to talk about Outlook, many mail clients support autodiscover with varying rules and process.</p>

<p>Microsoft have a good technical brief here: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/3211279/outlook-2016-implementation-of-autodiscover">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/3211279/outlook-2016-implementation-of-autodiscover</a>.</p>

<p>As you can see, step six of the discovery processis "check the root domain". And that tends to be a step that's hit before the issue is settled, usually at step 7 or step 9. You can also see described the triggers and schedules for autodiscover.</p>

<p>A more practical, and digestable article for people not often working with Office 365 can be seen here: <a href="https://practical365.com/exchange-server/fixing-autodiscover-root-domain-lookup-issues-mobile-devices/">https://practical365.com/exchange-server/fixing-autodiscover-root-domain-lookup-issues-mobile-devices/</a>.</p>

<p>I quite like this article as the reference to the web hosting circus will be quite familiar to anyone who has had to support the average shared hosting environment. Those people will be familiar with how common hacked websites are.</p>



<p>The problem with the autodiscovery situation described is that I can put a redirect in my web server's nginx config:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">        location /autodiscover/autodiscover.xml {
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
            proxy_pass http://localhost:8089;
        }
</code></pre></div>
<p>And of course similar options exist for Apache. With this in place, here's a dump of a proxied connection:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">[2020-09-02 06:09:09] ERROR `/autodiscover/autodiscover.xml' not found.

<p>Microsoft's article discusses the <em>ExcludeHttpRedirect</em> registry key, but for most cases it's not a solution as it won't impact mobile users or anyone not using your exact version of Outlook on a corporate device.</p>

<p>The most approachable I've come up with is that a redirect can be put in place upstream if you use a service like Cloudflare. The following page rule takes this URL out of the hands of a web host by redirecting the connection to the correct place.</p>



<p>The practical365 site states "the root domain lookup makes absolutely no sense to me" and any attempt to read a discussion on the issue will lead you to plenty of discussion of this as nonsense. Unfortunately for as long as this priority exists, this problem will.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>"<a href="http://prog21.dadgum.com/154.html">Do You Really Want to be Doing This When You're 50?</a>"</p>
<p>Well, I didn't really want to be doing this when I was 20. I'm in it for the money. As long as there's money in programming, I'll stay for the money, in all likelihood.</p>
<p>What <em>else</em> do you want to be doing when you're 50? Give me a profession remotely close to programming in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Little or no required education</li>
<li>Good compensation, even for mediocre performers</li>
<li>Millions of jobs</li>
<li>No physical effort</li>
<li>No health or legal risks</li>
</ul>
<p>Programming is money for nothing. Programming is very easy to enter and extremely hard to quit. What would you do instead?</p>
<p>I work with three lawyers – two became programmers and one became a PM. I haven't met programmers who became lawyers. I do know an engineer – not a programmer – who became a patent attorney (reported reason: "at some point, you resent your manager being the age of your kids"). Would you like to become a patent attorney when you're 50?</p>
<p>I had a manager who decided he'd rather be a school teacher, thinking that this line of work is more beneficial to society. He quit after 8 months, saying in his parting interview to a mainstream newspaper: "Sometimes I just want to enter the classroom with a machine gun and open fire". He's with Samsung now; he feels that his contribution to smartphone imagers benefits society substantially enough.</p>
<p>One of my roommates at work has been studying a bunch of things for a while now. He's got a degree in psychology and in something called Visual Theater. He's been programming part-time all the while, which is how he financed his studies. He's programming as a part of his visual performances (there's computer music involved). He'll likely be programming to finance his art work. I'm not sure he plans to quit programming at any defined point.</p>
<p>I've seen a lot of people "quitting" to study anything from physics to philosophy, and then going back to programming. The money is addictive. There are many other sources of satisfaction, of course – which is why I run this blog for free – but much of this satisfaction has to do with <em>demand</em>, directly or indirectly, and is thus very much related to money. "Building something useful" and "making money" are close relatives.</p>
<p>You could, of course, become independently wealthy. But you probably won't, and then programming is your plan B. There's also a thing about material wealth – it's easily taken away. I'm from Soviet Russia, so I tend to exaggerate the likelihood of that – but really, property is easily confiscated, and paper money can become paper overnight. It's not just a USSR thing; the US <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102">confiscated gold</a> from its citizens at about the same time as the USSR. Professional ability, however, can't be confiscated. The prudent (paranoid?) independently wealthy programmer will thus make some effort to stay in a good shape.</p>
<p>There's the argument that professional programming is stressful. Again – compared to what? A doctor's work? A lawyer's work? Answering calls by irate customers while your responses are recorded for later inspection?</p>
<p>What stress? Programmers who can program at all – as in, print out a binary tree correctly – are very scarce. This scarcity makes it rather hard to push programmers around. You can try to bully them into doing unpaid overtime, but they quickly learn that it's a seller's market, and that you're basically bluffing. You have nobody to replace them with.</p>
<p>With demand outstripping supply, there's enough space in programming for everyone. This makes for a not-so-competitive environment, compared to, say, finance/investment banking type of jobs. Programmers are also typically shielded from customers and senior management – the kind of people who're always right, a trait making communication somewhat tiresome.</p>
<p>Deadlines? Sure, we have them, just like everybody else. Let's admit it though – we tend to miss them, and it's not very stressful to us unless we want it to be. If you're given an impossible schedule, and you do your best, and you miss the deadline, you can suffer deeply or you can maintain mental peace. The fact is that your material well-being is rarely in jeopardy because of a missed deadline, so your reaction is fully up to you.</p>
<p>There's the argument that programmers can't fully understand what's going on, what with all the APIs and layers and stuff. And if you don't understand your own environment, that's stressful and that's not fun. Fair enough; but again – who <em>does</em> understand his environment more than a programmer? A doctor digging into a patient's guts? A lawyer sifting through legal documents? An investor trading financial derivatives? A manager overseeing 10 or 20 programmers? With all the self-inflicted complexity, we're still in a better shape than most.</p>
<p>The fact is that there are relatively few programmers in their fifties around. Does it mean people don't survive in programming though? More likely, it is simply a result of growth. There were few 20 year old programmers 30 years ago – compared to 10 years ago. Therefore, there are fewer 50 year old programmers today than 30 year old programmers. To the extent that the growth in programming slows down, things will be different 20 years down the road.</p>
<p>So I'm not planning to quit programming, not because it's such a great source of joy by itself, but because it looks so good compared to just about anything else. Maybe not the most "passionate" statement – but passion burns out, whereas greed is sustainable. And if you plan to quit programming, I wonder what your alternative is, and I won't be surprised if you come back to programming in a few years.</p>

<h5>Competition | Generation | European Film Market &amp; Co-Production Market | Awards | Additional Information</h5>

<div>
<div><p>The Berlin International Film Festival has made its first decisions for the 2021 festival. The Berlinale 2021 is being planned as a physical festival. A hybrid model is intended for the <i>European Film Market</i> (<i>EFM</i>).<br>The implementation of the Festival and Market will take place in accordance with the then-applicable rules and regulations, thus ensuring the greatest possible security for all guests. Adjustments in the festival structure, the film programming and the total number of invited films will be defined by the festival management within the coming weeks.<br>Moreover, it has already been decided that in 2021 the section <i>Generation</i> will only show feature-length films with a running time of at least 60 minutes – and no short films – in its two competition programmes <i>Generation Kplus </i>and <i>Generation 14plus</i>.<br>The official film registration starts on September 1, 2020. You will then find the regulations on <a href="https://www.berlinale.de/en/home.html" title="" target="_self">www.berlinale.de</a>.</p>
<p>“Festivals and markets are places of encounter and communication. This applies to the public as well as to the industry. We see an important and unique feature of festivals in their lively relationship with the audience. In times of the corona pandemic, it has become even clearer that we still require analogue experience spaces in the cultural realm”, says the director duo of the Berlinale, Mariette Rissenbeek and Carlo Chatrian. “We are pleased that festivals with physically present audiences are slowly taking place again around the world, and we wish our colleagues much success.”</p>
<h3>2021: Performance Awards Gender-Neutral / New: Jury Prize</h3><p>The Berlinale has reorganised the prizes awarded by the International Jury in the <i>Competition</i>. For the first time, the performance awards will be defined in a gender-neutral way. Instead of the awards for the Best Actor and the Best Actress, a “Silver Bear for Best Leading Performance” and a “Silver Bear for Best Supporting Performance” shall each be awarded on a gender-neutral basis.</p>
<p>In addition thereto, the “Silver Bear Jury Prize” constitutes a further new awards category.</p>
<p>The former “Silver Bear Alfred Bauer Prize” was suspended in 2020 due to new findings about the position of the first Berlinale director, Alfred Bauer, under National Socialism, and this prize will no longer be awarded in the future. The evaluation of an external specialist historical study on Alfred Bauer will be available in late summer and then published.</p>
<p>The International Jury of the <i>Competition</i> will award the following eight prizes:</p>
<ul> <li>Golden Bear for Best Film (awarded to the film’s producers)</li><li>Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize</li><li>Silver Bear for Best Director</li><li>Silver Bear Jury Prize</li><li>Silver Bear for Best Leading Performance</li><li>Silver Bear for Best Supporting Performance</li><li>Silver Bear for Best Screenplay</li><li>Silver Bear for Outstanding Artistic Contribution</li> </ul><p>“We believe that not separating the awards in the acting field according to gender comprises a signal for a more gender-sensitive awareness in the film industry,” commented the director duo of the Berlinale.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>At Buffer, we’ve been using <a href="https://kubernetes.io/case-studies/buffer/">Kubernetes since 2016</a>.  We’ve been managing our k8s (kubernetes) cluster with <a href="https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/">kops</a>, it has about 60 nodes (on AWS), and runs about 1500 containers. Our transition to a micro-service architecture has been full of trial and errors. Even after a few years running k8s, we are still learning its secrets. This post will talk about how something we thought was a good thing, but ended up to be not as great as we thought: <strong>CPU limits</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="cpu-limits-and-throttling">CPU limits and Throttling</h2>
<p>It is s general recommendation to set CPU limits. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/kubernetes-best-practices-resource-requests-and-limits">Google, among others, highly recommends it</a>. The danger of not setting a CPU limit is that containers running in the node could exhaust all CPU available. This can trigger a cascade of unwanted events such as having key Kubernetes processes (such as <code>kubelet</code>) to become unresponsive. So it is in theory a great thing to set CPU limit in order to protect your nodes.</p>
<p>CPU limits is the maximum CPU time a container can uses at a given period (100ms by default). The CPU usage for a container will never go above that limit you specified. Kubernetes use a mechanism called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completely_Fair_Scheduler">CFS Quota</a> to <strong>throttle</strong> the container to prevent the CPU usage from going above the limit. That means CPU will be artificially restricted, making the performance of your containers lower (and slower when it comes to latency).</p>
<h2 id="what-can-happen-if-we-dont-set-cpu-limits">What can happen if we don’t set CPU limits?</h2>
<p>We unfortunately experienced the issue. The <code>kubelet</code> , a process running on every node, and in charge of managing the containers (pods)  in the nodes became unresponsive. The node will turn into a <code>NotReady</code> state, and containers (pods) that were present will be rescheduled somewhere else, and create the issue in the new nodes. Definitely not ideal isn’t it?</p>
<h2 id="discovering-the-throttling-and-latency-issue">Discovering the throttling and latency issue</h2>
<p>A key metric to check when you are running container is the <code>throttling</code> . This indicate the number of time your container has been throttled. Interestingly, we’ve discovered a lot of containers having throttling no matter if the CPU usage was near the limits or not. Here the example of one of our main API:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/cpu-usage-limits.png" alt="Kubernetes pods CPU usage and limits"></p>
<p>You can see in the animation that the CPU limits is set at <code>800m</code> (0.8 core, 80% of a core), and the peak usage is at most <code>200m</code> (20% of a core). After seeing, we might think we have plenty of CPU to let the service running before it throttle right? . Now check this one out:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/cpu-throttling-low-usage.gif" alt="Kubernetes pods Low CPU usage, High limit, lot of throttling"></p>
<p>You can notice the CPU throttling occurs, even though the CPU usage is below the CPU Limits. The maximum CPU usage isn’t even near the CPU limits.</p>
<p>We’ve then found a few resources(<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67577">github issue</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpFApeaGv7A&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1204">zanado talk</a>,  <a href="https://medium.com/omio-engineering/cpu-limits-and-aggressive-throttling-in-kubernetes-c5b20bd8a718">omio post</a>) talking about how throttling lead to poorer performances and latency for your services.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we see CPU throttling while CPU usage is low?</strong>
The tldr is basically a bug in the Linux kernel throttling unecessarly containers with CPU limit. If you’re curious about the nature of it, I invite you to check Dave Chiluk’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE7QX98-kO0">great talk</a>, a <a href="https://engineering.indeedblog.com/blog/2019/12/unthrottled-fixing-cpu-limits-in-the-cloud/">written version</a> also exists with more details.</p>

<p>After many long discussions, we’ve decided to remove the CPU limits for all services that were directly or indirectly on the critical path of our users.</p>
<p>This wasn’t an easy decision since we value the stability of our cluster. We’ve experimented in the past some instability in our cluster with services using too much resources and disrupting all other services present in the same node.  That time was a bit different, we understood more about how our services needed to be and had a good strategy to roll this out.</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/unleash-k8s.jpg" alt="Buffer-remove-cpu-limits-announcement"></p>
<h2 id="how-to-keep-your-nodes-safe-when-removing-limits-">How to keep your nodes safe when removing limits ?</h2>
<p><strong>Isolating “No CPU Limits” services:</strong></p>
<p>In the past we’ve seen some nodes going to a <code>notReady</code> state, mainly because some services were using too much resources in a node.</p>
<p>We’ve decided to put those services on some specific nodes (tainted nodes), so those services will not disrupt all the “bounded” ones.  We have better control and could identify easier if any issue occurs with a node. We did this by tainting some nodes and adding toleration to services that were “unbounded”. Check <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/">the documentation</a> on how you can do that.</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/buffer-k8s-infrastructure-nodes.jpg" alt="Buffer k8s nodes infrastructure"></p>
<p><strong>Assigning the correct CPU and memory request:</strong></p>
<p>The main worry we had was service using too much resources and leading to nodes becoming unresponsive. Because we now had great observability of all services running in our cluster (with Datadog), I’ve analyzed a few months of usage of each service we wanted to “unbound”. I’ve assigned the maximum CPU usage as the CPU request with a &gt; 20% margin. This will make sure to have allocated space in a node. If k8s won’t try to schedule any other service in that node.</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/choose-cpu-request-based-on-max.png" alt="Chose CPU request based on max"></p>
<p>You can see in the graph that the peak CPU usage was <code>242m</code> CPU core (0.242 CPU core). Simply take this number and make it a bit higher to become the CPU request. You can notice that since the service is user facing, the peak CPU usage matches peak traffic time.</p>
<p>Do the same with your memory usage and requests, and you will be all set!
To add more safety, you can use the horizontal pod autoscaler to create new pods if the resource usage is high, so kubernetes will schedule it in nodes that have room for it. Set an alert if your cluster do not have any room, or use the node austoscaler to add it automatically.</p>
<p>The downsides are that we lose in “<a href="https://wiki.openvz.org/WP/Containers_density">container density</a>”, the number of containers that can run in a single node. We could also end up with a lot of “slack” during a low traffic time.
You could also hit some high CPU usage, but nodes autoscaling should help you with it.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>I’m happy to publish really great results after few weeks of experimentation, we’ve already seen really great latency improvements across all the services we’ve modified:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/speedup-no-cpu-limits2.png" alt="faster-kubernetes-containers"></p>
<p>The best result happened on our main landing page (<a href="https://buffer.com/">buffer.com</a>) where we speed the service up to <strong>22x</strong> faster!</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/no-cpu-limit-speedup-buffer-com.jpg" alt="buffer.com speedup without cpu limits"></p>
<h2 id="is-the-linux-kernel-bug-fixed">Is the Linux kernel bug fixed?</h2>
<p>The bug <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=763a9ec06c4">has been fixed and merged into the kernel</a> for Linux distribution running 4.19 or higher (kudo again to <a href="https://twitter.com/dchiluk">Dave Chiluk</a> for finding and fixing that).</p>
<p>However, as for <em>September 2nd 2020</em>, when reading <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67577">the kubernetes issue</a>, we can see various Linux projects that keep referencing the issue, so I guess some Linux distribution still have the bug and working into integrating the fix.</p>
<p>If you are below a Linux distribution that has a kernel version below 4.19, I’d recommend you to upgrade to the latest Linux distribution for your nodes, but in any case, you should try removing the CPU limits and see if you have any throttling.  Here a non exhausting list of various managed Kubernetes services or Linux distribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debian: The latest version <a href="https://erickhun.com/posts/kubernetes-faster-services-no-cpu-limits/%5Bhttps://www.debian.org/releases/buster/">buster</a> has the fix,  it looks <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/news/1167353/accepted-linux-latest-419-105deb10u5deb9u1-source-amd64-into-oldstable-oldstable/">quite recent (august 2020)</a>. Some previous version might have get patched</li>
<li>Ubuntu: The latest version <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/">Ubuntu Focal Fosa 20.04</a> has the fix.</li>
<li>EKS has the fix since <a href="https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/175">December 2019</a>. Upgrade your AMI if you have a version below than that</li>
<li>kops: Since <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/9283">June 2020</a>,  <code>kops 1.18+</code> will start using <code>Ubuntu 20.04</code> as the default host image. If you’re using a lower version of kops, you’ll have to probably to wait the fix. We are currently in this situation.</li>
<li>GKE (Goggle Cloud) : The kernel fix was merged in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/release-notes#cos-stable-77-12371-141-0">January 2020</a>. But it does looks like throttling are <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24356903">still hapenning</a></li>
</ul>
<p>ps: Feel free to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24351566">comment</a> if you have more precise information, I’ll update the post accordingly</p>
<p><strong>If the fix solved the throttling issue?</strong></p>
<p>I’m unsure if totally solved the issue. I will give it a try once we hit a kernel version where the fix has been implemented and will update this post accordingly. If anyone have upgrade I’m keen to hear their results.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you run Docker containers under Linux (no matter Kubernetes/Mesos/Swarm) you might have your containers underperforming because of throttling</li>
<li>Upgrade to the latest version of your distribution hoping the bug is fixed</li>
<li>Removing CPU limit is a solution to solve this issue, but this is dangerous and should be made with extra-care (prefer upgrading your kernel first and monitor throttling first)</li>
<li>If you remove CPU limits, carefully monitor CPU and  memory usage in your nodes, and make sure your CPU requests are</li>
<li>A safe way to is to use the Horizontal pod autoscaler to create new pods if the resource usage is high, so kubernetes will schedule it in nodes that have space.</li>
</ul>
<p>👉<strong>Hacker news update: lot of insighful <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24351566">comments</a>. I’ve updated the post to have better recommendations. You should prefer upgrading your kernel version over removing the CPU limits. Be really mindful, set the proper CPU requests, add the necessary monitoring when you do this</strong></p>
<p>I hope this post helps you get performance gains on the containers you are running. If so, don’t hesitate to share or <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24351566">comment</a> with always some insighful comments</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Supervised learning is perhaps the most common form of machine learning task in use nowadays.</p>
<p>This form of learning makes use of a labeled training dataset to create a model that predicts a target of interest. If this line makes absolutely no sense to you, don't worry. After reading this article you will have a clear understanding of supervised learning and its two most popular applications: regression and classification.</p>
<h2 id="trainingmachineswithexamples">Training machines with examples</h2>
<p>Supervised learning is a process in which you teach a machine to predict a particular result by feeding it examples 'with the right answers'.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to know is what are you trying to predict. You might want to create a program that classifies pet photos as <em>dog photos</em> or <em>cat photos</em>, or a program that predicts the prices of houses in different districts in Sydney, Australia.</p>
<p>After deciding the variable you are trying to predict (your <strong>target</strong>), it's time to gather data examples from the real world and <em>label them</em>. In our first example, we would start gathering photos with dogs and photos with cats and tagging them with the right category. This photo of a puppy is a dog photo, that photo of a cat playing with a laser is a cat photo, and so on for every example.</p>
<p>Before the training stage, you will set aside a percentage of your training set to test the performance of your models. Afterwards, you will feed your labeled examples into an algorithm that will learn to generalize a relationship between the inputs (the photos) and the targets (dog/cat), producing a model you can use to classify fresh images it has never seen before. In this context, this is what <em>training</em> means: teaching a machine to perform actions learned from training data.</p>
<p>You can evaluate how well the model performs on your training set, the one you put aside before training. If the results are satisfying, you can deploy the model into production and use it to solve the original problem. The following diagram shows a high-level view of the supervised learning process.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/SupervisedLearning.png" alt="SupervisedLearning"></p>
<p>This is an example of a classification task.</p>
<p><strong>Classification</strong> and <strong>regression</strong> are the most common applications of supervised learning. If you are interested in a career in machine learning you will likely spend most of your time creating these types of models, so let's take a look at them.</p>
<h2 id="classifyingtheworld">Classifying the world</h2>
<p>A classifier is a model that tells you the <strong>class</strong>(category) an instance of your data belongs to. In the previous example, our instances were photos of pets, and the classes were <em>cat photos</em> and <em>dog photos</em>.</p>
<p>The training set for classification tasks is usually a collection of instances (individual instances of the phenomenon you are trying to model) with a <em>label</em> that specifies the class they belong to.</p>
<p>Classifiers can be further classified ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° ) into different subtypes depending on the number of target classes (binary or multiclass) and how many categories an instance can belong to at the same time (single-label and multi-label), let's take a look at those.</p>
<h4 id="binaryclassifiers">Binary classifiers</h4>
<p>A binary classifier is a model that classifies examples into two possible classes. Classifiers are capable of telling you if an email is either <strong>spam</strong> or <strong>not spam</strong>, if a photo of a face is <strong>happy</strong> or <strong>sad</strong> or if a substance is <strong>harmless</strong> or <strong>dangerous</strong>.</p>
<p>The most common setup for binary classification is to have a positive class (<em>class</em>) and a negative class (<em>not-class</em>). In this sense, you can re-define the previous examples as spam/not-spam, happy/not-happy and dangerous/not-dangerous.</p>
<p>Some types of binary classifiers don't just tell you a result, but they also provide you a probability that the instance you are classifying belongs to the predicted class.</p>
<p>Binary classifiers are some of the most studied and used models in machine learning, and many other models build on top of them (like some forms of multiclass classifiers).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/BinaryClassifier.png" alt="BinaryClassifier"></p>
<h4 id="multiclassclassifiers">Multiclass classifiers</h4>
<p>As you might imagine from the title, a multiclass classifier is a model that classifies instances into many categories. Like in the previous case you can get the results as the probability of belonging to a particular class.</p>
<p>It's important to note that there is a difference depending on the number of classes an instance can belong to at the same time.</p>
<p>If the classes are mutually exclusive (an object can only belong to one class at a time) you are building a <strong>single-label multiclass classifier</strong>. If an instance can belong to more than 1 class at the same time then you need a <strong>multi-label classifier</strong>.</p>
<p>Depending on the particular scenario, your choice of algorithms and evaluation methods will differ.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/MulticlassClassifier.png" alt="MulticlassClassifier"></p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/MultilabelClassifier.png" alt="MultilabelClassifier"></p>
<h2 id="regression">Regression</h2>
<p>The goal of a regression model is to predict a continuous value. The training set for a regression problem is usually a collection of instances with the associated numeric value you are trying to predict.</p>
<p>The following are some examples of regression problems</p>
<ul>
<li>Predict the price of houses in Amsterdam given the size of the house (in square meters), the year the house was built, the average income of the area in which the house is located, the number of bedrooms and the color of the mailbox.</li>
<li>Predict a person's likelihood developing diabetes given the height, weight, number of cigarettes smoked per day, average caloric intake, average hours of physical activity per week and amount of carbs consumed per day.</li>
<li>Predict the stock price of a company one year from now based on the number of Disney films released last year, the color of underwear the CEO wears with more frequency and the title of his/her aunt's favorite song.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regression tasks are extremely common in machine learning. If you decide to pursue a career in data science or ML engineering, many of the models you'll build are likely aimed to solve regression problems.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/SimpleRegressor.png" alt="SimpleRegressor"></p>
<h2 id="thecoreassumptionofsupervisedlearning">The core assumption of supervised learning</h2>
<p>Ok, now you have an idea of what supervised learning is and how the process works. In brief, you collect a lot of data relevant to the problem you are trying to solve and label it with the <em>correct answers</em>, or the expected result your model is trying to predict. Then, all this training data is fed into an algorithm that will generate a model that maps the inputs into classes(classification) or values(regression).</p>
<p>For this process to work, the information contained in the training set needs to have enough <strong>predictive power</strong> for the algorithm to find a correlation between the two sets.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to predict the likelihood a given person has to develop diabetes, you might want data like the BMI, genetic predisposition and dietary habits. All 3 with powerful correlation with the variable you are trying to find (likelihood to develop a disease, in this case). Other data, like favorite film, shoe size, and favorite headphone brand has less predictive power for this particular target, so it makes little sense to add it to the training set.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the data gathered doesn't provide enough information to build a model that performs well, in this scenario you need to reformulate the problem or find data with better quality.</p>
<p>Supervised learning is a huge topic with lots of important concepts. The goal of this article was to present a high-level view of the topic. Hopefully, by now you have a better understanding of supervised learning, and we will be prepared to dig deeper in more elaborate topics in future articles.</p>

                        <p>В офис IT-компании PandaDoc этим утром приехали с обыском, сообщил Telegram-канал «<a href="https://t.me/motolkohelp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">МотолькоПомоги</a>». Эту информацию Onliner подтвердил основатель и руководитель компании Микита Микадо. По его словам, обыск проводят сотрудники Департамента финансовых расследований.</p>





<p>Большинство сотрудников PandaDoc работает из дома, поэтому информации о происходящем в офисе пока почти нет. Также Микита сообщил, что «директора забрали».</p>

<p>Руководитель PandaDoc Микита Микадо в августе предложил инициативу по финансовой помощи сотрудникам силовых ведомств, которые уйдут со службы.</p>

<p>Микита записал обращение на своей странице в Facebook:</p>



<p>Микита сообщил, что «<strong>инкриминируют 243-ю статью</strong>». Звучит она так: <em>«Уклонение от уплаты сумм налогов, сборов наказывается штрафом, или лишением права занимать определенные должности или заниматься определенной деятельностью, или арестом со штрафом, или ограничением свободы на срок до трех лет со штрафом, или лишением свободы на тот же срок со штрафом».</em></p>

<blockquote>Основатель PandaDoc в истории на Facebook рассказал, что сотрудников <em>«закрыли в офисе, не дают пользоваться телефонами»</em>.</blockquote>

<p>Появилась информация об обыске в квартире Виктора Кувшинова. Он занимает позицию Head of Product в PandaDoc. Про обыск <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aleksandra.dikan/posts/10159289426808488" target="_blank">сообщила</a> его жена в Facebook: сейчас она не может связаться с супругом.</p>

<p>PandaDoc представлена в трех странах: Беларуси, США и на Филиппинах. Компания разрабатывает решения по работе с цифровыми документами. Суммарно PandaDoc привлекла около $50 миллионов инвестиций.</p>

<p><strong>Дополнено:</strong></p>

<p>Позже супруга Виктора Кувшинова <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aleksandra.dikan" target="_blank">сообщила</a> в Facebook о том, что он проходит как подозреваемый по&nbsp;ч. 4 ст. 210 УК РБ — хищение путем злоупотребления служебными полномочиями в особо крупном размере. Она предусматривает лишение свободы на срок от 5 до 12 лет с конфискацией имущества и с лишением права занимать определенные должности или заниматься определенной деятельностью.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599018800430/t5WB9APqY.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>For the past 3 months, I've worked with a team of 4 people to design a curriculum to help 300 middle schoolers start their coding journey. Most of them had little to no experience with programming.</p>
<h2 id="we-knew-this-was-going-to-be-a-challenging-task-but-we-were-certain-we-could-do-it">We knew this was going to be a challenging task, but we were certain we could do it.</h2>
<p>That is why we decided to teach them in a way which most programmers learn:</p>
<ol>
<li>The students would daily watch a video tutorial and follow instructions in it</li>
<li>They would then solve challenges curated by our team</li>
<li>Every weekend a doubt solving session was held wherein the concepts were quickly brushed upon and you guessed it, doubts were cleared</li>
</ol>
<p>Now here are my main takeaways:</p>
<h2 id="1-teaching-takes-patience-a-lot-of-patience">1. Teaching takes patience, A LOT OF PATIENCE!</h2>
<p>Especially younger students require spoon-feeding at times.
Resources which were given to them had to be boiled down enough for them to grasp it. </p>
<h2 id="2-having-clear-fundamentals-is-very-important">2. Having clear fundamentals is very important.</h2>
<p>Basic things like knowing what is an integer, string, variable etc. are very important, otherwise programming at a later stage becomes very difficult. </p>
<h2 id="3-you-must-keep-your-expectations-low-dont-expect-to-make-aaa-games-after-just-a-month-of-programming">3. You must keep your expectations low: Don't expect to make AAA games after just a month of programming.</h2>
<p>To put it bluntly, programming is very very tough.
Takes months of learning to get good at it and there is always something new to learn. </p>
<h2 id="4-having-smaller-more-achievable-goals-helps-in-learning-things-faster">4. Having smaller more achievable goals helps in learning things faster.</h2>
<p>This also makes you more confident. </p>
<h2 id="5-teach-your-students-how-to-ask-doubts-and-google-things">5. Teach your students how to ask doubts and google things</h2>
<p>Before asking doubts one must give a detailed explanation as to what they have tried and have they tried searching it up on the web?Bugs are inevitable and a coder must learn to google stuff when things don't work out </p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>All went well and in the end we were able to help all the students to get a feel for what programming feels, our goal was not make full-stack 12-year-old prodigies who work at Facebook but to get them excited about programming and I feel we achieved our goal very well.</p>
<p>Hope you found this post insightful.
Have an awesome day, Cheers.</p>

ESP32 is a series of dual-core up to 240Mhz, low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth/BLE.</p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/ac7ba2d12ae49bb808d323edae91463b7f97656872f7d24c91dab86d4ba1653d.jpeg"></p><p>Pwnagotchi is a tamagochi like device powered by bettercap and running on a Raspberry Pi Zero W that learns from its surrounding WiFi environment in order to maximize the crackable WPA key material it captures (either through passive sniffing or by performing deauthentication and association attacks). This material is collected on disk as PCAP files containing any form of handshake supported by hashcat, including full and half WPA handshakes as well as PMKIDs. Or put quickly, it's a tamagochi who eats WiFi handshakes to be happy.</p><p>Hash Monster runs in a smaller size and cheaper platform superior to the Pwnagotchi in several aspects. While Pwnagotchi is based on the Raspberry Pi Zero and requires assembling a DIY kit with various components such as an eInk screen and an external powerbank, the Hash Monster works on directly on the tiny M5Stack device. M5 Stack couples an ESP32 with a small LCD display, buttons and internal battery. It’s a modular, stackable, scalable, and portable device which is powered with an ESP-32 core, which makes it open source, low cost, full-function, and easy for developers to handle ESP32 IoT product development. You can program M5Stack through Arduino, C++, Blockly or MicroPython to name a few. The complete development kit for M5 Stack just under $45 provides a friendly price and full-featured resources which makes it a good starter kit for you to explore ESP32. While the M5 Stack includes a built-in battery 110mAh, it can be upgraded with a stackable 700 mAh lipo battery extension module.</p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/615059260bcadb5085e71de543154bec6c52222f5d1efda91cdcafdbe403cce2.png"></p><p>The similarity between Pwnagotchi and Hash Monster is that they capture both PSK handshakes from WPA / WPA2 networks and PSK hashes contained in beacon frames with PMKID. A great advantage of PMKID cracking is that everything you need is available over the air even if there are no stations connected and only a single packet capture is required. Later we can crack these hashes with standard tools such as aircrack or hashcat, and thus obtain the credentials. Of course, we should only do this in networks that we manage ourselves or that we have permission to audit.</p><p><strong>The process.</strong></p><p>Hardware requirements:</p><ul><li><a href="https://bit.ly/3jFAnl8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">M5Stack CORE Development Kit</a> with built-in 110mAh Battery ($45)</li></ul><p>Optionally:</p><ul><li><a href="https://bit.ly/3gYtI48" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Extended Battery M5Stack Core Development Kit Capacity 700mAh Stackable Module</a> (USD$12)</li><li><a href="https://www.banggood.com/M5Stack-Multi-function-Digital-Watch-with-700mAh-Battery-for-M5Stack-ESP32-Core-p-1551727.html?rmmds=search&amp;cur_warehouse=CN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Smart Watch Module with 700mAh Battery for M5Stack ESP32 Core</a> ($15)</li></ul><p>The software installation is pretty straight forward:</p><p>1.Setup Arduino IDE environment.</p><p><em>M5Stack Arduino IDE Setup in 5 minutes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2es-l4z2Zg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2es-l4z2Zg</a></em></p><p>2.

We will do this with two known tools – Aircrack-ng and Hashcat, which relies respectively on CPU and GPU power. We will be running these tools from linux, even though they are both found in a Windows version as well. Remember to use recent versions to benefit from the PMKID attack in addition to the traditional cracking of handshakes.</p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/adb3724e47a02d9fe14b83454cae422f882a9c99ccc78f0f2db6ef6e7a7f6f9b.png"></p><p>Aircrack-ng can be used for very basic dictionary attacks running on your CPU. Before you run the attack you need a wordlist. I recommend using the infamous rockyou dictionary file:</p><p># download the 134MB rockyou dictionary file</p><pre><code><code>curl -L -o rockyou.txt https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt</code></code></pre><p>Note, that if the network password is not in the wordlist you will not crack the password.</p><p># -a2 specifies WPA2, -b is the BSSID, -w is the wordfile</p><pre><code><code>aircrack-ng -a2 -b AC:FC:E3:C9:AB:C0 -w rockyou.txt 3.cap</code></code></pre><p>If the password is cracked you will see a KEY FOUND! message in the terminal followed by the plain text version of the network password.</p><p>Cracking an WiFi password using brute force attack for a long WiFi password without GPUs or Cloud help, will be a nightmare but if the password is short or you know the key pattern it will be "easily" cracked.</p><p>Here you have a small guide for linux (Ubuntu) to crack the WiFi password using the files stored on the SD_Card of the Purple Hash Monster using your computer.</p><p>First we need to install <strong>hashcat</strong></p><pre><code><code>sudo apt-get update</code><br>
<code> sudo apt install hashcat</code></code></pre><p>EAPOL/PMKID stored on the SD-Card are <em>pcap</em> files, we have to convert to <em>hccapx</em> format to work with hashcat. In terminal from the directory were we have the <em>pcap</em> file from the SD-CARD:</p><pre><code><code>wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hashcat/hashcat-utils/master/src/cap2hccapx.c</code><br>
<code> gcc -o cap2hccapx cap2hccapx.c</code><br>
<code> ./cap2hccapx 1.pcap 1.hccapx</code></code></pre><p>For example if we know that the wifi password has a lenght of 8 digits we can run the following command, and in few seconds we will have the WiFi Password :)</p><pre><code><code>hashcat --force -m 2500 -a 3 -1 ?d -o cracked 1.hccapx ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1</code></code></pre><p><strong>Final notes</strong></p><p>Although in my case I exclusively use the M5 Stack for the pocket monster hash, there are undoubtedly several projects that run on the M5 Stack and you will certainly want to take a look if you are interested in wifi and bluetooth security attack tools for this platform.</p><p>M5 Stack WiFi SSID Scanner by Elkentaro</p><p><a href="https://github.com/elkentaro/M5_SSID_scanner_collector" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/elkentaro/M5_SSID_scanner_collector</a></p><p>Covid Sniffer: BLE COVID exposure app sniffer using M5 Stack</p><p><a href="https://gitlab.com/mschmidl/covidsniffer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gitlab.com/mschmidl/covidsniffer</a></p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/02ee78aa44062073eb950642e19a44a548daf55d3217643f1a98cc84d37bc7d6.jpeg"></p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
          <h2>GREGOR, the largest solar telescope in Europe, which is operated by a German consortium and located on Teide Observatory, Spain, has obtained unprecedented images of the fine-structure of the Sun. Following a major redesign of GREGOR’s optics, carried out by a team of scientists and engineers from the Leibniz Institute for Solar Physics (KIS), the Sun can be observed at a higher resolution than before from Europe.</h2>
        </p><div>
        <p>press release, Sep 1, 2020
</p>

<p>The Sun is our star and has a profound influence on our planet, life, and civilization. By studying the magnetism on the Sun, we can understand its influence on Earth and minimize damage of satellites and technological infrastructure. The GREGOR telescope allows scientists to resolve details as small as 50 km on the Sun, which is a tiny fraction of the solar diameter of 1.4 million km. This is as if one saw a needle on a soccer field perfectly sharp from a distance of one kilometer.
</p>


<p>“This was a very exciting, but also extremely challenging project. In only one year we completely redesigned the optics, mechanics, and electronics to achieve the best possible image quality.” said Dr. Lucia Kleint, who led the project and the German solar telescopes on Tenerife. &nbsp;A major technical breakthrough was achieved by the project team in March this year, during the lockdown, when they were stranded at the observatory and set up the optical laboratory from the ground up. Unfortunately, snow storms prevented solar observations. When Spain reopened in July, the team immediately flew back and obtained the highest resolution images of the Sun ever taken by a European telescope.
</p>

<p>Prof. Dr. Svetlana Berdyugina, professor at the Albert-Ludwig University of Freiburg and Director of the Leibniz Institute for Solar Physics (KIS), is very happy about the outstanding results: “The project was rather risky because such telescope upgrades usually take years, but the great team work and meticulous planning have led to this success. Now we have a powerful instrument to solve puzzles on the Sun.” The new optics of the telescope will allow scientists to study magnetic fields, convection, turbulence, solar eruptions, and sunspots in great detail. First light images obtained in July 2020 reveal astonishing details of sunspot evolution and intricate structures in solar plasma. &nbsp;
</p>


<p>Telescope optics are very complex systems of mirrors, lenses, glass cubes, filters and further optical elements. If only one element is not perfect, for example due to fabrication issues, the performance of the whole system suffers. This is similar to wearing glasses with the wrong prescription, resulting in a blurry vision. Unlike for glasses, it is however very challenging to detect which elements in a telescope may be causing issues. The GREGOR team found several of those issues and calculated optics models to solve them. For example, astigmatism is one of such optical problems, which affects 30-60% people’s vision, but also complex telescopes. At GREGOR this was corrected by replacing two elements with so-called off-axis parabolic mirrors, which had to be polished to 6 nm precision, about 1/10000 of the diameter of a hair. Combined with several further enhancements the redesign led to the sharp vision of the telescope. A technical description of the redesign was recently published by the Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics journal in a recent article led by Dr. L. Kleint.
</p>



<p>European researchers have access to observations with the GREGOR telescope through national programs and a program funded by the European commission. New scientific observations are starting in September 2020. 
</p>

<p>Albert-Ludwig University Freiburg founded in 1457 offers undergraduate and graduate studies in all important disciplines today. The Leibniz Institute for Solar Physics (KIS) located in Freiburg is a public foundation and a member of the Leibniz Association. It carries out fundamental research on the Sun and other stars.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><code>API</code> is the acronym for Application Programming Interface which defines interactions between multiple software architecture layers. Programmers carry out complex tasks easily using APIs in software development. Without APIs, a programmer's life would have been miserable with no proper(security, for example) access to data,  knowing unnecessary low level details etc.</p>
<p>When it comes to Web APIs, there are extremely useful  objects, properties and functions available to perform tasks as minor as accessing DOM to as complex as managing audios, videos, graphics, etc. </p>

<p>If you are from the web development background, you are using many of them already. Here is the list of very well known web APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">Canvas</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">Fetch</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API">History</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API">Geolocation</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console_API">Console</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API">Drag &amp; Drop API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, I am going to talk about 10 more web APIs that are not so popular. Lesser popular doesn't mean, they are not useful. You can use them in various use-cases of your project. Please have a look.</p>

<p>If you would like to jump into the source code or see the demonstration immediately, here are the quick links to them:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/atapas/demolab/tree/master/code/src/demos/web-apis">Link to the Source Code @GitHub</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://demo.greenroots.info/categories/web-apis/">Link to the Web API DemoLab</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: Web APIs are nothing but the interfaces, functions, objects, properties written and exposed using vanilla JavaScript. However the usage of the web APIs is not limited to the vanilla JavaScript based application alone. It is very straightforward to use them with an Angular, React or Vue based applications as well.</p>
<p>All the examples I have used to demonstrate the web apis in this article are written using reactjs. You can find them in the github link mentioned above. Please feel free to fork, change and use!</p>

<p>A big (pain) point about  using a web API is, most of them are not standardized yet. It means, the support for a web API  may differ from one browser vendor to another. For example, You may find an API working with the Chrome browser but, not supported by Firefox or Edge browsers yet.</p>
<p>I would suggest a couple of ways to have a check on this,</p>


<p>Alright, time to get started knowing them. Hope you also find these useful.</p>
<h2 id="1-fullscreen-api">1. 📺 Fullscreen API</h2>
<p>Do you have the need to show any of the DOM elements in full-screen mode? The full-screen use-case is very demanding for gaming applications, online video platforms(like, youtube) etc. </p>
<p>The <code>Fullscreen API</code> provides methods to present a specific Element (and its children) in a full-screen mode. There is a method available to exit full-screen mode once it is no longer needed. Not only that, this API can also help to perform any actions when a DOM element transition into a full-screen mode or comes out of it.</p>
<p>In the example below, my favorite Santa Claus can get into the full-screen mode and come out of it with ease.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598715764074/fR7trCfsA.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="full_screen.gif"></p>
<p>In the code below, the <code>manageFullScreen()</code> function uses  the <code>requestFullscreen()</code> API on an element which is having an id called, <code>fs_id</code>. </p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> manageFullscreen = () =&gt; {
   <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'fs_id'</span>).requestFullscreen();
}
</code></pre>
<p>This element with id, <code>fs_id</code> is a <code>DIV</code> with a child element, i.e, the Santa Clause image.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div className=<span>"column"</span>&gt;
  <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>"fs_id"</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>Img</span> <span>fixed</span>=<span>{imageData.image.childImageSharp.fixed}</span> <span>alt</span>=<span>"santa"</span> /&gt;</span>
   <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;<span>StyledButton</span> 
         <span>onClick</span>=<span>{manageFullscreen}</span>&gt;</span>
            Enter Fullscreen with Santa
    <span>&lt;/<span>StyledButton</span>&gt;</span>
 <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can check if the <code>Fullscreen API</code> is supported by the browser,</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (<span>document</span>.fullscreenEnabled) {
   setSupported(<span>true</span>);
} <span>else</span> {
   setSupported(<span>false</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Also watch out for the useful handlers like,</p>
<ul>
<li><code>onfullscreenchange</code>: An event handler for the fullscreenchange event.</li>
<li><code>onfullscreenerror</code>: An event handler for the fullscreenerror event.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-clipboard-async-api">2. 📋 Clipboard Async API</h2>
<p>What is a clipboard in comuping?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The clipboard is a buffer that some operating systems provide for short-term storage and transfer within and between application programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are mainly three operations you can perform with the clipboard. They are, <code>copy</code>, <code>cut</code> and <code>paste</code>. The Clipboard API provides the ability to respond to these three operations. </p>
<p>Interestingly, copying content to the clipboard is open as in, there is no need of a user permission. However, for pasting the content from the clipboard to the user application, the user needs to grant permission for it. It is achieved using another web API called, <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API">Permission API</a></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598716493747/PwPwDDK8Y.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Here is a simple example of the copy-paste operation,</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598716547383/PoXUNZmnr.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="clip_board.gif"></p>
<p>This is how to check if the feature is supported by the browser,</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (navigator.clipboard 
     &amp;&amp; navigator.clipboard.read 
     &amp;&amp; navigator.clipboard.write) {
   setSupported(<span>true</span>);
} <span>else</span> {
   setSupported(<span>false</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the async API function for writing the content to the clipboard,</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>performCopy</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
   event.preventDefault();
   <span>try</span> {
      <span>await</span> navigator.clipboard.writeText(copyText);
      <span>console</span>.log(<span>`<span>${copyText}</span> copied to clipboard`</span>);
   } <span>catch</span> (err) {
      <span>console</span>.error(<span>'Failed to copy: '</span>, err);
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The Async API function to read the content from the clipboard and do something with it,</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>performPaste</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
   event.preventDefault();
   <span>try</span> {
       <span>const</span> text = <span>await</span> navigator.clipboard.readText();
       setPastetext(text);
       <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Pasted content: '</span>, text);
   } <span>catch</span> (err) {
      <span>console</span>.error(<span>'Failed to read clipboard contents: '</span>, err);
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note: With the inclusion of the <code>Clipboard Async API</code>, you can get rid of the usage of <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand">document.execCommad()</a> function as it is obsolete now.</p>

<h2 id="3-resize-observer-api">3. 🧐 Resize Observer API</h2>
<p>Do you want to take some actions based on the changes to the content or border box of a DOM element? Are you thinking of writing a handler by yourself? What if I tell you, there is already one provided by the web API implementation?</p>
<p>Here is a story about a dumb button. We use a range slider to resize the button. While the button gets resized, we also want to control the text color, without letting the button know much about it. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717277220/dITL6Nog2.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="resizer.gif"></p>
<p>First, create a button and specify an id so that, we can access the button later using the id.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;StyledButton id=<span>"dumbBtnId"</span>&gt;
   I am a Dumb Button
&lt;<span>/StyledButton&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now we create a slider using the <code>range</code> input type from HTML5. A <code>resize()</code> function is invoked when the slider value changes.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
   <span><span>&lt;<span>input</span> 
         <span>onChange</span>=<span>{(event)</span> =&gt;</span> resize(event)} 
         type="range" 
         min={minRange} 
         max={maxRange} 
         defaultValue={rangeValue} /&gt;
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>resize()</code> function simply sets the width of the button as the slider range value so that, it can be resized dynamically.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> resize = event =&gt; {
   <span>const</span> value = event.target.valueAsNumber;
   setRangeValue(value);
   <span>let</span> dumbBtn = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'dumbBtnId'</span>);
   dumbBtn.style.width = <span>`<span>${value}</span>px`</span>;
 }
</code></pre>
<p>So far, so good? Now for every range value change, the button gets resized. We have a <code>ResizeObserver</code> observing this change and change the color of the button text.</p>
<pre><code>useEffect(() =&gt; {
   <span>try</span> {
            <span>let</span> dumbBtn = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'dumbBtnId'</span>);
            <span>var</span> resizeObserver = <span>new</span> ResizeObserver(entries =&gt; {
                <span>for</span>(<span>const</span> entry <span>of</span> entries) {
                    
                    
                   entry.target.style.color = <span>'green`;
                }
      });
      resizeObserver.observe(dumbBtn);
   } catch(e) {
            setSupported(false);
            console.log(e);      
   }
}, [rangeValue]);</span>
</code></pre>

<h2 id="4-image-capture-api">4. 📷 Image Capture API</h2>
<p>There are some cool and useful APIs around user media like, audio, video etc. I love the <code>Image Capture API</code> which helps us to capture an image or grab a frame from the video devices(like webcam). Not only that, you can also perform actions on capturing an image or grabbing a frame.</p>
<p>First, get the user media access. In this case we are getting the webcam access.</p>
<pre><code>navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({video: <span>true</span>})
  .then(mediaStream =&gt; {
     <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'video'</span>).srcObject = mediaStream;
     <span>const</span> track = mediaStream.getVideoTracks()[<span>0</span>];
     setTrack(track);
  }).catch(error =&gt; {
     <span>console</span>.error(<span>` <span>${error}</span> is not yet supported`</span>);
     setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>Just like the clipboard paste operation, a webcam media access permission has to be granted by the user.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717565379/MCRNY49Tl.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Now Grab a frame and do something. In this example, I am just drawing the frame on a Canvas.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> imageCapture = <span>new</span> ImageCapture(track);
    imageCapture.grabFrame()
      .then(imageBitmap =&gt; {
          <span>const</span> canvas = <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'#grabFrameCanvas'</span>);
          drawCanvas(canvas, imageBitmap);
    }).catch(error =&gt; {
          <span>console</span>.log(error);
          setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>I can also take a picture and do the similar thing.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> imageCapture = <span>new</span> ImageCapture(track);
    imageCapture.takePhoto().then(blob =&gt; createImageBitmap(blob))
      .then(imageBitmap =&gt; {
          <span>const</span> canvas = <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'#takePhotoCanvas'</span>);
          drawCanvas(canvas, imageBitmap);
    }).catch(error =&gt; {
          <span>console</span>.log(error);
          setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>To stop the video streaming from the webcam, just call he method <code>stop()</code> on the running video track.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> videoOff = () =&gt; {
   track.stop();
 }
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717833234/MPOxVZ92M.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="chrome_Umvi16wUlu.png"></p>
<p>Also watch out for the methods,</p>
<ul>
<li><code>getPhotoCapabilities()</code>: To get the ranges of available configuration options.</li>
<li><code>getPhotoSettings()</code>: To get the current photo configuration settings.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5-broadcast-channel-api">5. 📡 Broadcast Channel API</h2>
<p>The <code>Broadcast Channel API</code> allows communication between browsing contexts (windows, tabs, iframes) and workers on the <strong>same origin</strong>. Think of a use-case like, once you logout from an app running in a browser tab, you want to broadcast it to the app instances opened in other tabs of the same browser.</p>
<p>Here is an example where a sender is sending a message to the receiver and the same is being …</p></div></div>

        <p>Shell is the essential tool for every programmer. The more familiar you become with the available tools, the more efficient you can be with using your computer. Here's a list of command-line tools written in Rust that aim to provide modern, often much faster, alternatives to the existing shell commands.</p>
<h2 id="bat"><code>bat</code></h2>
<p><code>bat</code> is a <code>cat</code> clone with syntax highlighting and Git integration that works on Windows, MacOS and Linux. It provides syntax highlighting for many file extensions by default.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223573-9b9eb780-de0e-11ea-94e3-908957fe5a4e.png" alt="bat"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="exa"><code>exa</code></h2>
<p><code>exa</code> is a modern replacement for <code>ls</code>, the default command-line program in Unix/Linux for listing directory contents. <code>exa</code> supports icons with the <code>--icons</code> flag.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223612-aa856a00-de0e-11ea-8cec-133becefa6f2.png" alt="exa">
<a href="https://github.com/ogham/exa">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="fd"><code>fd</code></h2>
<p><code>fd</code> is a fast and user-friendly alternative to <code>find</code>, the built-in command-line program in Unix/Linux for walking a file hierarchy. <code>fd</code> provides opinionated defaults for the most common use cases. To find a specific file by name, you write <code>fd PATTERN</code> instead of <code>find -iname ‘*PATTERN*’</code>. <code>fd</code> is also extremely fast and it comes with a ton of options like ignoring hidden directories, files and patterns from <code>.gitignore</code> by default.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223646-bbce7680-de0e-11ea-98f4-0ef2d5f30920.png" alt="fd"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="procs"><code>procs</code></h2>
<p><code>procs</code> is a modern replacement for <code>ps</code>, the default command-line program in Unix/Linux for getting information about processes. It provides convenient, human-readable (and colored) output format by default.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223676-c8eb6580-de0e-11ea-8e3e-fea30f173aab.png" alt="procs"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dalance/procs">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="sd"><code>sd</code></h2>
<p><code>sd</code> is an intuitive find &amp; replace command-line tool, it is an alternative to <code>sed</code>, the built-in command-line program in Unix/Linux for parsing and transforming text (). <code>sd</code> has simpler syntax for replacing all occurrences and it uses the convenient regex syntax that you already know from JavaScript and Python. <code>sd</code> is also 2x-11x faster than <code>sed</code>.</p>
<p><code>sed</code> is a programmable text editor, with search and replace being a common use case. In that light, <code>sd</code> is more like <code>tr</code>, but on steroids. (thanks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/oleid/">/u/oleid</a> for the suggestion).</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223698-d6a0eb00-de0e-11ea-85e7-7bf590794ac0.png" alt="sd"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/chmln/sd">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="dust"><code>dust</code></h2>
<p><code>dust</code> is a more intuitive version of <code>du</code>, the built-in command-line program in Unix/Linux for displaying disk usage statistics. By default <code>dust</code> sorts the directories by size.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223722-e0c2e980-de0e-11ea-8c75-343273fed6f3.png" alt="dust"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bootandy/dust">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="starship"><code>starship</code></h2>
<p>The minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell.</p>

        <p>With this year’s <a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2020">International Conference on Machine Learning&nbsp;(ICML)</a>
being over, it is time to have another instalment of this series.
Similar to <a href="http://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2019/icml_tda_roundup/">last year’s post</a>, I shall cover
several papers that caught my attention because of their use of
topological concepts—however, <em>unlike</em> last year, I shall not
restrict the selection to papers using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis">topological data analysis&nbsp;(TDA)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Caveat lector:</strong> I might have missed some promising papers. Any
suggestions for additions are more than welcome! Please reach out

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04881">Learning Flat Latent Manifolds with VAEs</a>
by <a href="https://argmax.ai/team/nutan-chen">Nutan Chen</a>, <a href="https://www.argmax.ai/team/alexej-klushyn">Alexej Klushyn</a>,
Francesco Ferroni, <a href="http://bayerj.github.io/">Justin Bayer</a>, and
<a href="https://argmax.ai/team/patrick-van-der-smagt">Patrick van der Smagt</a>
discusses an interesting modification of variational autoencoders, viz.
an extended loss term that regularises the latent space to be
<em>flat</em>&nbsp;(i.e. having no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature">curvature</a>).
The main idea is to ensure that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor">Riemannian metric tensor</a>
is the identity matrix.</p>
<p>The ingenious implication of such a latent space is that the Euclidean
distance is a good proxy for the similarity between data points, whereas
this is <em>not</em> a priori the case for other latent spaces. It is interesting
to note that there is a ‘sibling’ paper to this one, which was published
at ICLR 2020, namely <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=S1g6xeSKDS">Mixed-curvature Variational Autoencoders</a>.
This paper presents an autoencoder whose latent space is a product of
Riemannian manifolds, whose curvature is either fixed or learnable.</p>
<p>I am glad to see that curvature is starting to attract more attention
from the machine learning community. It is such a fundamental property
of a manifold but can influence the validity of many calculations in
latent spaces. It also has some beneficial properties for <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BylEqnVFDB">graph
classification</a>, but this is
maybe a better topic for a subsequent post!</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10996">Graph Filtration Learning</a> by
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christoph_Hofer8">Christoph Hofer</a>,
<a href="https://www.uni-salzburg.at/index.php?id=213185&amp;L=1">Florian Graf</a>,
<a href="https://bastian.rieck.me/">Bastian Rieck</a>,
<a href="http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/~mn/?q=content/overview">Marc Niethammer</a>, and
<a href="https://rkwitt.github.io/">Roland Kwitt</a> is arguably<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> the first step
towards properly integrating topological features into neural networks
for graph classification! Briefly put, we developed a homological
<code>READOUT</code> function&nbsp;(to use the parlance of graph neural networks)
that gives rise to a learnable filter function—a <em>filtration</em>.</p>
<p>This concept might be unknown to some readers, but a filtration in this
context is a scalar-valued function on the vertices of a graph that
permits <em>sorting</em> it. Filtrations serve as the backbone for many
topology-based algorithms, primarily for the aforementioned <a href="https://christian.bock.ml/posts/persistent_homology/">persistent homology</a>,
which permits us to study multi-scale topological
features&nbsp;(connected components, cycles, etc.) of an object.
Prior to this paper, filtrations were pre-defined or chosen based on
some target function, such as the vertex degree function of a graph. Our
approach changes this—leading to a filtration that is learnable in an
end-to-end fashion and thus specifically designed for a classification
problem.</p>
<p>We manage to achieve this by first initialising our filter function
based on a regular graph neural network; essentially, one level of
message passing between nodes is sufficient. This provides us with
a non-trivial filter function whose performance we can subsequently
adjust by calculating the topological features induced by said filter,
and vectorising the resulting representations. Since each of these steps
is differentiable<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, the resulting function is also differentiable,
making it possible to adjust the filter for the best classification
results.</p>
<p>I would recommend this paper to anyone who is interested in learning
more about the benefits that a topology-based perspective brings to
certain application problems. Being able to learn the <em>right</em> topological features
to classify a set of graphs opens up exciting opportunities.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04805">Topologically Densified Distributions</a>
by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christoph_Hofer8">Christoph Hofer</a>,
<a href="https://www.uni-salzburg.at/index.php?id=213185&amp;L=1">Florian Graf</a>,
<a href="http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/~mn/?q=content/overview">Marc Niethammer</a>, and
<a href="https://rkwitt.github.io/">Roland Kwitt</a> studies regularisation properties of
over-parametrised neural networks in the context of small sample-size learning.
This is achieved by studying the properties of latent
representations&nbsp;(the paper uses the term <em>internal representation</em>,
but this is equivalent). More precisely, generalisation properties are
analysed via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushforward_measure">push-forward probability measure</a>
induced by the latent representation&nbsp;(or <em>encoding</em>).</p>
<p>The authors show that probability mass concentration around training
samples in the latent space is linked to the generalisation capabilities
of a model, but, even more exciting, such a concentration can be achieved by applying
topological constraints on samples from that space! In the context of
this paper, such constraints pertain to measuring the <em>connectivity</em> of
samples. This is achieved using <a href="https://christian.bock.ml/posts/persistent_homology/">persistent homology</a>, specifically,
by calculating a zero-dimensional Vietoris–Rips complex—if you are
not familiar with this term, just think of a minimum spanning tree.</p>
<p>What I particularly enjoyed about this paper is that it starts providing
solid answers to fundamental concepts in machine learning. All too often,
we remain in the realm of the empirical and just <em>observe</em> whether our
network generalises. This paper ventures into hitherto-unknown territories
and gives us a theoretical justification!</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00722">Topological Autoencoders</a> by
<a href="https://michaelmoor.ml/">Michael Moor</a>,

<a href="https://bastian.rieck.me/">Bastian Rieck</a>, and
<a href="https://bsse.ethz.ch/mlcb/karsten.html">Karsten Borgwardt</a> deals with
regularising the latent space in terms of its topology. More precisely,
we preserve the topological features of the input data in the respective
latent space&nbsp;(on the batch level, respectively). While we restrict
our experiments to connected components for now&nbsp;(so no cycles
yet, even though our method generalises to higher dimensions),
our approach makes it possible to create latent representations
that ‘mimic’ the topological features of the input.</p>
<p>This leads to a nice plug-and-play loss term that can be easily
integrated into most architectures, and we can demonstrate that, among
others, it considerably improves the quality of a ‘vanilla’ autoencoder
architecture. To achieve this goal, we had to solve all kinds of
interesting adventures, one of them being how to make everything
differentiable. Interestingly, we end up with a similar necessary
condition for differentiability than for the graph filtration learning
paper, viz. the pairwise distances between different samples of the
input batch need to be <em>unique</em>.</p>
<p>The coolest feature of our method is that it technically <em>only</em> requires
a distance metric between input samples<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, nothing more—no feature
vector representation or anything. It can thus conceivably be used to
represent the topology of any object you fancy&nbsp;(including
documents, images, and graphs).</p>

to this publication, you should take the time to read Michael’s <a href="https://michaelmoor.ml/blog/topoae/main/">blog post on our paper</a>.</p>

<a href="https://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/shanahan_phiala.html">Phiala E.  Shanahan</a>,
and <a href="http://theoryandpractice.org/">Kyle Cranmer</a>
present a novel method for calculating normalising flows on more complex
spaces than the usual Euclidean ones. Specifically, as the title
implies, they develop methods for calculating such flows on tori and
spheres.</p>
<p>What I enjoyed about this paper is the smart way of constructing flows
iteratively: first, flows on the circle are being constructed&nbsp;(using
different concepts for defining a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism">diffeomorphism</a>, the most favourite of
mine being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation">Möbius transformation</a>).
Since a torus can be described as the Cartesian product of circles, this
is sufficient to describe flows on tori of arbitrary dimensions! Next,
the flows are generalised to higher-dimensional spheres.</p>
<p>While I am by no means and expert in normalising flows, I liked
reading this paper a lot. The theory is well-developed and it is another
one of those publications that shows you how to go beyond the boundaries
of what is currently possible. Moreover, I enjoyed the discussion of the
implementation details—it turns out that achieving numerical stability
here is another feat that deserves some mention!</p>

<p>This year’s ICML also featured an interesting array of topology-based
papers. Not all of them fit neatly into the field of topological data
analysis&nbsp;(TDA), but I am happy to see that the community is
starting to pick up this fundamental topic. I remain convinced that
a topology-driven perspective is needed to answer certain foundational
questions in machine learning. Here’s to the future of topology!</p>

September 1, 2020 | https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/tuple/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/tuple/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>When he created Go as a knee-jerk Reaction to C++11,
Rob Pike proclaimed <a href="https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html">Less is exponentially more</a>.
While it is anyone’s guess what that is supposed to mean, in this blog post we will see how C++20 is less verbose, yet more expressive than
prior C++ versions.</p>
<p>I am a big fan of concepts-driven designs.
The use of concepts leads to less coupled, more generic interfaces that work with more types.
Take <code>std::tuple</code> for example. A tuple can be constructed from a <code>std::pair</code>. But it can’t be
constructed from a <code>QPair</code> or a <code>boost::tuple</code>. Nor can it be constructed from a <code>std::array</code>,
even if <code>std::array</code> follows the tuple protocol.
Isn’t that a bit arbitrary?</p>
<p>Shouldn’t instead construction and comparison support all objects following the tuple protocol?
Especially for comparison, if a different part of my system uses a different tuple type (of the same arity),
why should I need to do an expensive conversion to compare their <strong>value</strong> ?</p>
<p>A better question, of course, would be <em>why is <code>std::pair</code> a distinct type from <code>std::tuple</code>?</em>, the answer to that
being <em>legacy</em>, as always. Could we fix it? Probably not.</p>
<p>But anyway, this led me to propose <a href="https://wg21.link/p2165">P2165 - Comparing pair and tuples</a>.
This, in turn, led me to look at libstdc++'s tuple implementation.
That is the topic of today’s blog post.</p>
<p><code>std::tuple</code> is a C++11 addition, and like many standard types, its goal of being a universal
vocabulary type makes it quite challenging to implement.</p>
<p>You can also checkout <a href="https://medium.com/@mortificador/implementing-std-tuple-in-c-17-3cc5c6da7277">this article</a>
which explain how <code>std::tuple</code> is implemented in C++17.</p>
<p>But since then the language changed a lot, and many new features target easier library development.
Let see how C++20 can help us simplify <code>std::tuple</code>'s implementation.</p>
<h3 id="down-with-ebo">Down with EBO</h3>
<p><code>std::tuple</code> can be implemented as a recursive tuple.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>template</span> &lt;<span>typename</span> T, <span>int</span> index&gt;
<span>struct</span> <span>Wrapper</span> {
    T type;
};

<span>template</span> &lt;<span>int</span> index, <span>typename</span> T, <span>typename</span>... Tail&gt;
<span>struct</span> <span>Tuple</span>
    : Wrapper&lt;T, index&gt;
    , Tuple&lt;index + <span>1</span>, Tail...&gt;
{
};
</code></pre></div><p>Unfortunately, we do need to explicitly define constructors to be able
to use that type, which ends up with 14 or so constructors and a few assignment operators.
Half of those being for allocator support.</p>
<p>On top of that, libstdc++ optimises for empty types:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>struct</span> <span>empty</span>{};
<span>static_assert</span>(<span>sizeof</span>(std::tuple&lt;empty, empty&gt;) == <span>1</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>To that end, it implements <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/ebo">empty base class optimization</a></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>template</span> &lt;<span>typename</span> T, <span>int</span> index, <span>bool</span> <span>/* is the class empty */</span>&gt;
<span>struct</span> <span>Wrapper</span>;

<span>template</span> &lt;<span>typename</span> T, <span>int</span> index&gt;
<span>struct</span> <span>Wrapper</span>&lt;T, index, std::is_empty_v&lt;T&gt;&gt; {
    <span>// LOTS OF CONSTRUCTORS
</span><span></span>};

<span>template</span> &lt;<span>typename</span> T, <span>int</span> index&gt;
<span>struct</span> <span>Wrapper</span>&lt;T, index, !std::is_empty_v&lt;T&gt;&gt; {
    <span>// LOTS OF CONSTRUCTORS
</span><span></span>    T type;
};

<span>template</span> &lt;<span>int</span> index, <span>typename</span> T, <span>typename</span>... Tail&gt;
<span>struct</span> <span>Tuple</span>
    : Wrapper&lt;T, index&gt;
    , TupleImpl&lt;index + <span>1</span>, Tail...&gt;
{
    <span>// LOTS OF CONSTRUCTORS
</span><span></span>};
</code></pre></div><p>The actual libstdc++ implementation is a bit more complicated still.
Overall, about 70 lines of code - mostly duplicated - are there to
support empty objects.
This small optimization is, therefore, anything but free in terms of maintenance.
It also has some compilation cost, as more templates need to be instantiated.
Is it even worth it?</p>
<p>In C++20 all of that complexity goes away:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>template</span> &lt;<span>typename</span> T, <span>int</span> index&gt;
<span>struct</span> <span>Wrapper</span> {
    <span>[[no_unique_address]]</span> T type;
};

<span>template</span> &lt;<span>int</span> index, <span>typename</span> T, <span>typename</span>... Tail&gt;
<span>struct</span> <span>TupleImpl</span>
    : Wrapper&lt;T, index&gt;
    , TupleImpl&lt;index + <span>1</span>, Tail...&gt;
{
};
</code></pre></div><p><code>[[no_unique_address]]</code> gives us the same optimization as Empty-Base-Class-Optimization,
without adding any complexity to our design.
Less code, more expressiveness, less maintenance.</p>
<h3 id="c20-is-more-implicit-about-being-explicit">C++20 is more implicit about being explicit.</h3>
<p>Like watermelons are mostly water, <code>std::tuple</code> is mostly constructors.
I counted 24 constructors in libstdc++'s implementation.
Let’s remove some.</p>
<p>The standard specifies that a tuple constructor is explicit if any of its
elements would have an <code>explicit</code> constructor.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>struct</span> <span>S</span> {};
<span>struct</span> <span>E</span> { <span>explicit</span> <span>E</span>(S); };
<span>struct</span> <span>I</span> { I(S); };

std::tuple&lt;E&gt; x = S{};  <span>// ill-formed
</span><span></span>std::tuple&lt;I&gt; x = S{};  <span>// OK
</span></code></pre></div><p>Pretty neat. But how does it work ?</p>
<p>Simply by having defining 2 constructors,
one explicit and one not, and SFINAE away the one that should not be considered:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>template</span>&lt;<span>bool</span> _Cond, <span>typename</span>... _Args&gt;
<span>using</span> _ImplicitCtor =
    __enable_if_t&lt;_TCC&lt;_Cond&gt;::<span>template</span> __is_implicitly_constructible&lt;_Args...&gt;(), <span>bool</span>&gt;;

<span>template</span>&lt;<span>bool</span> _Cond, <span>typename</span>... _Args&gt;
<span>using</span> _ExplicitCtor =
    __enable_if_t&lt;_TCC&lt;_Cond&gt;::<span>template</span> __is_explicitly_constructible&lt;_Args...&gt;(), <span>bool</span>&gt;;


<span>template</span>&lt;<span>bool</span> _NotEmpty = (<span>sizeof</span>...(_Elements) &gt;= <span>1</span>),
    _ImplicitCtor&lt;_NotEmpty, <span>const</span> _Elements&amp;...&gt; = <span>true</span>&gt;
<span>constexpr</span> tuple(<span>const</span> _Elements&amp;... __elements);

<span>template</span>&lt;<span>bool</span> _NotEmpty = (<span>sizeof</span>...(_Elements) &gt;= <span>1</span>),
    _ExplicitCtor&lt;_NotEmpty, <span>const</span> _Elements&amp;...&gt; = <span>false</span>&gt;
<span>explicit</span> <span>// This is the explicit constructor
</span><span></span><span>constexpr</span>
tuple(<span>const</span> _Elements&amp;... __elements);
</code></pre></div><p>And this is for every single constructor!
Don’t worry, this is not the way, for in C++20 <code>explicit</code> was amended to support another form: <code>explicit(boolean-expression)</code>.
As such, <code>explicit(true)</code> is equivalent to <code>explicit</code> while <code>explicit(false)</code> is not explicit.
We can then rewrite the above code as:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>template</span>&lt;<span>bool</span> _NotEmpty = (<span>sizeof</span>...(_Elements) &gt;= <span>1</span>)&gt;
<span>explicit</span>(is_explicit_v&lt;<span>const</span> _Elements&amp;...&gt;)
<span>constexpr</span>
tuple(<span>const</span> _Elements&amp;... __elements);
</code></pre></div><p>This little trick lets us remove about 10 constructors and about 150 lines of codes. Don’t reinvent yourself!</p>
<h3 id="constrained-copy-pasta">Constrained copy-pasta</h3>
<p>With so many constructors, <code>std::tuple</code> is a template SFINAE bonanza.
So it is not surprising that the best way to improve <code>std::tuple</code> is to go all-in on C++ concepts.
Or rather, on <code>requires</code> clauses.</p>
<p>This is the code in libstdc++ for the default constructor:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>template</span>&lt;<span>typename</span> _Dummy = <span>void</span>, _ImplicitDefaultCtor&lt;is_void&lt;_Dummy&gt;::value&gt; = <span>true</span>&gt;
<span>constexpr</span>
tuple()
<span>noexcept</span>(__and_&lt;is_nothrow_default_constructible&lt;_Elements&gt;...&gt;::value);
</code></pre></div><p>It can be rewritten using a <code>requires</code> clause easily: No <code>std::enable_if</code> wizardry.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>explicit</span>(!(__and_&lt;__is_implicitly_default_constructible&lt;_Elements&gt;::value...&gt;::value))
<span>constexpr</span> tuple()
<span>noexcept</span>((__and_&lt;is_nothrow_default_constructible&lt;_Elements&gt;::value...&gt;::value))
<span>requires</span>((__and_&lt;std::is_default_constructible&lt;_Elements&gt;::value&gt;...&gt;::value));
</code></pre></div><p>If we look at the standard, the code above is a direct translation of the wording!
Each <code>Constraint</code> in the wording draft can be converted to a C++ constraint!</p>
<p><img src="https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/tuple/ctr1.png" alt="Example image"></p>
<p>One other thing we should do is to use fold expressions and template variables to cut down
on the clutter. Both these are actually C++17 features!</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>explicit</span>(!(__is_implicitly_default_constructible_v&lt;_Elements&gt; &amp;&amp;...))
<span>constexpr</span> tuple()
<span>noexcept</span>((std::is_nothrow_default_constructible_v&lt;_Elements&gt; &amp;&amp;...))
<span>requires</span>((std::is_default_constructible&lt;_Elements&gt; &amp;&amp;...));
</code></pre></div><p>Because <code>requires</code> clauses make it a lot easier to express constraint, and allow us to
implement the standard line by line, we can remove a lot of code while increasing
readability!</p>
<p>You could wonder about the cost of all these concepts on compile-time,
that would be very legitimate indeed.
Concepts are in fact a bit taxing on compilers.
They are however not as costly than the equivalent <code>enable_if</code> machinery,
so these transformations end up having no negative impact on compile times.</p>
<h3 id="a-pair-by-any-other-name-would-compile-just-as-fast">A pair by any other name would compile just as fast</h3>
<p>Because a tuple is constructible from a <code>std::pair</code>, libstdc++ elects to specialize tuple for 2
elements, for the sake of these additional constructors.
But what is a pair, if not a tuple?
Following this logic, we could remove that entire specialization, a whopping 360 lines of code.
So satisfying!</p>
<p>We could also keep the constructors for pair by simply adding a <code>requires (sizeof...(_Elements) == 2)</code>
to these constructors, no need for specialization!</p>
<h3 id="-nothing-as-futuristic-as-a-spaceship">🛸 Nothing as futuristic as a spaceship!</h3>
<p>Tuple provides all the comparison operators which are implemented in about 100 lines of code.
We can replace them by 2 functions, <code>operator==</code> and <code>operator&lt;=&gt;</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>template</span> &lt;<span>typename</span>...Elem, <span>typename</span>...OElem, <span>template</span> &lt;<span>typename</span>...&gt; <span>typename</span> B&gt;
<span>requires</span> (tuple_like&lt;B&lt;OElem...&gt;&gt;  &amp;&amp; <span>sizeof</span>...(Elem) == <span>sizeof</span>...(OElem))
<span>bool</span> <span>operator</span>==(<span>const</span> tuple&lt;Elem...&gt; &amp; a, <span>const</span> B&lt;OElem...&gt; &amp; b) {
    <span>return</span> [&amp;]&lt;std::size_t... I&gt;(index_sequence&lt;I...&gt;)
    {
        <span>return</span>  ((std::get&lt;I&gt;(a) == std::get&lt;I&gt;(b)) &amp;&amp; ...);
    }
    (std::make_index_sequence&lt;<span>sizeof</span>...(Elem)&gt;{});
}

<span>template</span> &lt;<span>typename</span>...Elem, <span>typename</span>...OElem, <span>template</span> &lt;<span>typename</span>...&gt; <span>typename</span> B&gt;
<span>requires</span> (tuple_like&lt;B&lt;OElem...&gt;&gt;  &amp;&amp; <span>sizeof</span>...(Elem) == <span>sizeof</span>...(OElem))
<span>auto</span> <span>operator</span>&lt;=&gt;(<span>const</span> tuple&lt;Elem...&gt; &amp; a, <span>const</span> B&lt;OElem...&gt; &amp; b) {
    <span>using</span> ret = common_comparison_category_t&lt;__detail::__synth3way_t&lt;Elem, OElem&gt;...&gt;;
    <span>return</span> [&amp;]&lt;std::size_t... I&gt;(index_sequence&lt;I...&gt;)
    {
        ret c = ret::equivalent;
        <span>// http://eel.is/c++draft/expos.only.func#2
</span><span></span>        <span>return</span>  ((c = synth3way(std::get&lt;I&gt;(a), std::get&lt;I&gt;(b)), c != <span>0</span>) || ...), c;
    }
    (std::make_index_sequence&lt;<span>sizeof</span>...(Elem)&gt;{});
}
</code></pre></div><p>Both these functions will support comparing a tuple to any <em>tuple-like</em> object.
They could be hidden friends, which would improve compile times, if not for the dependency
on <code>std::get</code>.</p>
<p>To implement them, I have used a few C++20 features.
Notably, generic lambdas, which are of the form: <code>[]&lt;_template-parameters_&gt;(){}</code>.
These allow us to unpack the tuple to make use of fold expressions directly in the functions.
Notice also the <code>requires</code> clause.
In the definition of <code>operator&lt;=&gt;</code> a nasty comma expression is used to return when 2
elements compare equal.
I understand this style might appear novel, maybe even scary, but properly documented
it is easier to document than something which relies on a lot of <code>enable_if</code> and other meta-programming heavy
approaches.</p>
<p>Interestingly these functions are not constrained by the standard.</p>
<h2 id="we-cant-have-nice-things">We can’t have nice things</h2>
<p>Using these tricks, I shaved over 700 lines from <code>&lt;tuple&gt;</code>; Almost a third.
And I am sure tons of improvements could still be made.
I probably introduced a few bugs doing this experiment, but I feel like I made the …</p></div></div>

Let’s start at the beginning. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a metric that estimates how much value (usually revenue or profit margin) any given customer will bring to your business over the course of the total time they interact with your brand—past, present, and future.
This course is an introduction to CLV for business analysts, c-suite executives, growth marketers, data scientists, and anyone in between.

<h3>Why Calculate CLV at the Individual Level</h3>
</p>
<p>
The most commonly used customer lifetime value models benchmark their strengths on aggregate statistics. Yet, most business use cases for CLV require accuracy at the individual level. You can see the problem.

<h3>Lookalike Strategies Powered by CLV</h3>
</p>
<p>
Ad platforms allow advertisers to target new users with lookalike audiences. However, the out-of-the-box solution falls short because all of your customers aren’t alike. With customer lifetime value, you can create more effective lookalike audiences for acquisition.

<h3>Optimize Your Marketing Budget</h3>
</p>
<p>
Between acquisition and retention campaigns to content marketing and brand development, it’s difficult to know where to spend your limited marketing dollars. Individual customer lifetime value metrics take the guesswork out of budgeting so you can optimize your spend in real time.

</span>
</p>
<p>
<h3>CLV Migration Over Time</h3>
</p>
<p>
Customer lifetime value is not a static metric. It changes over time—sometimes dramatically—as you observe new data about a customer. By tracking how CLV changes over time, you can determine what product features, retention campaigns, customer service practices, and more impact lifetime value.

</p>
<p>
<h3>Lifecycle Marketing Strategies</h3>
</p>
<p>
Don’t over-optimize your retention strategy; rather, acquire the right customers in the first place. Design a marketing strategy for customers throughout their lifecycle, from acquisition to retention.

<h3>CLV-Driven Product Insights</h3>
</p>
<p>
You can use customer lifetime value metrics to enrich and inform your product marketing strategy. What if you knew which products high-value customers bought first? Or which products you should offer as a bundle or upsell?

<p>For those who are unfamiliar with the term or practice of <strong><em>Fuzz Testing</em></strong>, it’s essentially the combination of testing input validation coupled with stress testing, which is performed by spraying inputs of a target device, application, or system with random and crafted input at high velocity and observing the effects on the target. Use cases can involve testing input forms on a website to ensure it doesn’t accept foreign or script characters or ensuring that IIoT devices are programmed to be functionally robust.</p>



<p>I’ve performed fuzz testing for many web &amp; mobile applications, and even industrial networks and devices. There are common denominators amongst fuzz tests of different technology or hardware stacks that map to higher level processes that translate well across the board and can be universally applied. Many fuzzing frameworks claim to be unified, but are only such when employed in their respective technology silo(s). As someone who works simultaneously in very low <em>and</em> high levels of varying engagements, I tend never to work, research, or experiment in a vacuum. And so the thought of having to find and apply fuzzing frameworks <em>a la carte</em> aggravates the living shit out of me, as It’s an inefficient and misapplied expenditure of effort (i.e. a waste of time).</p>



<p>I wanted to provide something of value that others who need to perform fuzz testing of <em>anything</em> can use from front-to-end, and even build off + flesh out as seen fit by those planning and/or testing. I just wanted to make your life easier. Enjoy!!</p>

September 1, 2020 | https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><img src="https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/fight.jpeg" alt="Fish"></p>
<p>In the early 70s, C was created at Bell Labs as a byproduct of the development of UNIX.
It quickly became one of the most popular programming languages.
But it was not expressive enough for Bjarne Stroustrup.
And so, in 1983, as a byproduct of his Ph.D. thesis, he extended C.</p>
<p>C with classes was born.</p>
<p>At the time, Bjarne Stroustrup understood that a programming language has many components,
not only the language, its compiler, but also a linker and libraries.
Offering a familiar tool also makes adoption easier.
In this historical context, it makes sense that C++ would be based on C.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 40 years later.</p>
<p>Both C and C++ are widely used in the industry.
But go 5 minutes on the Internet and C developers will tell you that C++ is the most horrific man-made creation,
while many C++ developers wait for the day when C finally burns in the hot flames of hell.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-happened">So what happened?</h2>
<p>On the surface, C and C++ cater to the same use cases: high performance, deterministic, native but portable code for the widest range of hardware and applications.</p>
<p>But C is proudly a low-level language. A nicer assembly.</p>
<p>From day one, C++ had magic. Dark witchcraft: destructors. Suddenly the compiler was doing things on its own.
It also had type inference very early on, but the developers of the mid-80s were not quite ready for that and Bjarne Stroustrup
was pressured into removing <code>auto</code>, until it was added back to C++11.</p>
<p>From then, C++ got more and more tools to build abstractions.
I don’t think it would be fair to say that C++ is a low-level or high-level language. It’s both, by design.
But building high-level abstractions while not sacrificing performance is hard.
C++ then needed tools to achieve that: <code>constexpr</code>, move semantics, templates, and an ever-growing standard library.</p>
<p>Fundamentally I think C trusts developers while C++ trusts compilers.
This is a massive difference that sharing the same native types or syntax for while loop cannot hide.</p>
<p>C++ developers blame C for all their lost limbs, while C developers probably think C++ is batshit crazy.
I imagine that is a fair perspective if you look at C++ through a C lense. C++ is pretty wild <em>as a superset of C</em>.
A seasoned C person looking at C++ expecting familiarity in C++ will not find it. C++ is not C.
This is enough to feed flamewars for generations.</p>
<p>But as much as I dislike C, I don’t have any legitimacy to make fun of it. See, I have some experience with C++ but I
wrote very little C. It was probably bad C.
A language is also its good practices, patterns, idioms, and these take years to learn. If you try to write C code like it’s C++ or C++ like it is C, you will have a bad time.
Knowing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWhqhNdYyk">C doesn’t teach you C++</a>. Knowing C++ does not teach you C.</p>
<p>So can we all stop saying C/C++, regret the unfortunate naming, and sing kumbaya in harmony?
Not so fast.</p>
<p>See, despite being philosophically different from C, C++ is still somewhat a superset of C.
That is to say, you can include a C header in a C++ translation unit and that should compile.
And this is where it gets messy.</p>
<p>C++ is not an extension of C.
It is designed as a separate standard, by a different committee, different people.
Logically, people who like C++'s philosophy will get involved in the C++ community and the C++ standardization process
while other people might try to get involved with C.
Committees, whether its C’s or C++'s, only manifest intent and direction through their respective end-product: the standards; standards which are the fruits of numerous voting.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is difficult for a compiler to know that it is dealing with a C header or a C++ header.</p>
<p><code>extern "C"</code> is not used consistently and only affects mangling, but neither grammar nor semantics.
And headers only exists in the eyes of the preprocessor, for a C++ compiler, everything is a C++ translation unit, and therefore C++.
And yet, people include C headers in C++ and expect it to “just work” ™️.
Which it mostly does.</p>
<p>We can wonder then,</p>
<h2 id="how-c-maintains-c-compatibility-while-being-developed-by-different-people-in-different-places">How C++ maintains C compatibility while being developed by different people in different places?</h2>
<p>Badly, I’m afraid.</p>
<p>A coworker recently reminded me of Conway’s law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By that logic, it would stand to reason that if the two committees don’t interoperate,
neither would the languages they produce.</p>
<p>C++ maintains a list of <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.iso">incompatibilities with C</a> and <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.library">its standard library</a>.
This list does not seem to reflect the many features that were added to C11 and C18 but are not valid C++ constructs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibility_of_C_and_C%2B%2B">Wikipedia</a> draws a clearer picture.</p>
<p>Listing incompatibilities isn’t sufficient to get a measure of incompatibilities between both languages.</p>
<p>Functions that exist in the C++ standard library but whose primary declaration is expected to come from C are difficult to make <code>constexpr</code>, and more difficult still to make <code>noexcept</code>.
C compatibility translates to performance costs and C functions are optimization barriers.</p>
<p>Many C constructs are valid C++ but should never pass a code review (<code>NULL</code>, <code>longjmp</code>, <code>malloc</code>, create/destroy functions, <code>free</code>, C  casts), etc.</p>
<p>These might not be bad C idioms, but they are bad C++. C++ has a stronger type system,
and unfortunately using C idioms punch a giant hole in that type system, and so C compatibility has a cost in terms of safety.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, C++ still care about C compatibility. Somewhat.
And interestingly C cares about C++. Somewhat.
Truth be told, C might care about C++ more than C++ cares about C.
So each committee cares somewhat about what the other does.
We care reluctantly.</p>
<p>See, C++ is aware of the many foundational libraries written in C, not only the <code>libc</code> but also <code>zip</code>, <code>png</code>, <code>curl</code>, <code>openssl</code> (!), and countless others, which are used in many, many C++ projects.
We can’t break that.</p>
<p>But recently, especially over the past decade, C++ has become much bigger than C.
C++ has more users - and a much more active community: <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/11/21/">There Are No C Conferences</a>.
Maybe that’s why the C++ committee is now over 10 times the size of the C committee.</p>
<p>C++ then is a force to be reckoned with and the C committee has to consider not breaking C++.
To the point that if a standard would track another, these days, C++ leads and C follow.</p>
<p>C++ is now on a steady three years cycle come rain or shine, or deadly pandemics.
Meanwhile, C has a major release every decade or so.
This makes sense. As a lower-level language, C doesn’t need to evolve as fast.</p>
<p>The C landscape is also rather different from the C++ landscape.
C caters to more platforms and a lot more compilers.
Everybody and their dog is writing C compilers because the language has a surface area small enough to make that possible, whereas the C++ committee will only really consider 4 implementations, all of which are represented at every meeting.
As a result, many features in C are implementation-defined or optionally supported so that the variety of compilers that exist can claim conformance without doing much work, which I’m told pleases regulatory bodies.</p>
<p>C++ these days is more interested in portability than implementation freedom. Yet another difference of philosophy.</p>
<h2 id="so-your-proposal-breaks-c-compatibility">So, your proposal breaks C compatibility</h2>
<p>Parts of my <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2178r1.pdf">P2178</a> paper theoretically affects C compatibility.
In such cases, none of the options seems satisfactory.</p>
<p>You could be told that you have to first get your feature into C. Which means more meetings.
Meetings you might not be able to attend because C has strict <a href="https://thephd.github.io/follow-the-river-wg14-ithaca-2019">attendance rules</a> - Excluding individuals not willing to put down thousands of dollars to become ISO members.
This is because the C committee is forced to adhere strictly to ISO rules.</p>
<p>It might also take a decade if the standard just shipped.
And most importantly, it might go nowhere if the C committee doesn’t understand or doesn’t care about the particular problem you are trying to solve.
And they probably don’t have the bandwidth to deal with it.
And you may not have the bandwidth to deal with C. After all, you joined C++ to improve C++.
In fact, if the room invites you to “talk to the C committee”, it is likely your proposal is dead, even in the unlikely event that no one in the room was against it.</p>
<p>Another likely scenario is that the C committee accepts a version of a proposal that is slightly different from what exists in C++.
<code>true</code>? Let’s make that a macro. <code>char16_t</code> ? Let’s make that a typedef. <code>char32_t</code>? Not necessarily UTF-32. <code>static_assert</code> ? <code>_Static_assert</code>.</p>
<p>The list goes on. Should we blame C? Probably not. Their committee does what they think is best for their language.
The opposite is true too. In C++20 designated initializers were inspired by C’s but are slightly different because they would otherwise not fit with the C++ initialization rules.</p>
<p>I am part of the problem. C has VLAs. I would vote against a proposal to adopt that in standard C++, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-Kills-The-VLA">too many security issues</a>. A proposal to add <code>_Generic</code> to C++ would be over-my-dead-body. I am not sure if <code>_Generic</code> attempts to palliate to the lack of template or the lack of overloads, but C++ has both these features - from my point of view <code>_Generic</code> doesn’t fit into the big picture of what I imagine C++ to be.</p>
<p>Both committees seem also inconsistent in how much they care about the other language.
Sometimes we go to great lenghts (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/complex">std::complex</a>), sometimes we don’t care at all (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/array">static array parameters</a>).</p>
<p>There is no way around this. Don’t forget that each committee is a bunch of people
voting at different times in different rooms and trying to control the outcome would defeat the purpose
of having a vote.
Putting people in the same room is not realistic either. ISO might object and the participation inbalance
would put C people at an enormous disadvantage.</p>
<h2 id="c-compatibility-doesnt-matter-kinda">C compatibility doesn’t matter, kinda</h2>
<p>If you are a C developer, I imagine you see C as a neat programming language.
But for the rest of us, C is something else.</p>
<p>C is the universal, cross-language glue that ties it all together.</p>
<p>For C++ users, C is …</p></div></div>

<p>This is an exploratory post of what extensible unions (a.k.a. polymorphic variants) might look like in Elm. This mainly a post to plant a seed in the minds of the collective Elm community and is not a call to action that they need to be implemented in Elm (although I would really really really love if they were).</p>
<p>One-line headline: I think extensible unions not only fill in a missing abstract corner of Elm’s type system (rather than being a entirely novel extension to its type system), but also solve many real-world problems affecting Elm codebases today, all without compromising and indeed augmenting the Elm compiler’s excellent way of guiding users through refactors.</p>
<p>This post is jumping off a separate post <a href="https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/how-to-represent-many-subsets-of-an-enum/6088/22">here</a> with some folks who were interested in a deeper explanation of extensible unions/polymorphic variants.</p>
<p>This post ended up being <strong>really</strong> long, so I apologize for its length in advance, but I do hope that people find it useful.</p>
<p>Because of its length I’ll just lead off with a high-level summary.</p>
<p>Polymorphic variants or extensible union types are to normal Elm union types (e.g.&nbsp;<code>type MyUnionType = UnionVariant0 | UnionVariant1 | UnionVariant2</code>) what records and extensible records are to normal Elm product types (e.g.&nbsp;<code>type MyProductType = ProductType TypeOfElement0 TypeOfElement1 TypeOfElement2</code>).</p>
<p>As such they allow for many of the same benefits that records and extensible records bring to input types of functions and modularizing Elm models, to output types of functions and modularizing Elm messages and update functions.</p>
<p>This post is split up into the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#what-are-extensible-union-types">What are extensible union types</a>: A introduction to some pseudo-Elm to help familiarize people with what extensible unions are. If you already know what extensible unions/polymorphic variants are you can skip this. <strong>The crucial take away is that we already have the equivalent of extensible unions for products, i.e.&nbsp;extensible records. This is just filling in a hole for current union types.</strong></li>
<li><a href="#what-are-the-benefits-of-extensible-unions">What are the benefits of extensible unions (the basics)</a>: Walking through some basic, contrived cases where extensible unions can come in handy.</li>
<li><a href="#everyday-elm-cases">Everyday Elm cases</a>: A non-exhaustive list of case studies of where extensible unions can help in code you’re likely to see in real Elm codebases.
<ul>
<li>Reminding you when you forget certain output cases for decoding</li>
<li>Unifying different error types</li>
<li>Modular Elm code: Unifying NoMap, OutMsg, and Translator</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="#drawbacks">Drawbacks and things-you-might-think-are-drawbacks-but-aren’t (a.k.a. literature review of other implementations)</a>: A dive into some cons and not-really-cons of extensible unions as well as how they’re implemented in other languages (mainly OCaml).</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s begin with a very short primer on union (a.k.a. sum types) and product types. We’ll approach them individually even though in Elm we can mix and match them together in a single type declaration. This hopefully will make some of the later presentation of extensible union types a little easier to follow.</p>
<p>Union types are those types that express an “or” relationship among its type constructors.</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span>-- MyColor is Red *or* Green *or* Blue</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a><span>type</span> <span>MyColor</span> <span>=</span> <span>Red</span> <span>|</span> <span>Green</span> <span>|</span> <span>Blue</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Product types are those types that express an “and” relationship in its (single) type constructor.</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>-- MyUserType is a MyUser that consists of a String *and* another String (maybe</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a><span>-- a first and last name)</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a><span>type</span> <span>MyUserType</span> <span>=</span> <span>MyUser</span> <span>String</span> <span>String</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>These two kinds of types are dual, i.e.&nbsp;complements, to one another, where you’ll see each of them playing “opposite” roles in a lot of circumstances. We’ve already seen one example here, whereas a union type can have multiple type constructors, only one of which can be used at any given time for a single value (i.e.&nbsp;only one of <code>Red</code>, <code>Green</code>, or <code>Blue</code> can be in use for a single value of type <code>MyColor</code>), a product type has a single constructor with multiple fields, all of which must be filled in for a single value (for any value of <code>MyUserType</code> both strings must be provided to <code>MyUser</code>). Notice the inverted relationship between multiple and single between the two (i.e. multiple type constructors vs single type constructor and single variant in use vs multiple fields must all be filled in). This sort of “dual” inversion will show up a lot more later on.</p>
<p>Even though the two are complements to one another, statically typed programming languages in general seem to favor product types over union types. You see this with languages like Java that allow for the creation of product types (i.e.&nbsp;Java classes), but have no union types. Statically typed FP languages such as Elm address this imbalance by also allowing union types. This unlocks a host of data modeling goodies and is the core of how Elm allows us to create “correct by construction” models that make errors unrepresentable.</p>
<p>Elm, however, goes further than some other statically typed FP languages and bestows more power to product types through record types and extensible record types. These essentially are product types on steroids. To see that records are fundamentally product types, note that you could in theory replace every record type with a product type, it’d just make for really annoying code because all of a sudden your fields are all anonymous and position-based.</p>
<p>However, Elm, in a fashion that somewhat echoes Java’s choice to disadvantage union types, doesn’t provide equivalent power to union types. The rest of this post is an exploration in what that might look like if Elm did.</p>
<p>To understand the relationship between extensible union types and normal union types, it’s perhaps illuminating to first consider the relationship between record types and normal product types.</p>
<p>Notice that Elm records differ from Elm’s normal product types by being</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Structural: Normal product types in Elm are nominal, that is name-based. Every product type you use must have been declared somewhere and is given an explicit, unique name that is used for typechecking. On the other hand record types are anonymous. Though they can be given a name with <code>type alias</code> that name is non-canonical (the same record type can be given multiple different names) and plays no role in typechecking. In other words <em>the structure of a record type is all that matters to the type checker, not its name.</em></li>
<li>Extensible: Normal product type signatures must specify all possible fields it supports. Extensible records only need to specify a subset of fields and then leave the others unspecified.</li>
</ol>
<p>Just to make this clear, here are the three versions of a product type that Elm supports at the current moment.</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span>-- Normal Elm product type</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a><span>type</span> <span>SomeProductType</span> <span>=</span> <span>ProductTypeConstructor</span> <span>Int</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4"></a><span>-- Normal Elm record, notice the type alias rather than type</span></span>
<span id="cb3-5"><a href="#cb3-5"></a><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>SomeRecord</span> <span>=</span> { <span>field0</span> : <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>field1</span> : <span>String</span> }</span>
<span id="cb3-6"><a href="#cb3-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb3-7"><a href="#cb3-7"></a><span>-- Extensible Elm record, notice the type variable</span></span>
<span id="cb3-8"><a href="#cb3-8"></a><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>ExtensibleRecord</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> { <span>a</span> <span>|</span> <span>field0</span> : <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>field1</span> : <span>String</span> }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Extensible union types introduce these two features, namely making a type structural and extensible, to union types. I find actual code to often be hepful here, so I’m going to introduce some hypothetical Elm syntax here.</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>-- Normal Elm sum type</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a><span>type</span> <span>User0</span> <span>=</span> <span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span> <span>|</span> <span>AdminUser</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4"></a><span>-- Hypothetical extensible union type, again note that this is a type alias</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5"></a><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>User1</span> <span>=</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>AdminUser</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6"><a href="#cb4-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-7"><a href="#cb4-7"></a><span>-- Hypothetical extensible union type actually using the extensible portion,</span></span>
<span id="cb4-8"><a href="#cb4-8"></a><span>-- note the type variable</span></span>
<span id="cb4-9"><a href="#cb4-9"></a><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>User2</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>AdminUser</span> <span>String</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s go over <code>User1</code> and <code>User2</code> in more detail. Names prefixed with a an <code>@</code> symbol such as <code>@RegularUser</code> are extensible union tags. These play an analogous role to field names in a record type. That is <code>@RegularUser Int</code> is an independent type in the same way <code>{ field0 : Int }</code> is an independent type, rather than just a value like <code>RegularUser Int</code>.</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span>@</span><span>SomeVariantTag</span> <span>MyType</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a><span>^</span> <span>tag</span> <span>name</span>      <span>^</span> <span>tagged</span> <span>type</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4"></a>{ <span>recordField</span> : <span>MyType</span> }</span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5"></a>  <span>^</span> <span>tag</span> <span>name</span>    <span>^</span> <span>tagged</span> <span>type</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Likewise, just like record field names can be used as the value level to directly create a value, extensible union tags can be used at the value level to directly create a value.</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>someRegularUser</span> : <span>User1</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a><span>-- Equivalently</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3"></a><span>-- someRegularUser : @RegularUser Int or @AdminUser String</span></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><a href="#cb6-4"></a><span>-- or</span></span>
<span id="cb6-5"><a href="#cb6-5"></a><span>-- someRegularUser : @AdminUser String or @RegularUser Int</span></span>
<span id="cb6-6"><a href="#cb6-6"></a><span>-- Notice just like for record fields the order doesn't matter</span></span>
<span id="cb6-7"><a href="#cb6-7"></a><span>-- This is different from a normal sum type where Result String Int is</span></span>
<span id="cb6-8"><a href="#cb6-8"></a><span>-- different from Result Int String</span></span>
<span id="cb6-9"><a href="#cb6-9"></a><span>someRegularUser</span> <span>=</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we could also have assigned this type</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a><span>someOtherRegularUser</span> : <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2"></a><span>someOtherRegularUser</span> <span>=</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>or</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1"></a><span>lotsOfIrrelevantVariants</span> : <span>@</span><span>Blah</span> <span>String</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>Blahblah</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2"></a><span>lotsOfIrrelevantVariants</span> <span>=</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>For now let’s leave aside why all these type signatures work other than to hand-wave it and say they all make sense if you think of “or”. We’ll return to that in just a bit when we look close at extensible types. Instead, let’s look at how to actually work with extensible unions.</p>
<p>Fundamentally the only thing you can do with a product type is pull out its fields. On the flip side, fundamentally the only thing you can do with a union type is pattern match on its variants with a case statement.</p>
<p>This remains true for extensible unions, which have their own associated case statement for pattern matching on them, introduced by <code>case#</code> instead of <code>case</code> (you could unify them as a single <code>case</code> statement, but I’m separating them for clarity here).</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span>toInt</span> : <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>AdminUser</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>

September 1, 2020 | https://www.neoaxis.com/news/neoaxis_engine_2020_5_released | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.neoaxis.com/news/neoaxis_engine_2020_5_released">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div>
          <div><p>NeoAxis company releases a new version of NeoAxis Engine, an integrated development environment with built-in 3D and 2D game engine. The environment can be used to develop all kinds of 3D and 2D projects such as computer games, visual trainers, VR systems, to visualize processes and develop windowed applications.</p>
<p>In this release, the engine has been translated to .NET Core 3.1 from .NET Framework, has been added support for Visual Studio Code, Rider and other C# IDEs, the editor has been improved and optimized, in the launcher you can now create Window App projects, also examples of creating add-ons have been added to the Assets\Samples\Addons folder.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.neoaxis.com/images/2020_5/NeoAxis_2020_5_ScifiDemo.png"><img src="https://www.neoaxis.com/images/2020_5/NeoAxis_2020_5_ScifiDemo.jpg" alt="" width="900"></a></p>
<h2>.NET Core 3.1</h2>
<p>In this release, the engine was upgraded to .NET Core 3.1, previously .NET Framework 4.6 was used. This gave a performance improvement. The engine and editor are noticeably faster. Now the created application does not require .NET installation, it is included into the project. It is also now easy to update the project to newer versions of .NET such as .NET 5.</p>
<h2>Support for Visual Studio Code, Rider and other C# IDEs</h2>
<p>Project compilation is now supported using any IDE that supports C# and .NET Core 3.1.</p>
<h2>Window app creation</h2>
<p>The ability to create windowed applications has been improved. When creating a new project, you can choose a Window App template, with which you can set the initial settings. The engine includes its own GUI system and GUI designer. This allows you to create full-fledged windowed applications, however, creating of windowed applications is still a new feature of NeoAxis.</p>

        Zstandard is a real-time compression algorithm,
        providing high compression ratios.
        It offers a very wide range of compression / speed trade-off,
        while being backed by a very fast decoder (see <a href="#benchmarks">benchmarks</a> below).
        It also offers a special mode for small data, called <a href="#small-data">dictionary compression</a>,
        and can create dictionaries from any sample set.
        Zstandard library is provided as open source software using a BSD license.

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>What happens when a conservative and a liberal decide to jump in an old Volvo and drive nearly 20,000 miles through 44 states across the U.S.? That’s the question at the heart of a new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Union-Democrat-Republican-Search-Common/dp/0316423793" rel=" noopener"><em><span>Union: A Democrat, a Republican, and a Search for Common Ground</span></em></a>, by Jordan Blashek and Christopher Haugh.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Chris and Jordan’s search for common ground despite their political differences is a mission that aligns well with The Factual. So I was delighted to sit down with them a few weeks ago to see if their road trip revealed insights that may be useful to all of us grappling with an <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/"><span>increasingly polarized society</span></a>. Here are five excerpts from our <a href="https://bookpassage.extendedsession.com/session/jordan-blashek-chris-haugh/#registermodalheader"><span>fascinating conversation</span></a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e24da16992bfa6b6c3185d6/5e2641e4edc1c820dd1651f9_img-portrait-605KB.png" alt="5e2641e4edc1c820dd1651f9_img-portrait-605KB" width="2000"></p>
<h6><strong>You had many arguments on the road. Did you ever feel like throwing in the towel and saying this road trip was a bad idea?</strong></h6>
<p><strong>Jordan:</strong> I’m pretty sure Chris feels that way every time we have these arguments! I’m the combative one and love instigating our arguments. We have definitely had these moments. But over time we learned where our limits are and were respectful of them.</p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> We were lucky that our first argument was in a car, hundreds of miles away from the closest town. When you’re in the midst of one of those fights and suddenly one person says “I’m done,” he can’t really get out of the car. Something about being forced together taught us this lesson of coming back to the table and how important that is.</p>
<p>We were forced to go through this thought process of: “Oh my God, I can’t believe I’m here. I can’t believe I’m with him. I can’t believe he said that.” Then you start to think, “well, maybe I shouldn’t have said that one thing. And maybe he had a point about that one thing.” You start to go through a full-circle process. And that first fight ended with “I love you, man. I’m still angry and we haven’t resolved this. But I’m committed to this project and friendship.”&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>At the end of this trip, Chris said “I’m still a Democrat” and Jordan said “I’m still a Republican.” So what changed for you two on this trip?</strong></h6>
<p><strong>Jordan:</strong> For both of us two things have changed. One is personal to ourselves and the other is our views of the country.</p>
<p>When we started out on this trip I was the optimist. I was sure that wherever we went we’d find signs that America was strong, healthy, and vibrant. That the American people were good. And that it would be evident everywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And Chris was more of a skeptic based on what he was hearing in the news and the data about various parts of American life. There would be signs of America coming apart and there would be signs of decay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the course of three road trips, it changed both our views. In the end, Chris saw a lot of what led to my optimism and it made him view the country differently and I also saw a lot of the structural problems that Chris was worried about and it tempered my optimism.</p>
<p>On an individual level, having these individual conversations and fights and figuring out how our friendship can navigate that made us deeper people. We developed more empathy for the other side. We found blind spots in our own views and politics. And though we didn’t switch parties or change our beliefs it made our beliefs more rigorous and gave us the ability to see the world through other people’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> I like to say that Jordan has made me a better liberal, and I think Jordan says the same about my impact on his conservatism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes we don’t muster all the right evidence or are not aware of our blind spots, and our friends who think the same way we do are incapable of pointing them out. [When you engage with someone who has different beliefs] you’re able to refresh your arguments, have these moments of crisis, and come back stronger. Sometimes that means moderation, sometimes it means we become more radical. But hopefully, we become better citizens as a result.</p>
<h6><strong>A lot of your book is about a very diverse and memorable set of people you met on the road. For both of you, who was the most impactful person you met?</strong></h6>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> Someone who’s a friend of mine these days is Pete Mylen. He’s a trucker from Daytona Beach, Florida who’s been on the road for 40 years. When we met him he had a Make America Great Again shirt, but we quickly realized he’s far more complex than that shirt might indicate.</p>
<p>The first time we brought up politics Pete said, “You know, I support the president but I really wish he’d talk more about climate change.” This coming from a guy driving a diesel truck at 80 miles an hour!&nbsp;</p>
<p>He went from there to talk about his faith, his support for LGBTQ marriage — all these policy ideas and values that I wouldn’t have necessarily associated with someone who wore a MAGA shirt four out of the five days we were with him. He really taught us how hard it is to look at someone and say “I know who that person is.” If you don’t actually talk to them, if you don’t actually engage with them, you don’t get to know what they actually think because oftentimes it’s easy to ascribe values to someone without looking more deeply into them.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan:</strong> For me, it was this man Gabriel, who was in <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/corrections/0,4551,7-119-68854_1381_1388-5339--,00.html" rel=" noopener">Parnall prison</a>. After our time with Pete, we did another road trip where we wanted to explore this idea of redemption. We believe that America is built on this idea of second chances, it’s a uniquely American value that pervades our ethos. And yet we had heard that the criminal justice system is a place where this might be out of sync with our ideal.</p>
<p>So in Detroit, we met this Shakespeare ensemble of 30 men from prison who were performing King Lear, and we were going to have a discussion on redemption afterward. And this one guy, Gabriel, is just throwing himself into the play, acting with all his energy. He’s interpreting everything with so much depth that Chris and I were in awe of his talent and his drive to better himself. Afterward, he talked about what it means to take personal responsibility and the a-ha moment that it takes to do something better with your life. He’s on my mind now because Parnall prison has been hit pretty hard by Covid and it’s a reminder that these men are in a really hard situation and are suffering. But I’m also thinking about the amount of talent and will Gabriel has, but knowing the barriers he’s going to face . . . really tugs at my heart.&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>My favorite line in the book is “we are at our worst when we speak for a flag or a group.” Can you expand on that?</strong></h6>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Union-Democrat-Republican-Search-Common/dp/0316423793" rel=" noopener"><img src="https://images.booksense.com/images/793/423/9780316423793.jpg" alt="9780316423793" width="258"></a>Chris:</strong> This was a phenomenon we found over and over again. When we argue on behalf of people we had never met or groups whose policies we don’t always agree with, like the Democratic or Republican party, or a media organization like <em>The Times</em>, we were at our worst. Because we felt we had to be these two-dimensional figures because we had to defend these groups that we didn’t know all that well. And you’re searching for the talking points and trying to win because it’s almost like you have this symbol or value that represents good and the other person represents bad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when we were able to get away from that, when we were able to speak as other identities, just Jordan and Chris, conversations were about getting to the bottom of things.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan: </strong>I think it’s very unproductive when we’re speaking on behalf of our parties and defending things that might not necessarily align fully with our own beliefs. I think there’s a counterpart to it which is another way of engaging is through loyalty tests — “do you agree with x?” And if I say no then all of a sudden I’m not on your side anymore. It’s all about figuring out which tribe are you part of. Chris and I found that whenever we engaged in a way that seemed to say “if you disagree with me then you’re in that box and that box has bad things associated with it,” it led to more defensive arguments because now a bad association is leveled on me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the last few years I’ve had to face this question of “Do you support Donald Trump?” And the implication is that if you do then you’re a bad person. But it doesn’t get to the nuance that there are some things he does that I agree with, some things he does that I don’t agree with, and some things I probably hate. But putting it as a binary context puts me into a bind. So over time we moved away from thinking like that.</p>
<h6><strong>Do you think we talk about politics too much as a society?</strong></h6>
<p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Yes, absolutely. Politics has become everything. As Chris and I found, outside the glare of the cameras and political rhetoric the people we met were good people. We were able to connect at this very human level. Politics is all about line drawing. If you’re on this side of the line, you’re on my team. If you’re on that side of the line, you’re my enemy. So the fact that politics has invaded every aspect of life today, it’s not healthy. It’s what drives our intense polarization. It’s making us angrier and testier and doesn’t allow for the cultivation of friendship, grace, love, compassion, empathy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

In general, there are a variety of options that are commonly used to implement this type of requirements, which typically fall into two categories: <br>1). Two separate UIs (one public app and the other one only accessible by admins)<br>2). Restrict the application pages/sections based on the users’ permissions.</p><p id="6c6a">I recently came across a situation while implementing a health care web application, where we had a bunch of UI components that were intended to be utilized from both medical personnel (admins) views as well as from the patients’ UI, so the second approach of the aforementioned ones made the most sense in that case.</p><p id="101d">One important issue we happen to have, however, was that even though we’ve got a lot of generic React components to be used across the entire app, a massive amount of them was not being rendered in all the pages our users were supposed to be interacting with, meaning that they’d end up downloading a <em>bundle.js </em>file containing lots of unneeded fragments of code. If a patient is <em>simply</em> filling out a form to schedule a doctor’s appointment, they won’t need the huge Google Maps component to locate the clinics they went to before, which might be only required by navigating to the <strong>/previousAppointments</strong> route for example.<br>So the idea is quite simple, just don’t have the users download code until they need it.</p><p id="4fe2">Now, you might be thinking that something like this would do the trick:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="f6b4">If you’re familiar with JavaScript and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ES modules</a> it wouldn’t take you so long to figure out that the above naive approach is not going to work, since by definition the modules are static, and therefore we must declare what we’re importing/exporting at compile-time, not at run time. In other words, they may only be specified at the top level of the files and not in other places such as an <em>if</em> statement.</p><p id="7003">That being said, let’s pretend for a moment that the above conditionally imported module worked. Can you think of any benefits of doing so? Certainly, instead of having to load all the application modules/components up-front, we’d be allowed to import them on demand depending on what page our visitors are at any given time, so that’d be a reasonable approach towards only downloading code the user requires.</p><p id="7676">Chances are you don’t care about IE11 anymore. But in our case, IE11 support was a must. So we concluded that if we ever find out a way to get the modules loaded conditionally, we might apply the same idea to execute legacy code <strong>only</strong> when the IE11 users landed on our web.</p><h2 id="1885">Dynamic EcmaScript modules to the rescue</h2><p id="367a">It turns out that there is a way to overcome the above-described issue: using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#Dynamic_Imports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dynamic</a> <em>import()</em> syntax. The difference with the normal import is that instead of using it as we’d normally do, we use it <strong>like </strong>a function that returns a promise — although <code>import()</code> looks like a function call, it is not actually, it’s a special syntax that just happens to use parentheses similar to <code>super()</code>.<br>Using this expression, we can load the module and return a promise that resolves into a module object that contains all of its exports. Getting back to our example, it would be something like:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="e8c8">We can even use <em>await</em> if the <em>import</em> statement were inside an <em>async</em> function:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="fcb5">One thing to be aware of, though, is that this syntax is not officially added to the EcmaScript specification yet, and at the time of this writing it’s in <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stage 4 of the process</a>. If you’re using <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Create React App</a> it’s already supported by default, otherwise, you just need to install a babel plugin named <code>plugin-syntax-dynamic-import</code></p><pre><span id="2a9e">npm install — save-dev @babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import</span></pre><p id="e59f">and then use it in the <code>.babelrc</code> configuration file:</p><pre><span id="9713">{ "plugins": ["@babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import"] }</span></pre><p id="f653">OK so now that we all know how to import modules dynamically, you might be wondering how to use this knowledge with React, and consequently, where should we split our application at? Well, there are a couple of approaches to address this question:</p><ol><li id="d3cd">Route level splitting</li><li id="a560">Component level splitting</li></ol><h2 id="21e7">Route level splitting</h2><p id="f42a">This is the most popular way when it comes to code splitting our app. Assuming you have some experience with any kind of routing tools, this should feel pretty natural after all, isn’t it? So this is where the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>React.lazy</em></a><em> </em>function comes into play. It accepts a function which must call the dynamic import, and returns a promise which resolves to a module with a <em>default</em> export containing a React component. This means that we don’t need to render the lazily loaded component by ourselves, instead, we render what <em>React.lazy</em> returns and it’ll take care of actually rendering the component.<br>Let’s take a look at how this would look like — I’m using <a href="https://reach.tech/router/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reach-router</a> instead of the typical React Router, but it shouldn’t make any difference for this example:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="d3ff">And that’s all that it takes to code split our app at the route level. In the snippet, we’re just dynamically importing the <strong><em>PreviousAppointments</em></strong> route component, but we can also use the same approach on the other two routes if we wanted to. Below is the output when we build our app — <code>yarn run build</code> or <code>npm run build</code> depending on what the package manager of your choice is.</p><pre><span id="57f0">Asset                 Size       Chunks</span><span id="7475">app.91ac87d5.js       114  KiB   0 [emitted] <br>1.19z8duj4.chunk.js   7.97 KiB   1 [emitted] <br>vendors.j8z7cn1q.js   869  KiB   2 [emitted]</span></pre><p id="37a8">You’ll get one <code>chunk</code> file per each dynamic <code>import()</code> in the app.</p><p id="5d15">What if we wanted to show some content to the users while the components are being loaded dynamically? That’s what the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-suspense.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>React.Suspense</em></a> component is used for. Anytime we want to import dynamic components we can wrap them all into a <code>Suspense</code> instance and pass it a <code>fallback</code> prop which is a React element that is rendered <strong>until</strong> all of its children’s components get successfully loaded. Now let’s give it a shot at Suspense by turning all of our routes into dynamic components and passing it a <code>&lt;Loading /&gt;</code> element as a fallback:</p><figure><div></div></figure><h2 id="1dee">Component level splitting</h2><p id="1003">Code splitting your application at the routes level might represent a significant improvement in terms of the size of files that webpack builds out, so you may consider it as good enough in a few cases. However, there is still a more granular way of dynamically importing code in React — at the Component level.<br>Inside a single component, you might need to render a child component based on a certain state. Assuming our <code>Map</code> component is tremendously heavy, we can get it loaded <em>if and only if</em> it’s necessary — so we’d first show a button to the users and if they want to get the Map functionality in place on the current page then they can click on it to load the component based on that action.<br>At a glance, it might sound a little bit tricky to achieve, but in practice, it’s pretty straightforward:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="6d43">As you might have seen, there’s one small caveat in the above code.<br>If the module we’re dynamically importing is using ES modules (export default), it’ll have a <code>.default</code> property; this is only the case for ES modules, meaning that if the module is using commonjs (module.exports), it won’t.</p><p id="6499">Besides the dynamic <em>import()</em> proposal, another common approach to performing code splitting in client-side JavaScript is using the <code>require.ensure</code> method from webpack, but as stated in their <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/#dynamic-imports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docs</a> the <em>import() </em>syntax should be preferred.</p><h2 id="fe43">Final thoughts</h2><p id="e534">A big gain we got in our application was the fact that we managed to optimize the bundles’ sizes since each of them ended up including only the sufficient modules/components depending on the type of users coming through the portal.</p><p id="86b4">React <code>lazy</code> and <code>Suspense</code> is definitely not a good fit if you’re using server-side rendering (SSR) in your project as this is not supported yet — I believe that might be one of the primary reasons for which those are still experimental features and are not included as part of the stable version of React. For SSR needs, React recommends a library named <a href="https://github.com/gregberge/loadable-components" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Loadable Components</a>. It has a nice <a href="https://loadable-components.com/docs/server-side-rendering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guide for bundle splitting with server-side rendering</a>.</p><p id="a68a">Another advantage of using code splitting was the ability to exclude administrative code for regular users to hide potentially sensitive data, which is a must while developing health care applications.</p><p id="36bc">Last but not least, be careful and use dynamic imports only when it makes sense. The static form is preferable for loading initial dependencies and can benefit more readily from static analysis tools and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tree shaking</a>.</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

    <p>When we think about commitments, we think about couples making
commitment to their relationship, group of talented and enthusiastic
people committed to <a href="https://minnatechnologies.com/about/">bringing power to the morden
consumers</a>, or a country
pledged to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXqlziZV63k">land a man to the moon and return him safely on
earth</a>. It is an
obligation of being dedicated to a cause, activity or entity; a
process of focusing on something with neccessary resources at the
expense of oppurtunity cost. It is <a href="https://www.sparkpeople.com/mypage_public_journal_individual.asp?blog_id=2925515">what transforms a promise
into
reality</a>.</p>

<p>I always have this mental image when I think about commitment: a
bigger, fluffier and unstructured space being mapped to a smaller,
clearer and structured space. It is about less, not more. It is
about making specific, irrevocable choices instead of leaving the
options open. Even though commitment takes hard work and perseverance,
many studies seem to suggest that it is a major factor for
happiness. Actually, being happy itself is something that we can
commit to as well.</p>

<p>As programmers, we must be the subset of human beings that has
the most intimacy towards the concept of commitments since we do <em>git
commit</em> basically everyday. When we commit code, knowledge from a much
larger and fluid space are transformed to a specific
format stored on disk. We even get an id for this, called a
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29106996/what-is-a-git-commit-id">commit
id</a>. The
commit id is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">SHA-1</a> hash,
which is in fact a crypographic commitment to a bunch of things, such
as the content of the file, commit date, commit message, id of the
previous commit, etc. When the hash is being created, information from a much larger
space is mapped to a space with only 160 bits, which is still really,
really huge, but theoretically speaking there exists infinite number of
<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-preimages-in-the-context-of-cryptographic-hash-functions">preimages</a>
for any hash values.</p>

<p>The trick of a “good” hash function is to make
sure that the likelihood of finding another preimage that can be
hashed to the same value is astronomically low, otherwise the
cryptographic commitment is broken. This property is
called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_resistance">collision
resistence</a>. If we are being
objective, isn’t that the case for all types of commitments? Last time
I checked,
<a href="https://www.wf-lawyers.com/divorce-statistics-and-facts/">50%</a> of the
marriages in the United States will end in divorce. As much as we want
to romanticize it, it doesn’t change the fact that commitment is a game
of probabilities.</p>

<p>In cryptography, hash function can be thought of as a member in a bigger
family called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme">commitment
scheme</a>, which “allows
one to commit to a chosen value (or chosen statement) while keeping it
hidden to others, with the ability to reveal the committed value
later.” Hash can be thought of as one way to commit to static information. As
it turns out, we can create commitment to dynamic program as well, for
example, using <a href="http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/techreports/2010/cacr2010-10.pdf">polynomial
commitment</a>. This
allows verifier who has this commitment to check if a claimed
evaluation of original program is valid. Under the hood, it is the same
probabilities game. Even though theoretically there might be infinite
number of programs that could produce the same commitment, the
likelihood of you happen to convince the verifier with another program
is astronomically small. Polynomial commitment at the core of many Zero
knowledge proofs (ZKP) systems, which has the potential to really help
us improve our current privacy situation.</p>

<p>Hash is my favourite cryptographic primitives. From user’s
perspective, it is simple, it is post quantum resistant, it is easy to
use. To the extent where people just take it for granted. I have a
strong believe that ZKP will make a great impact in the years to
come. It is fair to say that crypographic commitment makes the world a
better place and improve the collective happiness of human beings,
just like any other commitment we made in our lives.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      
      <p>Last year AWS released a new iteration of their API Gateway product: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api.html">HTTP APIs</a>. This new version promises lower prices, improved performance and some new features. Some features that are available in the older REST API are not (yet) available for HTTP APIs, though. The official <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-vs-rest.html">comparison page</a> gives a good overview of which features are available in both products.</p>
<p>My favorite new feature available for HTTPs APIs is <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-jwt-authorizer.html">JWT Authorizers</a>. It is now possible to have the HTTP API validate a JWT coming from an OIDC or OAuth 2.0 provider. While this was already possible using a Lambda Authorizer, now this can be achieved in a fully managed way with only a minimum amount of work required. It's even easier now to build secure APIs with proper authentication.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I'll create an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html">Amazon Cognito User Pool</a> with a test user and authenticate to an HTTP API using a JWT issued by Cognito. You can find the fully working code in my <a href="https://github.com/SanderKnape/cognito-apigateway-jwt">GitHub repository</a>. Below I'll go through the code and explain it step by step.</p>
<h2 id="creating-the-cognito-user-pool">Creating the Cognito User Pool</h2>
<p>The following CloudFormation creates a User Pool and a User Pool Client:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">UserPool:
  Type: AWS::Cognito::UserPool
  Properties:
    AutoVerifiedAttributes:
      - email
    UsernameAttributes:
      - email
    UserPoolName: cognito-apigateway

UserPoolClient:
  Type: AWS::Cognito::UserPoolClient
  Properties:
    ClientName: cognito-apigateway
    ExplicitAuthFlows:
      - ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH
      - ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH
    UserPoolId: !Ref UserPool
</code></pre></div><p>This code provisions a User Pool that accepts the user's e-mail address as the username. In addition, the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-client-apps.html">User Pool App Client</a> is required as we need an entity that is allowed to make API calls to our user pool (such as signing in).</p>
<h2 id="creating-the-http-api">Creating the HTTP API</h2>
<p>The following CloudFormation sets up the HTTP API with the JWT Authorizer:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">HttpApi:
  Type: AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Api
  Properties:
    Name: cognito-apigateway
    ProtocolType: HTTP

HttpApiAuthorizer:
  Type: AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Authorizer
  Properties:
    ApiId: !Ref HttpApi
    AuthorizerType: JWT
    IdentitySource:
      - <span>"$request.header.Authorization"</span>
    JwtConfiguration:
      Audience:
        - !Ref UserPoolClient
      Issuer: !Sub <span>"https://cognito-idp.${AWS::Region}.amazonaws.com/${UserPool}"</span>
    Name: JwtAuthorizer

HttpApiIntegration:
  Type: AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Integration
  Properties:
    ApiId: !Ref HttpApi
    IntegrationMethod: GET
    IntegrationType: HTTP_PROXY
    IntegrationUri: https://www.wikipedia.org/
    PayloadFormatVersion: <span>1.0</span>

HttpApiRoute:
  Type: AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Route
  Properties:
    ApiId: !Ref HttpApi
    AuthorizationType: JWT
    AuthorizerId: !Ref HttpApiAuthorizer
    RouteKey: GET /
    Target: !Sub <span>"integrations/${HttpApiIntegration}"</span>

HttpApiStage:
  Type: AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Stage
  Properties:
    ApiId: !Ref HttpApi
    AutoDeploy: <span>true</span>
    StageName: $default
</code></pre></div><p>This code sets up an HTTP API with a single GET route that forwards all requests to the Wikipedia homepage. The route is configured to use the JWT Authorizer. This authorizer expects the token to be present under the <code>Authorization</code> header, optionally prefixed with <code>Bearer</code> to conform to the formal specification. You can however use any header you want and omit the <code>Bearer</code> prefix altogether.</p>
<p>We also configure the authorizer to require the ID of the User Pool Client to match either the audience (<code>aud</code>) or the <code>client_id</code> entry in the token. We then set the required issuer to the URL of the User Pool; we can now be sure we only accept tokens issued by our User Pool.</p>
<h2 id="authenticating-with-the-http-api">Authenticating with the HTTP API</h2>
<p>To test the authentication, we first need to gather some details from the resources we just created.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ID of the User Pool. You can find this at the top of the homepage of your User Pool.</li>
<li>The ID of the User Pool Client. When in the Cognito User Pool UI, click “App clients” on the left. The ID we're looking for is the <code>App client id</code>.</li>
<li>The URL of the HTTP API. You can find this on the homepage of your API under “Invoke URL”.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll test the JWT authentication using some bash scripts. Let's first set the above values as variables in addition to fake credentials for our test user:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">EMAIL<span>=</span>fake@example.com
PASSWORD<span>=</span>S3cure!!

CLIENT_ID<span>=</span>&lt;client_id&gt;
POOL_ID<span>=</span>&lt;pool_id&gt;
API_URL<span>=</span>&lt;api_url&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Next, we first properly add a user to the user pool. This is just required for this demo to test the functionality.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">aws cognito-idp sign-up <span>\
</span><span></span>  --client-id <span>${</span>CLIENT_ID<span>}</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  --username <span>${</span>EMAIL<span>}</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  --password <span>${</span>PASSWORD<span>}</span>

aws cognito-idp admin-confirm-sign-up <span>\
</span><span></span>  --user-pool-id <span>${</span>POOL_ID<span>}</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  --username <span>${</span>EMAIL<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We now authenticate with this user and store the returned JWT:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">TOKEN<span>=</span><span>$(</span>aws cognito-idp initiate-auth <span>\
</span><span></span>    --client-id <span>${</span>CLIENT_ID<span>}</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>    --auth-flow USER_PASSWORD_AUTH <span>\
</span><span></span>    --auth-parameters USERNAME<span>=</span><span>${</span>EMAIL<span>}</span>,PASSWORD<span>=</span><span>${</span>PASSWORD<span>}</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>    --query <span>'AuthenticationResult.AccessToken'</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>    --output text<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Finally, we perform a <code>curl</code> request on our API using the token we just retrieved:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">curl -s -D - -o /dev/null -H <span>"</span><span>Authorization: Bearer </span><span>${</span>TOKEN<span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>${</span>API_URL<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This command only displays the returned headers, not the body. The header should show a 200 status code, meaning that we properly authenticated with the API. If you run this script without the token - or open the URL in your browser - you will get a 401 Unauthorized response instead. As expected! The API is only accessible with a valid, non-expired JWT from an authenticated user.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this post I went through the steps required to authenticate to an HTTP API with a JWT issued by AWS Cognito. Keep in mind that you can use this method with any OIDC identity provider that issues JWTs. Considering the simplicity in setting this up and the fact that no maintenance is required to keep it up and running, this is certainly an approach to consider when building authenticated APIs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
        We present a simple and effective deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model for video deblurring. The proposed algorithm mainly consists of optical flow estimation from intermediate latent frames and latent frame restoration steps. It first develops a deep CNN model to estimate optical flow from intermediate latent frames and then restores the latent frames based on the estimated optical flow. To better explore the temporal information from videos, we develop a temporal sharpness prior to constrain the deep CNN model to help the latent frame restoration. We develop an effective cascaded training approach and jointly train the proposed CNN model in an end-to-end manner. We show that exploring the domain knowledge of video deblurring is able to make the deep CNN model more compact and efficient. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark datasets as well as real-world videos.
      </p><p>
        The proposed algorithm contains the optical flow estimation module, latent image restoration module, and the temporal sharpness prior. For the optical flow estimation, we use the PWC-Net [5] to estimate optical flow. For the latent image restoration module, we use an encoder-decoder architecture based on [26]. However, we do not use the ConvLSTM module. Other network architectures are the same as [26].
      </p><p>
        To effectively train the proposed algorithm, we develop a cascaded training approach and jointly train the proposed model in an end-to-end manner. At each stage, it takes three adjacent frames estimated from the previous stage as the input and generates the deblurred results of the central frame. When handling every three adjacent frames, the proposed network shares the same network parameters.
        The variables \( \tilde{I}_{i+1}(x) \) and \( \tilde{I}_{i-1}(x) \) denote the warped results of \( I_{i+1}(x+u_{i+1\rightarrow i}) \) and \( I_{i-1}(x+u_{i-1\rightarrow i}) \), respectively.
      </p><p>
        As demonstrated in [4], the blur in the video is irregular, and thus there exist some pixels that are not blurred. Following the conventional method [4], we explore these sharpness pixels to help video deblurring. The sharpness prior is defined as:
        \[ S_i(x) = exp(-\frac{1}{2} \sum_{j\&amp;j\neq0}D(I_{i+j}(x+u_{i+j \rightarrow i}); I_i(x))) \tag{10} \]
        where \( D(I_{i+j}(x+u_{i+j \rightarrow i}); I_i(x)) \) is defined as \( \left \| I_{i+j}(x+u_{i+j \rightarrow i} - I_i(x) \right \|^2 \).
      </p><p>
        Based on (10), if the value of \( S_i(x) \) is close to 1, the pixel \(x\) is likely to be clear. Thus, we can use \( S_i(x) \) to help the deep neural network to distinguish whether the pixel is clear or not so that it can help the latent frame restoration. To increase the robustness of \( S_i(x) \), we define \( D(.) \) as:
        \[ D(I_{i+j}(x+u_{i+j \rightarrow i}); I_i(x)) = \sum_{y\in \omega(x)} \left \| I_{i+j}(x+u_{i+j \rightarrow i} - I_i(x) \right \|^2 \tag{11} \]
        where \( \omega(x) \) denotes an image patch centerd at pixel \( x \).
      </p><p>
        We further train the proposed method to convergence, and get higher PSNR/SSIM than the result reported in the paper.
      </p><p>
        Quantitative results on the benchmark dataset by Su et al. [24]. All the restored frames instead of randomly selected 30 frames from each test set [24] are used for evaluations. <em>Note that: Ours* is the result that we further trained to convergence, and Ours is the result reported in the paper.</em>
      </p><p>
        Quantitative results on the GOPRO dataset by Nah et al.[20].
      </p><p>
        Here are some visual comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm generates much clearer frames.

<![CDATA[Jsonptr: Using Wuffs' Memory-Safe, Zero-Allocation JSON Decoder]]>

September 1, 2020 | https://nigeltao.github.io/blog/2020/jsonptr.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nigeltao.github.io/blog/2020/jsonptr.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      
      

      

<p><em>Summary: <code>jsonptr</code> is a new, sandboxed command-line tool that formats JSON and
speaks the JSON Pointer query syntax. Wuffs standard library’s JSON decoder can
run in O(1) memory, even with arbitrarily long input (containing arbitrarily
long strings) because it uses multiple tokens to represent each JSON string.
Processing the JSON Pointer query during (instead of after) parsing can
dramatically impact performance. <code>jsonptr</code> can be faster, use less memory and
be safer than alternatives such as <code>jq</code>, <code>serde_json</code> and <code>simdjson</code>.</em></p>

<h2 id="jsonptr"><code>jsonptr</code></h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/a325d7860f9c922b805d959a7f66c726adc92593/example/jsonptr/jsonptr.cc"><code>jsonptr</code></a> is
a command-line formatter for <a href="https://www.json.org/">JSON</a>, a ubiquitous,
human-readable file format. It also implements the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6901.txt">JSON
Pointer</a> syntax for identifying a
sub-node of the JSON input. For example, Chromium’s Preferences files are
compact (minified, with no extra whitespace or line breaks) but <code>jsonptr</code> can
make them more readable.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/google/wuffs.git
$ g++ -O3 -Wall wuffs/example/jsonptr/jsonptr.cc -o my-jsonptr
$ ./my-jsonptr -query=/browser/window_placement \
&gt; ~/.config/google-chrome/Profile\ 1/Preferences
{
    "bottom": 1200,
    "docked": false,
    "left": 0,
    "maximized": false,
    "right": 1920,
    "top": 0,
    "work_area_bottom": 1200,
    "work_area_left": 0,
    "work_area_right": 1920,
    "work_area_top": 0
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>By itself, that’s not particularly novel. Many existing JSON processing tools
do this. Picking <code>jq</code> as a popular example, its syntax isn’t JSON Pointer
syntax, but <code>jq .browser.window_placement ~/.config/google-chrome/Profile\
1/Preferences</code> will print something similar, and <code>jq</code> comes with <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/">many more
useful features</a>.</p>

<p>Looking closer, there are several advantages to <code>jsonptr</code>. <strong>The first is
speed</strong>. Here are some numbers from throwing an <code>x86_64</code> Broadwell desktop CPU
at some JSON files from the
<a href="https://github.com/miloyip/nativejson-benchmark"><code>miloyip/nativejson-benchmark</code></a>
and <a href="https://github.com/zemirco/sf-city-lots-json"><code>zemirco/sf-city-lots-json</code></a>
repositories. The <code>time</code> output (and later, the <code>/usr/bin/time</code> output), a
median of three runs, has been edited for brevity and embellished with a N.NNx
ratio (N.NN greater than 1 means that <code>jsonptr</code> is better).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ time ./my-jsonptr &lt; canada.json       &gt; /dev/null

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Both <code>jsonptr</code> and <code>jq</code> can emit compact output, reducing the running time.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ time ./my-jsonptr -compact-output &lt; citylots.json &gt; /dev/null
real    0m0.863s   (1.00x by definition)

$ time jq --compact-output .        &lt; citylots.json &gt; /dev/null
real    0m12.140s  (14.1x vs jsonptr -compact-output)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>The second is memory usage</strong>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ /usr/bin/time -v ./my-jsonptr &lt; canada.json &gt; /dev/null
Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 1096   (1.00x by definition)

$ /usr/bin/time -v jq .         &lt; canada.json &gt; /dev/null
Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 18900  (17.2x vs jsonptr)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>The third is safety</strong>. <code>jq</code> is written in C, a memory-unsafe language. The
<a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/a325d7860f9c922b805d959a7f66c726adc92593/example/jsonptr/jsonptr.cc"><code>jsonptr.cc</code></a>
file is written in C++, also memory-unsafe, but the core JSON decoder is
written in <a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs">Wuffs</a>, a
<a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/a325d7860f9c922b805d959a7f66c726adc92593/doc/note/memory-safety.md">memory-safe</a>
language designed for crafting
<a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/a325d7860f9c922b805d959a7f66c726adc92593/doc/note/hermeticity.md">hermetic</a>
libraries.</p>

<h3 id="sandboxing">Sandboxing</h3>

<p>For additional defence in depth, on Linux, the second thing that <code>jsonptr</code>’s
<code>main</code> function does is to
<a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/a325d7860f9c922b805d959a7f66c726adc92593/example/jsonptr/jsonptr.cc#L1434">self-impose</a>
a <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html"><code>SECCOMP_MODE_STRICT</code></a>
sandbox. The first thing that it does is to open (but not read) the file named
in the command line arguments, which the sandbox would otherwise prohibit.</p>

<p>A <code>SECCOMP_MODE_STRICT</code> sandbox effectively restricts the program to only read
from the input file, compute on its bytes and write to <code>stdout</code>. Even if</p>

<ol>
  <li>malicious input tickled</li>
  <li>a bug in Wuffs’ JSON library that combined with</li>
  <li>a bug in the Wuffs compiler’s proofs of safety</li>
</ol>

<p>decoding such input still couldn’t access the file system or the network, run
other programs, etc.</p>

<p>One implication of the <code>SECCOMP_MODE_STRICT</code> sandbox is that <strong>the program
cannot dynamically allocate memory</strong>, and indeed, Wuffs’ JSON library runs with
zero dynamic allocations. It never calls <code>malloc</code> or invokes <code>new</code>. That’s not
“zero dynamic allocations in the steady state”, that’s “zero dynamic
allocations, full stop”.</p>

<p>The program statically allocates <a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/a325d7860f9c922b805d959a7f66c726adc92593/example/jsonptr/jsonptr.cc#L438-L447">three 32 KiB
buffers</a>
for the JSON decoder to use, but <code>jsonptr</code> can still handle megabytes of input,
or even individual megabyte-long JSON strings. How it does this is discussed
further below, starting with the “Wuffs Buffers” section.</p>

<p>Being sandboxed means that it’s less worrisome to process untrusted files from
the network, even when downloading over HTTP (not HTTPS).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ # prize.json has no line breaks.
$ wget -q -O - http://api.nobelprize.org/v1/prize.json | wc
      0   14703  216670

$ wget -q -O - http://api.nobelprize.org/v1/prize.json | \
&gt; ./my-jsonptr | head -n 20
{
    "prizes": [
        {
            "year": "2019",
            "category": "chemistry",
            "laureates": [
                {
                    "id": "976",
                    "firstname": "John",
                    "surname": "Goodenough",
                    "motivation": "\"for the development of lithium-ion batteries\"",
                    "share": "3"
                },
                {
                    "id": "977",
                    "firstname": "M. Stanley",
                    "surname": "Whittingham",
                    "motivation": "\"for the development of lithium-ion batteries\"",
                    "share": "3"
                },
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For an additional party trick, <code>jsonptr</code> can print a depth-limited summary of
the JSON node tree.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ wget -q -O - http://api.nobelprize.org/v1/prize.json | \
&gt; ./my-jsonptr -query=/prizes/0 -max-output-depth=2
{
    "year": "2019",
    "category": "chemistry",
    "laureates": [
        "{…}",
        "{…}",
        "{…}"
    ]
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="trade-offs">Trade-Offs</h2>

<p>To be clear, <code>jq</code> (or any other software discussed below) isn’t bad software.
It’s great software, deserving its many happy users. There’s simply trade-offs
where <code>jsonptr</code> and <code>jq</code> make different but equally reasonable choices.</p>

<h3 id="sorting-keys">Sorting Keys</h3>

<p>Unlike <code>jsonptr</code>, <code>jq</code> is able to sort object keys.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ echo '{"three":3,"four":4}' | ./my-jsonptr
{
    "three": 3,
    "four": 4
}
$ echo '{"three":3,"four":4}' | jq .
{
  "three": 3,
  "four": 4
}
$ echo '{"three":3,"four":4}' | jq --sort-keys .
{
  "four": 4,
  "three": 3
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Sorting keys is certainly a useful feature, and while the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8259.txt">JSON specification
(RFC 8259)</a> does not rule out duplicate
keys, many applications assume (often implicitly) that keys are unique, and
sorting keys helps efficiently detect duplicates.</p>

<p>However, if the top-level JSON value is an object (a dictionary of key-value
pairs) then a formatter cannot print anything other than the opening <code>{</code>
character until the entire value is parsed. <strong>This requires <code>O(N)</code> memory,
where <code>N</code> is the length of the input</strong>. In comparison, the <code>jsonptr</code> program
does not sort keys and requires only <code>O(1)</code> memory. Again, neither better or
worse per se, just making different trade-offs.</p>

<h3 id="parsing-numbers">Parsing Numbers</h3>

<p>Unlike <code>jsonptr</code>, <code>jq</code> will convert JSON numbers from strings (<code>"123"</code> being
one two three) to numbers (<code>123</code> being one hundred and twenty three), using
IEEE 754 <code>double</code> precision.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ echo 0.99999999999999999 | ./my-jsonptr
0.99999999999999999
$ echo 0.99999999999999999 | jq .
1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is certainly useful when comparing values to other numbers. <code>jq</code>’s query
language allows filters like <code>map(select(. &gt;= 2))</code>. It’s also more convenient,
for a programming API instead of a command-line tool, to work with JSON numbers
as a <code>double</code> instead of a <code>std::string</code>. Nonetheless, having the parser
(instead of the caller) always convert from <code>std::string</code> to <code>double</code> can be
surprisingly expensive. <strong>Optimizing <code>StringToDouble</code> (or its equivalent) can
dramatically <a href="https://github.com/google/double-conversion/issues/137">speed up a JSON
parser</a></strong>. For a
formatter, skipping a redundant <code>StringToDouble</code> and <code>DoubleToString</code> round
trip entirely means a faster program.</p>

<h2 id="rust">Rust</h2>

<p>Wuffs is most often compared with <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>. Both are
memory-safe (but not garbage collected) languages with C/C++ interoperability.</p>

<p>One difference is that Wuffs’ standard library is transpiled to C, not compiled
to object code, so that existing C/C++ projects can <strong>use Wuffs’ standard
library like any other third party C library</strong> (it’s just not hand-written C),
without needing to pull in another language toolchain. The “<code>git clone</code> and
then <code>g++</code>” instructions at the top of this article do not involve “install the
Wuffs compiler”.</p>

<p>Again, neither better or worse per se, just making different trade-offs.
There’s also the <a href="https://github.com/thepowersgang/mrustc"><code>mrustc</code></a>
alternative Rust compiler, a work-in-progress.</p>

<h3 id="jsonxf"><code>jsonxf</code></h3>

<p><code>jsonxf</code> is a JSON pretty-printer written in Rust (without any use of
<code>unsafe</code>). The <code>-m</code> flag minifies output.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ cargo install jsonxf
$ time ~/.cargo/bin/jsonxf    &lt; citylots.json &gt; /dev/null
real    0m1.928s  (1.72x vs jsonptr)
$ time ~/.cargo/bin/jsonxf -m &lt; citylots.json &gt; /dev/null
real    0m1.871s  (2.17x vs jsonptr)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It does not validate JSON escape sequences. This is <a href="https://github.com/gamache/jsonxf/blob/cd2835dc33f6c03999baa4ae4a9ff1dbd860134e/src/jsonxf.rs#L12-L15">a deliberate design
decision</a>,
not a bug, but it is a point of difference from <code>jsonptr</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ echo -n '"Backslash-t (\t) is   valid JSON."' | ./my-jsonptr; echo $?
"Backslash-t (\t) is   valid JSON."
0
$ echo -n '"Backslash-a (\a) is invalid JSON."' | ./my-jsonptr; echo $?
"Backslash-a (
json: bad backslash-escape
1
$ echo -n '"No final double-quote'              | ./my-jsonptr; echo $?
"No final double-quote
json: bad input
1

$ echo -n '"Backslash-t (\t) is   valid JSON."' | ~/.cargo/bin/jsonxf; echo $?
"Backslash-t (\t) is   valid JSON."0
$ echo -n '"Backslash-a (\a) is invalid …</code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<div>
<p id="c8d2" data-selectable-paragraph="">At&nbsp;<a href="https://upside.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upside</a>, we take pride in our deployment culture. We ship new versions of code multiple times per day through our various environments powered by AWS and Kubernetes. We run an infrastructure stack that leverages the powerful&nbsp;<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/microservices/what-are-microservices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">microservice architecture pattern</a>&nbsp;that sees our applications broken up into smaller segments that each do one thing, but do it very well. Thanks to our applications being loosely coupled, we feel safe deploying fast and deploying often due to blast radius being minimized.</p>
<p id="2da5" data-selectable-paragraph="">Half the battle of implementing true CI/CD is already won at Upside due to our awesome engineering management and teams being fully supportive of the culture. The other half of the battle is implementing it from a technical standpoint. A big portion of this effort involves weighing the pros and cons of the many tools out there in regards to your specific CI/CD needs. This is very important; just because there is a shiny new item out there, doesn’t necessarily mean that it is a one size fits all for everyone. To quote the late American psychologist Abraham Maslow, “If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail”.</p>

<p id="e50c" data-selectable-paragraph="">Let’s take a step back to fully flesh out what CI/CD means, because it can help us start to visualize the problem that we believe Spinnaker helps us to solve.</p>
<p id="9258" data-selectable-paragraph="">CI/CD stands for “Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment”:</p>
<h2 id="79eb" data-selectable-paragraph="">Continuous Integration</h2>
<p id="a26e" data-selectable-paragraph="">Continuous Integration deals with the culture of integrating code into a shared repository multiple times per day. Often times, automated tests are run on every merge, and artifact builds are kicked off. In our case at Upside, upon every merge to master, we run tests and then build and push a new Docker image that represents that version of the code.</p>
<h2 id="225b" data-selectable-paragraph="">Continuous Delivery/Deployment</h2>
<p id="4231" data-selectable-paragraph="">These are actually two different cultures and the difference between the two can really elevate a team’s ability to roll new services out. Continuous Delivery deals with automating the process of deploying artifacts into your environments. Typically this involves an automated deployment into dev, in which some sort of a manual judgement is needed to then deploy that artifact to later environments, and then finally ending in a deployment to production. Continuous Deployment takes this a step further and removes these manual judgements. This can be a heavy undertaking due to engineers having to write and rely on automated testing which will dictate if the code should be promoted to the next environment or not. Another roadblock to Continuous Deployment is finding the right tooling that balances out-of-the-box functionality but still leaving enough room for customization. At Upside, we are making the push to get to full Continuous Deployment, and Spinnaker is what is enabling us to get there.</p>

<p id="c0b7" data-selectable-paragraph="">Now that we can start to see what the true nature of Continuous Deployment looks like, let’s talk about the open-sourced tool developed by Netflix called Spinnaker that helps to enable it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="a137" data-selectable-paragraph="">Also, a disclaimer that this article is less of a “how to use Spinnaker”, and more of a high level “how we are leveraging Spinnaker at Upside”. If you are interested in how to get started, check out the Spinnaker docs on&nbsp;<a href="https://spinnaker.io/setup/install/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to install it</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://spinnaker.io/guides/user/get-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create your first pipeline</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="bccd" data-selectable-paragraph="">Okay, I understand the problem — but what exactly is Spinnaker?</h2>
<p id="d0f6" data-selectable-paragraph="">In a nutshell, Spinnaker is an open-sourced and self-hosted platform that allows you to quickly build out deployment pipelines. It is also multi-cloud in that you can easily deploy with built in functions to AWS, Azure, GCP, and Kubernetes to name a few. For example, need a stage in your pipeline to deploy a Helm chart to a Kubernetes cluster? Easy, there’s a built in function for this. Oh, but it needs to be a Canary deployment and analysis? Done, Spinnaker comes with that built in functionality as well. At Upside, these built in functionalities are a big reason of what sold us on Spinnaker — could you imagine scripting these in Jenkins?</p>
<h2 id="5117" data-selectable-paragraph="">A few Spinnaker terms</h2>
<ul>
<li id="46a1" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Application</strong>&nbsp;— an application can have 0 to many&nbsp;<em>pipelines</em>. In our case, each one of our microservices is its own application in Spinnaker.</li>
<li id="0bd5" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Pipeline</strong>&nbsp;— a pipeline has 0 to many&nbsp;<em>stages</em>. At Upside, each of our Spinnaker applications has a pipeline that deploys to our dev environment, another that deploys to our staging environment, and finally one for our prod environment.</li>
<li id="69d2" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Stage</strong>&nbsp;— represents an action in a pipeline. For example, a stage to deploy a Helm chart, another stage to publish this deployment information to our centralized logging solution, and a stage that may require a manual approval to continue the pipeline, to name a few.</li>
<li id="4823" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Pipeline-template</strong>&nbsp;— this is a parameterized JSON file that represents a pipeline. This is where we can define a pipeline and its stages in code. The purpose of this is for reuse. For example, at Upside, we deploy most of our 200+ microservices in the same fashion, therefore we want a single source of truth when we define our pipelines. So when the time comes to add an application to Spinnaker, we just create its dev, stage, and prod pipelines and point each to its respective pipeline-template. Another benefit of this is if, for example, a new stage needs to be added to all of our applications’ dev pipelines, we just edit the dev pipeline-template, and the change propagates to all of our applications.</li>
</ul>

</div><figcaption data-selectable-paragraph=""></figcaption></figure>
<p id="f252" data-selectable-paragraph="">Above is a somewhat simple deployment pipeline that we use here at Upside, but still nonetheless complex. I won’t get into the specifics of what each stage is doing, but the pipeline is triggered either manually in the Spinnaker UI, or triggered on a new image hitting a Docker registry. The pipeline then uses Helm to bundle our Kubernetes spec files into an artifact that can be used downstream by our Deploy stage.</p>
<p id="aa94" data-selectable-paragraph="">Then we have a manual approval stage that is dynamically enabled if our Run Tests stage sees something in our newly deployed resources that would need human intervention for. This manual approval has 3 options:</p>
<ol>
<li id="b9c9" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Stop</strong>&nbsp;— this stops the pipeline and the next environment’s pipeline will not execute.</li>
<li id="fed0" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Stop and Rollback&nbsp;</strong>— this option is selected via the dropdown in the image below and will stop the deployment from going to the next environment, as well as also rolling back the current environment’s deployment to the previous image version.</li>
<li id="d09e" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Continue</strong>&nbsp;— this continues the deployment to the next environment.</li>

<h2 id="0e20" data-selectable-paragraph="">Why this deployment flow is an improvement</h2>
<p id="36cc" data-selectable-paragraph="">Previously at Upside, we had continuous deployment to our Dev environment in that upon merge to master, Jenkins would use Helm to deploy to Dev. It was then up to the engineering teams to trigger this Jenkins job to promote that to our Staging environment, and then finally to Prod. Spinnaker helps improve upon this in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li id="93e7" data-selectable-paragraph="">More complexity and robustness in our pipelines flows. We began to hit a ceiling with Jenkins in that scripting any further complexity was going to become very tedious. Spinnaker enables us to quickly roll out more robust pipeline workflows.</li>
<li id="df3b" data-selectable-paragraph="">A single pane of glass. The Spinnaker UI allows diving into various bits of the infrastructure that each pipeline deploys such as pod logs, ReplicaSet information, the ability to scale up and down pods, etc. Also, engineers are able to make manual judgements to continue/stop/rollback within the Spinnaker UI.</li>
<li id="543b" data-selectable-paragraph="">Engineers dictate their own Continuous Deployment fate. At Upside, we allow our engineering teams the freedom to write their own tests that dictate whether or not to have full automation to Prod with no manual approvals needed (aka Continuous Deployment).

    Tracking position of something is a topic that I like, cause it makes me
    feel like to be a human with a sixth sense. With this sense I know where an
    object is and how it moves, in spite of&nbsp; I can't see the object
    directly with my naked eyes. Then how do we get a sixth sense? Because as
    ordinary human we only have five senses.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    In my opinion, living in this digital age today, we already had a sixth
    sense which is called technology that implemented in an application. Related
    with our topic in this post about flight tracking, there are numerous flight
    tracking applications out there such as flightradar24, FlightAware,
    flightview and so on, which enabled us to monitor position of airplanes
    around the earth. This post won't discuss about those applications, moreover
    I will discuss how to make our own flight tracking application with
    python.&nbsp; <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Previously I already posted two tutorials about flight tracking with python.
    The first one is about
    <a href="https://www.geodose.com/2018/11/create-simple-live-flight-tracking-python.html">creating a simple flight tracking application with python</a>
    and the another one is
    <a href="https://www.geodose.com/2019/01/realtime-flight-tracking-pandas-bokeh-python.html">creating a flight tracking application with pandas and bokeh</a>. What is the difference with this one? The main difference is data source.
    In those two previous posts, I used
    <a href="https://www.adsbexchange.com/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ADS-B Exchange</a>
    and in this tutorial I'm using
    <a href="https://opensky-network.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Opensky Network</a>. Another difference is module version. In this tutorial I'm using the
    latest version python library in particular for plotting library. So there
    will be a slight change in the code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Enough for introduction. Now let's move to our main topic how to build a
    flight tracking application with python using open air traffic data. This
    tutorial consists of several sub-topics, there are: Getting data, importing
    required libraries, loading basemap, plotting aircraft's position and make a
    "realtime" flight tracking application. We will discuss each part, and at
    the end of this tutorial we will get a flight tracking application which is
    running in a browser as shown in figure 1.

</div><h3>Getting Air Traffic Data

<ins data-ad-client="ca-pub-5632482621101280" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-slot="7655392618"></ins>
</h3>
<p>
  As I mentioned earlier, in this tutorial we are using open air traffic data
  from OpenSky Network. OpenSky Network is an non-profit consortium that
  provides open air traffic data to the public in particular for research and
  non-commercial purposes. The data can be accessed through REST API, Python API
  and Java API. In this tutorial we will use REST API to retrieve the live air
  traffic data.
</p>
<p>
  To retrieve the data using REST API can be done using request operation. There
  are two types of requests can be used. The first one is request for specific
  airplane based on time in UNIX timestamp or ICAO24 address. The second one we
  can get all airplane data within an area extent using WGS84 coordinates
  system. Moreover the access for the data can be done anonymously or registered
  user. For anonymously request, it has 10 seconds resolution and 5 seconds for
  registered user. <br>
</p>
<p>
  In this tutorial we will use the second one. We will define an area extent
  with minimum and maximum coordinates, and then send the query to get all
  airplane data within the area. For example we want to fetch the data over United States
  with minimum coordinate -125.974,30.038 and maximum coordinate -68.748,52.214. The query for both anonymously and registered user will be as follow.
</p>
<pre><span>#</span>Anonymously Request
https:<span>//</span>opensky<span>-</span>network.org<span>/</span>api<span>/</span>states<span>/</span><span>all</span><span>?</span>lamin<span>=30.038</span><span>&amp;</span>lomin<span>=-125.974</span><span>&amp;</span>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>lamax<span>=52.214</span><span>&amp;</span>lomax<span>=-68.748</span><span></span>

<span>#</span>Registered User Request
https:<span>//</span>username:password<span>@</span>opensky<span>-</span>network.org<span>/</span>api<span>/</span>states<span>/</span><span>all</span><span>?</span>lamin<span>=</span><span>30.038</span><span>&amp;</span>lomin<span>=-125.974</span><span>&amp;</span>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>lamax<span>=52.214</span><span>&amp;</span>lomax<span>=</span><span>-68.748</span><span></span></pre>
<p>
  Before continuing reading and to make sure the query is right, let's try it.
  Copy the anonymously query and paste into a browser. If you get a response
  like figure 2 below, then it works.&nbsp; <br>
</p>

        Figure 2. Air traffic data response<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>
  The return response as shown in figure 2 is in JSON structure with two keys.
  The first one is <i>time </i>and the second one is <i>States</i> that contains
  data for each airplane in a list array. The list array stores many data such
  as: ICAO24 address, airplane call sign, origin country, time position, last
  contact, longitude, latitude, barometer altitude and so on. For complete
  explanation about the data response and also further information about OpenSky
  Network API please refer to
  <a href="https://www.geodose.com/2020/08/OpenSky%20Network%20API" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OpenSky Network API Documentation</a>. &nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<h3>Getting Air Traffic Data in Python</h3>

<p>
  We already retrieved the traffic data using REST API in a browser. Now let's
  do it in Python and process the response for the next purpose. For this
  tutorial I'm using Jupyter notebook with Python 3.8.2 and some libraries such
  as Bokeh 2.1.1, Pandas 0.25.3, requests, json and numpy. <br>
</p>
<p>
  Below is the code to make a request and do a little processing on the
  data. At the beginning, we import the required libraries such as requests,
  json and Pandas. Then define the extent coordinate in WGS84 with respective
  variable <i>lon_min,lat_min, lon_max and lat_max</i>.&nbsp; Based on the
  extent coordinate, make the request query. If you are a registered user, give
  the user name and password in <i>user_name</i> and <i>password</i> variable at
  line 11-12. Based on given extent coordinate and user data, we create a
  request query in <i>url_data</i> variable as in line 13 and get the response
  in json format. The remain of the code is used to dump the response data into
  Pandas data frame and replace the blank/empty data with 'NaN' value with 'No
  Data'. The last line which is data frame's <i>head</i> method is used to view
  the first 5 top row of the data as shown in figure 3. &nbsp;

&nbsp;
<p>Make sure after executing the code, you have a result as in figure 3. If you
  get it, it means everything is fine, and we have the data that will be used
  for the next step.</p><h3>Plotting Airplane on the Map</h3>
<p>
  After getting the data, now let's plot the location of all airplanes on a
  map.&nbsp; For plotting purpose, we are using Bokeh library. Therefore we need
  to import the library first. Additionally we also need to import NumPy library
  that will be used in coordinate conversion.
</p>
<p>
  The conversion of coordinate system is implemented in a function which is
  called <i>wgs84_web_mercator</i>_. As it's name this function will be used to
  transform WGS84 coordinate into web Mercator coordinate system. This
  transformation is required because we are using a
  <i>STAMEN_TERRAIN</i> basemap in a web browser that has web Mercator
  projection (EPSG: 3857).
</p>
<p>
  After creating coordinate conversion function and perform the transformation
  for data frame and extent coordinates. Next we set up plotting figure settings
  by specifying plotting area extent based on the range of x and y coordinates.
  The aircraft will be plotted on the basemap based on x and y coordinates with
  Points and also with airplane icon image. Why both point and image are used to plot
  the aircraft? Image will give a better visualization by using an airplane
  image and it can be rotated with the respective track angle. But unfortunately it
  can't&nbsp; high light a selected object and display more information with
  hover tool. To overcome this issue we use both image and point in circle
  object to get nice a visualization and enable selection and hovering tool.
  &nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>
  The following is the code until this step. If it is
  executed we will get a result as in figure 4.&nbsp; <br>

<p>Collaboration between Elon Musk’s various companies is not a new thing, his space transportation company SpaceX often uses Tesla electric vehicles on the field wherever possible.</p>



<p>We saw <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/05/27/crewdragon-human-spaceflight/">two Tesla Model X SUVs escorting NASA astronauts</a> for the SpaceX Demo-2 mission but they are not the only Tesla cars used by SpaceX.</p>



<p>A white Tesla Model 3 is performing services as an ‘Emergency Operations’ vehicle for SpaceX, it has been spotted on several occasions and SpaceX events. I have sourced some of these pictures that show its usage beyond a normal car for the end-customer.</p>



<p>For example, a SpaceX enthusiast and observer at the Boca Chica launch facility Mary (@BocaChicaGal) posted a stunning photo of the same <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-3/">Tesla Model 3</a> with the SpaceX logo wrapped on the doors and equipped with the emergency vehicle lighting on the top.</p>

<p>This SpaceX Edition Model 3 was also spotted earlier this year at a <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/spacex/">SpaceX</a> recruitment event at the company’s Boca Chica Texas office. It was enjoying all the attention while the Mariachi music and Mexican food were igniting the passion of the candidates even further.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>When the huge Starship SN2 tank was returning to the assembly area on a rolling lift, the SpaceX Model 3 can be seen monitoring the situation at the back in a live video feed from Boca Chica earlier this year.</p>

<p>Integrating <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/">Tesla vehicles</a> into the SpaceX loop not only accelerates the mission of sustainable transportation but these electric cars are also helping humans reach goals beyond the planet.</p>

White Langshans were admitted to the quality ten years later in 1893. There are three sorts of Langshans that are accepted to the US standard – Black, White, and Blue. The latter wasn’t accepted to the quality until 1987.</p><p>In 1879 the breed was delivered to Germany. The German Langshans were derived from these and shortly replaced them. After the Second war Croad Langshans were reintroduced to Germany from the USA.</p><h3>Overall impression ;</h3><p>The original Croad Langshans were black with an excellent green sheen which remains the most colour kept today.</p><p>Croad Langshans are tall birds, known for the U-shape created between their heads and tall tails.</p><ul><li>males 4.5 kg;</li><li>hens 3-3.5 kg.</li></ul><p>The hens lay 140-150 eggs a year and are good winter layers; the eggs are dark brown</p><p>Brown shelled eggs were a rarity in England until the Croad Langshan was introduced, because it was the primary Asiatic breed during this country to supply them. there’s a <a href="https://funpoultry.com/chicken-breed/bantams/croad-langshan-bantam/"><strong>bantam version</strong></a>.</p><h3>Similar breeds;</h3><ul><li><a href="https://funpoultry.com/chicken-breed/large-fowl/australian-langshan/"><strong>Australian langshan</strong></a></li><li>Modern Langshan</li><li><a href="https://funpoultry.com/chicken-breed/large-fowl/german-langschan/"><strong>German Langshan</strong></a></li></ul><h3>Colour Varieties langshans ;</h3><ul><li>The original version has black feathers with green beetling</li><li>White Langshan</li><li>Blue Langshans</li></ul><p>Many other breeds were created using Langshan blood within the foundation matings.

<div>
<p>It is relatively old now, but on version 0.25, <code>pandas</code> introduced <code>NamedAgg</code>. It is mostly a convenience, it's not <strong>huge</strong>, but for me, it's life-changing.<br>
The <code>as</code> keyword from SQL is a wonderful one. You can create a complex function on a database column, and then give it an explicit name. This name can be used later in the pipeline as a reference, or even just as-is for convenience when reading the table.<br>
<code>pandas</code>, even though superior to SQL in so many ways, really lacked this until fairly recently. You either do a renaming stage, after receiving multi-index columns or feed the <code>agg</code> function with a complex dictionary structure. With <code>NamedAgg</code>, it becomes as easy as the <code>as</code> keyword, and in my mind, even more elegant.</p>

<p>Pandas <code>.groupby</code> always had a lot of flexability, but it was not perfect. Until lately. Let's start with the basics.
If you just want one aggregation function, and it happens to be a very basic one, just call it.</p>

<p>Notice how pandas created a <code>MultiIndex</code> on the columns. A <code>MultiIndex</code> has many advantages for efficiency, but when we are exploring data on reasonably sized datasets, they are harder to work with. I'd rather have a flat index. Flat indices are much easier to work with as they have very explicit means of accessing.
Also, maybe I don't need <strong>all</strong> functions on <strong>all</strong> columns? Perhaps I only need the sum of alcohol and the count of hue?</p>

<h2 id="Replacing-the-as-keyword-from-SQL">Replacing the <code>as</code> keyword from SQL<a href="#Replacing-the-as-keyword-from-SQL">¶</a></h2><p>SQL provides an important keyword when using <code>group by</code>. The <code>as</code> keyword essentially lets you call whichever aggregation function you want. If I want two different aggregation functions,  on two separate columns, simply write the functions and give them a new name.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>SELECT</span> <span>class</span><span>,</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>alcohol</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>sum_alcohol</span><span>,</span> <span>count</span><span>(</span><span>hue</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>count_hue</span>
<span>from</span> <span>df</span>
<span>group</span> <span>by</span> <span>class</span>
</pre></div>
<p>It used to be hard replicating that. You needed a very confusing dictionary structure that looked like this</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>df</span><span>.</span><span>groupby</span><span>(</span><span>'class'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>agg</span><span>({</span>
    <span>'alcohol'</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>'sum_alcohol'</span><span>:</span> <span>'sum'</span>
    <span>},</span>
    <span>'hue'</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>'count_hue'</span><span>:</span> <span>'count'</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>})</span>
</pre></div>
<p>It would have worked, but first of all, it's pretty not very elegant with all those nested dicts, and it would still return a <code>MultiIndex</code> on the columns.<br>
The solution comes with <code>pd.NamedAgg</code>. The way to use it is still with the agg function, which now accepts <code>**kwargs</code>. Just provide it with a <code>NamedAgg</code> using the following template.</p>
<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Language</th>
<th>Syntax</th>

<p>But as you can observe, we remain with a <code>MultiIndex</code> on columns and a column named <code>&lt;lambda_0&gt;</code>. Renaming this, and would be hell. Imagine reading your own code 6 months from now, when you suddenly meet this line: <code>df.rename(columns={'&lt;lambda_0&gt;':'geomean'})</code>.  Blah 🤢.
<code>pandas</code> will give it a readable name if you use <code>def function(x):</code> but, that may sometimes have the overhead of writing small unnecessary functions.
<code>NamedAgg</code> takes care of all this hassle. It can easily be fed lambda functions with names given on the <code>agg</code> method.</p>

<p>You can see that it can be instantiated with a non-existing function, on a non-existing column name, without a dataframe. It will only try to work inside an aggregation.
The <code>agg</code> method is smart enough. When given many <code>**kwargs</code> as tuples, it knows it should instantiate them as <code>NamedAgg</code>s. And this is where it ends, with this beautiful <code>groupby</code> aggregation, that finally, truly replaces the <code>as</code> keyword from SQL.</p>

<p>Water flows downhill. We all know this, and we all (implicitly) understand the idea. Water is flexible and subject to the forces of gravity. Terrain has high points and low points. Water follows the path of least resistance to reach its destination.</p>



<p>Water isn’t the only thing that behaves in this way. I think people behave in an identical fashion. Once the <a href="https://garybasin.com/no-motivation-without-vision/">destination</a> is determined and “terrain” is clearly visible, the path of least resistance becomes obvious. Unlike water, though, humans have to define the final resting point as precisely as possible. <strong>If you don’t define <em>it</em>, it may define <em>you</em></strong>: you will find yourself moving towards a destination you didn’t expect, and may not want.</p>



<p>You <em>will</em> flow along a path of least resistance. The key question is where do you want to end up? <a href="https://twitter.com/garybasin/status/1300428590530600963">If multiple paths seem equally appealing</a>, you may have not defined the destination with enough clarity.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><h2><span>Overall Thoughts</span></h2></p> <p><span>48 Laws of Power is a collection of tactics for attaining power in various domains in life. It may come off as amoral, and some of the tricks outlined in the book are shady to say the least. It is a tough pill to swallow. But it is an informative and engaging book, if you read it without value judgement. Less of a wholesome guide on how to live life, more of a disappassionate analysis of ways to obtain power. And here's the way the author Robert Greene himself puts it: "I'm not evil. I'm a realist."</span></p>  <p><h2><span>Summary</span></h2></p> <p><span>Below is the the list of the 48 laws detailed in the book, along with any important notes.</span></p> <p><h3><span>Law 1: Never outshine the master</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Make your masters appear more brilliant than they are</strong> <span> and you will attain the heights of power.</span></p> <p><span>As you try to impress your masters, do not go too far in displaying your talents. Otherwise, you will inspire fear and insecurity.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 2: Never put too much trust in friends, learn how to use enemies</span></h3></p> <p><span>Be wary of friends. </span> <strong>You have more to fear from friends than from enemies</strong> <span>. If you have no enemies, find a way to make them.</span></p> <p><span>Friends will betray you more quickly, as envy makes things tricky. But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more to prove. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 3: Conceal your intentions</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Keep people off-balance and in the dark.</strong> <span> Never reveal the purpose behind your actions. </span></p> <p><span>Hide your intentions not by closing up but&nbsp;</span> <strong>by talking endlessly about your desires and goals (just not your real ones)</strong> <span>. These are smoke screens that can disguise your actions.</span></p> <p><span>If they have no clue what you are up to, they cannot prepare a defense. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 4: Always say less than necessary</span></h3></p> <p><strong>The more you say, the more common you appear</strong> <span>, and the less in control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended, and sphinxlike.</span></p> <p><span>You can't take back words once they are out. Keep them under control. The more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 5: So much depends on reputation. Guard it with your life</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Through reputation alone you can intimidate and win</strong> <span>. It is the foundation of power.</span></p> <p><span>Always be alert to potential attacks and thwart them before they happen. Meanwhile, </span> <strong>learn to destroy your enemies by opening holes in their own reputations</strong> <span>. Then stand aside and let public opinion hang them. Doubt is a powerful weapon.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 6: Court attention at all cost</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Stand out. Be conspicuous, at all cost</strong> <span>. It is better to be attacked than be ignored, for what is unseen counts for nothing. Never let yourself get lost in the crowd or buried in oblivion. Attach your name and reputation to an image larger, more colorful, and mysterious than other people.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 7: Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Use other people to further your own cause</strong> <span>. It saves you valuable time and resources. Never do yourself what others can do for you. Your helpers wil lbe forgotten, and you will be remembered. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 8: Make other people come to you. Use bait if necessary</span></h3></p> <p><span>It is always wise to </span> <strong>make your opponent come to you</strong> <span>, and have them abandon their own plans in the process. Fight the battle on your turf. When you force the other person to act, you are the one in control. Lure them into your territory with a potential victory, then attack. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 9: Win through your actions, never through an argument</span></h3></p> <p><span>Any short-lived victory you think you gain through argument is an illusion, as resentment builds up. It is more powerful to get other people to agree with you through your actions, instead of your words. </span></p> <p><span>Show, don't tell. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 10: Infection: Avoid the unhappy and unlucky</span></h3></p> <p><strong>The unfortunate sometimes draw misfortune on themselves.</strong> <span> They will also draw it on you. Don't try to help an infector, or you will pay the price. Helping the drowning man only sets you up for a disaster. You can die from someone else’s misery.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 11: Learn to keep people dependent on you</span></h3></p> <p><span>Make people depend on you for their happiness and prosperity. Teach a man how to&nbsp;fish&nbsp;and you feed him for his life time. Don't. To maintain your independence you must always be needed and wanted. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 12: Use selective honesty and generosity to disarm your victim</span></h3></p> <p><strong>One sincere and honest move will cover over dozens of dishonest ones</strong> <span>. Even the most suspicious people can be disarmed with gestures of generosity and honesty. Once they let their guard down, you can manipulate them at will.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 13: When asking for help, appeal to people’s self-interest, never to their mercy or gratitude</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 14: Pose as a friend, work as a spy</span></h3></p> <p><span>Know your enemies. Learn to probe for other people's weaknesses and intentions. Every occasion is an opoprtunity to spy. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 15: Crush your enemy totally</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 16: Use absence to increase respect and honor</span></h3></p> <p><strong>The more you are seen and heard from, the more common you appear</strong> <span>. You must learn when to leave. Create value through scarcity.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 17: Keep others in suspended terror: Cultivate an air of unpredictability</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Be deliberately unpredictable</strong> <span>. Patterns are powerful, and you can keep others off-balance by disrupting the predictability. They will wear themselves out trying to explain your moves. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 18: Do not build fortresses to protect yourself. Isolation is dangerous</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 19: Know who you’re dealing with. Do not offend the wrong person</span></h3></p> <p><span>Not everyone will react to your actions the same way. There are so many different kinds of people after all. Pick your battles, choose your rivals carefully.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 20: Do not commit to anyone</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 21: Play a sucker to catch a sucker. Seem dumber than your mark</span></h3></p> <p><span>Make your victims feel smart. Make them feel smarter than you are. Once they believe this is true, they will not be able to detect your ulterior motives.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 22: Use the surrender tactic: transform weakness into power</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Surrender first</strong> <span>. Turn the other cheek.  Resist the temptation to fight back for honor's sake. That will throw off the aggressor.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 23: Concentrate your forces</span></h3></p> <p><span>Focus. Intensity is the name of the game. Don't spread your energy too thin.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 24: Play the perfect courtier
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Practice flattery and nonchalance. Yield to those who are more powerful. Assert power over others in the most graceful manner. Master your emotions. Never be the bearer of bad news.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 25: Recreate yourself
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Take control over your own image, or others will. Forge a new identity that commands attention. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 26: Keep your hands clean
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Hide your mistakes, or use a scapegoat to conceal your involvement. You must maintain a flawless appearance.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 27: Play on people’s need to believe to create a cultlike following
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Keep it vague, but full of promise. Promote passion over rationality. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 28: Enter action with boldness
</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Timidity is dangerous</strong> <span>. People admire the bold.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 29: Plan all the way to the end
</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 30: Make your accomplishments seem effortless
</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Act effortlessly, as if you could do much more</strong> <span>. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 31: Control the options. Get others to play with the cards you deal
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Rig the game. Change the playing field in your favour. Your opponents will get a false sense of control, but you will come out on top regardless of which option they choose.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 32: Play to people’s fantasies
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Life is tough. People want to believe there is something or someone to blame. Give them what they want.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 33: Discover each man’s thumbscrew
</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Everyone has a weakness, a gap in the castle wall</strong> <span>. Once you find it, you can turn it to your advantage. What other people can't control, you control for them.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 34: Be royal in your own fashion: Act like a king to be treated like one
</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 35: Master the art of timing
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Always appear patient and in control. You never want to be seen to be in a hurry. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 36: Disdain things you cannot have: Ignoring them is the best revenge
</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 37: Create compelling spectacles
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Create spectacles for the people around you. This creates the aura of power around you.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 38: Think as you like but behave like others
</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 39: Stir up waters to catch fish
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Never be angry or emotionally stirred, for they are counter-productive. However, if you can make your rivals angry while remaining calm yourself, it is a huge advantage. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 40: Despise the free lunch
</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Pay the full price, as there is no cutting corners with excellence.</strong></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 41: Avoid stepping into a great man’s shoes
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Getting lost in a great man's shadow is a dangerous trap. Build a name for yourself, on your terms. Tread your own path.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 42: Strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Trouble can usually be traced to a single source. If you let them be, they will infect the group with their ill will. Get rid of them before giving them the chance to do so.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 43: Work on the hearts and minds of others
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Play on what people fear, and dropping their guards by playing on what they hold dear. Don't coerce. Go along with what others' emotions.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 44: Disarm and infuriate with the mirror effect
</span></h3></p> <p><span>The mirror effect: </span> <strong>By holding up a mirror to their psyches, you seduce them with the illusion that you share their values</strong> <span>. This is powerful, and few can resist it.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 45: Preach the need for change, but never reform too much at once
</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 46: Never appear too perfect
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Envy is dangerous. One way to to eliminate envy is to </span> <strong>appear human and relatable</strong> <span>. It is wise to appear vulnerable and admit to defects occasionally.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 47: Do not go past the mark you aimed for. In victory, learn when to stop
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Leave on a high note. Don't let hubris blind you and trap you into pushing past what you had aimed for. When you reach a goal, stop. "Stop gain" is just as important as "stop loss".</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 48: Assume formlessness
</span></h3></p> <p><strong>By taking a shape, you open yourself to attack</strong> <span>. Instead, remain adaptable, remain on your toes. Accept that change is the only constant. Be like water. </span></p>

<div>
<p>Imagine a natural road spontaneously forms between point A and point B, and that as a consequence of this road, individuals suddenly wake up to the importance of point B, and of traveling there. Companies had first ignored point B altogether, but because the overwhelming majority of individuals now travel this road, these companies must now begin meeting individuals where they are: at point B. If they donâ€™t, they will perish.</p>

<p>But then comes along a wonderful invention: a road between point A and point B, but built on Conveyer Belt technology by the iCompany. Anyone traveling on the iRoad will arrive to B in 1/10th the time of the natural road. At first, the toll for individuals is far too pricey, so they disregard the iRoad; individuals are ok with the time cost of taking the natural road. But as time passes, more and more people begin taking the iRoad due to its undeniable benefits. Time turned out to be just one factor. Journeyers on the iRoad experience benefits like reduced health risk, less wear and tear, and an all around more comfortable experience. At some point, <em>not</em> taking the iRoad becomes of great consequence to individuals. Taking the natural road becomes no longer an option.</p>

<p>The benevolent iCompany has done a great service for humankind building this road that has completely changed the way people get to point B. And because the iCompany knows that other companies would love to travel this road just the same to cater to all its journey-goers, it charges them a hefty toll for access. It says, â€œanything you sell to people on this road, we will take a meaningful percent of, in perpetuity, forever and ever.â€�</p>

<p>Sellers on the iRoad grimace once at the terms of the deal, but sign nonetheless, knowing that not being able to sell to journeyers on the iRoad means their business will cease to exist. They can go and sell to riders of the natural road, but it isnâ€™t enough to guarantee a meaningful existence.</p>

<p>Over the days, months, and years, sellers go through a whirlwind of survival challenges all to put on a smile of a face to its customers on the iRoad, whom they can only meet through frosted glass. Throughout all the changes, mutations, and evolutions, one thing remains beautifully constant: the iRoad commission. It is the axiom of existence on the iRoad.</p>

<p>Merchants on the iRoad have for years felt the commission too high, and an impediment to their survival. But what can they do? Fight the iRoad, and risk being barred. Avoid the iRoad altogether, and immediately perish. Build your own iRoad, and fail.</p>

<p>Building an iRoad is of course no easy feat. In fact, only two companies in the history of the world have succeeded in doing so. The other such road, the gRoad, exists parallel to the iRoad, and funnily enough, charges the exact same toll. </p>

<p>Itâ€™s almost as if these two roads have a <em>monopoly</em> over access to passengers traveling to point B. We can say this because:</p>

<ul>
<li>Individuals can ignore point B at their own peril</li>
<li>Companies can ignore point B at their own peril</li>
<li>The only way to get to point B is via one of two roads</li>
<li>Building your own road is historically impossible and impractical</li>
<li>Both roads charge the same commission and are unwilling to negotiate</li>
<li>This commission is often seen as egregiously excessive</li>
</ul>

<p>In non-monopolistic cases, there would be many, many more roads to point B. And because individuals can choose which roads to travel, these roads compete to a point where commissions and tolls are reduced to their lowest natural level.</p>

<p>In cases of monopolies, there is no competition. And thus no real reason to lower prices, especially for a good as important as access to point B.</p>

<p>There are two common arguments one sees over this epic battle:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Textbook Libertarian: <em>"If youâ€™re not happy with the fee donâ€™t use the road."</em> As mentioned, one cannot simply ignore this road. This response is equivalent to <em>"Donâ€™t exist"</em>, but I think things that exist want to stay in existence. So this is ultimately too nihilistic a response.</li>
<li>The Textbook Retailer: "<em>All roads charge tolls."</em> Sure, almost all roads will levy a toll. The difference is that traveling most roads is optional. Point B however is special. Very, very special. So special that if you ignore it you will perish. And there are only two roads you can travel to get to point B. These two roads appear to act in unison to maintain what sellers deem unreasonably high tolls.</li>
</ol>

<p>Itâ€™s extremely important to understand what differentiates this case from any other case where you can successfully apply The Textbook Libertarian and The Textbook Retailer:</p>

<p><em>Monopoly.</em></p>

<p>The constricting of competition.</p>

<p>The complete suffocation of choice.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-768591a489fac6dfd3c8"><div><p>Two of my favorite follows on Twitter are <a href="https://twitter.com/tobydoyhowell">Toby Howell</a>, writer for the Morning Brew, and <a href="https://twitter.com/BUSlNESSBARISTA?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Alex Liberman</a>, CEO and co-founder of the Morning Brew. Recently, they announced a competition  — who would get to 10,000 followers first. The idea wasn't only a smart idea, but an idea rooted in authenticity.</p><p>If you are an avid reader of the <a href="https://www.morningbrew.com/">Brew</a>, a newsletter-firs media company, or a follower of them on social media, you'll notice a distinct voice. Their content is concise, playful, but always authentic. Here's an <a href="https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/stories/2020/08/31/zooms-revenue-increases-355-second-quarter">example</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Zoom’s revenue grew 355% in Q2, because last year you hadn’t heard of the company and now you use it to watch your brother get married.” </em></p></blockquote><p>A publication like the Wall Street Journal would've just reported the number. The Morning Brew adds their own voice to it that makes the content special. </p><p>Special content is hard to come by  —  that's why two million people subscribe to their newsletter. When you open their email, you'll either be informed or entertained, but never disappointed. </p><p>This quality isn't just present in their content, but in their employee's content. Morning Brew employees have done an excellent job of forging their own path on social media. Alex Liberman has built a LinkedIn following of over 40,000 followers. <a href="https://twitter.com/austin_rief">Austin Rief</a>, COO and Co-Founder, of Morning Brew has built a following of over 18,000. Which brings be back to the Twitter game.</p><p>Many companies use referral programs and gamification to boost their following. It's been a common practice for years way before the internet. But there is a right way and wrong way to do it. In 2011, Google News introduced Google Badges, a reward system for reading the news. It was universally panned. Tech Crunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/15/google-news-badges-we-dont-need-no-stinking-google-news-badges/">wrote</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Whether you think </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification"><em>gamification</em></a><em> is the road that leads to a brighter future – or instead straight to the irreparable infantilization – of the Web, even the harshest of critics have to admit that there’s more to the concept than simply slapping some badges on a website, game or application, Foursquare-style. The more I </em><a href="http://googlenewsblog.blogspot.com/2011/07/shareable-google-news-badges-for-your.html"><em>read up</em></a><em> on this new </em><a href="http://news.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1237021"><em>Google News Badges</em></a><em> stuff, the more I think some people over at Mountain View didn’t quite get that particular message.”</em></p></blockquote><p>But for Morning Brew, gamification has been at the forefront of their brand. Case and point is their referral program which has brought in more than 225,000 subscribers to their newsletter. <a href="https://twitter.com/denk_tweets?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Tyler Denk</a>, the lead engineer behind the program, <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/how-morning-brews-referral-program-built-an-audience-of-1-5-million-subscribers-3315482c1aa5">wrote an excellent summary</a> of it. </p><p>You never doubted the authenticity of the battle when Toby and Alex launched this competition, Twitter users such as <a href="https://twitter.com/APompliano">Anthony Pompliano</a>,  <a href="https://twitter.com/polina_marinova">Polina Marinova Pompliano</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JuiceboxCA">Jack Appleby</a> chose sides. This amplified it. Instead of it being a contest between Alex and Toby, it was a battle that enlisted the help of a variety of different Twitter users.</p><p>Authenticity rules the day. It's been a recurring theme in my articles. The companies that win tell the truth and remain consistent in their culture. Consider taking a page from the Morning Brew playbook. Figure out how to empower your employees, reward your users and have them buy into your success. Toby ended up getting to 10K followers first, but the real winner was Morning Brew. </p></div></div></div>]]>

				<div><div><div><div><div><p><span>Why do transit-infrastructure projects in New York cost 20 times more on a per kilometer basis than in Seoul? W</span><span>e investigate this question across hundreds of transit projects from around the world. We have created a database that spans more than 50 countries and totals more than 11,000 km of urban rail built since the late 1990s. We will also examine this question in greater detail by carrying out six in-depth case studies that take a closer look at unique considerations and variables that aren’t easily quantified, like project management, governance, and site conditions.</span></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to figure out how to deliver more high-capacity transit projects for a fraction of the cost in countries like the United States. Additionally, we hope that our site will be a useful resource for elected officials, planners, researchers, journalists, advocates, and others interested in contextualizing transit-infrastructure costs and fighting for better projects.</p>

<p>Originally Published in <i>Psychological Review</i>, 50, 370-396.</p></center>

<p><i><span size="-1">Posted August 2000</span></i></p>



<center>
<p>[p. 370] I. INTRODUCTION</p></center>

<p>In a previous paper (<a href="#r13">13</a>) various propositions were
presented which would have to be included in any theory of human motivation
that could lay claim to being definitive. These conclusions may be briefly
summarized as follows:
</p><blockquote>1. The integrated wholeness of the organism must be one of
the foundation stones of motivation theory.
<p>2. The hunger drive (or any other physiological drive) was rejected
as a centering point or model for a definitive theory of motivation. Any
drive that is somatically based and localizable was shown to be atypical
rather than typical in human motivation.
</p><p>3. Such a theory should stress and center itself upon ultimate or basic
goals rather than partial or superficial ones, upon ends rather than means
to these ends. Such a stress would imply a more central place for unconscious
than for conscious motivations.
</p><p>4. There are usually available various cultural paths to the same goal.
Therefore conscious, specific, local-cultural desires are not as fundamental
in motivation theory as the more basic, unconscious goals.
</p><p>5. Any motivated behavior, either preparatory or consummatory, must
be understood to be a channel through which many basic needs may be simultaneously
expressed or satisfied. Typically an act has more than one motivation.
</p><p>6. Practically all organismic states are to be understood as motivated
and as motivating.
</p><p>7. Human needs arrange themselves in hierarchies of pre-potency. That
is to say, the appearance of one need usually rests on the prior satisfaction
of another, more pre-potent need. Man is a perpetually wanting animal.
Also no need or drive can be treated as if it were isolated or discrete;
every drive is related to the state of satisfaction or dissatisfaction
of other drives.
</p><p>8. <i>Lists</i> of drives will get us nowhere for various theoretical
and practical reasons. Furthermore any classification of motivations [p.
371] must deal with the problem of levels of specificity or generalization
the motives to be classified.
</p><p>9. Classifications of motivations must be based upon goals rather than
upon instigating drives or motivated behavior.
</p><p>10. Motivation theory should be human-centered rather than animal-centered.
</p><p>11. The situation or the field in which the organism reacts must be
taken into account but the field alone can rarely serve as an exclusive
explanation for behavior. Furthermore the field itself must be interpreted
in terms of the organism. Field theory cannot be a substitute for motivation
theory.
</p><p>12. Not only the integration of the organism must be taken into account,
but also the possibility of isolated, specific, partial or segmental reactions.
It has since become necessary to add to these another affirmation.
</p><p>13. Motivation theory is not synonymous with behavior theory. The motivations
are only one class of determinants of behavior. While behavior is almost
always motivated, it is also almost always biologically, culturally and
situationally determined as well.</p></blockquote>
The present paper is an attempt to formulate a positive theory of motivation
which will satisfy these theoretical demands and at the same time conform
to the known facts, clinical and observational as well as experimental.
It derives most directly, however, from clinical experience. This theory
is, I think, in the functionalist tradition of James and Dewey, and is
fused with the holism of Wertheimer (<a href="#r19">19</a>), Goldstein
(<a href="#r6">6</a>), and Gestalt Psychology, and with the dynamicism
of Freud (<a href="#r4">4</a>) and Adler (<a href="#r1">1</a>). This fusion
or synthesis may arbitrarily be called a 'general-dynamic' theory.
<p>It is far easier to perceive and to criticize the aspects in motivation
theory than to remedy them. Mostly this is because of the very serious
lack of sound data in this area. I conceive this lack of sound facts to
be due primarily to the absence of a valid theory of motivation. The present
theory then must be considered to be a suggested program or framework for
future research and must stand or fall, not so much on facts available
or evidence presented, as upon researches to be done, researches suggested
perhaps, by the questions raised in this paper.[p. 372]
</p><center>
<p>II. THE BASIC NEEDS</p></center>

<p><i>The 'physiological' needs</i>. -- The needs that are usually taken
as the starting point for motivation theory are the so-called physiological
drives. Two recent lines of research make it necessary to revise our customary
notions about these needs, first, the development of the concept of homeostasis,
and second, the finding that appetites (preferential choices among foods)
are a fairly efficient indication of actual needs or lacks in the body.
</p><p>Homeostasis refers to the body's automatic efforts to maintain a constant,
normal state of the blood stream. Cannon (2) has described this process
for (1) the water content of the blood, (2) salt content, (3) sugar content,
(4) protein content, (5) fat content, (6) calcium content, (7) oxygen content,
(8) constant hydrogen-ion level (acid-base balance) and (9) constant temperature
of the blood. Obviously this list can be extended to include other minerals,
the hormones, vitamins, etc.
</p><p>Young in a recent article (<a href="#r21">21</a>) has summarized the
work on appetite in its relation to body needs. If the body lacks some
chemical, the individual will tend to develop a specific appetite or partial
hunger for that food element.
</p><p>Thus it seems impossible as well as useless to make any list of fundamental
physiological needs for they can come to almost any number one might wish,
depending on the degree of specificity of description. We can not identify
all physiological needs as homeostatic. That sexual desire, sleepiness,
sheer activity and maternal behavior in animals, are homeostatic, has not
yet been demonstrated. Furthermore, this list would not include the various
sensory pleasures (tastes, smells, tickling, stroking) which are probably
physiological and which may become the goals of motivated behavior.
</p><p>In a previous paper (<a href="#r13">13</a>) it has been pointed out
that these physiological drives or needs are to be considered unusual rather
than typical because they are isolable, and because they are localizable
somatically. That is to say, they are relatively independent of each other,
of other motivations [p. 373] and of the organism as a whole, and secondly,
in many cases, it is possible to demonstrate a localized, underlying somatic
base for the drive. This is true less generally than has been thought (exceptions
are fatigue, sleepiness, maternal responses) but it is still true in the
classic instances of hunger, sex, and thirst.
</p><p>It should be pointed out again that any of the physiological needs and
the consummatory behavior involved with them serve as channels for all
sorts of other needs as well. That is to say, the person who thinks he
is hungry may actually be seeking more for comfort, or dependence, than
for vitamins or proteins. Conversely, it is possible to satisfy the hunger
need in part by other activities such as drinking water or smoking cigarettes.
In other words, relatively isolable as these physiological needs are, they
are not completely so.
</p><p>Undoubtedly these physiological needs are the most pre-potent of all
needs. What this means specifically is, that in the human being who is
missing everything in life in an extreme fashion, it is most likely that
the major motivation would be the physiological needs rather than any others.
A person who is lacking food, safety, love, and esteem would most probably
hunger for food more strongly than for anything else.
</p><p>If all the needs are unsatisfied, and the organism is then dominated
by the physiological needs, all other needs may become simply non-existent
or be pushed into the background. It is then fair to characterize the whole
organism by saying simply that it is hungry, for consciousness is almost
completely preempted by hunger. All capacities are put into the service
of hunger-satisfaction, and the organization of these capacities is almost
entirely determined by the one purpose of satisfying hunger. The receptors
and effectors, the intelligence, memory, habits, all may now be defined
simply as hunger-gratifying tools. Capacities that are not useful for this
purpose lie dormant, or are pushed into the background. The urge to write
poetry, the desire to acquire an automobile, the interest in American history,
the desire for a new pair of shoes are, in the extreme case, forgotten
or become of sec-[p.374]ondary importance. For the man who is extremely
and dangerously hungry, no other interests exist but food. He dreams food,
he remembers food, he thinks about food, he emotes only about food, he
perceives only food and he wants only food. The more subtle determinants
that ordinarily fuse with the physiological drives in organizing even feeding,
drinking or sexual behavior, may now be so completely overwhelmed as to
allow us to speak at this time (but only at this time) of pure hunger drive
and behavior, with the one unqualified aim of relief.
</p><p>Another peculiar characteristic of the human organism when it is dominated
by a certain need is that the whole philosophy of the future tends also
to change. For our chronically and extremely hungry man, Utopia can be
defined very simply as a place where there is plenty of food. He tends
to think that, if only he is guaranteed food for the rest of his life,
he will be perfectly happy and will never want anything more. Life itself
tends to be defined in terms of eating. Anything else will be defined as
unimportant. Freedom, love, community feeling, respect, philosophy, may
all be waved aside as fripperies which are useless since they fail to fill
the stomach. Such a man may fairly be said to live by bread alone.
</p><p>It cannot possibly be …</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h2 id="a-note-on-bit-wise-operations">A note on bit-wise operations</h2>
<p>Today I read some JavaScript source code and stumbled on a line like
<code>var delta = ~~time;</code>
and I was unsure what that purpose of using <code>~~</code> was.</p>
<p>So I started to research and digging a bit deeper.
It turns out that the binary not operator (<code>~</code>) when applied twice on a floating number (e.g. <code>4.12</code>) returns an integer (<code>~~4.12 = 4</code>).</p>
<p>Why not simply use <code>Math.floor(4.12)</code>?
It turns out that the bit-wise not operator applied twice is quite a bit faster than using the <code>Math.floor</code> method (see <a href="http://rocha.la/JavaScript-bitwise-operators-in-practice">Link</a>).</p>
<p>Let’s wind back a little bit and dig deeper into the workings here, because I’m sure you might be confused by how this works and what this actually does.</p>
<h3 id="the--operator">The ~ Operator</h3>
<p>First of all, the binary not operator (<code>~</code>) basically switches all 1s to 0s and vice versa.
Thus, if you have a binary representation of <code>0111011001</code> and apply <code>~</code> to it, it will be <code>1000100110</code>.</p>
<p>I got a bit more interested in the exact workings, because it turned out, that <code>~4 = -5</code> and <code>~6 = -7</code>, so a positive number becomes its negative number minus one.
Why is this and why does it make sense?</p>
<p>Let’s start with a binary representation of 5:
<code>0101</code></p>
<p><code>~5 = 1010</code></p>
<p>So in this case, <code>1010</code> is supposed to be a representation of <code>-6</code>?</p>
<p>Let’s think about this. So we have 4 bits in the case above, i.e. 4 positions of 0s or 1s.
$2^4$ possibilities to encode with 4 bits, which is 16 different encodings (<code>0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100, 0101, ..., 1111</code>).</p>
<h3 id="number-representation-in-bits">Number representation in bits</h3>
<p>When we want to represent positive and negative numbers using these 4 bits, we have to split these by 2, so we have 8 possibilities for positive numbers and 8 possibilities for negative numbers.
But we also have the 0, so we either need to have one less positive or negative number (usually one less positive).</p>
<p>Alright, let’s build our construct and take the first 8 possibilities for 0 (<code>0000</code>) and the positive numbers 1 (<code>0001</code>) through 7 (<code>0111</code>).</p>
<p>Now the question is how to represent the negative ones.</p>
<h4 id="option-1-negative-flag">Option 1: Negative Flag</h4>
<p>One “natural” option would be to just use the highest bit to switch between positive and negative numbers like a flag.
Thus, <code>1001 -&gt; -1</code>, <code>1010 -&gt; -2</code> and so forth.
But then, what is <code>1000</code>? Is it another representation of 0? And is <code>1000 == 0000</code> ??? Seems ugly, right?</p>
<p>Another problem here is the mathematical operations. Let’s add some numbers in this representation, say add 1 and -1:</p>
<p><code>0001 + 1001 = 1010</code></p>
<p><code>-1 + 1 = -2</code> ? Not so great, right?
Thus, in this represenation we would have to differentiate between positive and negative numbers when doing mathematical operations. Bummer.</p>
<h4 id="option-2-twos-complement">Option 2: Two’s Complement</h4>
<p>Typically, in modern architectures what is thus used is called <strong>two’s complement</strong>.</p>
<p>It is the natural evolution to have most mathematical operations in a consistent style.</p>
<p>How? Well, just like using the bits so far, we simply have the highest bit represent a negative value like this:</p>
<p>Let <code>$b_3, b_2, b_1, b_0$</code> be our bit values, then our number simply is:</p>
<p>$num_{10} = -1 * b_3 * 2^3 + b_2 * 2^2 + b_1 * 2^1 + b_0 * 2^0$</p>
<p>leading to</p>
<p><code>$1001 = -1 * 2^3 + 2^0 = -8 + 1 = -7$</code></p>
<p>Let’s add this:</p>
<p><code>0001 + 1001 = 1010</code></p>
<p><code>$1010 = -1 * 2^3 + 2^1$ = -8 + 2 = -6.</code></p>
<p>So <code>1 + (-7) = -6</code> Hooray!</p>
<p>One side effect of the two’s complement representation is that <code>x * -1 = ~x + 1</code> which is <code>~x = -x - 1</code>
or in binary:</p>
<p><code>0001 * -1 = ~0001 + 0001 = 1110 + 0001 = 1111 =</code></p>
<p><code>$-1 * 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0$ = -8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = -1</code></p>
<h3 id="intermediate-summary">Intermediate summary</h3>
<p>Phew, that was quite a bit of work, but so far you learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computers represent integer numbers in the two’s complement representation to have a single value for 0 and convenient ways to perform mathematical operations without having special rules for negative numbers.</li>
<li>The ~ operator on an integer number converts the number from a positive one to a negative one which is one lower than the initial number (<code>~5 = -6</code>).</li>
<li>When you want to get the negative number of a positive one you can thus use ~ and add one (<code>-5 = ~5 + 1</code>)</li>
<li>Using <code>~~</code> on a float cuts off the floating part and returns the integer (<code>~~-3.42 = -3</code>, <code>~~5.23 = 5</code>) and can be faster than Math.floor()</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-about-">What about ~~?</h3>
<p>About that last part - what is the representation of a float and how does that <code>~~</code> part work.
In fact, it was hard to get much information on this, but it turns out that the way this works is that the bitwise operators convert the float to an int before doing the bitwise flip, thus <code>~~5.23 = ~~5 = ~-6 = 5</code>.</p>
<p>More exactly: numbers in JavaScript are stored as 64 bits floating point numbers, but the bitwise operations are performed on 32 bits signed integers, so a conversion occurs before and after the bitwise operation.</p>
<p>The performance part thus seems more related to the overhead the function call is providing.</p>
<p>Be aware though, that for negative numbers <code>~~-3.42 = -3 != Math.floor(-3.42) = -4</code></p>
<p>So, when handling positive numbers, you can use <code>~~</code> instead of <code>Math.floor</code> to gain some performance.</p>
<p>The same holds in PHP: <code>~~</code> is faster than <code>floor()</code> by a matter of about <strong>200%</strong>. However, <code>~~</code> is as fast as is a cast to int: <code>(int)</code></p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Today, we learned that:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>~</code> is the bitwise not operator which flips all 0s to 1s and vice versa.</li>
<li>Signed numbers are represented with the two’s complement which yields <code>~5 = -6</code></li>
<li><code>~~</code> is a performance trick to truncate a floating point number to an integer.</li>
<li><code>~~</code> is like <code>Math.floor()</code> for positive numbers, but not for negative ones as <code>~~-5.93 = -5</code> while <code>Math.floor(-5.93) = -6</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bonus-all-bitwise-operators-in-javascript">BONUS: All bitwise operators in JavaScript</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>x &lt;&lt; y</code>: Returns x with the bits shifted to the left by y places (new bits on the right-hand-side are zeros). This is the same as multiplying x by <code>Math.pow(2, y)</code>.</li>
<li><code>x &gt;&gt; y</code>: Returns x with the bits shifted to the right by y places. This is the same as dividing x by <code>Math.pow(2, y)</code>.</li>
<li><code>x &amp; y</code>: Does a “bitwise and”. Each bit of the output is 1 if the corresponding bit of x AND of y is 1, otherwise it’s 0.</li>
<li><code>x | y</code>: Does a “bitwise or”. Each bit of the output is 0 if the corresponding bit of x AND of y is 0, otherwise it’s 1.</li>
<li><code>~ x</code>: Returns the complement of x - the number you get by switching each 1 for a 0 and each 0 for a 1. This is the same as -x - 1 as explained above.</li>
<li><code>x ^ y</code>: Does a “bitwise exclusive or”. Each bit of the output is the same as the corresponding bit in x if that bit is 0 in y, and it’s the complement of the bit in x if that bit is 1 in y.</li>
</ul>

              <p>Maintainable and readable test code is crucial to establish a good test coverage which in turn enables implementing new features and performing refactorings without the fear of breaking something. This post contains many best practices that I collected over the years of writing unit tests and integration tests in Java. It involves modern technologies like JUnit5, AssertJ, Testcontainers, and Kotlin. Some recommendations might be obvious to you, but some might conflict with what you’ve read in books about software development and testing.</p>

              </p>
              

              
              

<ul>
<li><strong>Write small and specific tests</strong> by heavily using helper functions, parameterized tests, AssertJ’s powerful assertions, not overusing variables, asserting only what’s relevant and avoiding one test for all corner cases.</li>
<li><strong>Write self-contained tests</strong> by revealing all relevant parameters, insert data right in the test and prefer composition over inheritance.</li>
<li><strong>Write dumb tests</strong> by avoiding the reuse of production code and focusing on comparing output values with hard-coded values.</li>
<li><strong>KISS &gt; DRY</strong></li>
<li><strong>Test close to production</strong> by focusing on testing a complete vertical slide and avoiding in-memory databases.</li>
<li>JUnit5 and AssertJ are a very good choice.</li>
<li>Invest in a testable implementation by avoiding static access, using constructor injection, using <code>Clocks</code> and separating business logic from asynchronous execution.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="given-when-then">Given, When, Then</h2>
<p>A test should contain three blocks which are separated by one empty line. Each block of code should be as short as possible. Use subfunctions to shorten these blocks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Given (Input): Test preparation like creating data or configure mocks</li>
<li>When (Action): Call the method or action that you like to test</li>
<li>Then (Output): Execute assertions to verify the correct output or behavior of the action.</li>

<li>Use helper functions for creating data (objects) (<code>createProductWithCategory()</code>) and complex assertions. Only pass those parameters to the helper functions that are relevant for your tests. Use reasonable defaults for the other values. In Kotlin, this is easy by using default arguments. In Java, you have to use method chaining and overloading to simulate default arguments.</li>
<li>varargs can make your test code even more concise (<code>ìnsertIntoDatabase()</code>).</li>
<li>Helper functions can also be used to create simple values more easily. This is even nicer in Kotlin where you can use extension functions for this.</li>

</div></div><div id="c463261"><p>In the Flying-V – originally an idea of TU Berlin student Justus Benad during his thesis project at Airbus Hamburg – the passenger cabin, cargo hold and fuel tanks are integrated in its wing structure. The design is not as long as an Airbus A350, but it has the same wing span. This allows the Flying-V to use the present infrastructure at airports, such as gates and runways. The Flying-V carries about the same number of passengers -&nbsp; 314 in the standard configuration – and the same amount of cargo, 160 m<sup>3</sup>. Project leader at TU Delft, Dr. Roelof Vos: “The Flying-V is smaller than the A350 and has less inflow surface area compared to the available amount of volume. The result is less resistance. That means the Flying-V needs less fuel for the same distance.”</p></div><div id="c463506"><div data-namespace-typo3-fluid="true">

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h6><b>You might have recently heard that</b><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ebay-port-scans-visitors-computers-for-remote-access-programs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <b>eBay is performing port scanning</b></a><b>, while online shoppers are visiting their website. At first glance, it will probably sound a bit strange, as port scanning is an internal network action. As such, it is designed to detect services and should not be related to the regular user browsing experience.</b></h6>
<h6><b>eBay is not alone. According to</b><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/list-of-well-known-web-sites-that-port-scan-their-visitors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <b>Bleeping Computer</b></a><b> a high number of well-established websites are conducting port-scanning. These include top websites like TD Bank, Lloyds Bank, Walmart, Target, Netflix and lots more.&nbsp;</b></h6>
<p>From a technological point of view, the issue of port-scanning has raised an interesting question: how does an external website have access and the ability to conduct internal network scanning and what are their limitations.</p>
<p>This article will shed more light about port-scanning activities. We will explain the technical aspects of it from a website perspective and then we will explore different ways of using it.</p>

<h3><b></b><b>Port Scanning: Technical background&nbsp;</b></h3>
<h6><b>Client &amp; Server</b></h6>
<p><span>When you, as an end-user, are browsing a website, you load the HTML content from the web server which provides most of the</span></p>
<p><span>data you request. While visiting eBay, for example, you get products, pictures, your cart and endless inventory of data about goods. The same loaded HTML also includes a high number of JavaScript codes, that are actually running on your own browser. This is commonly referred to as client-side code.</span></p>
<h6><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Client-Server-300x140.jpg" alt="" width="666" height="312" srcset="https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Client-Server-300x140.jpg 300w, https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Client-Server-768x360.jpg 768w, https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Client-Server.jpg 867w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px"></h6>
<h6><b>The Client-Side Code</b></h6>
<p><i><span>Gartner’s “</span></i><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3986880" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span>Market Guide for Online Fraud Detection</span></i></a><i><span>” indicates that&nbsp; “Contemporary websites have become completely reliant on JavaScript to fulfill their functions”, ranging from collecting usage metrics to serving up ads. According to the guide, many of these JavaScript snippets are provided by third parties.</span></i></p>
<p><span>JavaScript codes can do anything, as if they are the original website code, from user engagement to advanced analytics. For example, in order to improve the user experience, the JavaScript code can load banners, suggesting that you buy a product that is currently on sale. It can also enable customer support and engagement tools, like live chats. This is the code that enables us, as users, to engage and get feedback from a website that actually reacts to our actions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Javascript has the ability to do almost anything today. This is even more true since the introduction of HTML5, that enables the creation of web based applications that can both behave and feel like native mobile apps.You can use JS to open the camera or access the microphone, you can read what your visitors are typing or, you check if they have opened Bluetooth. Practically, everything and yes, you can also use it for port scanning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now, let’s talk about web-sockets.</span></p>
<h6><b>What are WebSockets?</b></h6>
<p><i><span>According to Wikipedia: “WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.”</span></i></p>
<p><span>Put simply, we are all familiar with the fact that website’s communication is done through HTTP requests. These are asynchronous requests, meaning that when you are visiting a webpage, the user’s browser is sending an HTTP request to the server, including additional headers, that add some user data and some request guidelines. In response, the server returns an HTTP response with the webpage’s content.</span></p>
<p><span>As it is an asynchronous request, there is no active channel between the user and server. If it wants to share extra details, like updating a user’s actions, or just requesting additional content, the client will be required to send a new request, with all the header data again, over and over. In many cases this creates an inefficient method of communication, increases the traffic load and affects the user experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For that reason, Web-sockets were introduced, presenting the ability to run a regular TCP request from your own browser. The concept is similar to TCP: a server opens a port, listening to the incoming traffic and in this case, the client, our browser, can create a socket between the client and the server. The socket always requires the external server IP and a listening port. <em>To know more about TCP and sockets visit this recommended<a href="http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/tcpip-ports-sockets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> article</a> explaining it on Steve’s Internet Guide.&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span>Since the user is the one who creates the requests, the user needs to use JavaScript for it. In this case the JavaScript obtains objects that can create and manage web-socket connections to the server. &nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><b>Port-Scanning and JavaScript</b></h3>
<p><span>So how can you run a port scanning with these sets of “tools”? Simple.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The JavaScript code can initiate a websocket request to any location around the world and try to open a socket to it. For example, the selected address can be ‘127.0.0.1’, the loopback address, which is your localhost.</span></p>
<p><span>If you “translate” it to a simple code, you just need to run a list of ports you want, and then try to open a socket for each of them. Once the port is opened, you will know about it.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<pre><i><span>var ports = [80, 443, 445];</span></i>
<i><span>for (var i = 0; i &lt; ports.length; i++) </span></i>
<i><span>{</span></i>
<i><span>var s = new WebSocket("wss://127.0.0.1:" + ports[i]);</span></i>
<i><span>s.port = ports[i];</span></i>
<i><span>}</span></i></pre>
<p><i><span>A basic port-scanning code</span></i></p>
<p><span>The most common way to find out if the port is open is to measure the time until getting a response. Active listening ports will answer immediately. Inactive ports will only be resolved when a timeout threshold happens. These are the indications that are helping us to distinguish whois doing what.</span></p>
<p><span>Some of the most common ports are blocked by browsers to reduce the risk level. Because of this, scanners aren’t able to analyze ports like DNS, SSH, 21. To view the full list, by browser type, go to the following links: </span><a href="https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/list-of-restricted-ports-in-browsers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Chrome</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www-archive.mozilla.org/projects/netlib/portbanning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Firefox</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now that we have discussed how to operate a port-scanning, we can jump on to the next question: WHY?</span></p>

<h3><b>Compromised Hosts Detection</b></h3>
<p><span>Well, there are different reasons to run port scanning. The most essential technique is trying to detect if the client’s host is compromised. The idea in this case is testing several known ports that are commonly used by remotely controlled applications, or by known trojans. This lets you understand which services are currently running on the client host and creates a risk score. Once you realize that, you can decide if you want to allow the user to login to your application or website.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Most of these web port scanners are doing it to protect login pages or checkout pages, which are usually targeted by client-side attacks, third-party skimming and, man in the browser attacks. Port scanning is just an additional method of understanding who is performing as the host: a regular user or a malicious entity.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><em>Legal or not? Is port-scanning allowed?</em></p>
<h6><b>Is Port-Scanning Allowed? </b></h6>
<p><span>The first question we should ask ourselves in this case should be – is this behavior illegal? According to the Wikipedia article “Port-Scanning”: </span><i><span>“Because of the inherently open and decentralized architecture of the Internet, lawmakers have struggled since its creation to define legal boundaries that permit effective prosecution of</span></i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_crime" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <i><span>cyber-criminals</span></i></a><i><span>. Cases involving port scanning activities are an example of the difficulties encountered in judging violations. Although these cases are rare, most of the time the legal process involves proving that an intent to commit a break-in or unauthorized access existed, rather than just the performance of a port scan”</span></i></p>
<p><span>Web port scanning doesn’t necessarily fall under the category of illegal, as the action is conducted to detect breaches and increase the protection level of websites.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But, for many users this action would be perceived as highly intrusive, one that is being done without their consent. In such cases, the obvious option should be to alert users before the action is done, or at least, update the website’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>eBay, and other sites mentioned above, are using port-canning capabilities to enhance the security level of the website and to protect their users. </span><span><br>
</span><span>But this same technique can also be used for malicious purposes. For example, an attacker can scan the open services you currently run on the host to detect vulnerabilities that can be exploited, either through the website or, by other means. No matter how you look at it, we mustn’t forget that port scanning is considered as one of the basic steps of accumulating information before conducting an attack.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><b>As a website owner, am I in danger?</b></h3>
<p><span>The answer is yes, and no. In the cases mentioned here we saw how eBay is running the port scanning, probably relying that their user will consider it essential and therefore consent. Now let’s go back to the beginning of this article and remember what JavaScripts can do, and that port scanning is conducted by JavaScript. It means that every third-party application, or a 4</span><span>th</span><span>-party, that is running on your website can carry out the same actions. It also means that once one of your third or fourth party apps are breached, or even just releasing a new version that is trying to access some local resources, you, as the website owner, won’t be able to know about it, or block it.</span></p>
<p><span>The consequences include reputation damages, privacy issues, as well as an indication of a breach.</span></p>
<p><span>How can you detect port-scanning? A dynamic browser security solution (like Reflectiz) can easily detect any type of port scanning from the site origins or iFrames.&nbsp;</span></p>

                            <p>Unless we’ve been hiding under a rock, there’s a very good chance we’ve heard of the latest excitement in Ethereum Layer 2 scaling — Rollups.</p><p>Ethereum gas prices hit an all-time high (ATH) of more than 477 Gwei this week, perhaps foretelling the arrival of Twei’s (szabo’s) sometime soon.</p><p>The network hasn’t been this congested since the ICO days of 2017 — it’s arguably much worse now. The block gas limit is at an ATH of 12.5 million. The transaction count hit levels of 2017 peak and the block size is also at an ATH.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/B1DnOduU0M-NHMIz-sE9iocvYTSkU7p2QcORPbsPi7hLFyDEuqKBxgY_cjUJipGRXbW17saW19kkhlJ0Cg2kf955qPobIGaI26wtUcMuoahtKcGMVW055Cnr3WMKFeeDLrA9sd-f" alt=""></figure><p>While this is encouraging news for the increased utility of the Ethereum network (at least by these metrics), one can argue that the current scalability (or lack thereof) of the base layer is considerably limiting applications and significantly hindering user experience. But, this is not a new realization. The Ethereum community foresaw this problem years ago and has been exploring numerous solutions ever since.</p><p><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/">Ethereum 2.0</a> with Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and sharding in Layer 1 is the biggest ongoing effort and we will soon start seeing rollout of its phase 0 in coming months. However, computational scaling (i.e. state execution in shards with smart contracts) in Eth2 will only happen in phase 2, which is currently anticipated in 2021+.</p><blockquote><em>All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection - </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wheeler_(computer_scientist)#Quotes"><em>David Wheeler</em></a></blockquote><p>Layer 2 solutions effectively introduce a level of indirection by resolving transactions at their layer while going to Layer 1 <em>only</em> when necessary. Several <a href="https://medium.com/l4-media/making-sense-of-ethereums-layer-2-scaling-solutions-state-channels-plasma-and-truebit-22cb40dcc2f4">categories</a> of such solutions — State Channels, Sidechains, Plasma — have been explored by multiple projects for many years now and have seen considerable progress and evolution. </p><p>Most recently, Bitfinex’s Tether — that powers USDt, the largest stablecoin by market capitalization and consistently in the <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/">top</a> Ethereum gas consumers — <a href="https://tether.to/tether-usdt-integration-live-on-omg-network/">switched</a> to <a href="https://omg.network/">OMG Network</a>’s More Viable Plasma Layer 2 solution.</p><p>Reddit’s “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hbjx25/the_great_reddit_scaling_bakeoff/">The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off</a>” contest to help scale its Ethereum-based “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/community-points">Community Points</a>” program (currently implemented only on two subreddits) to all its users has seen 22 submissions across these various Layer 2 solutions.</p><p>However, note that Layer 1 and Layer 2 scaling solutions are not mutually exclusive — they’re <em>multiplicative</em>. </p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6pCInKJtXhcNPMTb9ATwBkIoFvjmXo-rdFlclCpORjKN3mi1N2_TPCay-TVNMDq60oaEyT_WMUbQCTwRlVYNUAV7k2PEMLUKelNoRRSx25CdDDDQVj__5-ApRgV55F1exNkg1tOx" alt=""></figure><p>So while Ethereum 2.0 rolls out in phases over the next couple of years, Layer 2 solutions hope to provide the much needed scalability until then and even beyond.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/I3zvOWSr65Qff2_8YSLra9CMXl45Y4R17KPz8V8WC6IkkAriT6vtUhIOFARSqRd4DO6FJQVhV3PJu0ZGi8lhd_P6t7k__MWmkd9kLLip4RJNNagyVDgpvHly_eR4QluKMe9nZiqr" alt=""></figure><p>State Channels and Plasma projects dominated Layer 2 explorations in the last couple of years but the category of Rollups is lately seeing considerable excitement and gaining real traction.</p><p>So in this article, we dive into Rollups and summarize the <em>why</em>, <em>what</em> and <em>who</em> aspects. We review conceptual ideas of the two broad categories of Rollups — ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups — and then reference some of their leading implementations. Finally, we touch upon the various initiatives at Status Network that could benefit from Layer 2 scaling and project where we may be headed in the near future.</p><h2 id="rollups-why">Rollups: Why?</h2><p><strong>Basics</strong>: Scaling solutions that are built <em>on top</em> of Ethereum without requiring any changes to the underlying base Layer 1 protocols are known as <em>Layer 2 solutions</em>. They resolve transactions without always requiring interactions with the Ethereum network. They anchor their security guarantees to the base layer of Ethereum via smart contracts. </p><p>Layer 2 solutions are appealing because there can be multiple such solutions running on Ethereum <em>only</em> for specific applications that are Layer 2 aware and enabled without requiring <em>everyone</em> to upgrade the base layer infrastructure (which is a significant effort involving a lot of risk). While they don’t always offer the same level of security and finality guarantees as Layer 1, they could be sufficient enough for certain applications that require increased throughput, decreased costs and a better overall user experience than what Layer 1 offers currently.</p><p>The most promising Layer 2 solutions until recently were State Channels and Plasma.</p><p><strong>State Channels</strong> are typically best suited for applications where the number of participants is well defined, need to exchange many state updates over time and have strong availability guarantees to account for challenge periods. <a href="https://connext.network/">Connext Network</a> is a representative example of a project that is currently using State Channels to help scale DApps.</p><p><strong>Plasma</strong> was <a href="http://plasma.io/plasma.pdf">introduced</a> in August 2017 by Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Poon. It is a <a href="https://www.learnplasma.org/">framework</a> for scaling where assets are transferred into/out-of child chain(s) via a smart contract on the root chain, all transaction execution happens on child chain(s) with state commitments (via Merkle root created from all state updates in the block) posted to the root chain which may later be used in fraud proofs during exits to the root chain. There have been many variants of Plasma proposed including Minimum Viable Plasma, More Viable Plasma, Cash, Debit and Prime. OMG Network’s More Viable Plasma is a recent example of a Plasma project that has seen market adoption.</p><p><strong>Drawbacks:</strong> The biggest drawback of State Channels is its <em>liveness assumption</em> — users or their representatives need to be constantly monitoring Layer 1 to be available for any challenges. And Plasma not only inherits this liveness assumption but also has a <em>data availability <em>assumption — </em></em>users need to trust the operators to make available all the transaction data required to verify correctness if/when required. In the absence of that, they could exit the Plasma chain but that could lead to a mass exit problem in the worst-case scenario. Also, both State Channels and Plasma do not support smart contracts, in general, which severely limits applications that require EVM compatibility<em>.</em></p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/iFK6VIk2xTwYWkPRM4MeoRJqFQXfTBp2q98vcKxWhsuZCg5UJRax_hi0x7mebn0CdoOFKoiHe5nSq4Q3gj9_hzNzewFOcduT5Ivtq7feZd5ZZkpLRstIKYYMKMoUavENfySbQ16_" alt=""></figure><p>Looking at the comparative <a href="https://medium.com/matter-labs/evaluating-ethereum-l2-scaling-solutions-a-comparison-framework-b6b2f410f955">illustration</a> above, Rollups do not need to make the two described limiting assumptions that could be a deal breaker in many scenarios. This makes Rollups more promising than State Channels and Plasma for a wide variety of applications.</p><p>So let’s look at what Rollups are and why they do not have the limiting assumptions of State Channels and Plasma.</p><h2 id="rollups-what">Rollups: What?</h2><p>Rollups are very similar to Plasma with one big difference to avoid its data availability assumption — all Layer 2 transactions are “rolled up” into a block which is committed to Layer 1 in one transaction’s calldata (calldata is the read-only area where data parameters of an Ethereum transaction are held).</p><p>Given that calldata is much cheaper than Layer 1 storage, this approach allows Layer 2 transaction data — unlike only the Merkle root in Plasma — to be available on Layer 1 anytime someone needs it for validating a state transition. So Layer 2 data once committed is always available on Layer 1. This property removes the requirements of both liveness and data availability assumptions giving Rollups the edge over both State Channels and Plasma.</p><p>Depending on the approach to validating state transitions, there are two types of Rollups: ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups.</p><p><strong>ZK Rollups (ZkR)</strong>: In ZkR, operator(s) must generate a <a href="https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/">zk-SNARK</a> validity proof for every state transition on Layer 2 and submit these to the Rollup contract on Layer 1 which verifies that there are valid proofs for state transitions to go from the old Merkle root to the new one. The guarantees here are cryptographic in nature, albeit using novel primitives.</p><p><strong>Optimistic Rollups (OR)</strong>: In OR, operator(s) submit the new Merkle root along with transaction data to the Rollup contract on Layer 1 and everyone optimistically moves forward with the assumption that this is a valid transition (without verifying like in ZkR) but if not, one of the participants will challenge it with a fraud proof. The guarantees here are cryptoeconomic in nature because operators are incentivized to be honest with token rewards along with staking and slashing.</p><p>To summarize from a <a href="https://medium.com/matter-labs/optimistic-vs-zk-rollup-deep-dive-ea141e71e075">deep-dive</a> comparative analysis, ZkRs today are best suited for token transfers with faster time-to-finality (~1-20 minutes) but do not support EVM-compatible smart contracts for generalized applications. In contrast, ORs today are best suited for applications requiring EVM-compatible smart contract support but with the downside of slower time-to-finality (~1-2 weeks) by default to account for the fraud proof challenge window. (There are however techniques to provide economic guarantees for achieving faster finality or withdrawal times with ORs.)</p><h2 id="rollups-who">Rollups: Who?</h2><p>There are multiple projects working on ZkR and OR implementations with different assumptions and properties suitable for different scenarios.</p><p><strong>ZkR</strong>: <a href="https://zksync.io/">zkSync</a> from Matter Labs is live on Ethereum mainnet. Loopring has <a href="https://blogs.loopring.org/loopring-pay-is-live-zkrollup-transfers-on-ethereum/">launched</a> a DEX and payments using ZkR. <a href="https://medium.com/starkware/with-starkex-ethereum-is-ready-for-reddit-3b2966d5203b">StarkEx</a> from StarkWare is a ZkR technology that uses <a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-starks/">zk-STARK</a> (instead of zk-SNARK) and therefore is not dependent on a trusted setup, more scalable and currently quantum resistant.</p><p><strong>OR</strong>: There are at least nine projects working on different variations of OR as shown in the below comparison table from this <a href="https://medium.com/molochdao/the-state-of-optimistic-rollup-8ade537a2d0f">article</a>. The biggest differentiators are support for EVM compatibility and the interactivity requirements of challenges with fraud proofs. For example, <a href="https://blog.celer.network/2020/07/20/introducing-the-celer-hybrid-rollup-testnet/">Celer</a>, <a href="https://nutberry.github.io/">Nutberry</a> and <a href="https://optimism.io/">Optimism</a> support EVM-compatible smart contracts with single-round fraud proofs.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/bHAtV-TfsdLmZO5xfcXeViZLo0sd8TWlKUsx82qmkYuUF6RC0D8ezzViIav2Re1XoSJqWKCXKf5jtK5BQDxThOrkRjPU8SglEr_BpPonOv-b0asmcRMwiypiR_oVVeaVFpWlp1nH" alt=""></figure><h2 id="status-network">Status Network</h2><p>A big part of the vision at Status is being the “Window onto Ethereum.” While <a href="https://status.im/">Status Messenger</a> does not interface directly with the Ethereum blockchain, the app bundles a secure crypto wallet and web3 browser which interact with Ethereum and therefore are directly affected by the soaring gas prices due to the aforementioned scalability challenges. </p><p>The <a href="https://keycard.tech/">Keycard</a> product which is part of <a href="https://statusnetwork.com/">Status Network</a> is exploring a <a href="https://discuss.status.im/t/keycard-for-payments-proof-of-concept-and-a-demo/1590">payments network</a> whose design requirements of credit-card level scalability and near-instant finality are not fulfilled by the Ethereum network today.</p><p>Additionally, there are numerous other initiatives within Status Network such as <a href="https://discuss.status.im/t/kudos-rewards-building-the-status-meritocracy/1019">Kudos rewards</a>, <a href="https://github.com/status-im/tribute-to-talk/blob/master/docs/TributeToTalk.md">Tribu…</a></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<h3>Learn how to maximize the predictive accuracy of the MACD using actionable insights from a data driven analysis.</h3>

The darkest green can be observed at 47%, 48%, and 49%, meaning those accuracy’s can be trusted the most.</figcaption></figure>



<p id="01b5">The MACD is a momentum-focused price indicator. It utilizes the exponential moving averages of the last 12 and 26 days’ closing price to predict future trends. After analyzing the historical data of over a thousand companies, I can confidently state that you will make more money doing the opposite of what the MACD technical indicator recommends. <strong>At an average accuracy of 49%, equity traders have better odds moving money flipping a coin (pun intended) than using this momentum oscillator.</strong></p>



<p id="f0f0">In the process of incorporating it into my algorithmic trading program, I stumbled upon some eye-opening findings about the MACD — findings that prove its recommendations are nothing but preconceived notions. In fact, I found that it is statistically more beneficial to do the opposite of what this momentum signal advises. Using data-driven techniques, I also found some better ways to utilize this indicator, and maximize its predictive accuracy.</p>



<p id="6809">Insights lead to opportunity. From this analysis, I discovered the following about the MACD:</p>



<ul><li>It is 49% accurate at predicting the future price movements of a random stock.</li><li>Which stocks have the highest probability of having their future prices forecast correctly, as well as which ones have the lowest.</li><li>Whether it is more fruitful to act on a bullish or bearish crossover (sensitivity vs specificity).</li></ul>



<p id="a62e">If you are skeptical as to how I came to these results, I published a full walk-through of the code and calculation process I devised. You can learn more about it&nbsp;<a href="https://handsoffinvesting.com/how-to-calculate-the-macd-using-python/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="0866">Accurate Predictions 49% of the Time</h2>



<p id="b755">I will now offer a brief explanation of my data driven analysis process. For this study, I picked the 1,028 companies with the highest market capitalization. Then, I imported the daily historical data for each one (five million total records). Next, I isolated each stock and calculated multiple variables, such as the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and more. Using these values, I was able to gauge how well the MACD predicted price swings, at an overall, as well as individual company basis.</p>



<p id="51a6">After running this process on all 1028 stocks, as well as filtering out some outliers, I was able to obtain an overall predictive accuracy of 49%. This means, that if you did exactly what the MACD recommended every time a signal-line crossover occurred, you would be profitable on less than half of your trades. Hence the idea that flipping a coin can result in more favorable odds than blindly using the MACD as a predictive tool.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/1531/1*Ck8YLqOlOJFBsi4trKWzfw.png?w=1140&amp;ssl=1" alt="A graph showing that the average accuracy of the MACD is 49%." data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/1531/1*Ck8YLqOlOJFBsi4trKWzfw.png?w=1140&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>The predictive accuracy of the MACD technical indicator, when averaged over 1,028 of the highest market-cap stocks, is 49%.</figcaption></figure>



<hr>



<h2 id="2bd3">The Top and Bottom 10 Stocks Ranked by MACD Accuracy</h2>



<p id="fae8">Now, I want to focus on the best strategies for trading equities using this technical indicator. In the chart below you will see the best 20 stocks to focus on when trading the MACD. These are the companies that, historically, have the highest and lowest predictive accuracy out of the 1,028 stocks I analyzed. For the top 10 stocks (green), their historical data showed that it would’ve been the most profitable to trade them by leveraging the recommendations of the MACD. Whereas, for the bottom 10 stocks (red), it would’ve been the most advantageous to do the opposite of what the MACD advocated.</p>



<p id="2e6c">In this visualization, it is important to note that volume should also play a significant role in the interpretation of a stock’s potential. The higher the volume of signal line crosses, the larger the sample size for the predictive accuracy.</p>

<h2 id="3d83">What Type of Crossover is the Most Accurate (Sensitivity vs Specificity)</h2>



<p id="f828">Sensitivity represents the accuracy of the MACD at predicting future price movements, following a bullish crossover. Whereas, specificity shows the predictive accuracy after a bearish crossover. In these box-plots we see that, in my analysis, sensitivity had a median value of 52.8%, while specificity was 45.8%. From this very general visualization, it appears the MACD’s recommendations are more accurate for bullish crossover events. That being said, I’m not advising anyone to make financial decisions based off this analysis.</p>

<h2 id="4998">Takeaways</h2>



<p id="68ac">In a perfect world, I would’ve liked to have access to more crossovers for this data driven analysis. From the 1,028 companies that I studied, there was only about 400,000 signal line crosses that I could use to test the accuracy of the MACD. In order to cross validate my analysis, I also ran the program using two other observational time periods. These tests resulted in a predictive accuracy of 49% as well. I also attempted to test the long term MACD indicator, but the volume of observed signal line crosses was too low to draw any conclusions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.thomascountz.com/2018/07/11/ownership-in-rust-part-2"><em>Ownership in Rust, Part 2</em> →</a></p><p>As a Rubyist, all that I know about memory allocation is that it’s handled by some process called garbage collection and that it’s <a href="https://medium.com/u/64e4f5eee153">Aaron Patterson</a>’s problem, not mine.</p><p>So, when I cracked open the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/">Rust Book</a> and saw that one of Rust’s defining features is its alternative to garbage collection, I became a bit worried.</p><p>Was the responsibility of dealing with memory management about to be heaped onto me?</p><p>Apparently, with other system programming languages, like C, dealing with memory allocation is a big deal, and can have significant consequences when done poorly.</p><p>With all of the other new things to learn, I felt things beginning to stack up.</p><p>No, its not a hipster clothing brand, the stack and heap are ways of managing memory at runtime.</p><p><img src="https://www.thomascountz.com/assets/images/stack_and_heap.png" alt="Stack &amp; Heap"></p><p>First, we have the <strong>stack</strong>. The stack is considered fast because it stores and accesses data based on <em>order</em>. The last thing that was placed — pushed — onto* *the stack is the first thing removed — popped — from the stack. This is referred to as *LIFO, *Last In First Out, and means that we only need to keep track of where the top of the stack is when it comes time to free up memory.</p><p>The stack can also be fast because the amount of space needed from the stack is known at <em>compile</em> time. This means that we can allocate a fix-size portion of memory before we store anything into it.</p><p>For example, if you know that four people are coming to your dinner party, you can decide ahead of time where everyone will sit, how much food to prepare, and practice their names before they get there. This is super efficient!</p><p>Next, we have the alternative, the <strong>heap</strong>. When you don’t know exactly how many people are coming to your dinner party ahead of time, you can use the heap. Using the heap means finding extra chairs and giving out name tags as more and more people arrive to your dinner party.</p><p>When data of unknown-size needs to be stored during runtime, the computer searches for memory on the heap, marks it, and returns a <em>pointer</em>, which points back to that place in memory. This is called <em>allocating</em>. You can then push this pointer onto a stack, however, when you want to retrieve the actual data, you need to follow the pointer back to the heap.</p><hr><p>As I keep digging into the stack &amp; heap rabbit hole, it seems like managing data in the heap can be difficult. For example, you need to ensure that you allow the computer to reallocate a place in memory once you’re done using it. But if one part of your code <em>frees</em> a place in memory that another part of your code still has a pointer to, funky things can happen.</p><blockquote><p>Keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap, minimizing the amount of duplicate data on the heap, and cleaning up unused data on the heap so you don’t run out of space are all problems that ownership addresses.</p></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/">Rust Book</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><img src="https://www.thomascountz.com/assets/images/ownership.png" alt="Ownership"></p><p>There are three rules about ownership in Rust:</p><div><div><pre><code>Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its *owner*.

There can only be one owner at a time.

When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
</code></pre></div></div><p>The simplest illustration of this ownership magic is with variable scope:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>hello</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Hello, World!"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>hello</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span> <span>// variable `hello` is now invalid</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>Once the current function scope is over, denoted by the <code>}</code>, the variable <code>hello</code> goes out of scope, and is <em>dropped</em>.</p><p>“Well, duh!” That’s what I thought when I first read this. This is the same in most other programming languages. This is what I know as the behavior of a “locally-scoped variable.”</p><p>If this is all ownership does, I’m not sure what all the hubbub is about.</p><p>However, things get more interesting when we start passing around values and switching from using a string literal, which is stored on the stack, to using a <code>String</code> type, which is stored on the heap.</p><div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>hello</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Hello, World!"</span><span>;</span> <span>// string literal</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>hello1</span> <span>=</span> <span>hello</span><span>;</span> <span>// copy the value of `hello` and bind it to `hello1`</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>hello</span><span>);</span> <span>// this works!</span>
  
  <span>let</span> <span>hello</span> <span>=</span> <span>String</span><span>::</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, World!"</span><span>);</span> <span>// `String` type</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>hello1</span> <span>=</span> <span>hello</span><span>;</span> <span>// move the data of `hello` into `hello1`</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>hello</span><span>);</span> <span>// error[E0382]: use of moved value: `hello`</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>We can see here, that when using a string literal, Rust is <em>copying</em> the value of <code>hello</code> into <code>hello1</code>, as we might expect. But when using a <code>String</code> type, Rust <em>moves</em> the value instead. Rust tells us that we attempted to retrieve a valued that has been moved by throwing the error:<code>error[E0382]: use of moved value: 'hello’</code></p><p>It seems like when using a string literal, Rust will <em>copy</em> the value of that one variable into another variable, but when we use a <code>String</code> type, it <em>moves</em> the value instead.</p><p>In order to find out which types implement the <em>copy trait</em> “…you can check the documentation… but as a general rule, any group of simple scalar values can be <code>Copy</code>, and nothing that requires allocation or is some form of resource is <code>Copy</code>”</p><h4 id="why-not-copy-everything">Why Not Copy Everything?</h4><p><em>Updated June 13, 2018</em></p><p><em>For the related discussion which lead to this update, please visit this <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/the-copy-trait-what-does-it-actually-copy/18730/24">Rust language forum thread</a>.</em></p><p><img src="https://www.thomascountz.com/assets/images/copy_trait_when_using_str.png" alt="Copy trait when using &amp;str"></p><p>The string literal, <code>"Hello, World!"</code>, is stored somewhere in read-only memory, <em>(neither in the stack nor heap)</em>, and a pointer to that string is stored on the stack. Because it’s a string literal, it usually shows up as a <em>reference</em>, meaning that we use a pointer to a string stored in permanent memory, <em>(see <a href="https://medium.com/@thomascountz/ownership-in-rust-part-2-c3e1da89956e">Ownership in Rust, Part 2</a> for more on references)</em>, and it’s guaranteed to be valid for the duration of the entire program, (it has a <em>static lifetime)</em>.</p><p>Here, the pointers stored in <code>hello</code> and <code>hello1</code> are using the stack. When we use the <code>=</code> operator, Rust pushes a new copy of the pointer stored in <code>hello</code> onto the stack, and binds it to <code>hello1</code>. At the end of the scope, Rust adds a call to <code>[drop](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.6.0/std/ops/trait.Drop.html)</code> which pops the values from the stack in order to free up memory. These pointers can be stored and easily copied to the stack because their size is known at compile-time.</p><p><img src="https://www.thomascountz.com/assets/images/move_trait_when_using_the_heap.png" alt="Move trait when using the heap"></p><p>Over on the heap, the <code>String</code> type with value <code>"Hello, World!"</code> is bound to the variable <code>hello</code> , using the <code>String::from</code> method. However, unlike the string literal, there’s more data bound to <code>hello</code> than just a pointer, and the size of this data can change during runtime. Here, the <code>=</code> operator binds the data from <code>hello</code> to a new variable <code>hello1</code>, effectively *moving *the data from one variable to another. Poor <code>hello</code> is now invalid, as per ownership rule #2: “There can only be one owner at a time.”</p><p>But why do this? Why doesn’t Rust always just make a copy of the data and bind it to the new variable?</p><p>If we think back to the differences between the stack and heap, we remember that the size of data stored on the heap is not known at compile time, which means we need to run through some memory allocation steps during runtime. This can be expensive. Depending on how much data we’re storing, we could quickly run out of memory if we sit around making copies of data all day.</p><p>Besides that, the default behavior of Rust helps protect us from memory issues that we might run into in other languages.</p><p>Part of storing data on the heap, is store a pointer to that data on the stack. However, unlike using a pointer to locate read-only memory, <em>like when using a string literal</em>, the data at the end of the pointer that leads to the heap, can change. A pointer is part of the <code>&lt;&lt;DATA&gt;&gt;</code> that is bound to the <code>hello</code> variable that stores the <code>String</code> type. If we bind the same pointer data to two different variables, it might look something like this:</p><p><img src="https://www.thomascountz.com/assets/images/rough_sketch_of_copying_string_type_data.png" alt="A rough sketch of copying String type data"></p><p>We have two variables, <code>hello</code> and <code>hello1</code>, which share ownership of the same value. This violates rule #2: “There can only be one owner at a time,” but let’s keep going.</p><p>At the end of the scope in which <code>hello</code> and <code>hello1</code> are defined, we have to <em>drop</em> the memory in the heap, which frees it up to be used again elsewhere.</p><p><img src="https://www.thomascountz.com/assets/images/dropping_hello1.png" alt="Dropping hello1"></p><p>First, we call <code>drop</code> on the data stored at the end of the pointer bound to <code>hello1</code>, but what happens now when we call <code>drop</code> on <code>hello</code>, next?</p><p><img src="https://www.thomascountz.com/assets/images/double_free_error.png" alt="Double Free Error"></p><p>This is called a <em>double free error</em>, which I think is best summarized in this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/21057524">Stack Overflow answer</a>:</p><blockquote><p>A double free in C, technically speaking, leads to <em>undefined behavior</em>. This means that the program can behave completely arbitrarily and all bets are off about what happens. That’s certainly a bad thing to have happen! In practice, double-freeing a block of memory will corrupt the state of the memory manager, which might cause existing blocks of memory to get corrupted or for future allocations to fail in bizarre ways (for example, the same memory getting handed out on two different successive calls of <code>malloc</code>).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Double frees can happen in all sorts of cases. A fairly common one is when multiple different objects all have pointers to one another and start getting cleaned up by calls to <code>free</code>. When this happens, if you aren’t careful, you might <code>free</code> the same pointer multiple times when cleaning up the objects. There are lots of other cases as well, though.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>—<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/501557/templatetypedef"> templatetypedef</a></p></blockquote><p>This is what Rust is trying to prevent! By invalidating <code>hello</code>, the compiler knows to only make a call to <code>drop</code>, (which calls <code>free</code> behind the scenes), on <code>hello1</code>.</p><hr><p>This is all well and good, but there are instances when we <em>do</em> want to copy data that’s stored in the heap. Rust provides an easy way of doing that with <code>clone()</code>.</p><div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>hello</span> <span>=</span> <span>String</span><span>::</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, World!"</span><span>);</span> <span>// `String` type</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>hello1</span> <span>=</span> <span>hello</span><span>.clone</span><span>();</span> <span>// clone data from `hello` into `hello1`</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>hello</span><span>);</span> <span>// =&gt; "Hello, World!"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>Keep in mind that calls to <code>clone()</code> can be expensive, which is why Rust prevents this “deep copying” by default.</p><hr><p>Apparently, there’s a lot more about Rust ownership than covered here; there are concepts called <em>borrowing, referencing</em>, and <em>slicing</em>, too!</p><p>So far, it seems like learning about ownership is more to do with navigating Rust’s memory management solution than it is to learn about the problem it solves. But, instead of taking it as a quirk of the language, the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/">Rust Book</a> encourages you to learn about why the language writers were eager create a safer language.</p><p><a href="https://www.thomascountz.com/2018/07/11/ownership-in-rust-part-2">Read <em>Ownership in Rust, Part 2</em> →</a></p></section></div>

    <p>TL;DR: My band <a href="https://fb.com/enaehq" target="_blank">ENAE</a> has released a first single, called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-2EpUqb9g" target="_blank">The System</a>. Song is 100% DIY (from writing to recording to mixing to producing to releasing) and the music video is written 100% in Go!</p>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>I always had a soft spot for interesting movies. Of course, I like the good story as much as the next guy, but the visual aspect can make me fall in love with a movie. I won’t even count how many times I’ve watched Guy Richie’s Sherlock Holmes (both movies actually), What We Do In The Shadows, Blade Runner or anything by Quentin Tarantino.</p>

<p>One thing that glues all of these movies together is that they do something really fresh from the very beginning - apart of the great story, they push the limit of visual aspect.</p>

<p>And I wanted to do the same with first <a href="https://fb.com/enaehq" target="_blank">ENAE</a> single. I’m a DIY guy and the visual aspect of things isn’t my strongest suit so, being a dev, what can I do?</p>

<p>Well, I can program the nerdiest music video you have seen so far.</p>


<h2 id="why-would-you-program-a-music-video">Why would you program a music video?</h2>

<p>Because I can.</p>

<p>No, really, this is the major thing why I’ve done it. I’ve thought that going nerdy and seeing how far I can push my knowledge about some stuff will be a fun project. Also I needed an excuse to brush off my sight reading and music transcription skills!</p>

<p>Before we go any further, I recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-2EpUqb9g" target="_blank">The Video</a>. so we’ll set the playing field - I’ll refer to it a few times!</p>

<p><a href="#top">Go to Top</a></p>


<h2 id="where-to-start">Where to start?</h2>

<p>There’s three parts to getting the song ready to be programmed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, sheet notation of your song. Helps with the timings and you don’t have to do the math yourself;</li>
  <li>Second, lyrics. Basically, what I’ve made is a more complicated lyrics video;</li>
  <li>Third, final mix version. As the timings might change, you don’t want to redo the whole video because your mix has changed.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve started mocking the video a long before we’ve finished the final mix, but I’ve started actual programming literally the day we’ve agreed on the mix.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Go to Top</a></p>


<h2 id="getting-the-sound">Getting the sound</h2>

<p>Getting the sound was actually the easiest bit - I’ve used <a href="https://github.com/faiface/beep" target="_blank">Beep by Faiface</a> in it’s most raw form:</p>

<p><strong>player.go</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

  <span>})))</span>

  <span>&lt;-</span><span>done</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>done</code> is the channel I use to notify the main goroutine that play/print has finished. As it’s a music video, high-quality mp3 file is sufficient enough to be lightweight and good sounding.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Go to Top</a></p>


<h2 id="getting-the-first-characters-to-print">Getting the first characters to print</h2>

<p>The main file, that deals with all the things to print is, unsurprisingly, <code>printer.go</code>. Let’s break it down:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>var</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>// notes</span>
  <span>fullnote</span>         <span>int</span> <span>=</span> <span>1678</span>
  <span>halfnote</span>         <span>int</span> <span>=</span> <span>839</span>
  <span>quaternote</span>       <span>int</span> <span>=</span> <span>420</span>
  <span>eightnote</span>        <span>int</span> <span>=</span> <span>210</span>
  <span>sixteenthnote</span>    <span>int</span> <span>=</span> <span>105</span>
  <span>thirtysecondnote</span> <span>int</span> <span>=</span> <span>52</span>
  <span>sixtyfourthnote</span>  <span>int</span> <span>=</span> <span>26</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In order to be able to print stuff properly, you need to get a tempo of the song and the duration of each note in milliseconds. The formula to do that is really simple:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>60000 / BPM = one beat in millisecond</p>
</blockquote>

<p>BPM (Beats per minute) is the song tempo, one beat refers to a quater note. So, in case of <em>The System</em>, where the BPM is 143, it’s:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>60000 / 143 = 420 (rounded up)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This way, I’ve calculated all necessary note durations that I’ll need to print.</p>

<p>Moving on:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>Sized</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll touch on <code>Sized</code> struct a while later; for now, you can see how the song was built.</p>

<p>I’ve divided the chorus into 4 small chunks (in case I want to change only a part of it). <code>verse1</code> and <code>verse2</code> are a tiny bit different in the approach - one is typewriting (printing one character per x milliseconds), second one is Star-Wars-esque “Text is going up” using frames.</p>

<p>Before we go into the rhythm part of the music video, there are three very important functions in <code>printer.go</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>cleanDisplay</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>\x1b</span><span>[2J"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>moveCursor</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>moveCursor</span><span>(</span><span>row</span><span>,</span> <span>col</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>\x1b</span><span>[%d;%df"</span><span>,</span> <span>row</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>col</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>noteRest</span><span>(</span><span>note</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Sleep</span><span>(</span><span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Millisecond</span> <span>*</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Duration</span><span>(</span><span>note</span><span>))</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we delve into the nitty-gritty of the whole system - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code">Ansi escape codes</a>. In case of my music video, I’ve used a few:</p>

<p>in <code>printer.go</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>\x1b[2J</code> - all escape codes starts with <code>\x1b</code>, which is ASCII representation of ESC. <code>[2J</code> means to clear the whole display;</li>
  <li><code>\x1b[%d;%df</code> - <code>[%d;%df</code> moves the cursor to a given position</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’ll talk about noteRest in a second!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>in <code>colours.go</code>:</p>

<p>(First, let’s bring the functions here)</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>resetColourChanges</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Print</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>\x1b</span><span>[0m"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>as the function name says, it reset colour changes to default;</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>colourText</span><span>(</span><span>colour</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>bright</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>bright</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>\x1b</span><span>[9%vm"</span><span>,</span> <span>colour</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>\x1b</span><span>[3%vm"</span><span>,</span> <span>colour</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>colourText</code> is a wrapper around printing from basic palette of 8 colours (black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white) in bright (<code>[9</code>) variant or in normal - let’s call it plain (<code>[3</code>);</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>colourTextRGB</span><span>(</span><span>red</span><span>,</span> <span>green</span><span>,</span> <span>blue</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>\x1b</span><span>[38;2;%v;%v;%vm"</span><span>,</span> <span>red</span><span>,</span> <span>green</span><span>,</span> <span>blue</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is the function I ended up using - I’ve found a way to print the colours using RGB values - the loading bar you see before the solo starts is done using this magical thing!</p>

<p><a href="#top">Go to Top</a></p>


<h2 id="rhythm">Rhythm</h2>

<p>Remember <code>noteRest</code>? It’s nothing else than a wrapper around <code>time.Sleep</code>. To print time-based frames, I used <code>printInMicroseconds</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>printInMicroseconds</span><span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>spd</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>speed</span> <span>:=</span> <span>spd</span> <span>*</span> <span>1000</span>
  <span>freq</span> <span>:=</span> <span>(</span><span>float64</span><span>(</span><span>speed</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>float64</span><span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>)))</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>);</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"%v"</span><span>,</span> <span>string</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]))</span>
    <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Sleep</span><span>(</span><span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Microsecond</span> <span>*</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Duration</span><span>(</span><span>freq</span><span>))</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Why <em>Microseconds</em> instead of <em>Milliseconds</em> you ask? The reason for that is sometimes the lyrics aren’t really divisible by the millisecond duration of the note in a nice fashion. That’s why, I’m converting milliseconds to microseconds and then printing. Check <code>verse1.go</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>...</span>
<span>func</span> <span>verse1</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>printInMicroseconds</span><span>(</span><span>verse1_1_1</span><span>,</span> <span>halfnote</span><span>+</span><span>quaternote</span><span>)</span> <span>// 3/1</span>
  <span>printInMicroseconds</span><span>(</span><span>verse1_1_2</span><span>,</span> <span>quaternote</span><span>)</span>          <span>// 1/1</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Sometimes some part of the lyrics will have to stay longer than pre-defined note duration. Because notes in the code are <code>int</code>, we can add them and then the function takes care of it!</p>

<p><a href="#top">Go to Top</a></p>

<p>And now,</p>


<h2 id="binary-solo">Binary solo</h2>

<p>This is the part, I think, I’m most proud of. The function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>*</span><span>Sized</span><span>)</span> <span>printNoteInBinary</span><span>(</span><span>note</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>speed</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>toBinary</span> <span>string</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>note</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>toBinary</span> <span>+=</span> <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Sprintf</span><span>(</span><span>"%b "</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>freq</span> <span>:=</span> <span>(</span><span>float64</span><span>(</span><span>speed</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>float64</span><span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>toBinary</span><span>)))</span> <span>// to microseconds</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>toBinary</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"%c"</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span>
    <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Sleep</span><span>(</span><span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Millisecond</span> <span>*</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Duration</span><span>(</span><span>freq</span><span>))</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The function itself is nothing crazy, but the approach to printing is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>...</span>
<span>// 1st bar</span>
<span>s</span><span>.</span><span>printNoteInBinary</span><span>(</span><span>"D"</span><span>,</span> <span>fullnote</span><span>)</span>
<span>s</span><span>.</span><span>printNoteInBinary</span><span>(</span><span>"F"</span><span>,</span> <span>fullnote</span><span>)</span>
<span>s</span><span>.</span><span>printNoteInBinary</span><span>(</span><span>"G"</span><span>,</span> <span>halfnote</span><span>)</span>
<span>s</span><span>.</span><span>printNoteInBinary</span><span>(</span><span>"A"</span><span>,</span> <span>halfnote</span><span>)</span>
<span>s</span><span>.</span><span>printNoteInBinary</span><span>(</span><span>"C"</span><span>,</span> <span>fullnote</span><span>)</span>
<span>cleanDisplay</span><span>()</span>
<span>// 2nd bar</span>
<span>noteRest</span><span>(</span><span>eightnote</span><span>)</span>
<span>s</span><span>.</span><span>printNoteInBinary</span><span>(</span><span>"A"</span><span>,</span> <span>sixteenthnote</span><span>)</span>
<span>s</span><span>.</span><span>printNoteInBinary</span><span>(</span><span>"C"</span><span>,</span> <span>sixteenthnote</span><span>)</span>
<span>s</span><span>.</span><span>printNoteInBinary</span><span>(</span><span>"D"</span><span>,</span> <span>eightnote</span><span>)</span>
<span>s</span><span>.</span><span>printNoteInBinary</span><span>(</span><span>"G"</span><span>,</span> <span>quaternote</span><span>)</span>
<span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Remember at the beginning, I’ve told that we’d need a sheet music? Without that, programming this solo would be extremely painful. Each note gets converted to a binary representation and then gets printed within the note duration.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You might notice, that there’s a pointer to <code>Sized</code> here - reason for that is, I’ve iterated over multiple versions of the solo and thought the one now is the best looking one. In case someone would like to print it anywhere else on the screen, they can, because they know the terminal size already!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#top">Go to Top</a></p>


<h2 id="last-scene">Last scene</h2>

<p>The last scene is an interesting one, because there’s a very small chance that it’ll look the same ever.</p>

<p>Each time you run this music video in the terminal, it’ll be different, because the “frame cleanup” is truly randomized. I’ve spent a while thinking about how to pull this off and went with this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’ve prepared nice ASCII art of the last chorus</li>
  <li>Then I’ve formatted it</li>
  <li>Populated the display with <code>:</code></li>
  <li>The randomly destroyed what I need</li>
</ul>

<p>Sounds easy? Once I had figured it out, it actually was! So, let’s take a closer look at the functions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All functions are in chorus_last.go</p>
</blockquote>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>*</span><span>Sized</span><span>)</span> <span>formatLine</span><span>(</span><span>str</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>add</span> <span>:=</span> <span>int</span><span>(</span><span>math</span><span>.</span><span>RoundToEven</span><span>((</span><span>float64</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>width</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>float64</span><span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>)))</span> <span>/</span> <span>2</span><span>))</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>pre</span><span>,</span> <span>post</span> <span>string</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>add</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pre</span> <span>+=</span> <span>":"</span>
    <span>post</span> <span>+=</span> <span>":"</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>f</span> <span>:=</span> <span>pre</span> <span>+</span> <span>str</span> <span>+</span> <span>post</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)</span> <span>!=</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>width</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>f</span><span>[</span><span>:</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>f</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As each display will be different, the art needs to be formatted - which basically means adding <code>:</code> at the beginning and the end until the whole width of the display is used.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>*</span><span>Sized</span><span>)</span> <span>generateLine</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>str</span> <span>+=</span> <span>char</span>

<h2>What it is:</h2>







<div>
<div>
<div><p>The PanoCamAdder is a small addon for Blender.</p><p>It is helpfull to create 3D models from equirectangular panoramas.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<figure><img src="https://der-mische.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PanoCamAdder-CAM.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://der-mische.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PanoCamAdder-CAM.jpg 472w, https://der-mische.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PanoCamAdder-CAM-282x315.jpg 282w" sizes="(max-width: 472px) 100vw, 472px"></figure>
</div>
</div>



<div>
<p>Download it for free from here:</p>




</div>



<p><strong>It does three things for you:</strong></p>



<ul><li>It adds a 360°-viewer camera setup.</li><li>It creates a Material with a panorama-texture node.</li><li>It creates a World setup with a desaturated panorama for the background.</li></ul>



<p><strong>You can add multiple PanoCams, Materials and Worlds to each file!</strong></p>



<p>That’s all… </p>



<p>But it is not needed more, to use 360° Panoramas as reference to create a 3D model!</p>



<hr>



<h2>For what is it usefull?</h2>







<p>You can use all the features of Blender to create different things with the model later on.</p>



<p>Use texture-baking to create beautiful <strong>dollhouses</strong> or scenes for a <strong>game engine</strong>.</p>



<p>You can export the model also as STL file, to use it inside <strong>KRpano</strong> as Depthmap. But therefore you must prepare it manually before (tutorial is coming soon).</p>



<h2>How it works:</h2>







<div>
<p>Enter a name for your panorama and press the „Add PanoCam“ button.</p>



<div>
<figure><img src="https://der-mische.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PanoCamAdder-panel.jpg" alt="PanoCamAdder panel"></figure>
</div>
</div>



<p>This will create:</p>



<ul><li>A Material „<strong>PanoName_MAT</strong>„</li><li>A World „<strong>PanoName_WORLD</strong>„</li></ul>



<p>And it adds three objects to the scene:</p>



<ul><li>A camera „<strong>PanoName_CAM</strong>„</li><li>An emty „<strong>PanoName_EMPTY</strong>„</li><li>And another empty „<strong>PanoName_ROT</strong>„</li></ul>



<p><strong>The „PanoName_EMPTY“ is the mainhandle for the camera-location and the panorama-rotation.<br>Move it to position the camera, rotate it to turn the panorama.</strong></p>



<div><p>The „PanoName_CAM“ is the 360°-Viewer for the current panorama. Press NumPad-0 to activate the camview, hold and drag the middle mouse button to look around. <br>If you use more than one PanoCam in your scene, you must activate different cameras for each window. Go to the VIEW tab, tick „use local camera“ and select a camera from the dropdown menue.</p><p>The „PanoName_ROT“ is needed for the world-setup. Just leave it where it is and ignore it. 😉</p></div>



<hr>



<h2>Start modelling</h2>







<p>To start modelling, add a plane to the scene and apply the „PanoName_MAT“. Load your panorama to the Material. Keep sure the plane is at (0/0/0) and move the „PanoName_EMPTY“ to the corecct camera-height (very important!)<br>If you wanna see a desaturated panorama in the background, select the „PanoName_WORLD“ in the World settings.<br>Activate Viewport-Shading to make the Material visible. Tick Scene-World to make the background-panorama visible, too.</p>



<p>As you can see, you need more Blender knowledge for this one.<br>So I recoment you to learn some Blender basics first!</p>



<p>Everything, the camera height for example, must be set up manually. There is neither a „Make ExportReady“ button.. If you wanna use the 3D model for KRpano, you must prepare it manually.</p>



<p><strong>If you are totaly new to Blender, it is maybe better to start with the <a href="https://der-mische.de/panoblender/">PanoBlenderAddon</a>.<br>On the other side, you can also use the PanoCamAdder  to learn Blender with it.</strong></p>



<hr>



<h2>What’s next?</h2>







<div><p>For now I wanna do more tests with the PanoCamAdder. <br>I will try to find an easy workflow to prepare the model(s) for using it with KRpano.</p><p>I will try to create an additional Mask-Material. This could be helpfull, if you wanna bake multiple panorama-textures and layer them in Photoshop or any other image-editing application later on.</p><p>Anyway, I think this is a good startpoint for a new PanoBlenderAddon version.</p></div>

    <p>In recent months, I've noticed a dramatic increase in TypeScript packages on GitHub. I usually come across them when checking repositories of the people I follow like. Or, when I'm looking for dependencies to solve a problem in my projects. And the more TypeScript packages I'm encountering, the more often I get reminded of this little annoyance towards the project.</p>
<p>My context is that I've not looked into TypeScript yet. That means I have no idea how it works. Unfortunately, this is now starting to become kind of a problem when searching for dependencies. It does, when I either willingly or accidentally include a TypeScript package into my projects. Mainly because my package-choosing criteria include:</p>
<ul>
<li>picking packages that I potentially can contribute to (e.g., a lesser-known package that contains well-written code); or</li>
<li>picking packages that are well-maintained by a large community but may include code that I'd not be able to easily contribute to (e.g., a popular package using a C library internally)</li>
</ul>
<p>I've put these criteria in place willingly to achieve a certain quality standard when building applications. Either because I can fix bugs myself quickly, or because I'm able to rely on a strong community to fix them. However, with TypeScript packages in npm, there's now this opaque problem of not knowing the language or quickly telling a package's language and its community size. Also, TypeScript could be just another CoffeeScript.</p>
<p>So essentially, the problem is that TypeScript authors publish their packages on npm, the package manager for Node.js. And to me, that's what is weakening the JavaScript ecosystem. Since its inception, and throughout trends like Coffeescript, npm has mostly held the promise of only hosting JavaScript packages. However, this promise is <code>rejected()</code> (lol) by many authors publishing their TypeScript-to-JavaScript transpiled packages.</p>
<p>Indeed, it makes sense considering that Microsoft markets TypeScript as a "superset of JavaScript" and since it "compiles" to JavaScript, why not publish packages to npm? But in terms of equality and identity, TypeScript is not JavaScript. After all, you'd not consider C and Objective-C the same either, or would you? In both examples, the languages are subsets/supersets but were conceived with different goals in mind to solve other problems.</p>
<p>Therefore, TypeScript authors should, in my opinion, do something along the following lines:</p>
<ul>
<li>namespacing their TypeScript packages; or</li>
<li>build and publish their packages to their package manager.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, continuing to publish TypeScript packages to npm is, in my opinion weakening the JavaScript ecosystem as it's splitting its community and polluting the npm namespace.</p>
<h2 id="controversy">Controversy</h2>

<li>For a short time, there was an <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24344506" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intense conversation</a> on Hacker News. But for unknown reasons, my post got marked as <code>[flagged]</code>. I've written an email to the operators.</li>

		<div>

			
<p>In brief, second-party data is essentially customer data, directly purchased from the initial data collector, which is why it’s frequently referred to as the so-to-speak “someone else’s first-party data.”</p>



<p>Similarly to 1st-party data, 2nd-party data frequently includes information about people’s website / app usage, social media activity, as well as customer survey results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Upon a purchase, such <a href="https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IAB_Defining-the-Data-Stack_2018-12-05_Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data sets</a> are usually merged with brands’ first-party data, primarily for audience targeting purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Third-party vs Second-party Data&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>While third-party data basically implies purchasing of data segments, initially obtained from various publishers across the Web, indirectly, i.e. via data aggregators/data brokers, second-party data requires direct deals with first-party data collectors.</p>



<p>This difference actually explains why second-party data deals have gained traction over the past several years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The thing is, not only is 3rd-party data non-exclusive and often poorly-converting, the lack of transparency on consent verification for the syndicated data collection can in fact result in a buyer’s being held legally accountable for privacy law (e.g. GDPR or CCPA) violations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, 2nd-party data unlocks brands’ access to the high-quality niche data, which is more accurate, more precise and, certainly, more transparent in terms of collection.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Benefits of Second-party Data</strong></h4>



<p>From a brand’s perspective, obtaining 2nd-party data may be an essential step towards developing an efficient marketing strategy, i.e. scaling their customer data analysis, hence expanding audience reach and improving behavior predictions.</p>



<p>From a publisher’s perspective, second-party data deals unlock yet another source of incremental revenue for content creators, while keeping their audience data protected in a policy-controlled environment.</p>



<h4><strong>Potential Challenges with Second-party Data</strong></h4>



<p>While 2nd-party data deals can foster trust and collaboration between businesses on the supply and demand side, this is only possible in case no competition or any other conflict of interest between the parties is involved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another potential challenge for marketers is to ensure continuous quality control of the data obtained from the seller, while keeping it scalable enough to reach their business goals.</p>

<p><strong>Team Health is the most important KPI for dev leads. Monitor these vital signs during your iteration to identify problems early and prevent developer burnout.</strong></p>







<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-DevTeamHeatlh-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-DevTeamHeatlh-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-DevTeamHeatlh-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-DevTeamHeatlh-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-DevTeamHeatlh.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<p>Many of us in software are working longer and harder than ever before. Being at home all day, every day, is blurring the lines between work and home life. On one hand, this work from home experience is wholesome and humanizing. Seeing your boss holding a newborn or wrestling with a curious five year old during product strategy meetings adds a new perception and understanding to the workplace. Something that was often not found in the workplace. Unfortunately the same coin has another side.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As family life blends into worklife, the opposite is happening as well. It’s all too easy to get pinged on slack after dinner and say “I’ll just send that over real quick.” No one wants to be the blocker afterall. This type of always-on mentality is something that many companies are learning to combat because it is unhealthy and a leading indicator of bigger issues down the road.</p>



<p>Keeping the teams pulse at your fingertips is one of the necessary challenges of the team lead.</p>



<p>In a lot of ways the team’s pulse is something that is felt, an intuition if you will. In other ways it is something that can be measured, like work output changes. Great leaders work hard to combine their intuition with quantitative data, providing them with powerful insights into their teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m not sure I can help you feel the pulse of your team, but I can share the quantitative data I watch at a team and individual level that helps me identify unhealthy behaviors before they become larger issues.&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>Top Development Team Health Indicators to Watch:&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Consecutive Days Worked</li><li>Number of Open Tasks per Team Member&nbsp;</li><li>Unfocused Work&nbsp;</li><li>High levels of Rework</li><li>Number of bugs/fire drills per Iteration&nbsp;</li><li>Team Members Acting Out of Character</li></ul>







<h3><strong>Consecutive Days Works</strong></h3>



<p>At LinearB we run 2 week sprint cycles, meaning my team has 10 good working days to accomplish our sprint goals. At larger companies with hundreds of developers, seeing developers log on 11 out of the 14 days might be the norm. This includes being on-call during a sunday night merge or answering a quick slack message on a Saturday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At smaller companies who employ only a handful of developers, all of which are all at home all day, it’s much more regular to see 12, 13, 14 days logged in per sprint. This is okay during some sprints, big launch weeks for example, but when my lead developer is working at least some of every day for multiple sprints, that is unhealthy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Consecutive days worked is a leading indicator of team member health. It is the job of the team lead to step in and be the responsible people manager. It’s like putting a 7 year old to bed, they are tired, you know they are tired, but they fight it anyways. If tomorrow is going to be a good day, we need to disconnect, mentally and physically. If you see your people working consecutively, if you find yourself working consecutively, start enforcing mandatory downtime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<h3><strong>Number of Open Tasks Per Team Member</strong></h3>



<p>Work balance across development teams has gotten much better over the years. As a team lead myself, I take an active role in knowing what everyone is working on and making sure our more experienced developers aren’t taking on more than they should be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the LinearB development team we flag anyone who has more than six tasks open at any one time. What does the flag mean? It means I need to take some time to listen.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HhnBNyuucwSW4izcb67TqIob-muhIgydmmJFZnAKQywAho1TjxqFjwoS0inGjESzsxCTPW-wyHsucNKlPmjuH1c-Knxc51JkfCleTea78xzP5RWD3TM_k7dLVzEcMPnPK2SaTijF" alt=""><figcaption>LinearB’s Custom Workflow Alerts</figcaption></figure>







<p>There may be a good reason why Oriel has 6 active branches right now, or it might mean that I haven’t provided Miki with the right priorities. Either way, knowing the number of open tasks everyone is working on allows me to open a dialogue and keep my team balanced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To keep your team members healthy, stop using individual velocity as a KPI, focus instead on providing the right priorities and keeping the work balanced across your whole team.</p>







<h3><strong>Unfocused Work</strong></h3>



<p>Similar to having too many open tasks, team members who aren’t focusing their efforts on solving one problem before another is a leading indicator of developer burnout. If we take Oriel as the example again, we can see that he is spread across 4 different open tasks and 4 completely different areas of focus. It’s going to be hard for him to immerse himself in any of those problems if he is constantly switching contexts.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><a href="https://linearb.io/demo/"><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-9.02.12-AM-1-1024x507.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-9.02.12-AM-1-1024x507.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-9.02.12-AM-1-300x149.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-9.02.12-AM-1-768x381.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-9.02.12-AM-1-1536x761.png 1536w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-9.02.12-AM-1-2048x1015.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>LinearB Team Pulse View</figcaption></figure>







<p>Another way to identify unfocused inefficient work is to look at the type of output coming from developers who are spread thin. If someone like Oriel, who is often providing several PR reviews a week, hasn’t participated in any reviews during this sprint, I can infer that his time is being taken up in other areas – meetings, support tickets, bugs, etc. While day-to-day operations like these are important, it’s also crucial to make sure your team members have enough time to block out the business and zone in on solving a single problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Identifying people on your team who are spread across several focus areas is an excellent way to prevent developer burnout. Help your people by communicating their priorities and asking what they need so they can focus without switching context.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Time Investment Profile</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-9.04.56-AM-1-1024x688.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-9.04.56-AM-1-1024x688.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-9.04.56-AM-1-300x202.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-9.04.56-AM-1-768x516.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-9.04.56-AM-1.png 1208w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>LinearB’s time investment profile is the quickest way to visualize how time was spent across different ticket types.

<h3><strong>High Levels of Rework</strong></h3>



<p>Frustration is a keen emotion felt by everyone. It often reminds me of fire. It can build up and explode. Or it can be so subtle you don’t even recognize it until it’s a bigger issue. And the best antidote for both is to identify it early and snuff it out. High levels of rework during your sprint is a leading indicator of team frustration. Frustration within your team is scary, because like fire, it can spread very quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A high level of rework during your sprint is often a symptom of misalignment between product and development. It’s an age old story, product says A, development starts working, and three days later, product makes changes to the requirements. Rework due to vague or changing requirements causes frustration for whoever is trying to build the feature.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><a href="https://linearb.io/demo/"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uz-hvE8LkEzs8dyOoaZMQwWtgQPmsH-kwqI29m7hDzsUGhYzVB9yj7Q160E7kY6qDPwF04wPHo9pF-9HQmvzVsgvB-e2We53gxgk71q96QZN8sEiyBu6L2KjPP2_B4mDZJYjvgJi" alt=""></a><figcaption>LinearB’s Work Breakdown Per Iteration</figcaption></figure>







<p>Another way to check for misalignment between product and your dev team is to look at the time between when requirements are finished and the first commit. If that is a short time span, you can infer that your team members trust the product team because the product team has provided enough context for developers to understand why something is being built.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Healthy development teams have a transparent relationship with their product manager.&nbsp;</p>







<h3><strong>Number of Bugs/fire drills per Iteration</strong></h3>



<p>Working on new stuff is fun. You get to explore, discover, and accomplish something different. Working on bugs, fire drills, and support tickets might be seen as less exciting, especially by younger developers. Teams who are working on bugs and support more than 80% of the time tend to get bored and envious of other teams, leading again to our fiery friend frustration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s good to keep an eye on the amount of new work vs refactoring vs bugs during your team’s iteration, and at an individual level. Too much of the latter can be a symptom of much larger code quality issues or headaches that cause stress among the team. Team health is optimized when refactor, bug, and new work is balanced throughout the team.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><a href="https://linearb.io/demo/"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Yg29YSHot-tg4OQLWixNK6tdf2RCqKKatWB6OdKK3DMq5R2yKYS9WbuO2upk5jQwr4DYaLsR8yogXFw2Qjjxwrk3Y-lInekgvAxrTRJextN4ViJBVkrnlLsXUF0LJNKkVGQ0wxXX" alt=""></a><figcaption>LinearB Time Investment Profile</figcaption></figure>







<p>Another way to combat a high amount of bug work is to ask your developers what else they are interested in and try to give them time throughout the sprint to explore the idea. People produce their best work when they are interested in what they are doing.&nbsp;</p>







<h3><strong>Acting Out of Character</strong></h3>



<p>Our final top dev team health indicator to watch is more subjective. People management is hard, and only harder now with everyone distributed. Our 2d world leaves out a lot of the context we as humans have become accustomed to when interacting with each other. But as a team leader, I have to try.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Acting out of character can take a lot of different forms, and it’s the job of the team lead to identify when it’s happening. If someone who normally speaks a lot is all of a sudden quiet during stand up, or the type of work someone usually does has changed significantly, are a couple examples I’ve seen. If you can identify a behavior change, my best advice is to engage that person directly and ask what’s up. Maybe it’s frustration, or home life, or conflict within the team. Whatever the reason, it is the team leader’s responsibility to listen, understand, and lend your resources where you can.&nbsp;</p>







<h3><strong>Tips for Mitigating Dev Team Health Risks</strong></h3>







<h4>1. Give People Tactical Time To Explore</h4>



<p>I like to ask my team members directly what they are interested in working on. What has been triggered in their brain lately. So other teams I know give an 8 hour allotment per sprint to each dev to work on something they are interested in. However you go about doing it, giving people some freedom to explore and discover on their own will almost assuredly make your team happier.&nbsp;</p>







<h4>2. Use Tools That Track Team Vital Signs&nbsp;</h4>



<p>While team leaders most assuredly keep track of their team’s health, it is always helpful to apply tools, automation, and data to provide early identifiers. LinearB plugs into your Project Management tool and Git repository to provide visibility into your overall sprint as well as individual team health. Free tools like LinearB.io give team leads the early indicators they need to run a healthy team.&nbsp;</p>

Well, the first answer is that you build a gaming PC. That was a good project with a lot of incentives to complete, but that also meant it was soon over.  So, what next? I spotted a post about an outreach project from CERN to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/ozel/DIY_particle_detector" target="_blank">build your own particle detector</a> for under £30. Sounded like fun, so here’s how we got on.</p>



<p>Firstly, a bit about ourselves: I’ve just retired from an IT architecture role at a major UK bank, a brave decision when you still have a child at secondary school and there’s a global pandemic looming. My son, Sam, has just completed his GCSEs and is about to enter the sixth form.  I have a degree in Physics and Sam has a keen interest in scientific things. We both suffer from hypermobility of the finger joints, meaning that we have limited fine motor skills (translation: we are both klutzes. Even klutzes can successfully build this detector.) I haven’t picked up a soldering iron in anger for a long time and Sam has only done two or three connections for a school project so we are effectively total noobs to this sort of project.</p>



<p>Anyway, here is a write-up of our experience and lessons learned rfom building the electron detector. If you’re planning on building one yourself then you may find this useful</p>



<h2>Buying the components</h2>



<p>The great thing about the CERN kit is that you can order most of the parts easily using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kitspace.org/boards/github.com/ozel/diy_particle_detector/electron-detector/" target="_blank">kitspace</a>. Can you really build it for under €30 (about £27) as claimed? Well, yes and no. The exchange rates have all moved, which doesn’t help. The individual components certainly cost less than €30 but you cannot just buy individual components. You have to buy 10 resistors at a time but they are dirt cheap and you’ll just end up spending 30p instead of 3p for the parts you need. The biggest surprise was that you have to buy a minimum of three circuit boards, but this turned out to be a blessing in disguise. It’s handy to have a spare board if your soldering skills are questionable, plus the alpha detector variant uses the same board so you have an incentive to build that model too. All-in-all, the cost of all the electronic components same to just under £40. If you were buying for a class project – a dozen or so boards – I think the bulk  price would be closer to £33/€37 per board.</p>



<p>There are some optional costs too that you may want to take into account. We bought a BNC to audio jack cable for about £8 on Amazon as this was quicker, easier and ultimately cheaper than building one from scratch. We also had to buy some tools that we needed but didn’t have in our existing toolbox. You may prefer to buy a metal case or project box for around £6, however I would recommend using an old sweet tin or similar. We used a presentation case off a Fossil watch that my wife received one Christmas.  To mount the board in the case, you’ll need some sort of metal standoff. We bought a box of M3 brass standoffs of assorted lengths with all the necessary screws and bolts for about £11 on Amazon. (120 components when you need only one!) You’ll also need some small lengths of connecting wire – about 30cm in total. (Tip: Amazon Prime is well worth the cost if you need to order all these things as you go along.)</p>



<p>Finally, you are going to need some sort of radioactive source to try out the detector. We bought 100g of analytical quality <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium-40" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potassium chloride</a> (KCl) on Amazon for under £5. This is a better price than that of the potassium-rich salt substitutes that are also on Amazon and has a higher proportion of potassium to boot.</p>



<h2>Tools that you’ll need</h2>

<p>Before you start, make sure that you have all the tools that you’re going to need, Here’s a list of what we found necessary:</p>



<ul><li>A soldering iron with a small tip suitable for the components and board</li><li>A de-soldering pump and braid for when you mess things up</li><li>Small cutting pliers for tidying up excess wires when you’ve soldered a component</li><li>Wire strippers for the ends of the connecting wires</li><li>A small multi-meter for testing joints and checking the board</li><li>A nail punch to make holes in your old tin box</li><li>A file to file down the sharp edges on the holes that you’ve just punched</li><li>Some things to hold the board and components in position while you solder them. We used an old wall tile and a hexagonal pencil.</li></ul>



<h2>Constructing the detector</h2>



<p>We spent about three elapsed hours over about 3 weeks building the board and maybe another hour building the case and mounting the board into it. Why so long? Well, this project didn’t have the same appeal to a 16 year old as does building a gaming PC. Plus, use of said gaming PC frequently took priority over this project. We decided to solder the components in groups, doing the resistors first, then the capacitors then the semiconductors. The build instructions in the wiki are pretty good and easy to follow. </p>



<p>We tested every joint as we soldered it, making sure to test from another point on the circuit board so as to prove the connection was good. My son did all the soldering on one of the PCBs. I started work on a second board partly as a backup and partly to have something that could form the basis of the alpha detector. (I discovered the hard way that the two variants begin to differ at the third component, R3!)</p>



<p>Here are some shots of the board at different stages of construction:</p>

<h2>Testing the detector</h2>



<p>The first thing to do when testing the detector was to make sure that there were no shorts by measuring resistance across the power connectors. (Tick! A satisfactory 9.8 kilo-ohms) and make sure that power was reaching the board. Then we plugged it into a PC and switched it on. We were using the pulse detector JavaScript to check that it was working. I flicked the switch and…nothing. So, we examined the board. We knew we were novice constructors and some of the joints looked potentially to be dry and on one or two others we could not be 100% sure that we had an air gap between adjacent joints so we de-soldered and remade about 3 joints. Again we connected to the PC and we saw the satisfying pulses when the device was turned on and off. We also saw quite a bit of microphony being picked up when the tin was moved or when one of us spoke near it.</p>



<p>Ok, so next step was to try it with a radiation source. I weighed out roughly 10g of KCl into a plastic lid and positioned it under the diodes in the detector. We hadn’t made a radiation window in the lid of the tin and the diodes were about 1.5cm above the surface of the KCl. I switched on the detector and…nothing, not even the on/off pulses. The detector seemed dead.  I took the device apart and retested very connection with the multi-meter and made sure all the case connections were good and that the case was properly wired to earth. I checked that power from the battery was reaching all the necessary parts and that the battery power was good. I could find nothing wrong. </p>



<p>It quickly became apparent that there was an intermittent problem. Sometimes, the JavaScript detector would see a pulse when the device was switched on or off and sometimes – usually – there was nothing. Sometimes you would see noise on the web oscilloscope and sometimes not. I was scratching my head as to what the problem was. Eventually, it occurred to me to try actually listening to the audio output, a trivial thing to do under Windows. BINGO! I could hear white noise when the device was switched on and, just audible over the noise, a soft click every 20-30 seconds. Clearly the detector was working and therefore what I was facing was a software problem.</p>



<h2>The importance of sound cards, and repurposing yet again an ancient laptop</h2>



<p>I have to say that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/ozel" target="_blank">Oliver Keller</a> was an enormous help while I was trying to get the detector working and I cannot stress enough how important it is to listen to his advice about audio connections and sound cards. The problem seems to be that sound cards (or chips) in modern PCs are too clever for their own good. They are designed to optimise microphone input for Skype and Zoom and that means removing the noise and extraneous clicks that are exactly the signal that the detector puts out. </p>



<p>Modern technology was assuming the detector signal was unwanted noise so I needed some primitive technology. I have an old notebook laptop, an Asus EeePC 901. I bought this about 10 years ago and it has been the subject of several hobbyist projects over the years. I upgraded it’s memory to 2GB. I replaced it’s laughably small 4GB SSD with a 32GB one.  I upgraded it from Windows XP Home, via several versions of Ubuntu, to Windows 10 Home. You may be surprised that such a machine can run Windows 10 and MS Office but it can do so, just not well. I backed it up (virtualized it for VMWare) and installed a fresh copy of Lubuntu. I fired up the web oscilloscope under FireFox and now I have a working detector:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="600" src="https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2020-09-01-105609_1024x600_scrot.png" alt="" srcset="https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2020-09-01-105609_1024x600_scrot.png 1024w, https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2020-09-01-105609_1024x600_scrot-768x450.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>You can quite clearly see a detector pulse in the screenshot. The noise sometimes peaks and can give a false reading but these are fairly easy to spot. The false pulses are one sided and lack the rebound peak of a true pulse. From around 25g of KCl, I’m seeing two or three pulses per minute in the detector</p>



<h2>So what comes next?</h2>



<p>OK, now that the detector is working, what comes next? Our first plan is to try out the python script to make sure that we can see and correctly analyze the energy spectrum from the KCl.  Step three will be to try various things to reduce the electrical noise. I have a suspicion that the tin leaks a little light into its interior but that can be remedied with black tape. Step three will be trying out various samples from my small mineral collection in the …</p></div></div>

We got two options:</p><h2>3.1 Using Context.Consumer</h2><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> ProductsPage</code></pre></div><p><code>&lt;ShopContext.Consumer&gt;</code> is a wrapper component we can use to “inject” the Context provided in some parent component (doesn’t have to be the immediate parent) in this child component.</p><p>The <code>context</code> is received as an argument to a function which you pass as a direct child to <code>&lt;ShopContext.Consumer&gt;</code>. That’s important! You don’t (directly) place JSX between <code>&lt;ShopContext.Consumer&gt; ... &lt;/ShopContext.Consumer</code>.</p><p>The <code>context</code> object is the exact same object passed to <code>value</code> on our <code>&lt;ShopContext.Provider&gt;</code> - this means that when the data passed to <code>value</code> changes, the <code>context</code> object in the child component also changes and hence this child component updates. That’s a nice form of updating different components based on some centralized state.</p><h2>3.2 Using static contextType</h2><p>Besides using <code>&lt;ShopContext.Consumer&gt;</code>, we can also get access to our Context by setting a static property in our (class-based) child component. Important: Unlike <code>&lt;ShopContext.Consumer&gt;</code>, which you can use in functional <strong>and</strong> class-based components, this method will only work in class-based (“stateful”) components!</p><p>Side note: With <a href="https://academind.com/learn/react/react-hooks-introduction">React Hooks</a> you also got a way of tapping into Context anywhere in functional components, too.

Greeting from a bunch of&nbsp;<em>post-April-Fool bunnies</em>&nbsp;who never managed&nbsp;to get their modules published on time — because they were simply too busy eating <em>Easter eggs</em> and <em>shooting for the moon</em>. &nbsp;🙂</p><p>Moving onto a more serious topic though, if you’re currently into&nbsp;(or have been into) this thing called <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/calculus-analysis-symbols/#Derivative_and_Integral" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>integral calculus</strong></a>, you might know from first-hand experience&nbsp;that integration in general is no easy task. After all, most of us&nbsp;spend at least a semester honing different methods of integration, which include — among others —&nbsp;the&nbsp;techniques&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>Substitution</strong>, <strong>Partial Fraction</strong> and I<strong>ntegration By Parts</strong>.</p><p>In what follows though, we will share with you a powerful technique for&nbsp;finding <strong>antiderivatives</strong>&nbsp;— possibly without paper and pen. We call&nbsp;this technique&nbsp;the <strong>Overshooting Method</strong>, which — as we shall see later — can even be just as efficient as several <strong>standard integration techniques</strong> combined.<span id="more-5619"></span></p><h2 id="basic"><span id="The_Overshooting_Method_%E2%80%94_Basic_Ideas"></span><a href="#toc">The Overshooting Method — Basic Ideas</a><span></span></h2><p>So what is this <em>marvelous</em> technique you ask? Well, the short answer is that it&nbsp;can be found&nbsp;in the header image above. What? <strong>Overshooting</strong>, of course! 🙂</p><p>More specifically, given a function $f$, the <strong>Overshooting Method</strong> consists in finding an antiderivative of $f$ first by&nbsp;<em>guessing</em> a <strong>potential candidate</strong>, and then checking to see how <em>close</em>&nbsp;the candidate&nbsp;<em>differentiates</em> to $f$.</p><p><span>In the event where&nbsp;the&nbsp;derivative is off, but <em>only</em> by an <strong>additional term</strong></span><span>&nbsp;or a </span><strong>multiple</strong><span>, then additional steps can be implemented to correct this discrepancy, thereby transforming a&nbsp;potential candidate into a <em>valid</em> antiderivative of $f$.</span></p><p>All right. That’s about as intuitive and accurate as it gets. In <strong>formal terms</strong> though, this is&nbsp;what the&nbsp;technique would look like <em>in a nutshell</em>:</p><div><p>Theorem 1 — The Overshooting Method</p><div><p>Given a function $f$ defined on an interval $I$, if there exists another function $F^*$ such that:</p><ul><li>$(F^*)’ = kf$ on $I$ for some <em>non-zero</em> number $k$ (i.e., $F^*$ is off by a <strong>multiple</strong>), then the function $\dfrac{F^*}{k}$ constitutes&nbsp;a&nbsp;valid&nbsp;antiderivative of $f$ on $I$.</li><li>$(F^*)’=f + g$ on $I$ for some function $g$, with $\displaystyle \int g$ being one of its own antiderivatives on $I$ (i.e., $F^*$ is off by a <strong>term</strong> that is itself <em>antidifferentiable</em>), then the function $\displaystyle F^* – \int g$ constitutes a valid antiderivative of $f$ on $I$.</li></ul></div></div><p>OK. Enough of the <a href="https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/">mathematical jargon</a>? Let’s move on to how we can apply the Overshooting Method to integrate all kinds of functions then!</p><h2 id="multiple"><span id="The_Overshooting_Method_%E2%80%94_Adjusting_for_Multiples"></span><a href="#toc">The Overshooting Method — Adjusting for Multiples</a><span></span></h2><p>As it turns out, when a potential antiderivative&nbsp;is off by <em>only</em> a <strong>multiple</strong>, it’s not hard to readjust it so as to produce a valid antiderivative. In fact, learning to adjust for a multiple paves the way for more complex applications of the Overshooting Method, which can take a bit more<em>&nbsp;insight</em> and&nbsp;<em>ingenuity</em> to be executed elegantly.</p><p>With that in mind, here are 16 examples illustrating how the Overshooting Method can be used to integrate certain <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/algebra-symbols/#Key_Functions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>elementary functions</strong></a> with ease. These include a good chunk of <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/geometry-trigonometry-symbols/#Trigonometric_Functions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trigonometric functions</a>, exponential functions, power functions and trig-substitution functions.</p><h3 id="trig"><span id="Trigonometric_Functions"></span><a href="#toc">Trigonometric Functions</a><span></span></h3><h4 id="cos"><span id="Cosine_Functions"></span><a href="#toc">Cosine Functions</a><span></span></h4><p>To find an antiderivative of a function like $6\cos (2x+4)$, for instance, we start by noticing that since this&nbsp;function&nbsp;behaves very much like $\cos x$, we can try to integrate it&nbsp;<em>as if</em> we were dealing with&nbsp;$\cos x$. With this insight, the idea of&nbsp;$\sin (2x+4)$ being a <em>potential</em> antiderivative of&nbsp;$6\cos (2x+4)$ naturally comes to mind.</p><p>Before we move on though, let’s check&nbsp;how well this idea works out:</p><p>\begin{align*}[\sin (2x+4)]’ &amp; =\cos (2x+4)(2x+4)’ \\ &amp; = 2\cos (2x+4)= \frac{6\cos (2x+4)}{3} \end{align*}</p><p>So, $\sin (2x+4)$ is <em>off</em> by a multiple of $\dfrac{1}{3}$ as a result of <a href="https://mathvault.ca/chain-rule-derivative/">chain rule</a>. To get rid this multiple, we multiply our <em>potential antiderivative</em> by $3$, yielding that:</p><p>\begin{align*}\displaystyle [3\sin (2x+4)]’ &amp; =3\, [\sin (2x+4)]’\\ &amp; = 3\, \frac{6\cos (2x+4)}{3} \\ &amp; = 6\cos (2x+4) \qquad (\text{for all } x \in \mathbb{R}) \end{align*}</p><p>Hence, $\displaystyle \int&nbsp;6\cos (2x+4)\, dx = 3 \sin (2x+4) + C$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ — as desired.</p><h4 id="sin"><span id="Sine_Functions"></span><a href="#toc">Sine Functions</a><span></span></h4><p>How about a function such as $\pi \sin (10x)$? Well, we can always begin by pulling&nbsp;the <em>coefficient</em> $\pi$ outside the integral:</p><p>$$ \int \pi \sin (10x)\, dx = \pi \int \sin (10x)\, dx$$</p><p>Presumably, since $\sin (10x)$ behaves very much like $\sin x$, the first potential antiderivative that comes to mind would be $-\cos (10x)$. To test it, we need to see what it <em>actually</em> differentiates to:</p><p>$$ [- \cos (10x)]’ = \sin (10x) (10x)’ = 10 \sin(10x) $$</p><p>This means that our candidate is off by a multiple of $10$. Dividing it however&nbsp;by $10$ yields that:</p><p>\begin{align*} \left(\frac{- \cos (10x)}{10}\right)’ &amp; = \frac{1}{10}\, [- \cos (10x)]’ \\ &amp;= \frac{1}{10} \, [10 \sin(10x)] \\ &amp; = \sin (10x) \qquad (\text{for all }x \in \mathbb{R})\end{align*}</p><p>which is exactly what we needed. Putting everything together, we get that&nbsp;$\displaystyle&nbsp;\int \pi \sin (10x)\, dx = \pi \int \sin (10x)\, dx $ $\displaystyle = \pi \, \frac{- \cos (10x)}{10} + C$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$.</p><h4 id="sec"><span id="Secant_Functions"></span><a href="#toc">Secant Functions</a><span></span></h4><p>For functions such as $\displaystyle \dfrac{1}{2} \sec^2 (4-x)$, we begin by pulling out the <em>extraneous</em> coefficent:</p><p>$$ \int \dfrac{1}{2} \sec^2 (4-x) \, dx= \dfrac{1}{2}&nbsp;\int \sec^2 (4-x) \, dx $$</p><p>Here, since $\sec^2 (4-x)$ behaves very much like $\sec^2 x$, we choose $\tan (4-x)$ as a potential antiderivative to start with. To be sure, we actually have that:</p><p>$$ [\tan (4-x)]’ = – \sec^2 (4-x) $$</p><p>which means that we are off by a <em>negative sign</em>. In this case, simply <em>negating</em>&nbsp;our candidate function&nbsp;would do the trick:</p><p>$$&nbsp;[-\tan (4-x)]’ = \sec^2 (4-x) $$</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>\begin{align*} \int&nbsp;\dfrac{1}{2} \sec^2 (4-x) \, dx &amp; = \dfrac{1}{2}&nbsp;\int \sec^2 (4-x) \, dx \\ &amp; = \frac{1}{2}\, &nbsp;[-\tan (4-x)] + C\end{align*}</p><p>(<strong>Bonus</strong>: Can you figure out what is the <em>largest</em> domain under which this equality holds? 🙂 )</p><h4 id="sectan"><span id="SecantTangent_Functions"></span><a href="#toc">Secant-Tangent Functions</a><span></span></h4><p>For functions such as $3 \sec (2x+ \pi) \tan (2x+ \pi)$, we begin by noticing that since this falls into the family of $\sec x \tan x$, a potential antidervative that comes to mind would be $\sec (2x+ \pi)$. To be sure, we have that:</p><p>\begin{align*} &nbsp;[\sec (2x + \pi)]’ &amp; = \sec (2x+\pi) \tan (2x+\pi) (2x+\pi)’ \\ &amp; = 2 \sec (2x+\pi) \tan (2x+\pi) \end{align*}</p><p>So almost there, except that we need to have $3$ as our <strong>leading coefficient</strong> instead of $2$, and a bit of reflection shows that multiplying our candidate&nbsp;by $\dfrac{3}{2}$ would do:</p><p>\begin{align*} &nbsp;\left( \frac{3}{2}\sec (2x + \pi) \right)’ &amp; = \frac{3}{2} \, 2 \sec (2x+\pi) \tan (2x+\pi) \\ &amp; = 3 \sec (2x+\pi) \tan (2x+\pi) \end{align*}</p><p>And that’s a <em>homerun</em>! Hence $\displaystyle \int&nbsp;3 \sec (2x+ \pi) \tan (2x+ \pi) \, dx =$ $\displaystyle \frac{3}{2}\sec (2x + \pi) + C$ (where $2x + \pi \ne \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi$ for some <em>integer</em> $k$).</p><h4 id="csc"><span id="Cosecant_Functions"></span><a href="#toc">Cosecant Functions</a><span></span></h4><p>For functions like $-6 \csc^2 (5x-4)$, we start by noticing that since it pretty much behaves like $\csc^2 x$ (which antidifferentiates to $-\cot x$ — by the way), the idea of $-\cot (5x-4)$ being one of its&nbsp;antiderivatives becomes more than a <em>remote reality</em>. However, we need to&nbsp;verify this idea in practice:</p><p>$$[-\cot (5x-4)]’= \csc^2 (5x-4) (5x-4)’ = 5 \csc^2 (5x-4) $$</p><p>To correct the leading coefficient from $5$ to $-6$, we multiply our guess by $\dfrac{-6}{5}$, yielding that:</p><p>\begin{align*}&nbsp;\left( \frac{-6}{5} [- \cot (5x-4)] \right)’ &amp; = \frac{-6}{5} \, [5 \csc^2 (5x-4)] \\ &amp; = -6&nbsp;\csc^2 (5x-4)\end{align*}</p><p>Done! Hence $\int -6 \csc^2 (5x-4) \, dx =$ $\frac{-6}{5}\, [- \cot (5x-4)] + C =$ $\frac{6}{5} \cot (5x-4) +C\,$ (where $5x-4 \ne k \pi$ for some integer $k$).</p><h4 id="cot"><span id="Cotangent_Functions"></span><a href="#toc">Cotangent Functions</a><span></span></h4><p>OK. What about $\cot (2x-e)$? Let’s see… looking at the <strong>table of integrals</strong>, we see that $\cot x$ integrates to $\ln |\sin x|$, which suggests that $\ln |\sin (2x-e)|$ might work out very well as a candidate. Let’s check what it differentiates to:</p><p>$$ \left[\ln |\sin (2x-e)|\right]’ = \frac{\cos(2x-e)}{\sin (2x-e)}(2x-e)’=&nbsp;2\cot (2x-e)$$</p><p>Pretty close! Because in thise case, dividing both sides of the equation by $2$ would do:</p><p>$$ \left[\frac{1}{2}\ln |\sin (2x-e)| \right]’ = \cot (2x-e)$$</p><p>Therefore, $\displaystyle \int \cot (2x-e) \, dx =&nbsp;\frac{1}{2}\ln |\sin (2x-e)| + C$ (where $2x-e \ne k\pi$ for some integer $k$).</p><h3 id="exp"><span id="Exponential_Functions"></span><a href="#toc">Exponential Functions</a><span></span></h3><h4 id="natural"><span id="Natural_Base"></span><a href="#toc">Natural Base</a><span></span></h4><p>For functions such as $\displaystyle -5.6e^{-2x+4}$, once we notice its <em>similarity</em> with $\displaystyle e^x$, trying out $\displaystyle e^{-2x+4}$ becomes our <em>first line of attack</em>:</p><p>$$(e^{-2x+4})’=e^{-2x+4} \, (-2x+4)’ = -2 e^{-2x+4} $$</p><p>Now, multiplying both sides by $\dfrac{5.6}{2}$ yields:</p><p>$$\left( \frac{5.6}{2} \, e^{-2x+4} \right)’=\frac{5.6}{2} (-2 e^{-2x+4}) = -5.6 e^{-2x+4}$$</p><p>And that’s it! Hence $\displaystyle \int -5.6e^{-2x+4} \ dx = \frac{5.6}{2}(e^{-2x+4}) + C$ (for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$).</p><h4 id="arbitrary"><span id="Arbitrary_Bases"></span><a href="#toc">Arbitrary Bases</a><span></span></h4><p>So that was for the <strong>natural base</strong> $e$. For exponential functions of other bases like $34 \pi^{3x-1}$, we can always start by taking out the <em>annoying</em> leading coefficient:</p><p>$$ \int 34 \pi^{3x-1} \, dx = 34 \int \pi^{3x-1} \, dx$$</p><p>Now, what function could possibly <em>differentiate</em> to $\displaystyle&nbsp;\pi^{3x-1}$ ? Out of curiosity, let’s just try the function <em>itself</em>:</p><p>$$\left(\pi^{3x-1}\right)’ = \pi^{3x-1} \ln \pi \, (3x-1)’ = (3 \ln \pi) \pi^{3x-1}$$</p><p>In which case, all that’s left to do is to <em>divide both sides</em> by $3 \ln \pi$:</p><p>$$\left(\frac{\pi^{3x-1}}{3 \ln \pi}\right)’ = \pi^{3x-1}$$</p><p>yielding that $\displaystyle \int 34 \pi^{3x-1} \, dx =$ $\displaystyle 34 \int \pi^{3x-1} \, dx =$ $\displaystyle 34 \, \frac{\pi^{3x-1}}{3 \ln \pi} +C\,$ (for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$).</p><h3 id="power"><span id="Power_Functions"></span><a href="#toc">Power Functions</a><span></span></h3><h4 id="root"><span id="Square_Root_Functions"></span><a href="#toc">Square Root Functions</a><span></span></h4><p>Here’s another one for you: &nbsp;$e\sqrt{7x-9}$. <em>Strange</em> huh?</p><p>Actually, by inspection, this really just looks like $\sqrt{x}$, so let’s try out $\displaystyle \frac{(7x-9)^{\frac{3}{2}} }{\frac{3}{2}}$:</p><p>$$ \left(&nbsp;\frac{(7x-9)^{\frac{3}{2}} }{\frac{3}{2}} \right)’= \sqrt{7x-9}\, (7x-9)’ = 7 \sqrt{7x-9}$$</p><p>Here, we need to turn the $7$ into a $\displaystyle e$, and&nbsp;a bit of thought reveals&nbsp;that multiply both sides by $\dfrac{e}{7}$ would do the trick:</p><p>$$\left( …</p></section></div>

Do you have any advice for navigating the process?</h2><p>Whenever I need fundraising advice, there’s one person I immediately go to: <a href="https://twitter.com/mccabe?lang=en">Marc McCabe</a>. Marc is a friend, a former colleague, and a prolific angel investor. He has personally helped dozens of startups raise money (even doing this full-time for a number of years). When I got this question, I went straight to Marc and asked him to do a guest post. Not only did he agree, he ended up putting together the most comprehensive fundraising guide I’ve ever seen, which you’ll find below.

It’s incredibly opaque, asymmetrical, and is often the difference between having a company and not. Even the most experienced founder may have only fundraised 5-10 times in their life, while VCs engage in this process daily.</p><p>Nonetheless, it’s also a very exciting time for a founder. Very few people ever get the chance to raise millions of dollars from top tier VCs. As a result, I often see founders rush into the process, setting up investor meetings before they’re truly prepared and end up with a bad outcome. This is a missed opportunity because the fundraising process is a great forcing-function for getting you to think deeply about your business and where it’s going.</p><p>Over the last decade I have personally helped dozens of companies raise capital, from pre-seed to Series C rounds, and through these experiences I’ve seen a lot of effective, and also counterproductive, fundraising patterns. I shared many of these learnings in <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/deepdive-into-startup-fundraising-with-marc-mccabe/id1457400066?i=1000447317091">a lengthy podcast interview</a> a year ago in, but with a prod from Lenny I felt like now was a good time to revisit this topic.</p><p><strong>This guide is for founders of technology businesses who have raised their seed round, and are thinking forward to their next fundraise</strong>. It’s most relevant for Series A, but a lot of the same concepts apply for seed rounds, Series B and to a certain extent Series C. While most tech businesses can benefit from this guide, there are plenty of exceptions, especially companies with products which take a long time to get to market, and companies raising capital outside the US. Consider yourself caveated.</p><p><strong>Ultimately, fundraising is an exercise in building trust. </strong>Every week we read about new Series A, B and C rounds. We hear about pre-emptive offers and blank check term sheets from prominent investors. All of this can lull us into thinking raising capital is easy. Yet, each partner at a fund generally only makes 1-3 early-stage investments per year, and their career is ultimately staked to how successful these investments are. Each investment is incredibly significant to each fund and in order to convince a fund that you are worthy of that big check, you need them to feel incredibly confident that you will take the money and use it to take your business to a new level, whereby you could raise future funding and ultimately build a huge business. With that in mind, let’s get started with how I like to manage the various steps from thinking about fundraising to closing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I typically break up a fundraising process into 4 steps:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Preparation</p></li><li><p>Outreach</p></li><li><p>Navigating the process</p></li><li><p>Partner meetings + closing</p></li></ol><p>Let’s walk through each of these stages one by one.</p><h2>Step 1: Preparation</h2><p><strong>First, you need to figure out </strong><em><strong>why</strong></em><strong> and </strong><em><strong>when</strong></em><strong> you should raise a round</strong>. Maybe this seems obvious, but rather than looking at new investment as an opportunity, many founders only start fundraising when they are running out of money. VC’s don’t invest because you’re running out of money – they invest because they believe their equity stake will be worth a lot more in the future.</p><p><em>When</em> you should raise a Series A round is a blog post unto itself, and I’m not going to go in depth here. The truth is that there isn’t just one factor that will say you’re ready to raise Series A. For example, in SaaS, it’s common that companies that have achieved $1M ARR are told they are ready, but growth rate is a factor as well, and ARR doesn’t always apply for consumer focused businesses.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Generally the way to think about whether you are ready for a Series A is whether you’ve proven <a href="https://a16z.com/2017/02/18/12-things-about-product-market-fit/">a credible value hypothesis</a></strong>. This is a combination of factors including the market you’re attacking, the features you’ve built to exploit the opportunity, and how well your product is finding its fit in the market. I often describe Series A as the “Product-Market Fit Round”: You want to show that you’ve convinced a slice of your market that your product is valuable enough to pay for (or if it’s free, use very regularly), and that this user base is growing. While seed rounds are intended to explore an idea and find some fit in the market, raising a Series A helps you pour more fuel on the fire.</p><p>Investors ultimately want to invest in growth. If a company is growing fast relative to its peers, this can make up for lower ARR especially if the business seems defensible and sustainable. It’s often helpful to speak with your seed investors early on about it, especially if they have experience raising capital themselves, to understand what milestones would make most sense to support a new round in the future.</p><p>When you think that you’re ready, the first step is to start pulling together your key metrics and wins,&nbsp; such as your growth rates, revenue numbers, customer testimonials, user feedback, and achievements. As mentioned, what makes you ready for Series A varies greatly, so find data points that will get investors excited about your business.</p><h4><strong>In terms of materials, I advise founders to prepare the following at a minimum:</strong></h4><ol><li><p><strong>A short blurb about your business</strong>, including a couple of headline numbers that indicate the business is doing well</p></li><li><p><strong>A short teaser deck</strong> (3-7 slides)</p></li><li><p><strong>A longer presentation deck</strong> (12-15 slides)</p></li><li><p><strong>A 2-3 year forecast</strong> with assumed fundraise secured</p></li><li><p><strong>Optional: <a href="https://www.rippling.com/blog/company-news/rippling-series-a-pitch-deck-and-memo/">Metrics deck</a></strong> or a data room. Sometimes you will get asked for this at Series A, sometimes not. t helps if you ask your prospective VCs in the first meeting whether they’ll ask for it.</p></li></ol><p>You can find some good references for building pitches <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/writing-a-business-plan/">here</a>, <a href="https://piktochart.com/blog/startup-pitch-decks-what-you-can-learn/">here</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@zebulgar/how-to-raise-money-before-launch-a3544ef4dba6">here</a>.</p><p>The key is that your materials tell a compelling story. They need to explain what you’re building, why you’re building it, and how your strategy will capture considerable revenue in the future. The better this story ties everything together, the more your business will seem insightful. Ultimately we’re all human, and strong narratives that help explain the world around us are more compelling than a selection of disparate, albeit impressive, data points. </p><blockquote><p>“If you can’t tell a credible and compelling story about your vision and how your plans will capitalize on broader societal, market, cultural, economic or other trends, you’re dead in the water. I believe my own secret to fundraising success was that I always spoke to the broader changes I saw happening in the world and my conviction about the opportunities they presented.”</p><p>— <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eoghanmccabe">Eoghan McCabe</a>, co-founder Intercom</p></blockquote><p>As an early investor in Intercom, it always impressed me how consistent the narrative stayed from when the company started up until today.</p><p>The shorter teaser deck is for sharing over email but be mindful that you don’t want to share everything with VCs ahead of meeting your lead partner. Hence the longer deck for your in-person (or Zoom meetings). Remember, it’s a trust building exercise. In a relationship, trust is built over many interactions over a long period of time. You want to show some positive elements to get investors interested, but leave good content in reserve.</p><p>One thing that Covid has changed is that building a relationship with a VC, with fewer in-person meetings, is now harder. Think about this with respect to your materials. To make up for the lack of in-person face time, you need to find more digital approaches to building this relationship than before. <a href="https://twitter.com/caitlinbolnick1/status/1290375205362098177">Caitlin Bolnick recently had an excellent thread about this</a>&nbsp; so consider preparing some of the following extra materials:</p><ol><li><p>A Loom of your product flow explaining how you made key design decisions and how these relate to the use case or market</p></li><li><p>An appendix of interesting information you yourself have read or viewed that inspired your approach</p></li><li><p>A compilation of customer testimonials&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>You will need more content than ever to help build a shared belief in what you’re doing and why. <strong>I typically recommend spending at least 4 weeks building the deck and supporting materials.</strong> I find founders realize there are stronger elements they should have included 1-2 weeks into the pitch process. Taking time to get the narrative right and letting your points crystallize will likely result in a stronger deck from the start.&nbsp;</p><p>An important component in building this content is a part of the process I like to call <strong>“Hardening the Pitch”</strong>. Typically I recommend founders prepare their materials to about 70% completeness and then test them before going into battle. Put together a coherent story with great supporting data (not necessarily heavily designed). Find 4-6 people in your network, who have either fundraised at Series A for their own startup (ideally in the same or similar space), are friendly investors who know the space (perhaps from your seed investors), or even growth stage investors. Practice your pitch with them. Testing your materials and thesis before you hit the full pitch gauntlet will build your confidence and reps on the pitch. It will also provide you with helpful feedback and, …</p></div></div>

            <!-- content --><p>The world of training big AI models is no longer the realm of a desktop or a few servers. Big AI research organizations are using thousands of accelerators to train huge models. Google, a major force in AI training, designs its own accelerators and systems to use both for internal purposes, as well as to rent via the Google Cloud platform. At Hot Chips 32 (2020) we had the chance to learn a bit more about the Google TPUv3 and the improvements over <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/google-enables-tpu-v2-pod-training-gcp/">TPUv2 pods</a>.<span id="more-46464"></span></p>
<h2>Google TPUv3 at Hot Chips 32</h2>
<p>Starting with the basic building block, the chips under the cold plates in the cover image above, this is the basic block diagram for the TPUv3. One can see the two cores, their vector, scalar, matrix multiply, and transpose/ permute units. There is HBM memory as well. One can see PCIe connectivity to a host as well as a high-speed interconnect.</p>
<figure id="attachment_46470" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46470"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/google-tpuv3-discussed-at-hot-chips-32/hc32-google-tpuv3-overview-diagram/" rel="attachment wp-att-46470"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram.jpg" alt="HC32 Google TPUv3 Overview Diagram" width="1370" height="747" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram.jpg 1370w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram-400x218.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram-800x436.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram-696x379.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram-1068x582.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram-770x420.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 1370px) 100vw, 1370px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-46470">HC32 Google TPUv3 Overview Diagram</figcaption></figure>
<p>A big change with TPUv3 is that the matrix multiply units are doubled, just like the HBM capacity. This is an ugly image as we took it from the PDF version of Google’s talk. The presented version did not have the diagram over the text. It is somewhat amazing that Google can make massive AI training systems and index the world, but Google Slides gives this kind of export to PDF experience in 2020.</p>
<figure id="attachment_46469" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46469"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/google-tpuv3-discussed-at-hot-chips-32/hc32-google-tpuv3-architecture/" rel="attachment wp-att-46469"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture.jpg" alt="HC32 Google TPUv3 Architecture" width="1458" height="580" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture.jpg 1458w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture-400x159.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture-800x318.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture-696x277.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture-1068x425.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture-1056x420.jpg 1056w" sizes="(max-width: 1458px) 100vw, 1458px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-46469">HC32 Google TPUv3 Architecture</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are a number of other improvements beyond the MMU and HBM capacity doubling. The core frequencies, memory bandwidth, and interconnect link bandwidth all went up by 30% as well. When you see “4x nodes” in this diagram below, that is referring to the number of nodes per pod is scaling to 4x the previous generation (1024 up from 256.)</p>

<p>The TPUs are connected via a 2D Torus network for high-speed accelerator communication. There is also a PCIe link to host machines that provide the link to storage.</p>

<p>Taking a step back here, there are quite a few people who think that this is completely different from what NVIDIA is doing. As we showed in our <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/inspur-nf5488m5-review-a-unique-8x-nvidia-tesla-v100-server/">Inspur NF5488M5 review</a> as well as our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-dgx-a100-leapfrogs-previous-gen/">NVIDIA DGX A100</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-dgx-a100-superpod-detailed-look/">NVIDIA DGX A100 SuperPod look</a>, NVIDIA is doing something similar. We can even look back to our <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/a-quick-hardware-overview-of-deeplearning12/">DeepLearning12</a> Tesla P100 build and see a similar theme. The NVIDIA A100 (and V100’s) have an interconnect on a HGX-2/ HGX A100 board. That scales from 4x A100 GPUs <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-tesla-a100-4x-gpu-hgx-redstone-platform/">HGX Redstone Platform</a> up to 8 or 16 GPUs per platform with <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-nvswitch-details-at-hot-chips-30/">NVSwitch</a>. Interconnect is NVIDIA-Mellanox Infiniband that with GPUDirect RDMA and effectively bypass going to the host to get on the training fabric. For storage, one goes back to the host system and storage is via another NIC.</p>

<p>There are a few differences and some significant ones, but we just wanted to point out that there are, indeed, a lot of similarities in how the solutions are built at a high-level. From this high-level, we are comparing a BMW to a Tesla (car) rather than a BMW automobile to a bullet train.</p>
<p>The TPUv2 Google showed using large air coolers. With the TPUv3 we get liquid cooling which means a lower server height. As a result, the standard rack seems to have gone from the TPUv2’s 4×8 four across and eight high of TPUv2 boards to 2×16 of TPUv3 boards.</p>

<p>There are other changes, however, at the system level, we have 4x the number of accelerator chips but 9-10x the petaflops and 8x the memory. We can also see a big change to the cabling connectors on the left side of these nodes.</p>

<p>At Hot Chips 32, the company talked more about the software scaling they were seeing which lead to their recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/mlperf-0-7-results-when-winners-only-apply-nvidia-google-intel-huawei-inspur/">MLPerf 0.7 Training Results</a>. Google uses this hardware (or perhaps a newer generation that they are not talking about) internally.</p>

<p>NVIDIA also saw the need to build a large internal-use cluster to aid in software development as we saw in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/0-to-supercomputer-nvidia-selene-deployment/">0 to Supercomputer NVIDIA Selene Deployment</a>.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>The TPUv3 was announced in 2018 so hearing talk on it with a lot of obfuscated details in 2020 seems strange. This is especially so given the relatively open manner NVIDIA offerings are discussed. That may be due to NVIDIA having partners and a stack that is scaling from low-power to high-power chips and software across multiple domains. Still, we wish Google had used its multiple talks at Hot Chips 32 to go into more detail about the systems themselves especially since we are around two years after TPUv3 announcement. Google tends to be relatively opaque on its hardware (e.g. there is very little public information on the company’s Arm CPU usage.) Facebook and Microsoft tend to be much more open, AWS is somewhere in the middle. At this point, given Google’s scale, they are hard to imitate except for the other hyper-scale outfits. While it is great to see more, we wish Google would let its engineers show off their engineering prowess a bit more.</p>

<p>The Secondary Memory Interface (SMI) is a parallel I/O interface that is included in all the Raspberry Pi versions. It is rarely used due to the acute lack of publicly-available documentation; the only information I can find is in the source code to an external memory device driver <a href="https://github.com/Ysurac/raspberry_kernel_mptcp/blob/master/include/linux/broadcom/bcm2835_smi.h">here</a>, and an experimental IDE interface <a href="https://github.com/fenlogic/IDE_trial">here</a>.</p>



<p>However, it is a very useful general-purpose high-speed parallel interface, that deserves wider usage; in this post I’m testing it with digital-to-analogue and analogue-to-digital converters (DAC and ADC) but there are many other parallel-bus devices that would be suitable.</p>

<p>To take advantage of the high data rates, I’ll be using the C language, and Direct Memory Access (DMA); if you are unfamiliar with DMA on the RPi, I suggest you read my previous 2 posts on the subject, <a href="https://iosoft.blog/raspberry-pi-dma-programming/">here</a> and <a href="https://iosoft.blog/fast-data-capture-raspberry-pi/">here</a>.</p>



<h2>Parallel interface</h2>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1941" data-permalink="https://iosoft.blog/2020/07/16/raspberry-pi-smi/smi2/" data-orig-file="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png" data-orig-size="447,123" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="smi2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png?w=447" src="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png?w=447" alt="" srcset="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png 447w, https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png?w=150 150w, https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 447px) 85vw, 447px"><figcaption>Raspberry Pi SMI signals</figcaption></figure>



<p>The SMI interface has up to 18 bits of data, 6 address lines, read &amp; write select lines. Transfers can be initiated internally, or externally via read &amp; write request lines, which can take over the uppermost 2 bits of the data bus. Transfer data widths are 8, 9, 16 or 18 bits, and are fully supported by First In First Out (FIFO) buffers, and DMA; this makes for efficient memory usage when driving an 8-bit peripheral, since a single 32-bit DMA transfer can automatically be converted into four 8-bit accesses.</p>



<p>If you have ever worked with the classic bus-interfaces of the original microprocessors, you’ll feel quite at home with SMI, but no need to worry about timing problems, because the setup, strobe &amp; hold times are fully programmable with 4 nanosecond resolution; what luxury!</p>



<p>The SMI functions are assigned to specific GPIO pins:</p>

<p>The GPIO pins to be included in the parallel interface are selected by setting their mode to ALT1; there is no requirement to set all the SMI pins in this way, so the I2C, SPI and PWM interfaces are still quite usable.</p>

<h4>Hardware</h4>



<p>The simplest device to drive from the parallel bus is a digital-to-analogue converter (DAC), using resistors from each data line to a common output. This arrangement is commonly known as an R-2R ladder, due to the resistor values needed.</p>



<p>I’ve used a pre-built device from Digilent (details <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/r2r-module-retired/">here</a>, or newer version <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-r2r-resistor-ladder-d-a-converter/">here</a>) but it is easy to make your own using discrete resistors; the least-significant is connected to GPIO8 (SD0), and the most-significant to GPIO15 (SD7).</p>



<h4>Software</h4>



<p>I’ll be making extensive use of the dma_utils functions that were created for my previous DMA projects, but before diving into the complication of SMI, it is helpful to test the hardware using simpler GPIO commands:</p>


<pre title="">#define DAC_D0_PIN      8
#define DAC_NPINS       8

extern MEM_MAP gpio_regs;
map_periph(&amp;gpio_regs, (void *)GPIO_BASE, PAGE_SIZE);

// Output value to resistor DAC (without SMI)
void dac_ladder_write(int val)
{
    *REG32(gpio_regs, GPIO_SET0) = (val &amp; 0xff) &lt;&lt; DAC_D0_PIN;
    *REG32(gpio_regs, GPIO_CLR0) = (~val &amp; 0xff) &lt;&lt; DAC_D0_PIN;
}

// Initialise resistor DAC
void dac_ladder_init(void)
{
    int i;
    
    for (i=0; i&lt;DAC_NPINS; i++)
        gpio_mode(DAC_D0_PIN+i, GPIO_OUT);
}

// Output sawtooth waveform
dac_ladder_init();
while (1)
{
    i = (i + 1) % 256;
    dac_ladder_write(i);
    usleep(10);
}
</pre>


<p>This is less-than-ideal because we have to use one command to set some I/O pins to 1, and another command to clear the rest to 0, so in the gap between them the I/O state will be incorrect; also we won’t get accurate timing with the usleep command.</p>



<p>To my surprise, when I ran this code on a Pi Zero, and viewed the output on an oscilloscope, it didn’t look too bad; however, as soon as I moved the mouse, there were very significant gaps in the output, so clearly we need to do better.</p>



<h4>SMI register definitions</h4>



<p>To use SMI, we first need to define the control registers, and the bit-values within them. The primary reference is bcm2835_smi.h from the Broadcom external memory driver, but I found this difficult to use in my code, so converted the definitions into C bitfields; this makes the code a bit less portable, but a lot simpler and easier to read.</p>



<p>Also, when learning about a new peripheral, it is helpful if the bitfield values can be printed on the console. This normally requires the tedious copying of register field names into string constants, but with a small amount of macro processing, this can be done with a single definition, for example the SMI CS register:</p>


<pre title="">#define REG_DEF(name, fields) typedef union {struct {volatile uint32_t fields;}; volatile uint32_t value;} name

#define SMI_CS_FIELDS \
    enable:1, done:1, active:1, start:1, clear:1, write:1, _x1:2,\
    teen:1, intd:1, intt:1, intr:1, pvmode:1, seterr:1, pxldat:1, edreq:1,\
    _x2:8, _x3:1, aferr:1, txw:1, rxr:1, txd:1, rxd:1, txe:1, rxf:1  
REG_DEF(SMI_CS_REG, SMI_CS_FIELDS);

volatile SMI_CS_REG  *smi_cs;

smi_cs  = (SMI_CS_REG *) REG32(smi_regs, SMI_CS);
</pre>


<p>The last bit of code is needed so that smi_cs points to the register in virtual memory; if you don’t understand why, I suggest you read my post on RPi DMA programming <a href="https://iosoft.blog/raspberry-pi-dma-programming/">here</a>. Anyway, the upshot of all this code is that we can access the whole 32-bit value of the register as smi_cs-&gt;value, and also individual bits such as smi_cs-&gt;enable, smi_cs-&gt;done, etc.</p>



<p>To print out the bit values, we use macros to convert the register definition to a string, then have a simple C parser:</p>


<pre title="">#define STRS(x)     STRS_(x) ","
#define STRS_(...)  #__VA_ARGS__

char *smi_cs_regstrs = STRS(SMI_CS_FIELDS);

// Display bit values in register
void disp_reg_fields(char *regstrs, char *name, uint32_t val)
{
    char *p=regstrs, *q, *r=regstrs;
    uint32_t nbits, v;
    
    printf("%s %08X", name, val);
    while ((q = strchr(p, ':')) != 0)
    {
        p = q + 1;
        nbits = 0;
        while (*p&gt;='0' &amp;&amp; *p&lt;='9')
            nbits = nbits * 10 + *p++ - '0';
        v = val &amp; ((1 &lt;&lt; nbits) - 1);
        val &gt;&gt;= nbits;
        if (v &amp;&amp; *r!='_')
            printf(" %.*s=%X", q-r, r, v);
        while (*p==',' || *p==' ')
            p = r = p + 1;
    }
    printf("\n");
}
</pre>


<p>Now we can display all the non-zero bit values using:</p>


<pre title="">disp_reg_fields(smi_cs_regstrs, "CS", *REG32(smi_regs, SMI_CS));
</pre>


<p>..which produces a display like..</p>


<pre title="">CS 54000025 enable=1 active=1 write=1 txw=1 txd=1 txe=1
</pre>


<h4>SMI registers</h4>



<p>The SMI registers are:</p>


<pre title="">CS:  control and status
L:   data length (number of transfers)
A:   address and device number
D:   data FIFO
DMC: DMA control
DSR: device settings for read
DSW: device settings for write
DCS: direct control and status
DCA: direct control address and device number
DCD: direct control data
</pre>


<p>You can specify up to 4 unique timing settings for read &amp; write, making 8 settings in total. The settings are specified by giving a 2-bit device number for each transaction; this selects 1 of the 4 descriptors for read or write. I’ve only used one pair of settings, and the ADC &amp; DAC don’t have address lines, so the address &amp; device register remains at zero.</p>



<p>Direct mode is a simple way of doing accesses using the appropriate timings, but without DMA; it has separate address, data and control registers.</p>



<p>Some notable fields in the control &amp; status register are:</p>



<p><strong>Enable</strong>: it is obvious that this bit must be set for SMI to work, but it is less obvious when that should be done. Initially, I assumed it was necessary to enable the interface before any other initialisation, but then it responded with the ‘settings error’ bit set. So now I do most of the configuration with the device disabled, then enable it before clearing the FIFOs and enabling DMA, otherwise the transfers go through immediately.</p>



<p><strong>Start</strong>: set this bit to start the transfer; the SMI controller will perform the number of transfers in the length register, using the timing parameters specified in DSR (for read) or DSW (for write). If there is a backlog of data (FIFO is full) the transaction may stall.</p>



<p><strong>Pxldat</strong>: when this ‘pixel data’ bit is set, the 8- or 16-bit data is packed into 32-bit words.</p>



<p><strong>Pvmode</strong>: I have no idea what this ‘pixel valve’ mode should do; any information would be gratefully received.</p>



<h4>Direct Mode</h4>



<p>As the name implies, SMI Direct Mode allows you to perform a single I/O transfer without DMA. However, it is still necessary to specify the timing parameters of the transfer, specifically:</p>



<ul><li>The clock period, that will be used for the following timing:<ul><li>The setup time, that is used by the peripheral to decode the address value</li><li>The width of the strobe pulse, that triggers the transfer</li><li>The hold time, that keeps the signals stable after the transfer</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>To add to the complication, the SMI controller can drive 4 peripheral devices, each with its own individual read &amp; write settings, so there are a total of 8 timing registers. I’m keeping this simple by always using the first register pair (for device zero) but it is worth remembering that you can define more than one set of timings, and quickly switch between them by setting the device number.</p>



<p>Likewise, I’m ignoring the address field since it is also redundant for my DAC; for safety, I clear all the SMI registers on startup, in case there are any residual unwanted values.</p>



<p>As it happens, this setup/strobe/hold timing is largely redundant for our simple resistor DAC (since it doesn’t latch the data) but we still need to specify something, for example if we want the overall cycle time to be 1 microsecond, this can be achieved with a clock period of 10 nanoseconds, setup 25, strobe 50, and hold 25, since (25 + 50 + 25) * 10 = 1000 nanoseconds. This is the code I use to set the timing:</p>


<pre title="">// Width values
#define SMI_8_BITS  0
#define SMI_16_BITS 1
#define SMI_18_BITS 2
#define SMI_9_BITS  3

// Initialise SMI interface, given time step, and setup/hold/strobe counts
// Clock period is in nanoseconds: even numbers, 2 to 30
void …</pre></div></article></div>

          <article>
            <p>I've met some hugely successful people. Some of them are happy. Some of them... aren't. I've noticed some things about the ones who aren't:</p>

<ul>
<li>They're obsessed with their careers</li>
<li>They spend a lot of time at work</li>
<li>They aren't fulfilled by the work they do</li>
<li>They aren't content with what they have</li>
</ul>

<p>In many circles, these people are way more successful than most of us. They probably have better networks. They might have fancier job titles. They certainly make more money.</p>

<p>The Silicon Valley meme goes, "start a company and sell it for so much money that you can say 'f*ck you' to anyone in the world." Or maybe an alternate career path is to climb the corporate ladder at Google until you've banked that privilege.</p>

<p><strong>So much toxic bullshit stems from that line of thinking.</strong></p>

<p>I'd rather have f*ck-that money—e.g., a moderate amount of money that empowers you to live a meaningful life. F*ck-that money isn't about being a pretentious asshole; it's about keeping your priorities straight. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Miss your kid's soccer practice to catch up on emails? F*ck that!</li>
<li>Power through lunch? F*ck that!</li>
<li>Skip the gym? F*ck that!</li>
<li>Work over the weekend? F*ck that!</li>
<li>Save that side project for when you have more free time? F*ck that!</li>
<li>You get the idea...</li>
</ul>

<p>At Honeybadger, this mindset has led us to turn down acquisition offers and investors—to stay small and grow naturally. We're not in this business to be rich; we're in it to be free.</p>

<p>Regret the best years of our lives?</p>

<p><strong>Fuck that.</strong></p>

                    <p><strong><em>Giving organizations and security engineers total control over their data</em></strong></p><p><strong>By: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rrleighton">Russell Leighton</a></strong></p><div><p>At its core, <a href="https://github.com/panther-labs/panther">Panther</a> is a data-driven platform that needs to store, manipulate, and query huge amounts of data to help answer important security questions.</p><p>In this blog, I’ll explain how we chose our datastore and why we took the bold step of <strong>fully</strong> opening it to customers. I’ll also share how Panther's open data infrastructure integrates with third-party applications and services. You’ll discover how this leads to improved security and transparency, and why we believe that data should never be trapped in a security platform.</p></div><h2 id="how-panther-processes-data">How Panther Processes Data</h2><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/qFWoR_ckqNeDGC4aTvkJGLfqT7y_4cTzrXGYKLtuWMOs5Mk-MztbVXbHDqCPcDiwrtOsQTkOIjua2yqzRMWqRmCJkeHeOn87C9IHiKCRquouC-jXBiAB79WGNLI5NDEpErf7Xitt" alt=""></figure><p>One of Panther's core components is a log processing sub-system which takes raw logs and converts them into structured events that can be analyzed with <a href="https://docs.runpanther.io/log-analysis/rules">Python rules</a>. This system parses, normalizes, and extracts indicators (like IP addresses) from a <a href="https://docs.runpanther.io/log-analysis/supported-logs">variety of security data sources</a> like CloudTrail, Osquery, Okta, Suricata, and more. When rules are triggered by suspicious activity, alerts are generated and dispatched to destinations like Slack or PagerDuty. </p><p>The processed log data and all events related to an alert are stored and made searchable via SQL in a serverless Data Lake. This Data Lake is fully open and available to users of our system to enable post-processing, visualizations, training machine learning models, or anything else desired.</p><h2 id="a-modern-database-architecture">A Modern Database Architecture</h2><p>To keep up with cloud-scale data demands, small security teams need to scale very quickly. <a href="https://runpanther.io/">Panther</a> is built on a fully serverless architecture, that enables higher scale, more flexibility, and quicker time-to-value than traditional on-premises applications. The choice of database should be consistent with this architecture.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SNAA5Y78k_5086xMXptPQja60Fq_ThGxm8LOiM7RIojSNsu5ia6pj32QsTz2tvjBZQhwfyKPmh2Y3f1TvJOGTQF5c4k7xt2tZgKmwe42Wd9uzDjzYyg_JH84vQlkDM5jouTLczHM" alt=""></figure><h3 id="database-as-a-service">Database as a Service</h3><p>We designed Panther to be fundamentally serverless to offer customers automatic scaling, lower operational load, lower cost, better security, and easier deployment. Being serverless also impacted our database decision because <strong>we do not want to manage any database servers</strong>! Therefore, our database must be exposed as a managed service.</p><h3 id="storage-decoupled-from-compute">Storage Decoupled from Compute</h3><p>Panther is a security data processing platform, which means huge volumes of data are expected to be processed and retained for long periods of time. For example, it’s not uncommon to consume 2-5TB of data per day and store that data for up to 3 years. To handle this heavy workload, Panther’s database must be extremely scalable. </p><p><strong>Decoupling storage from computation</strong> is the only way to achieve the scale needed to operate in a cloud-first world where data volumes continue to grow. This means data storage is not local to the compute nodes, but remote on the network. Remote storage adds latency to queries, but it allows the storage size to grow independently of the compute nodes which is incredibly important for security applications that need to retain petabytes of data that span years.</p><p>In contrast, if your database storage is local to your compute nodes, then to add storage capacity, more compute nodes must be added. This is expensive and wasteful when the usage is primarily historical data because compute nodes must be added simply to increase storage capacity when they are not needed for query speed. In addition, the more compute nodes that are added, the more operational burden it is to maintain patching and to replace failing nodes.</p><p>One way organizations work around this pain is by limiting the volume of security data they ingest, either in the form of low retention or filtering for only the most valuable data. These difficult tradeoffs significantly hinder the security team’s ability to effectively detect, investigate, and remediate security incidents.</p><p>You might ask: “You already decided that you want to use a database as a service. If the vendor manages the database, why do you care if storage is decoupled from compute?” The reason is that while the operational burden is removed by using the service, the underlying problems have <em>not</em> been resolved. The users of the service still suffer from excessive costs and data capacity issues--just ask anyone who’s had to resize a big Redshift cluster. Once storage is decoupled from compute, these issues simply disappear. In addition, new capabilities are now possible like running multiple query clusters concurrently and having other tools access the storage.</p><h3 id="support-for-complex-objects">Support for Complex Objects</h3><p>Security data is complex. The days of simple rows and columns with scalar values are gone. Today’s security data often originates as complex objects that express rich relationships necessary for answering critical security questions. <strong>Our database must</strong> <strong>support complex objects such as arrays, maps, and structs</strong>. A well-known example is AWS CloudTrail data which is composed of many complex elements, for example:</p><pre><code>{
  "Records": [
    {
      "eventVersion": "1.0",
      "userIdentity": {
        "type": "IAMUser",
        "principalId": "EX_PRINCIPAL_ID",
        "arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Alice",
        "accessKeyId": "EXAMPLE_KEY_ID",
        "accountId": "123456789012",
        "userName": "Alice"
      },
      "eventTime": "2014-03-06T21:22:54Z",
      "eventSource": "ec2.amazonaws.com",
      "eventName": "StartInstances",
      "awsRegion": "us-east-2",
      "sourceIPAddress": "205.251.233.176",
      "userAgent": "ec2-api-tools 1.6.12.2"
    }
  ]
}</code></pre><p>In particular, take note of the complex <em>userIdentity</em> attribute which is very useful for answering security questions concerning “who” was responsible for an activity. <strong>A security application database needs to be able to represent such data and allow efficient searching and element extraction</strong>.</p><h2 id="making-a-decision">Making a Decision</h2><p>Given the important qualities we require for a database, Panther chose to initially support two options which may be used interchangeably in the backend: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/what-is.html">AWS Athena</a> and <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake</a>. </p><p><strong>Security products commonly keep their choice of database engine proprietary and hidden from users</strong> (but if you ask, most use Elasticsearch which is neither serverless, nor does it separate storage from compute). Customer interaction with data only happens using the product’s UI or APIs, which allows vendors to:</p><ul><li>Change datastores and internal representations without impacting customers.</li><li>Abstract the underlying technology which might be proprietary and offer competitive advantages.</li></ul><p><strong>Panther decided not to follow this path.</strong></p><p>As an open security product, it was important to us that customers always had the ability to customize our platform to fit their needs and integrate with other systems. Let’s dig deeper into why opening up our data infrastructure has such a valuable impact on the usability of our system.</p><h3 id="enriching-security-data-with-business-context">Enriching Security Data with Business Context</h3><p>Allowing customer access to Panther’s database improves overall security. </p><p>Providing relevant context for security analytics is the key to successfully utilizing security data. For example, the normal behavior of a salesperson is very different from a system administrator. Distinguishing the activity of a salesperson from a system administrator could be important if the activity involved the salesperson logging into production servers (very suspicious!). </p><p>A customer typically has internal mappings (e.g., Active Directory data) to label a user id as a salesperson or a system administrator for business reasons. By exposing the core database, customers can join their internal data (which has the user’s job role) to the security data (which likely only has &nbsp;the user’s id) to provide the needed context to disposition events.</p><p>While contextualizing security data with customer business data makes the data more relevant, the compliment is also true. Processed security data can add value to core business analytics by supplying information about user activity and cloud infrastructure to improve efficiency and reduce costs.</p><h3 id="open-integrations-and-partner-ecosystems">Open Integrations and Partner Ecosystems</h3><p>Panther has a beautiful user interface that makes it easy for security teams to customize detections, triage alerts, baseline behaviors, and investigate incidents. However, our customers often need to answer very particular questions about their security posture and infrastructure that is outside the scope of what we offer in our UI today. Exposing the datastore allows customers to use their existing business intelligence (BI) tools without any special integrations.This allows customers to create their own rich graphs, metrics, and reports to communicate to stakeholders the state of the organization’s security posture. </p><p>In addition, some teams also have significant investments in existing data processing technologies. Rather than forcing them to replace a datastore, using a shared datastore enables easy integration. Notebooks are particularly popular for Security Engineers to implement customized threat hunting. For example, see: <a href="https://posts.specterops.io/threat-hunting-with-jupyter-notebooks-part-1-your-first-notebook-9a99a781fde7">“Threat Hunting with Jupyter Notebooks— Part 1: Your First Notebook”</a>. Customers can integrate <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter </a>and <a href="https://zeppelin.apache.org/">Zeppelin</a> notebooks as well as <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Spark </a>systems with Panther data by using the AWS Glue catalog, and there are ways to easily <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/blog/quickstart-guide-for-sagemaker-snowflake-part-one/">connect Snowflake as well</a>. </p><p>It is also very common to have in-house security workflows that are very particular to the customer’s business and data. These must (by definition) be implemented <em>by the customer</em>. Having easy access to the common datastore allows these workflows to query back into the database to retrieve critical data. An example of this is a mitigation workflow that is triggered by a Panther alert of suspicious activity. The workflow reaches back into the datastore to collect data identifying the employee and circumstances from <strong>both </strong>the processed security data and the business-related data. Using this information, the mitigation then restricts access accordingly (e.g., using the SSO API to revoke an access token) and notifies the employee’s manager and the security organization.

<p><span>The shared-kitchen industry is growing, even in such a tough year. People are more focused on local supply chains and community togetherness, while our increasingly digital world is demanding new ways of working in the food industry. Many chefs and caterers are realising that the solution to their problems might be just around the corner in a shared-use kitchen.</span></p>
<p><span>If you already realized this and want to provide a space for innovation and creativity in your local area, you might be asking: how does one go about planning a new kitchen space? Or reinvent an existing kitchen for shared commercial use?</span></p>
<p><b>It’s a daunting prospect and you’re right to look for some outside help!</b></p>
<p><span>Here’s the thing. If you don’t get the design right in the early stages, things are likely to get very costly down the road. You don’t want to get your shiny kitchen built, only to be told by the health department that you need to dig up the floor to put in a floor sink, for example. Or if you don’t plan for enough electrical capacity to simultaneously run walk-in refrigerators, fryers, combination ovens, vent hoods, and dishwashers, you may not be able to to support multiple tenants at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Proper planning and upfront investment in a design from the professionals will help you avoid issues like this and avert a financial disaster. There’s a multitude of details that must be thought-out carefully to avoid issues down the road.</span></p>
<h2><span>What to Consider When Designing a Shared-use Kitchen</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://atkdesignstudios.com/"><span>ATK Design Studios</span></a><span> has decades of experience designing commercial kitchens, including university cafeterias, corporate coffee bars, cafes, and markets, senior care facilities, government cafeteria kitchens, and more.</span></p>
<p><span>The businesses’ owner and Senior Principal Teri Kidwell explains that designing shared-use kitchens is a natural fit based on the firm’s experience. Referring to commercial kitchens of the type mentioned above, she says, “Those </span><i><span>are</span></i><span> shared kitchens because there’s a lot of people working in one space to serve a mass of people.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>That’s why the team has put together a special package to help you navigate the inevitable challenges you’ll encounter when planning and building a shared-use kitchen. Teri and Head of Business Development Marisela Smith put their heads together and told us the most important factors to consider from their years of experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There was a lot of talk about floor sinks and health and safety regulations, and here’s the list of considerations they came up with.</span></p>
<h3><span>Define the Goals of Your Shared Kitchen</span></h3>
<p><span>The first stage of kitchen design planning is to decide what you want for your kitchen. The constraining factors will be your budget and, if you already have a site in mind, the size of your space.</span></p>
<p><span>But the first step is to ask yourself if you could have whatever you wanted, what would it be? More specifically:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>What do you want to achieve with your kitchen?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Who is it for?</span></li>
<li><span>What kind of equipment and amenities do you want to provide? For example, will you have bakery equipment, an event space, parking for food trucks etc.?</span></li>
<li><span>How many tenants will you accommodate?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Working with a design firm that understands what goes into designing and building out a professional kitchen will help you whittle down your ideas and ambitions to a realistic list. Inevitably, there will be compromises so it’s important to fully answer these questions before you spend any money on construction or equipment.</span></p>

<h3><span>Set a Working Budget</span></h3>
<p><span>What is your budget based on your goals and what you can realistically afford?</span></p>
<p><span>This may evolve and change as you look at the rest of the options so it’s something to bear in mind constantly as you go. But defining a working budget early on is important as things can quickly get out of control if you’re not on top of what you’re spending.</span></p>
<p><span>People often underestimate the cost of design and construction. So it is advisable to build in a contingency of at least 10%-20% for unforeseen costs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are getting investment, you need an idea to take to an investor. A kitchen design company can help you work out a realistic budget and present a visible proposal to investors.</span></p>
<h3><span>Look at Your Existing Infrastructure</span></h3>
<p><span>Consider the buildings you’re looking at or have already purchased or leased. Ask yourself:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Will the space work with your goals?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Are there existing features you can incorporate in the design, or is it a blank slate?</span></li>
<li><span>Are there any issues with building regulations?</span></li>
<li><span>Does the facility have a strong foundation, adequate plumbing and electrical systems?</span></li>
<li><span>What can you realistically achieve based on the space you have?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Prioritize the equipment and facilities you need to achieve your goals. And determine what has to be compromised on.</span></p>

<h3><span>Access, Entrances, and Exits</span></h3>
<p><span>In shared kitchens access is even more important than in many other commercial kitchens as there will be multiple independent parties coming and going at all times of the day and night.</span></p>
<p><span>You need to consider:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>How will delivery drivers access the building?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Who will be coming and going?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Do you need an access elevator or other loading equipment?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>How much parking space do you have available?</span></li>
<li><span>Can you get the required kitchen equipment into the space?</span></li>
<li><span>How will you comply with safety and fire regulations for exits?</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Planning the Layout of Your Kitchen</span></h3>
<p><span>Taking into account the goals of your business, your budget, the existing infrastructure and the access issues we have already talked about, it is now time to start planning the space in more detail.</span></p>
<p><span>Professional kitchen designers will be able to advise you on the following questions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>What equipment do you need and where will it go?</span></li>
<li><span>Does the health department require a hood?</span></li>
<li><span>Where do you require mandated features like a grease traps/floor sinks etc.?</span></li>
<li><span>Where will all of this go?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>What is the best layout for your customers’ needs and their business flows?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The layout of the kitchen is particularly important in a shared space where multiple people and organisations will be using the space and the equipment. Consider how customers will move to and from shared refrigerators, dry storage rooms, and break rooms. Everything must have its place. And you want to make sure this makes sense and is a logical layout so that the space functions well and you avoid bottlenecks.</span></p>

<h3><span>Building Regulations and Health and Safety Considerations</span></h3>
<p><span>Once you have your rough design, check that you are complying with all the relevant building regulations, safety requirements, and certifications and you will get the relevant licenses required.</span></p>
<p><span>Being aware of these rules and regulations well in advance of building and fitting out your kitchen is vital. Because the last thing you want is to finish the build and then be prevented from opening because you don’t have the required hood vent, handwashing sink, or other mandated features.</span></p>
<h3><span>Visualizing Your Kitchen</span></h3>
<p><span>Now you really imagine how the space will work. You can make changes and adjustments to fine-tune the design. A design company can produce an accurate visualization of the kitchen space so that you can see in advance what it will look like. This allows you to really imagine working in the space and tweak the layout to make it as efficient and user-friendly as possible.</span></p>

<p><span>It might also be a good idea to share the design with potential clients or industry professionals and get their expert opinions. A visualization makes this process a whole lot easier and better than if you were showing a scribble on the back of a napkin.</span></p>
<h2><span>How ATK Design Studios Helped Create a Shared Community Kitchen</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://sprezzaturapgh.com/"><span>Sprezzatura</span></a><span> is a Pittsburgh catering company run by Jenn Saffron, a community-focused Italian-American chef. Jenn was running a successful catering business from shared kitchens and wanted to expand into a space of her own.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://www.thefoodcorridor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ATK_LOGO_FINAL_COLOR_STACKED-2-inch.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="670" srcset="https://www.thefoodcorridor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ATK_LOGO_FINAL_COLOR_STACKED-2-inch.jpg 600w, https://www.thefoodcorridor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ATK_LOGO_FINAL_COLOR_STACKED-2-inch-269x300.jpg 269w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="https://www.thefoodcorridor.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif" data-lazy-src="https://www.thefoodcorridor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ATK_LOGO_FINAL_COLOR_STACKED-2-inch.jpg"></p>
<p><span>ATK Design Studios helped both <a href="https://sprezzaturapgh.com/">Sprezzatura</a> and <a href="https://412foodrescue.org/">412 Food Rescue</a>&nbsp;in the collaboration and development of a shared-use space. 412 Food Rescue is a non-profit organization that facilities the recycling of surplus food from local grocery stores, restaurants and cafes, putting it to use and getting it into the hands of people who need it most. Both had their own visions and are their own individual entities. The space was envisioned to bring the two organizations together, but our design also allowed them to work independently.</span></p>
<p><span>The space was envisioned to bring together the two organizations so that they could work together to make the most of the donated ingredients. But it would also allow them to work independently.</span></p>
<p><span>Teri explains that the space would help Food Rescue make the most of the donations that they previously didn’t have the capacity to use. ”They can’t use a whole pallet of bananas.” She says, “But you still don’t want to throw that in the trash. They wanted to be able to take it to a place where they could process it. So they could make it into banana bread or dehydrated banana chips to sell.”</span></p>
<p><span>Working with a for-profit catering company selling to the public in the same kitchen as volunteers who might not be used to the rules and etiquette of a professional space was a particular challenge that many shared kitchen operators may be able to relate to. Especially in the dish room!</span></p>
<p><span>The solution they came up with was to split the kitchen down the middle and create two production lines back to back. This enables both organizations to work at the same time and share resources and ingredients without getting in each other’s way.</span></p>
<p><span>Once the initial design was finished and tested, the storage areas were separated to optimize operations for both parties. This is a good example of adapting to make the best of the space. In the kitchen though, the team knew that the hood had to be shared as it’s an expensive piece of equipment.</span></p>
<p><span>Marisela explains, “That couldn’t have changed because the shared kitchen space was planned around the shared hood. We had to figure out how to get the most out of a very costly piece of equipment to maximize efficiency and cost-effectiveness.”</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_70_6e6"><div><p>Building upon our React hooks introduction from our previous post on <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/development/web-development/react/react-hooks-and-local-storage-lets-build-a-todo-app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">understanding React hooks (useState and useEffect)</a>, we will look at the useReducer hook in this post. useReducer hook can be an alternative to useState (in fact, useState uses useReducer internally). Before getting into how to use the useReducer hook, we should understand what is meant by a reducer.</p><h2>What is a reducer?</h2><p>If you are coming from a redux background, you can probably skip this section. But for those who are not, let us first understand what a reducer is and what is the need for it. Then we will dive into the useReducer hook.</p><p><span>- Advertisement -</span> <ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1198872678846288" data-ad-slot="2989761355"></ins> </p><p>The first principle that we should remember before getting into a reducer is that the state is represented as a single immutable tree. So whenever we make a change to state, it is an explicit change. Typically, we use the setState function to make changes to the state. When using redux, we will not be making these changes directly to the state. We will instead be using reducers, which are functions that determine how to change the application state. For making changes to the application state, we will call these reducers with an action to specify what happened.</p><p>Let us consider a simple counter example:</p><pre><code>function Counter({initialCount}) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);
  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      Count: {count}
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(initialCount)}&gt;Reset&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(prevCount =&gt; prevCount - 1)}&gt;-&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(prevCount =&gt; prevCount + 1)}&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  );
}</code></pre><p>There are two actions that are happening here: increment and decrement. So we can abstract them out into a reducer function that takes an action as an argument:</p><pre><code>function reducer(count, action) {
  switch (action) {
    case 'increment':
      return count + 1;
    case 'decrement':
      return count - 1;
  }
}</code></pre><p>An action is the minimal representation of the change to application data (or state).</p><h2>Why do we need reducers?</h2><p>The first question that comes to mind is, why do we need reducers or actions? Even though it is redundant in our counter example, but for larger applications, there can be a lot of state-related operations happening everywhere. So, instead of having these spread out all across our application, and inside different components, we move it all into a reducer function. The reducer function then becomes a single source of truth for all application state-related changes. Thus a reducer takes in two arguments, state, and action, and returns the new state of the application.</p><pre><code>(state, action) =&gt; newState</code></pre><p>And all the different actions across the application are now in a single place, and the reducer function updates state according to the action it receives. The reducer is also a pure function, that is it does not have any side-effects.</p><p>Overall, all these properties of the reducer function make it perfect for testing state changes independently and in isolation. The same input should always return the same output.</p><h2>The action in a reducer function</h2><p>Even though we touched on the action above, it was a simplified version of what action looks like. Sometimes, we want to pass in a value along with the action as well. If we were to increment by 5 instead of 1, our previous example would require a different action altogether.</p><p>Instead, a standard has been laid out for actions. The only requirement is that the action is an object that has a type property defining what the action is. Also, the value of the type property should not be undefined. It can be an object as well, but the best practice is to use a string because strings are serializable. Any additional information can be passed in as different properties.</p><p>Putting all of this together, our updated reducer would now look like:</p><pre><code>const initialState = {count: 0};

function countReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return {count: state.count + 1};
    case 'decrement':
      return {count: state.count - 1};
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}
const newState = countReducer(initialState, 'increment') // returns {count: 1}
countReducer(newState , 'decrement') // returns {count: 0}</code></pre><p>With all this in place, the component does not need to know anything about updating the state. All the components need to know is that they will dispatch an action with the type of what happened, and the reducer will take care of everything else. Thus we achieve more maintainable code that adheres to the single responsibility principle.</p><h2>React’s useReducer hook</h2><p>Now that we have an understanding of reducer functions, we can dive into the useReducer hook implementation. As we have already seen, the useReducer hook is useful for managing complex state and state transitions.</p><p>Another benefit of the reducer is to not have to pass props manually around from parent components to child components. This is possible because all the state-related logic is defined inside the reducer function. And the child component only needs to call the reducer function with the appropriate action.</p><p>Before we start using the useReducer hook, we need to have the reducer defined. We already did that above for our counter example. Next, we can reduce the useState call with useReducer and pass the reducer to it and the initial state that we want to assign.</p><pre><code>const initialState = {count: 0};
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);</code></pre><p>Like useState, useReducer returns an array of two variables. The first one refers to the current state of the application, and the second is a dispatch function that we can use to send actions to the reducer. Invoking the dispatch function would change the state of the application, depending on the action that we invoke it with. Thus our counter example would get converted into the following code using the useReducer hook:</p><pre><code>const initialState = {count: 0};

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return {count: state.count + 1};
    case 'decrement':
      return {count: state.count - 1};
    case 'reset':
      return initialState;
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      Count: {state.count}
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; dispatch({type: 'reset'})}&gt;Reset&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; dispatch({type: 'decrement'})}&gt;-&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; dispatch({type: 'increment'})}&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  );
}</code></pre><p>It is also important to note that React guarantees that the calls to the dispatch function are stable and will not change on re-renders. Therefore we do not need to put it in the useEffect dependency list.</p><h2>Applying useReducer hook to our To-Do list application</h2><p>Let us now apply the hook to our ToDo list application that we had built in the previous blog post.</p><p>We will define an items reducer as follows:</p><pre><code>const itemsReducer = (state, action) =&gt; {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'POPULATE_ITEMS':
      return action.items;
    case 'ADD_ITEM':
      return [...state, action.item];
    case 'REMOVE_ITEM':
      return state.filter((item) =&gt; item !== action.itemToBeDeleted);
    default:
      return state;
  }
};</code></pre><p>The three actions correspond to fetching of data, adding an item, and removing an item. These are self-explanatory in what we are trying to do here with respect to the action type that we receive. Next, we will start making use of this reducer in our App component. We will replace useState with our useReducer hook</p><pre><code>const [items, itemsDispatch] = useReducer(itemsReducer, []);</code></pre><p>We can name the first (state) variable whatever we want it to be. It is better to be more explicit about what it refers o since there might be multiple reducers in an application. So we did not name it state as we did in our example before.</p><p>Now that we have access to our state variable and dispatch function, we can use them in our component. Getting into our first useEffect call:</p><pre><code>  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    const items = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('items'));
    if (items) {
      setItems(items);
    }
  }, []);</code></pre><p>We no longer have access to setItems. But we created an action POPULATE_ITEMS in our reducer to populate the items which can be used here. So we will invoke our dispatch function here instead:</p><pre><code>useEffect(() =&gt; {
  const items = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('items'));
  if (items) {
    itemsDispatch({ type: 'POPULATE_ITEMS', items });
  }
}, []);</code></pre><p>When we invoke this dispatch function, it will invoke our reducer with action type POPULATE_ITEMS. And since we passed in the items (using the shorthand notation), the items reducer returns those items and saves them in the application state.</p><p>For the other useEffect where we were saving items to state, we do not need to do anything since we were not doing any state manipulation.</p><p>Next, we will do the same thing for the other actions that we have, that is adding an item and removing an item.</p><pre><code>const addItem = (item) =&gt; {
  // setItems([...items, item]);
  // becomes:
  itemsDispatch({ type: 'ADD_ITEM', item });
}

const removeItem = (itemToBeDeleted) =&gt; {
    // setItems(items.filter((item) =&gt; itemToBeDeleted !== item));
    // becomes
    itemsDispatch({ type: 'REMOVE_ITEM', itemToBeDeleted });
  };</code></pre><p>And that concludes our refactoring to use useReducer hook in our code.</p><p>You can find the code changes <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/saranshkataria/todo-list-react-hooks-demo/commit/d2f2c98c1b9918eac8a909a3d8153497ff289156" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and the final code <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/saranshkataria/todo-list-react-hooks-demo/tree/d2f2c98c1b9918eac8a909a3d8153497ff289156" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p><p>We will talk about useContext in the next post, and that will finish our to-do application.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Two machines on the internet can talk to each other iff both of them know each other’s IP addresses. When we
type in “google.com” in the browser, the first task of the browser is to get the IP address of “google.com”
which it does by communicating with the DNS system. Once an IP address is received, the browser establishes a
TCP connection to the server, does a TLS handshake, exchanges data with the server before terminating the
connection.</p><p>What would happen if the DNS system gives a bad IP for a domain? That is, rather than giving <code>172.217.164.206</code>
for <code>google.com</code>, DNS answers with some other IP. How can that happen? Apart from a bug in the DNS resolvers,
there can be cases where a malicious user might eavesdrop for DNS queries from your system and replies back with
IP address over which she commands control and thereafter can snoop on the traffic from your machine.</p><p>To check out this scenario, let’s try to connect to <code>google.com</code> with an IP address of <code>example.com</code> such that
TCP and TLS handshake is done with <code>example.com</code>. There are multiple ways to do this: update your local
<code>/private/etc/hosts</code> to direct <code>google.com</code> to <code>example.com</code>, inject the bad RR in locally running DNS resolver
<a href="https://github.com/lafolle/rrdns">rrdns</a> or much simpler, use curl’s <code>--resolve</code> option.</p><p>Let’s go with the 3rd option.</p><p>We can create a small HTTPS server using SSL certs signed by our own root CA using
<a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert">mkcert</a>:</p><pre><code>$ mkcert example.com
Using the local CA at "/Users/Karan/Library/Application Support/mkcert" ✨

Created a new certificate valid for the following names 📜
 - "example.com"

The certificate is at "./example.com.pem" and the key at "./example.com-key.pem" ✅
</code></pre><p>Server code would execute the following line to
run TLS server given SSL certificate and private key:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="Go">http.<span>ListenAndServeTLS</span>(<span>":443"</span>,
	<span>"example.com.pem"</span>, <span>// Certificate.
</span><span></span>	<span>"example.com-key.pem"</span>, <span>nil</span>) <span>// Private key.
</span></code></pre></div><p>Check if the server is running correctly:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">curl <span>\
</span><span></span>	--cacert rootCA.pem <span>\ </span><span># Load the root cert from this path</span>
	--resolve example.com:443:127.0.0.1  <span>\ </span><span># Use this mapping instead of asking DNS resolver</span>
	-vvv <span>\
</span><span></span>	https://example.com
</code></pre></div><p>Now lets resolve <code>google.com</code> to 127.0.0.1 and hit our test server:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">curl <span>\
</span><span></span>	--cacert rootCA.pem <span>\
</span><span></span>	--resolve <span>\

</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>We can see here that curl loaded its DNS cache with our entry, tries and succeeds to establish a TCP connection
with localhost:443, loads the root certs from the custom path provided and then goes ahead to establish TLS 1.3
connection with the server, which fails because of <em>no alternative certificate subject name matches target host
name ‘google.com’</em>.</p><p>What’s happening?</p><p>Every web server needs to prove its identity to the connecting client, failure of which would result in the
client terminating the connection. The entity of proof is a digital certificate that a web server offers to the
client, which on reception of cert runs multiple validations. Who certifies the server? Server gets its
certification from Certificate Authority (CA), a third party neutral organization whose job is to verify that
the server/org does own the domain for which it is asking the certificate for.</p><p>Server or domain administrator, generates a public/private RSA key pair and composes Certificate Signing Request
(CSR) containing the public key and name of domains for which it intends to get a certificate for, signs it with
the private key and sends it (CSR) to CA. CA verifies the CSR using the public key in it and also verifies if
the domains for which the certificate is requested for, does actually belong to the requesting
org/server/entity: earlier there used to be manual steps involved, like asking the domain controller to update
DNS records temporarily which can assert the claim of ownership but lately the verification can be automated
using <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555">ACME</a> protocol by LetsEncrypt. Once verification succeeds, CA
generates the X.509 certificate containing the public key of the requesting org, for how long the certificate is
valid, identity of self as to who generated the certificate, list of domains this certificate is valid for in CN
(Common Name) and SAN (Subject Alternate Name) fields and other various fields.</p><p>Note from the section above, the certificate is only valid for a selected list of domains. When client a made a
connection with the server, the server sent back its certificate to affirm its identity. Apart from many other
validations (like is the certificate signed by a verified CA, is the cert expired or not, etc) the client also
checks if the domain name to which it was trying to connect to matches the CN (Common Name) or SAN (Subject
Alternate Name) present in the certificate. This is the stuff that failed in our case as neither CN nor SAN in
certificate matches <code>google.com</code>. What are they in the certificate? CN is set to “mkcert
@.local ()” and SAN consists of DNS name=example.com and IP Address =
127.0.0.1. Both of these were set by the <code>mkcert</code> command for us.</p><p>Cool, so we now know why the failure occured. But what if we generate the certificate where SAN matches
<code>google.com</code>?</p><p>Lets generate cert for google.com: <code>mkcert google.com</code>, and load them into the server such that server looks
like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="Go">http.<span>ListenAndServeTLS</span>(<span>":443"</span>,
	<span>"google.com.pem"</span>, <span>// Certificate.
</span><span></span>	<span>"google.com-key.pem"</span>, <span>nil</span>) <span>// Private key.

</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>This is expected. The certificate does have <code>google.com</code> in it under SAN (<code>subjectAltName</code>) section which
matches domain present in the request.</p><p>One big advantage we have over an attacker is that we are able to inject CA’s root certificates into the client.
Note the “–cacert” option passed to <code>curl</code> which tells <code>curl</code> where to find the root CA certificate which was
used to issue X.509 cert to server. This ability is denied to attackers. Mostly clients come bundled with CA
certs and can also be provisioned to use CA certs installed in the system.</p><p>Is it possible for an attacker to use <code>google.com</code>s certificate as anyways it is public?</p><p>How can we get the SSL cert for <code>google.com</code> in PEM format??? Easy:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>echo</span> | openssl s_connect -showcerts -connect google.com.443 <span>\
</span><span></span>	openssl x509 -out google.com-original.pem
</code></pre></div><p>This will create a file <code>google.com-original.pem</code> that will contain the digital certificate for <code>google.com</code>.
We can load this into our server, but there is a problem. We don’t have the private key. Note, at the time of
building CSR request we need to generate public/private key pair and the private key is used to sign the
request. In fact, if we can have the corresponding private key, Google’s existence is literally doomed.</p><p>This is a blocker but lets go forward and try to feed-in wrong private key to the Go server:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="Go">http.<span>ListenAndServeTLS</span>(<span>":443"</span>,
	<span>"google.com-original.pem"</span>, <span>// Certificate.
</span><span></span>	<span>"bad-key.pem"</span>, <span>nil</span>) <span>// Private key.
</span></code></pre></div><p>On running, the server fails with following error:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">2020/08/24 17:42:44 ListenAndServe: tls: private key does not match public key
<span>exit</span> status <span>1</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Of course! When the server loads the cert and private key, it generates corresponding public key from private
key and matches it against the provided public key in first argument. This matching failed here, hence the
error. Now we are certain that attacker cannot do any damage unless they have the private key corresponding to
the public key.</p><p>If the imposter is somehow able to direct the browser to her IP which is backed by a webserver also controlled
by her, until the website is being accessed by HTTPS, she won’t be able to do any harm because the whole
certificate dance prevents her from faking the identity. But it is important to note that this only works if the
website is being accessed over HTTPS. In case the website is accessed over HTTP, there is no way for the
client to verify the identity of server it is communicating with and is easy for the attacker to fake its
identity. For example, she might direct <code>scotiabank.com</code> (a major bank in Canada) to her own malicious version
of the bank’s website and ignorant user won’t be able to differentiate and might end up giving private info to

        <p>Since 2016, commentators across a swath of disciplines have pointed to Google and Facebook as consequential and harmful actors in the global political and social order. These platforms influence world events by doing everything from disseminating fake news during national elections<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> and a pandemic in the U.S. and abroad<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>, to helping hate groups form and organize<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>, to aiding in the fomenting of genocide in Myanmar. <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>One area often missing from the discussion, though, is the corporations’ impact on local communities, both through their products oriented to organize local social and economic life and their corporate strategies around taxation.</p>
<p>Yet local strategies are core to both platforms, and while policy can be done at a national level, life is lived locally. The shops, businesses, public spaces, schools, and people around us make up our neighborhoods, and the taxes we pay support our communities.</p>
<p>Indeed, Google and Facebook know this, and portray themselves as organizers of local communities, helping connect people to the small businesses and neighbors around them. “One of the biggest opportunities is to help small businesses create connections with customers in their local neighborhoods and beyond,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in October 2019. “While the internet has given people the ability to buy anything from anywhere, often they are searching for what’s right next to them: the closest pediatrician, the best pizza delivery in Omaha, a hair salon open today.”<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> Pichai said this is especially true during the coronavirus pandemic: “Definitely we see activity back around people trying to find services, what’s around, what’s open. People are exploring and discovering local services again.”<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Similarly, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has touted himself as a “community builder,” likening Facebook groups to “churches, sports teams, unions or other local groups.”<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> Through 2017, Zuckerberg had discussed “community” 150 times in public<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>: “Meeting new people, getting exposed to new perspectives, making it so that the communities that you join online can translate to the physical world, too,” is a Facebook goal, he said.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> On calls with investors, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg routinely talks up the importance of Facebook for small and local businesses. As Zuckerberg once indelicately put it, “A squirrel dying in front of your house may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa.”<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>And yet, when looking for local news or community information on social media, you don’t necessarily get the most trusted or professional sources, or those from traditional community stakeholders such as newspaper editors, local business, unions, or religious leaders — you get what Facebook wants you to see. When you run a Google search to find a local restaurant, you don’t necessarily get the best or most useful information — you get what Google wants you to see. When attempting to access information about where your local government is spending local resources or what it is charging for utilities, you often can’t get the full picture, only a snippet that Facebook and Google will allow. And when paying your local taxes to support your community, you may not realize the money is often going to subsidize the businesses of Google and Facebook through tax concessions hidden via shell corporations.</p>
<blockquote><p>The net effect undermines the ability of locals to access good information; instead, the vacuum is filled by commentary and conspiracies.</p></blockquote>
<p>For instance, in Holyoke, Massachusetts, the loss of several local papers resulted in the town having just one newsweekly that does no investigative reporting. When a ballot initiative in 2019 that would have OK’d a bond issue for two new middle schools was put forward, commenters in a local Facebook group spread misinformation about the city’s finances, such as who would be responsible for any potential cost overruns on the project. Targeted advertisements against the initiative were run by a committee<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> whose largest funder was the local mall, the largest taxpayer in the city.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> The ballot issue was ultimately defeated.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>Regardless of the merits of the measure, a dedicated local news outlet would at least have been able to provide accurate information regarding the state of the city’s finances and its ability to cover the cost of the schools. Instead, as one city employee put it, local government officials wound up “playing whack a mole with every little conspiracy theory out there.”<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a> The city simply wasn’t equipped to run a propaganda campaign on behalf of funding schools.</p>
<p>This policy brief will examine Google and Facebook’s effects on local communities in two ways. First, it will examine the impacts of their product lines: How their search and social networking services affect local communities through their organizing of advertising markets and the viability of local journalism. Second, it will explore more direct political strategies by these corporations to extract subsidies from local communities, and how they hide what they are doing from voters. These are surely not the only harms the corporations inflict on local communities, merely some of the most egregious.</p>
<p>Finally, it will detail solutions – at both the federal and local level – to readjust the legal underpinning of the platform business model, so that Facebook and Google’s strategies of self-preferencing to exclude competitors and profiting via misinformation are no longer viable, and so that local communities can prioritize small businesses and local services over the business imperatives of these extractive giants.</p>
<h3><strong>What Are Facebook and Google?</strong></h3>
<p>Popularly portrayed as big tech companies, Facebook and Google – and the other properties they own, such as WhatsApp and YouTube, respectively – are better understood as vital 21<sup>st</sup> century communications networks.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a> They’re the platforms on which local shops and restaurants connect to customers, on which local news is disseminated, and on which citizens organize everything from school bake sales to local elections to neighborhood clean-ups.</p>
<p>But their business models are not based on serving consumers with the most credible information and facilitating neutral communications among friends, family, and community stakeholders. Instead, Facebook and Google use intrusive surveillance of their users to collect data, and they use algorithms based on “engagement” to ensure users continue to pay attention to curated content. They then sell user attention, enriched with data, to advertisers, often monetizing content they didn’t generate but are profiting from, with users manipulated into further engagement with their properties. Both companies have incentives to self-deal and self-preference their own content in order to capture market share, and then use engagement algorithms to sell more advertising.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Good information isn’t what Facebook and Google are selling. You are being sold to advertisers through what you see and interact with.</p></blockquote>
<p>As tech reporter Rani Molla put it, “This business model has been around for decades, and it shows how free software (not to be confused with the free software movement) and services are never really free. You’re paying with your data.”<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<h3><strong>How Dominant Search and Social Networks Affect Local Communities</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Google Undermines Local Businesses: </strong></h4>
<p>For a local business to operate and be successful, local residents must be able to find it. There’s a long history of enabling such matchmaking between customers and businesses through newspapers, radio, TV, directories, and local advertising channels. Today, one of the key mechanisms filling this critical function is local search. Local search is the single largest category of search on Google, the world’s dominant search engine. In 2018, Google said local search grew by 50 percent over the year before, outpacing the overall search market.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a> More than 80 percent of cell phone users report searching for businesses “near me.”<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></p>
<p>And yet, Google’s search properties, either general search or via its Maps subsidiary, often hurt local businesses and residents by allowing scammers to infiltrate its listings. For instance, Florida locksmith Rafael Martorell explained that the name of his business, A-Atlantic Lock and Key, was stolen by scammers on Google who pretended to be him and would charge customers five or six times what he normally charged. “One of the scammers put the name of my company, and the address that he put was my own house,” he said, alleging that such practices are an epidemic in the locksmith industry.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>
<p>“90 percent of our advertising, most of that for years was the Yellow Pages,” Martorell said. “Then suddenly Google came, without us noticing. And then we figured it out, we knew we had to go to Google and that is when the issues began. Because the local listings, most of them are fraudulent. Completely phony, fraudulent.”<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a> The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> noted several other sectors in which similar scams have occurred.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></p>
<p>Since Google is so dominant in search, merchants have little alternative to battling the corporation endlessly, trying to buy ads for which they can’t ascertain the true value – and where a substantial amount of clicks can be fraudulent<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a> – or simply vanishing from the vast majority of internet searches when they are either not listed or when their listing has incorrect information. (Facebook can create similar issues for small businesses via fraud, driving up costs for businesses running ads and opaque algorithm changes that limit small businesses ability to ensure their customers actually see their content.)<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a><a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></p>
<p>Google’s size and scale leads to neglect of local needs. The corporation has eight products with more than a billion users, so the ability of a top executive to focus on any one town, or even a major city, is virtually nil. Google is slow to correct misinformation and has allowed whole neighborhoods to be …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Being a project lead can be challenging. There are so many variables to make everything work out in the end. But it's a rewarding experience if everything is going right. Following a few simple guidelines can set any project up for success. </p><blockquote>Understand what success looks like, develop a plan of execution, hold people and yourself accountable, know when to escalate. </blockquote><p>"Project" is a vague term. Some projects can take multiple years, with thousands of people involved. Others can get done by two people in a week. And then there is everything in between. No matter what size your project is, the first thing is to know what success means. Begin with the end in mind and work your way backward. It's one of&nbsp;<a title="https://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful/dp/0743269519" href="https://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful/dp/0743269519">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a>.</p><p>The planning starts with clearly defining the scope and success criteria. What is in the scope and what's not. Everyone involved should be on the same page what success means. And what the deadline is. A one-pager document or&nbsp;<a title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_requirements_document" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_requirements_document">PRD</a>&nbsp;(product requirements document) are pretty standard practices. You and your team should be able to tell with confidence when the project is complete.</p><p>When building software, programmers break it down into smaller components, classes, objects, utilities. Same with managing a project. Break it down into smaller pieces, then take those and break it down again until you end up with tasks. The first step in this process is to create milestones. They should serve as a map of how to complete the project. Each one of them should be a mini-project with a clear deliverable and timeline. By completing milestones successfully and on time, you can be confident everything is under control. And the opposite is true if there are issues with one of the milestones, the entire project is at risk. Use them as your roadmap to get to the big finish line.</p><p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/output=format:png/resize=height:1080,width:1920/YVC9VTfHSredQjhXV6Ja" alt="Example of project breakdown into miletones." title="milestones-example.png" width="1920" height="1080"></p><p>Projects don't happen in isolation. There is always a group of people who has skin in the game. Stakeholders are people who work with you on the project like product managers, designers, program managers. In some cases, projects can involve other teams or departments like marketing, business, finance. Identify all the stakeholders and their roles and level of involvement to keep them informed as everything progresses.
</p><p>All the tasks, including clarifying requirements, delivering assets, and coding should have owners. A task without an owner won't ever get done. It doesn't mean an individual. An owner can be a team or a person as long as there is an agreement. Once the owners are clear, everyone should be accountable for delivering the committed work on time. There are multiple ways to communicate the progress and blockers with the rest of the team: daily standups, weekly check-ins, status reports, to name a few. Choose the cadence that works for the team as long as there are transparency and accountability. Any standing meeting is better than pinging people on Slack regularly to get an update when something is going to get done.</p><p>If there are blockers or unexpected complexity, evaluate what impact they may have on the current milestone and overall project. Discuss it with the person who faces the challenge, try to work it out, and agree to escalate it if necessary. Other people can potentially help to resolve the issue. TPMs can help with external dependencies, engineering managers can reallocate resources, and PMs can re-negotiate the scope, timeline, or priorities.</p><p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/8MQPzrJQ9SSGdjWknBJA" alt="project-management-risks.png" title="project-management-risks.png" width="738" height="388"></p><p>Things happen. Every project has risks, and most of us expect that unexpected things will come up. It's rare for a team to keep building the same software over and over again. There is something new in the mix every time. We face unknown projects, tasks, problems, bugs constantly. It all makes the projects somewhat unpredictable. Despite all that, management will demand some timeline and budget estimates because building software is the means to an end. The ultimate goal of the software is to support or build a business. And business works around budgets and time. We still do our best to estimate the efforts, but we can't say for sure.
</p><p>There are many ways why things can go sideways. Common pitfalls are increasing scope, implementation complexity, unclear requirements, missing assets, legacy code. Transparency is the key, know when to pull the&nbsp;<a title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andon_(manufacturing)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andon_(manufacturing)">andon cord</a>&nbsp;and notify the stakeholders and management there is a problem.&nbsp;<a title="https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/clean-escalations" href="https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/clean-escalations">Escalate cleanly</a>, remember your colleagues have the same goal. When it's all over, everyone will remember how you reacted and how you treated others more than the project outcome.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>For those who are unfamiliar with the term or practice of <strong><em>Fuzz Testing</em></strong>, it’s essentially the combination of testing input validation coupled with stress testing, which is performed by spraying inputs of a target device, application, or system with random and crafted input at high velocity and observing the effects on the target. Use cases can involve testing input forms on a website to ensure it doesn’t accept foreign or script characters or ensuring that IIoT devices are programmed to be functionally robust.</p>



<p>I’ve performed fuzz testing for many web &amp; mobile applications, and even industrial networks and devices. There are common denominators amongst fuzz tests of different technology or hardware stacks that map to higher level processes that translate well across the board and can be universally applied. Many fuzzing frameworks claim to be unified, but are only such when employed in their respective technology silo(s). As someone who works simultaneously in very low <em>and</em> high levels of varying engagements, I tend never to work, research, or experiment in a vacuum. And so the thought of having to find and apply fuzzing frameworks <em>a la carte</em> aggravates the living shit out of me, as It’s an inefficient and misapplied expenditure of effort (i.e. a waste of time).</p>



<p>I wanted to provide something of value that others who need to perform fuzz testing of <em>anything</em> can use from front-to-end, and even build off + flesh out as seen fit by those planning and/or testing. I just wanted to make your life easier. Enjoy!!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>So you bought some bitcoin from an exchange, and your privacy is violated… You can practically hear voices coming from the dark corridors of the NSA, throbbing through your ears…</p></blockquote><p>Oof that was intense. Let’s fix this mess… <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Recommended article on Bitcoin privacy</a>
.</p><p>This is the first post in a series to reclaim your <em>privacy</em>, <em>autonomy</em>, <em>sovereignity</em> and <em>independence</em> of your coins. The setup I will describe will allow you to connect to your Electrum wallet from any supported Electrum clients (Win/OSX/Linux/Android at the time of writing) through a secure and private connection, remotely.</p><h2 id="why-have-your-own-wallet">Why have your own wallet? <a arial-abel="header-anchor" href="#why-have-your-own-wallet">#</a></h2><blockquote><p>“Not your keys, not your coins” - Andreas M. Antonopoulos</p></blockquote><h3 id="security">Security <a arial-abel="header-anchor" href="#security">#</a></h3><p>Exchanges don’t actually allow you to see your keys (a <code>seed phrase</code> phrase being one form of key combination). Whenever you use your exchange to transfer funds (or store them) you are relying on them to keep it safe. This means your coins <strong>are not in your custody and belong to the exchange</strong>.</p><p>Now, you might say, an exchange <em>probably</em> has better security than I ever will, therefore it’s safer to just let their engineers take care of it. Well, as it turns out exchanges being hacked is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quite</a>
<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/bitcoin-exchange-bitfloor-shuttered-after-virtual-heist/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>
<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=499580" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">common</a>

, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincheck" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">keep</a>
going? Anyways, you get the point.</p><p>Besides external risks, the actual exchange company owners have the keys to your keys and have every incentive to get them. Also if an investigation into an exchange gets launched, <a href="https://www.ccn.com/south-koreas-biggest-cryptocurrency-exchange-investigated-by-local-police-market-drops/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">your funds might get frozen</a>
.</p><h3 id="privacy">Privacy <a arial-abel="header-anchor" href="#privacy">#</a></h3><p>Every single exchange that is not p2p (e.g. <a href="https://bisq.network/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bisq</a>
, locally acquiring coins) has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">KYC</a>
/<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aml.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AML</a>
requirements, by law. Not only that, chain analysis companies and software <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_analysis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">are a real thing</a>
. If you keep your funds in your exchange wallet, you have no hope of ever anonymizing your Bitcoin (we’ll get to that later). This is also why <strong>DEFI</strong> (decentralized finance) could be so revolutionary and why decentralized exchanges should be used if your aim is privacy.</p><blockquote><p>In Bisq there’s currently not much liquidity, so expect to lose a bit of coins (<code>~2-5%</code> at the time of writing).</p></blockquote><h3 id="flexibility">Flexibility <a arial-abel="header-anchor" href="#flexibility">#</a></h3><p>Having your own wallet not only gives you more privacy and security, but can also gives you more options. For example the <a href="https://wasabiwallet.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wasabi wallet</a>
is a privacy focused wallet, that <em>automagically</em> sets up Tor for you, for network anonymity and provides an easy to use interface for <strong>CoinJoins</strong> (for cleaning/washing/tumbling coins). Some other features you might like:</p><ul><li>Lightning network support</li><li>Bech32 addresses</li><li>sendtomany (multiple payment outputs)</li><li>Labeling your transactions</li><li>Fee controls</li></ul><p>And many more…</p><h3 id="recommendations">Recommendations <a arial-abel="header-anchor" href="#recommendations">#</a></h3><ul><li><a href="https://electrum.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Electrum</a>
, you should use a self-hosted server, such as <a href="https://github.com/chris-belcher/electrum-personal-server" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EPS</a></li><li><a href="https://wasabiwallet.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wasabi</a></li><li><a href="https://phoenix.acinq.co/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pheonix</a>
(Lightning wallet)</li><li><a href="https://zaphq.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zap</a>
(Lightning wallet)</li></ul><blockquote><p>I will preface this by saying, that the following process is detailed and is not necessarily required, but I prefer to do things this way for more flexibility. If you are holding your funds in an exchange right now, simply downloading a <code>non-custodial</code>, generally accepted to be good wallet is already a massive improvement. The following steps are <strong>not</strong> required to hodl your <code>btc</code>. There are very simple to use wallets, such as <a href="https://phoenix.acinq.co/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pheonix</a>
. However, these steps will get us closer to <strong>maximal</strong> privacy (total privacy/security is never possible) and will provide us with a lot of flexibility.</p></blockquote><p>In this post we’re going to set up a <strong>pruned Bitcoin node</strong>, an <a href="https://electrum.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Electrum wallet</a>
, with an <a href="https://github.com/chris-belcher/electrum-personal-server" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Electrum Personal Server (EPS)</a>
to sync with (as 3rd party electrum servers can violate your privacy and <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/04/16/behind-the-scenes-electrum-hackers-steal-4m-with-bitcoin-phishing-attacks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">security</a>
). Obviously, this will be set up on a *nix system.</p><p>In the next posts, I will write about how to securely connect to your remote electrum server with <strong>WireGuard</strong> VPN, and how to wash/tumble/clean/CoinJoin your coins to effectively make coin analysis software useless and improve bitcoin’s fungibility.</p><p>First, we need to get a Bitcoin node up and running.</p><h2 id="bitcoin-node">Bitcoin node <a arial-abel="header-anchor" href="#bitcoin-node">#</a></h2><blockquote><p>Any computer that connects to the Bitcoin network is called a node. Nodes that fully verify all of the rules of Bitcoin are called full nodes.</p></blockquote><h3 id="why">Why? <a arial-abel="header-anchor" href="#why">#</a></h3><ul><li>Privacy</li><li>Participating in the network’s consensus rules</li><li>Keeping your funds safe</li><li>Broadcasting your own transactions in the network</li></ul><p>If you believe in the bitcoin project and its decentralized future, and you would like to help, running your own node is the best way of doing that. The more nodes that are being run, the more decentralized and secure the network is. Besides that, the gains are not merely altruistic, there are incentives that I mentioned before - security, privacy and others.</p><blockquote><p><strong>BIG NOTE BEFORE THE NEXT STEPS</strong>: I <strong>highly</strong> recommend you first sync the node with the blockchain on a more powerful device if you are planning to run it on a low-powered device (e.g. a rPI). Synchronizing the initial block download (IBD) on these devices would take forever. Once you finish the IBD you can then <code>rsync</code> (or <code>ftp</code>/<code>scp</code>) your data to your destination device/server.</p></blockquote><h3 id="a-pruned-node">A pruned node <a arial-abel="header-anchor" href="#a-pruned-node">#</a></h3><p>Since I will be running my Bitcoin node on a cheap <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/cloud" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hetzner VPS cloud instance</a>
without much storage, I will run my node in <code>pruned</code> mode. This will allow me to only use <code>~5GB</code> of storage instead of the normal <code>~200GB</code> of storage that a non-pruned node normally requires. This means the node will only store the last <code>n</code> blocks on its copy of the blockchain (you can alter the amount of blocks kept in the config).</p><figure><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/033e7b1e18b7d230c5a34f576bfd2ddd2c87ae55/731cb/posts/bitcoin_electrum/hetzner.png" alt="A Hetzner Cloud CX21 instance." width="285px" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/033e7b1e18b7d230c5a34f576bfd2ddd2c87ae55/731cb/posts/bitcoin_electrum/hetzner.png"><figcaption><p>You can actually run a lot of things on such a cheap instance.

September 1, 2020 | https://dojo4.com/blog/try-them-all-exploring-the-data-quality-of-the-unsplash-dataset | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dojo4.com/blog/try-them-all-exploring-the-data-quality-of-the-unsplash-dataset">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
  
  <article>
    

<p>This is the 3rd in an open-ended series around implementing roughly the same application in many ways using various technologies, frameworks, languages etc. Feel free to <a href="https://dojo4.com/blog/try-them-all-introduction">start at the beginning</a>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://dojo4.com/blog/try-them-all-dataset-selection">previous article</a> I decided  to use the <a href="https://unsplash.com/data">Unsplash Dataset</a> as the basis for these implementations and enhance it with the data from <a href="https://www.geonames.org/">GeoNames</a> and <a href="https://gadm.org/">GADM</a>.</p>

<p>Today I'm going to explore the data of the Unsplash dataset from a data quality perspective. I want to check things out about the data that could trip me up down the road if I don't catch them now.</p>

<h2>Fetching and loading the Unsplash data</h2>

<p>This process is all derived from the documentation in the <a href="https://github.com/unsplash/datasets">Unsplash datasets github repository</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Make a scratch directory.
<code>mkdir unsplash &amp;&amp; cd unsplash</code></li>
<li>Download the dataset.
<code>curl -L https://unsplash.com/data/lite/latest -# -o unsplash-research-dataset-lite-latest.zip</code></li>
<li>Extract the files
<code>unzip unsplash-research-dataset-lite-latest.zip</code></li>
<li>Quick check on sizes
  <code>
  % wc -l *.tsv000
   1646598 collections.tsv000
   4075505 conversions.tsv000
   2689741 keywords.tsv000
     25001 photos.tsv000
   8436845 total
</code></li>
<li>Download the creation and loading scripts mentioned in <a href="https://github.com/unsplash/datasets/blob/master/how-to/psql/README.md">Loading data in PostgreSQL</a>.
<code>
curl -L -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unsplash/datasets/master/how-to/psql/create_tables.sql
curl -L -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unsplash/datasets/master/how-to/psql/load-data-client.sql
</code></li>
<li>Create the postgresql db - this does assume you have a postgresql server up and running locally. You'll probably need to adjust the commandline as appropriate for your situation.
<code>createdb -h localhost unsplash_lite</code></li>
<li>Create the tables.
<code>
% psql -U jeremy  -d unsplash_lite -f create_tables.sql
CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE
</code></li>
<li>Edit the <code>load-data-client.sql</code> file to replace the <code>{path}</code> section to the full path to the unsplash scratch directory you are in.</li>
<li>Load the data - the numbers output should be 1 less than those  in the <code>wc -l</code> check from Step 4 above. That's because of header lines on all the files. This will probably take a few minutes.
<code>
% time psql -h localhost -U jeremy -d unsplash_lite -f load-data-client.sql
COPY 25000
COPY 2689739 # Hmm.. this one is NOT 1 less than keywords.tsv000 above - will have to investigate
COPY 1646597
COPY 4075504
real    1m48.452s
user    0m57.944s
sys     0m2.320s
</code></li>
</ol>

<h2>Data Quality Checks</h2>

<p>It is always a good idea when you start looking at a dataset to do some cursory data quality checks and see if anything jumps out.</p>

<p>All of the following assume you are at the <code>psql</code> commandline. So connect up: <code>psql -U jeremy -h localhost unplash_lite</code></p>

<h3>Check Referential Integrity</h3>

<p>According to the <a href="https://github.com/unsplash/datasets/blob/master/DOCS.md">dataset documentation</a> the <code>photo_id</code> column on the <code>unsplash_photos.photo_id</code> field is the primary key of all the photos, and the <code>photo_id</code> column in the other tables should refer to the photos table. The <a href="https://github.com/unsplash/datasets/blob/master/how-to/psql/create_tables.sql">create_tables.sql</a> does not create the referential constraint - or indexes on these columns. Lets add those. Doing so will confirm the documented referential integrity.</p>

<pre><code>unsplash_lite=# alter table unsplash_collections add foreign key (photo_id) references unsplash_photos(photo_id);
ALTER TABLE
unsplash_lite=# alter table unsplash_conversions add foreign key (photo_id) references unsplash_photos(photo_id);
ALTER TABLE
unsplash_lite=# alter table unsplash_keywords add foreign key (photo_id) references unsplash_photos(photo_id);
ALTER TABLE
</code></pre>

<p>No errors. Excellent, this confirms the documented referential integrity.</p>

<p>Just to save our sanity while doing some exploring - lets go ahead and add indexes on those foreign key columns. No need to add one for <code>unsplash_collections</code> as it is part of the compound primary key.</p>

<pre><code>unsplash_lite=# create index on unsplash_conversions(photo_id);
CREATE INDEX
unsplash_lite=# create index on unsplash_keywords(photo_id);
CREATE INDEX
</code></pre>

<h3>Cardinality check</h3>

<p>One of the first things I do when looking at a new set of data is check out the cardinality of the columns. In other words, the list of distinct values in the column. This can show you potential errors or just undocumented assumptions in the dataset.</p>

<p>You could use a tool like <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv">xsv</a> to do an initial cardinality report. <code>xsv stats --cardinality -d '\t' photos.tsv000  | xsv table</code> will work.</p>

<p>I'm going with an SQL approach today. Doing a cardinality check is effectively doing a group count on all the values of a column. This query on <code>unsplash_photos.photo_featured</code> for example.</p>

<pre><code>unslash_lite=# select photo_featured, count(*) from unsplash_photos group by 1;
 photo_featured | count
----------------+-------
 t              | 25000
(1 row) 
</code></pre>

<p>This shows that the <code>unsplash_photos.photo_featured</code> field has the value<code>true</code> for every record in the dataset. A cardinality of 1. When a column has a cardinality of 1, it is always <a href="https://github.com/unsplash/datasets/issues/25">worth confirming</a> that this cardinality is correct. In this case <a href="https://github.com/unsplash/datasets/issues/25#issuecomment-677794892">this is expected</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is expected that all the photos in the Lite dataset are featured photos. It won't be the case in the Full dataset
-- <a href="https://github.com/unsplash/datasets/issues/25#issuecomment-677794892">@TimmyCarbone</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first version of the Unsplash dataset I downloaded was the initial release. And when I did cardinality checks on the various <code>unsplash_photos.ai_primary_landmark_*</code> columns, they all had a cardinality of 1, with the value <code>NULL</code>. <a href="https://github.com/unsplash/datasets/issues/12">I asked about this</a>. And it turned out to be a bug, was fixed, and a new release of the dataset was published.</p>

<p>So always worth worth asking questions. Initial clarifications can save hours, days, weeks, even months of person time to find, fix, and reprocess incorrect data assumptions.</p>

<h3>Check for leading and trailing whitespace on text fields.</h3>

<p>Looking at the <code>unsplash_keywords</code> table, there is a <code>keyword</code> column. If the values in this column are from human entered data, in all probability it will be a bit messy. For instance, do any of the keywords have leading or trailing spaces?</p>

<pre><code>unsplash_lite=# select count(*) from unsplash_keywords where keyword like ' %';
 count
-------
  1248

unsplash_lite=# select count(*) from unsplash_keywords where keyword like '% ';
 count
-------
   291
</code></pre>

<p>That could be an issue -- lets see if there's any any keywords that are just padded left or right with spaces.</p>

<pre><code>unsplash_lite=# select keyword, count(*)  from unsplash_keywords where keyword like '% ' group by 1 order by 2 desc limit 5;
     keyword      | count
------------------+-------
 wallpaper        |     5
 california       |     5
 cat photography  |     4
 beautiful        |     4
  silhouette      |     3

unsplash_lite=# select '&gt;' || keyword || '&lt;' as keyword, count(*) from unsplash_keywords where keyword IN (' wallpaper', 'wallpaper', 'wallpaper ') group by 1 order by 2 desc;
   keyword    | count
--------------+-------
 &gt;wallpaper&lt;  |  1951
 &gt; wallpaper&lt; |    12
 &gt;wallpaper &lt; |     5
</code></pre>

<p><em>That || operator is the SQL string concatenation operator, its used here to visually show the padding.</em></p>

<p>Yup -- looks like there might be something to this -- <a href="https://github.com/unsplash/datasets/issues/13">I asked Unsplash about it</a>. There's a whole lot of text fields in the Unsplash data, and like I said, humans never enter data consistently. Turns out this is a known factor in this dataset and <a href="https://github.com/unsplash/datasets/issues/13#issuecomment-672635482">they are are open to community input</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe that having clean fields is important. We might and will probably get to normalizing the location fields at some point in the future, it's just not really planned yet. I'll keep you and everyone posted on this issue as soon as we have a plan to tackle it</p>

<p>Also, if anyone wants to give it a shot, we'd be happy to implement good solutions from the open-source community!</p>

<p>-- @TimmyCarbone</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That <a href="https://github.com/unsplash/datasets/issues/13">issue is open</a> and there are a number of other text columns exhibiting the same characteristics as <code>unsplash_keywords.keyword</code>. It is being kept open for future reference.</p>

<h3>How about if the keywords are normalized on case?</h3>

<pre><code>unsplash_lite=# select count(*) from unsplash_keywords where keyword != lower(keyword);
 count
-------
     0
</code></pre>

<p>Okay - that looks good. Nothing to see here, move along.</p>

<h3>That 1 line difference on keywords from the import</h3>

<p>When looking at the original <code>keywords.tsv000</code> file, it has 2,689,741 rows, which I assumed to be 1 header row and 2,689,740 data rows. When imported, postgresql reported 2,689,739 rows. This does not match my assumption. Lets double check and figure this out.</p>

<pre><code>% wc -l keywords.tsv000
2689741 keywords.tsv000
</code></pre>

<pre><code>unsplash_lite=# select count(*) from unsplash_keywords ;
  count
---------
 2689739
(1 row)
</code></pre>

<p>Still a row off, maybe there's an extra newline in <code>keywords.tsv000</code>?
<code>
% tail -2 keywords.tsv000
--2IBUMom1I     people  62.514862060546903              f
--2IBUMom1I     electronics     43.613410949707003              f
</code></p>

<p>Nope. Well, maybe there was a row eliminated on import. In the <a href="https://github.com/unsplash/datasets/blob/master/how-to/psql/create_tables.sql">create_tables.sql</a> the primary key on the <code>unsplash_keywords</code> table is a compound key of <code>photo_id</code> and <code>keyword</code>.</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE unsplash_keywords (
  photo_id varchar(11),
  keyword text,
  ai_service_1_confidence float,
  ai_service_2_confidence float,
  suggested_by_user boolean,
  PRIMARY KEY (photo_id, keyword)
);
</code></pre>

<p>How about reimporting this data file and see how it looks. Using a new table, that's just like the original one but without the primary key and then import the keywords tsv into it. The <code>\COPY</code> command here is adapted from <a href="https://github.com/unsplash/datasets/blob/master/how-to/psql/load-data-client.sql">load-data-client.sql</a></p>

<pre><code>unsplash_light# CREATE TABLE unsplash_keywords_raw ( photo_id varchar(11), keyword text, ai_service_1_confidence float, ai_service_2_confidence float, suggested_by_user boolean
CREATE TABLE
unsplash_light# \COPY unsplash_keywords_raw FROM PROGRAM 'awk FNR-1 ./keywords.tsv* | cat' WITH ( FORMAT csv, DELIMITER E'\t', HEADER false);
COPY 2689739
</code></pre>

<p>No joy, same as before. Looks like its time to <a href="https://gist.github.com/copiousfreetime/ab23addcb3a6e5612a77d0724e5d52b9">write code</a>. The checks to do are:</p>

<ul>
<li>make sure that all the records have the same number of fields</li>
<li>the number of records in the file matches that reported by <code>wc -l</code> and/or loaded by postgresl</li>
</ul>

<p>My primary programming language is Ruby - so I'll use it.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env ruby

line_number    = 0
unique_counts  = Hash.new(0)
filename       = ARGV.shift
abort "filename needed" unless filename

File.open(filename) do |f|

<p>using a state management package allows you to manage your state globally in your application, it is more like having a global store where each page, widgets can connect directly to and access and manipulate data.</p>
<h3 id="steps-">Steps:</h3>
<ol>
<li>How to install Provider Package
add below snippet in your pubspec.yml file under the dependencies  section</li>
</ol>
<pre><code><span>provider</span>: ^3<span>.1</span><span>.0</span>+1
</code></pre><p>OR</p>
<pre><code>
provider:
</code></pre><p>2.
create a dart file that has all your theme definition</p>
<pre><code>

ThemeData darkTheme = ThemeData.dark().copyWith(
    primaryColor: Color(<span>0xff1f655d</span>),
    accentColor: Color(<span>0xff40bf</span>7a),
    textTheme: TextTheme(
        title: TextStyle(color: Color(<span>0xff40bf</span>7a)),
        subtitle: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
        subhead: TextStyle(color: Color(<span>0xff40bf</span>7a))),
    appBarTheme: AppBarTheme(color: Color(<span>0xff1f655d</span>)));

ThemeData lightTheme = ThemeData.light().copyWith(

    accentColor: Color(<span>0xff40bf</span>7a),
    textTheme: TextTheme(

    appBarTheme: AppBarTheme(
        color: Color(<span>0xff1f655d</span>),
        actionsIconTheme: IconThemeData(color: Colors.white)));
</code></pre><p>3.
Create a theme model </p>
<p>you need to create your theme model</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> <span>'package:flutter/material.dart'</span>;
<span>import</span> <span>'package:whatsapp/theme.dart'</span>;

<span>enum</span> ThemeType { Light, Dark }

<span><span>class</span> <span>ThemeModel</span> <span>extends</span> <span>ChangeNotifier</span> </span>{
  ThemeData currentTheme = darkTheme;
  ThemeType _themeType = ThemeType.Dark;

  toggleTheme() {
    <span>if</span> (_themeType == ThemeType.Dark) {
      currentTheme = lightTheme;
      _themeType = ThemeType.Light;
      <span>return</span> notifyListeners();
    }

    <span>if</span> (_themeType == ThemeType.Light) {
      currentTheme = darkTheme;
      _themeType = ThemeType.Dark;
      <span>return</span> notifyListeners();
    }
  }
}
</code></pre><p>Explanation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>we are creating an enum type for our theme, which we allow us to assign a type to each Themedata, it also helps us to check currently theme efficiently</p>
</li>
<li><p>We create a class that extends ChangeNotifier, create currentTheme as a property of ThemeData and set the default value to darkTheme and also property _themeType  then assign your current themeType to it. you can set any theme of your choice, it's the theme that will be the default app theme</p>
</li>
<li><p>create a method that handles the toggling of your theme from theme 1 to theme 2. But the most important part is to call notifyListener() method, it is the method that informs your store that your state value has changed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Wrap provider Class as a parent of your MaterialApp, which will allow all pages, widgets e.t.c have access to the provider value.</p>
<pre><code><span>void</span> main() =&gt; runApp(
ChangeNotifierProvider&lt;ThemeModel&gt;(
    builder: <span>(<span>BuildContext context</span>) =&gt;</span> ThemeModel(), child: MyApp()));
</code></pre><p>Consuming your state value anywhere in your application</p>
<pre><code>Provider.of&lt;<span>object</span>&gt;(context);
</code></pre><p>it allows you to access your provider store value and access your data. by specifying the ThemeModel.</p>
<p>below is your output</p>
<pre><code><span><span>class</span> <span>MyApp</span> <span>extends</span> <span>StatelessWidget</span> {</span>
  @override

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <div>
              <p>The recent announcement from Mozilla Corporation that it is laying off almost a quarter of its work force has many, including myself, thinking about how we as a society go about ensuring the continued existence of the fundamental digital infrastructure on which so much of modern life depends. The continued funding of open source software, and therefore its long-term sustainability, has been a perennial question for developers, the for-profit companies that rely on open source libraries, and even some of the large <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/about/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure">philanthropic foundations</a>. There don’t seem to be any silver bullets to solve the problem, but the software produced by these projects can be massively important. We’ve seen time and again how just a handful of unpaid people can be responsible for complex pieces of code that are fundamental to the continued operation of our global network. The funding story gets even worse if you look at the need to maintain software instead of develop something new.</p>
<p>On top of that, our relationship with our electronics has always been tinged by the background issues of how they’re made, how quickly we are convinced to replace them, and, frankly speaking, their human and ecological costs. The online services that we connect to using those devices have their own problems, from privacy violations to radicalization, all in service to (or an outgrowth of) keeping us glued to our screens so companies can sell more advertising.</p>
<p>It seems like there should be solutions to both of these (and some other) issues. A way to support the necessary work on important infrastructure as well as divorcing our own use of technology from the incessant needs of capitalism.</p>
<p>There have always been groups of people willing to dedicate themselves to what they view as fundamental in life, without concern for what profit it brought. What if there existed a model for an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_community">intentional community</a> where this type of work could be done? The course of 2020, from pandemic, to the battle for civil rights, to uprisings against dictatorships in Belarus, Hong Kong, and Thailand, has tought us the importance of solidarity, of the power of community, and the need to think beyond the well-trod paths of the 20th Century. So, how could a new type of intentional community, focused on building and maintaining technology to help real people as well as our planet, operate? How would it sustain itself against the backdrop of a capitalist world?</p>
<h2 id="monasteries">Monasteries</h2>
<p>There are, of course, some analogs to this kind of community, both ancient and modern. The Christian monasteries of the late Classical and Middle Ages are one example. The dedication to the church and its teachings gave the members of the monestary the drive to remove themselves from everyday life and pursue what they felt was a higher calling. They were not generally completely separate from society, however. Monks and nuns taught the laity not just religion but also agriculture, mechanics, and metallurgy. They were also responsible for the diligent copying and storage of manuscripts, eventually giving later thinkers the opportunity to read copies of ancient Roman and Greek texts. Monasteries and cathedrals also often offered the only meaningful schooling of the time.</p>
<p>The monasteries themselves were supported by the laity by donations and via the larger Church structure. Some monestaries also produced their own products for sale to the public. The two groups relied to a certain extent on one another. This reciprocal relationship of donations given by the public and knowledge and care given by the monastics in return still sustains the monasteries of today.</p>
<p>The monestary model of course shows up in other cultures as well, such as in Buddhism. The Buddhist model shows a similar symbiotic relationship between monastics and the laity. In fact, monks and nuns are forbidden from growing their own food and must go into their communities to collect donations of food. This binds them to the surrounding people and ensures that they do not retreat and seal themselves off. In return, of course, the monastics provide education and spiritual guidance to the public.</p>
<h2 id="a-shift-of-priorities">A Shift of Priorities</h2>
<p>Religion as a motivating factor is less of a driving force today, but perhaps the drive to improve the lives of people and the planet can still be captured.</p>
<p>Could some of the issues facing the open source movement in particular and the world more broadly be addressed and perhaps alleviated by a reimagined version of that same kind of intentional living and reciprocal support structure? We can combine elements of monastic living with the tenets of open source, communal solidarity, and ecological care, to create a new model for living with technology and the environment. I don’t have a name I like yet (suggestions welcome!), but I’m rolling with “a Dedication” for now. Here are some thoughts on how a Dedication could operate:</p>
<h3 id="fundamentally-important-focuses">Fundamentally Important Focuses</h3>
<p>While of course individual Dedicateds will always have their own passions to pursue, the overriding focus and mission of the Dedications should be centered around a central core of priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crucial and under-supported digital infrastructure on which many people rely</li>
<li>Tools that empower the people that work with them, particularly in cases where those people belong to marginalized communities, instead of huge corporations</li>
<li>Objects and ideas that are designed to operate on long time scales – This means avoiding planned obsolescence, designing for easy repair, and not fetishizing other goals such as speed or size over resilience and longevity</li>
<li>Outcomes that benefit local communities first, rather than trying to solve the problems of a global audience</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="self-sufficiency-and-helping-local-communities">Self Sufficiency and Helping Local Communities</h3>
<p>In addition to support from local and other communities, a Dedication can and should do what it can to be self sufficient:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grow what food it can given the physical location it occupies</li>
<li>Accept donations in return for things they produce or services they provide (e.g. organizations like <a href="https://www.edinburghremakery.org.uk/">Edinburgh Remakery</a>)</li>
<li>Limit the impact on the Earth that the group has by reusing whenever possible, offsetting electricity use by using more efficient equipment and installing solar, wind, and other renewable electrical sources</li>
</ul>

<p>The COVID pandemic makes this suggestion an odd one, but hopefully some day we will be able to go outside and see other people again… While the bulk of open source development happens online, there are some clear benefits that come from gathering together. I think a solitary modern monastic could constitute a Dedication-of-one located in an apartment above a coffeeshop, but they would miss out on some of these benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Costs of all necessities fall when you purchase in bulk. Food, rent, clothing, furniture, and most other items can be had cheaper when you’re buying for 20 instead of one.</li>
<li>Groups of larger numbers are more likely to engage in activities, both in the open source ecosystem and in the local community, that would be likely to garner support through donations of money, equipment, or time.</li>
<li>The work of coding obviously benefits from bouncing ideas off of others. While the internet makes distance collaboration much easier, there is still a tangible benefit to sharing space with colleagues.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-common-outfit">A Common Outfit</h3>
<p>There are a few reasons why Dedicateds should stand out wherever they go. As with monastics of every tradition, Dedicateds should remind everyone around them of the work that they’re doing and the commitment that they have made. They are ambassadors of the entire idea.</p>
<p>It should be as simple as a robe of a given color. In my head green makes the most sense. The color is a reminder of the goal to heal the planet, and green is said to cause feelings of safety and calm. The robe form is important for all the reasons that it was 500 BCE when the Buddha chose it: it is easy to create, inexpensive to obtain, easy to repair, and simple to hand down to another. It is also conveniently non-gender specific. It therefore represents the ideals of reuse, simplicity, and equity that would underly the work of the Dedication.</p>
<h2 id="so-what">So What?</h2>
<p>I’m not running off tomorrow to start some commune. This is 90% “what if” ideas that have been bouncing around in the back of my head for a while. But there is still that 10%…</p>
<p>This is also obviously not the only way to support people working on these important but profit-less projects. There have been some success stories of people making enough of a living off of individual grants, Patreon supporters, or GitHub’s new “Sponsors” program to work on open source as a full time job. I’m not sure that these solutions really scale to more than a handful (relatively speaking) of people, and they don’t really address the issues of our technology’s impacts on ourselves and our planet.</p>
<p>Clearly, nothing in here is even a quarter fleshed out. I’d love to hear from people who are into the idea or think its completely bonkers, as long as they’re cool about it. You can reach out to me <a href="https://twitter.com/RossSchulman">on Twitter</a>, <a href="https://social.rbs.io/@ross">on Mastodon</a>, or <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@rschulman:westwork.org">on Matrix</a>.</p>

    <a href="https://outlandishthinking.com/">Outlandish Thinking</a>

<p>Thereâ€™s free speech and the question of free will, but lately Iâ€™ve been wondering how free our thoughts are. And Iâ€™m pretty sure theyâ€™re not free to roam wherever they may like, but constrained by unseen guardrails and self-censoring mechanisms that arrest the development of interesting ideas before they can be fully articulated.</p>

<p>On average we are probably the most creative and generative as children with the dwindling of this superpower coinciding perfectly with when we begin to develop self-consciousness. Self-consciousness seems to go hand in hand with policing our own thoughts and doubting them before we can fully articulate them and consider their veracity. Itâ€™s as if something inside our brain says â€œstop kidding yourself, that canâ€™t beâ€� and shuts everything down before the thought can be further entertained. Self-consciousness seems to make some things unthinkable and this seems largely in line with the behavior of people lacking self-consciousness. People incapable of considering what others think of them do things others wouldnâ€™t consider doing. But the interesting question remains: why would the mind undermine itself in the first place? My first hunch is that it has to do with the consequences and costs associated with realizing new ideas. Divergent ideas necessitate updating your world view and occasionally this provides you with a shortcut, but itâ€™s much more likely to invalidate the guideposts and milestones we organize our lives and identity around so our memetic immune systems choose to suppress the new idea before it and itâ€™s implications can throw your life into disarray. Itâ€™s memetic suppression or having to backtrack, cross uncharted waters, adjust your exposure, and recognize that milestone you hold so dearly has lost some of its shine. Another possible explanation is moral disgust with ourselves. Biting into a rancid apple or the smell of decaying flesh both activate the region of the brain associated with gustatory and sensory disgust. Interestingly the same region activates when observing social norm deviations. So, maybe this region of your brain turns itself inward directing moral disgust at yourself and thatâ€™s when your mind quickly backs away from that new idea, depriving it of oxygen it needs to fully develop.Â&nbsp;</p>

<p>Comparing languages with opposite grammatical genders for the same words helps to unearth some of these guardrails. To describe a â€œbridgeâ€� which is feminine in German, German speakers use words like â€œbeautiful,â€� â€œelegant,â€� and â€œfragile.â€� But in Spanish where the same word is masculine, Spanish speakers use words like â€œbig,â€� â€œstrong,â€� and â€œdangerous.â€� So language at least influences perception but it also seems to funnel our thoughts in specific directions, as is the case with <a href="https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27181">Russel conjugations</a> where owing to our social nature we unconsciously let the connotations of words discourage us from considering whether the opposite of what we are being told could be true. Describing someone as â€œcrazyâ€� instead of a â€œfreethinkerâ€� impacts how much consideration your audience gives to their ideas.</p>

<p>If language can do these things, itâ€™s not a stretch to assume gaps in our language create artificial boundaries in our minds forbidding us from thinking from new angles and stifling variation in thought.</p>

<p>Luckily, Iâ€™m pretty sure we can neutralize the constraints language places on our thoughts. The invention of new words could allow us to overcome these language induced boundaries in the same way first principles thinking allows us to exceed the constraints of thinking exclusively in available analogies. The best proximate to this is likely the invention of numbers. Before numbers presumably people could distinguish between one and more than one or at least a little and a lot, but two options only leaves you with so much room to reason. The invention of the numeral system allowed for precision and more complexity. The same should be true of words. Coining new words should allow us to explore ideas with more precision and granularity, explore fresh shades of grey for deeper truths, reason up from new building blocks to totally new conclusions, and generally provide us with more room to think. And most importantly, allow us to ask questions we previously couldnâ€™t conceive of, expanding what is imaginable, and finally what is possible<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The most pervasive guardrail stems from a default expectation of ours: the expectation that the natural state is for ideas across a population to be more or less homogenous<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. And this expectation appears to corrupt or at least transcend a lot of our thinking. You see this every time someone comes up with an idea and immediately assumes someone else has already tried it and likely failed, you see this when someone discourages you from entering a crowded market<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>, and itâ€™s especially prevalent among the â€œinnovation is inevitableâ€� crowd. Implicit in the belief that if inventor A hadnâ€™t invented X, inventor B, C, and D would have is the assumption that the possibility of an individual having an idea no one else has is very unlikely<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. Besides the fact that this totally undermines the individual and deprives us of additional innovation, itâ€™s no wonder we donâ€™t give new ideas the necessary space to develop when everything around us, including ourself is telling us they donâ€™t exist <sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>.Â&nbsp;</p>

<p>Understanding how the mind works is probably one of the most important questions in need of an answer. If we really understood it we might know why some people seem to have an easier time thinking without constraints. But for now, just realizing these guardrails exist seems to make it easier to detect when these self-censoring mechanisms are at work, and quickly respond by giving yourself the freedom to ask the unsolicited questions and nourish the weirder ideas. But I still feel deeply uncomfortable knowing yet to be identified guardrails are placing pseudo limits to my imagination. Theyâ€™re probably staring me in the face but like a belief that has always been there Iâ€™m much less likely to question or even notice itâ€™s there.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction:</h2>
<p>In this post, which can be read as a follow up to our <a href="https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/web-scraping-without-getting-blocked">ultimate web scraping guide</a>, we will cover almost all the tools Python offers you to web scrape. We will go from the more basic to the most advanced one and will cover the pros and cons of each. Of course, we won't be able to cover all aspect of every tool we discuss, but this post should be enough to have a good idea of which tools does what, and when to use which.</p>
<p><em>Note: when I talk about Python in this blog post you should assume that I talk about Python3.</em></p>
<h2 id="0-web-fundamentals">0. Web Fundamentals</h2>
<p>The internet is <strong>really complex</strong>: there are many underlying technologies and concepts involved to view a simple web page in your browser. I don’t have the pretension to explain everything, but I will show you the most important things you have to understand in order to extract data from the web.</p>
<h3 id="hypertext-transfer-protocol">HyperText Transfer Protocol</h3>
<p>HTTP uses a <strong>client/server</strong> model, where an HTTP client (A browser, your Python program, curl, Requests…) opens a connection and sends a message (“I want to see that page : /product”)to an HTTP server (Nginx, Apache…).</p>
<p>Then the server answers with a response (The HTML code for example) and closes the connection. HTTP is called a stateless protocol, because each transaction (request/response) is independent. FTP for example, is stateful.</p>
<p>Basically, when you type a website address in your browser, the HTTP request looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">GET /product/ HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q<span>=</span>0.9,image/web<span>\
</span><span></span>p,*/*;q<span>=</span>0.8
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, sdch, br
Connection: keep-alive
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 <span>(</span>Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_6<span>)</span> AppleWebKit<span>\
</span><span></span>/537.36 <span>(</span>KHTML, like Gecko<span>)</span> Chrome/56.0.2924.87 Safari/537.36
</code></pre></div><p>In the first line of this request, you can see multiples things:</p>
<ul>
<li>the GET verb or method being used, meaning we request data from the specific path: <code>/product/</code>.There are other HTTP verbs, you can see the full list <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp">here</a>.</li>
<li>The version of the HTTP protocol, in this tutorial we will focus on HTTP 1.</li>
<li>Multiple headers fields</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the most important header fields :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Host:</strong> The domain name of the server, if no port number is given, is assumed to be <strong>80</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>User-Agent:</strong> Contains information about the client originating the request, including the OS information. In this case, it is my web-browser (Chrome), on OSX. This header is important because it is either used for statistics (How many users visit my website on Mobile vs Desktop) or to prevent any violations by bots. Because these headers are sent by the clients, it can be modified (it is called “Header Spoofing”), and that is exactly what we will do with our scrapers, to make our scrapers look like a normal web browser.</li>
<li><strong>Accept:</strong> The content types that are acceptable as a response. There are lots of different content types and sub-types: <strong>text/plain, text/html, image/jpeg, application/json</strong> …</li>
<li><strong>Cookie</strong> : name1=value1;name2=value2… This header field contains a list of name-value pairs. It is called session cookies, these are used to store data. Cookies are what websites use to authenticate users, and/or store data in your browser. For example, when you fill a login form, the server will check if the credentials you entered are correct, if so, it will redirect you and inject a session cookie in your browser. Your browser will then send this cookie with every subsequent request to that server.</li>
<li><strong>Referrer</strong>: The Referrer header contains the URL from which the actual URL has been requested. This header is important because websites use this header to change their behavior based on where the user came from. For example, lots of news websites have a paying subscription and let you view only 10% of a post, but if the user came from a news aggregator like Reddit, they let you view the full content. They use the referrer to check this. Sometimes we will have to spoof this header to get to the content we want to extract.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the list goes on…you can find the full header list <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields">here</a>.</p>
<p>A server will respond with something like this:</p>
<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu) Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8 &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt; ...[HTML CODE]
</code></pre><p>On the first line, we have a new piece of information, the HTTP code <code>200 OK</code>. It means the request has succeeded. As for the request headers, there are lots of HTTP codes, split into four common classes, 2XX for successful requests, 3XX for redirects, 4XX for bad requests (the most famous being 404 Not found), and 5XX for server errors.</p>
<p>Then, in case you are sending this HTTP request with your web browser, the browser will parse the HTML code, fetch all the eventual assets (Javascript files, CSS files, images…) and it will render the result into the main window.</p>
<p>In the next parts we will see the different ways to perform HTTP requests with Python and extract the data we want from the responses.</p>
<h2 id="1-manually-opening-a-socket-and-sending-the-http-request">1. Manually opening a socket and sending the HTTP request</h2>
<h3 id="socket">Socket</h3>
<p>The most basic way to perform an HTTP request in Python is to open a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sockets.html">socket</a> and manually send the HTTP request.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> socket

HOST <span>=</span> <span></span><span>'</span><span>www.google.com</span><span>'</span>  <span># Server hostname or IP address</span>
PORT <span>=</span> <span>80</span>        <span># Port</span>

client_socket <span>=</span> socket<span>.</span>socket(socket<span>.</span>AF_INET, socket<span>.</span>SOCK_STREAM)
server_address <span>=</span> (HOST, PORT)
client_socket<span>.</span>connect(server_address)

request_header <span>=</span> <span>b</span><span>'</span><span>GET / HTTP/1.0</span><span>\r</span><span>\n</span><span>Host: www.google.com</span><span>\r</span><span>\n</span><span>\r</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span>
client_socket<span>.</span>sendall(request_header)

response <span>=</span> <span></span><span>'</span><span>'</span>
<span>while</span> True:
    recv <span>=</span> client_socket<span>.</span>recv(<span>1024</span>)
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> recv:
        <span>break</span>
    response <span>+</span><span>=</span> str(recv)

<span>print</span>(response)
client_socket<span>.</span>close()  
</code></pre></div><p>Now that we have the HTTP response, the most basic way to extract data from it is to use regular expressions.</p>
<h3 id="regular-expressions">Regular Expressions</h3>
<p>A regular expression (RE, or Regex) is a search pattern for strings. With regex, you can search for a particular character/word inside a bigger body of text.</p>
<p>For example, you could identify all phone numbers inside a web page. You can also replace items, for example, you could replace all uppercase tag in a poorly formatted HTML by lowercase ones. You can also validate some inputs …</p>
<p>The pattern used by the regex is applied from left to right. Each source character is only used once. You may be wondering why it is important to know about regular expressions when doing web scraping?</p>
<p>After all, there is all kind of different Python module to parse HTML, with XPath, CSS selectors.</p>
<p>In an ideal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">semantic world,</a> data is easily machine-readable, the information is embedded inside relevant HTML element, with meaningful attributes.</p>
<p>But the real world is messy, you will often find huge amounts of text inside a p element. When you want to extract a specific data inside this huge text, for example, a price, a date, a name… you will have to use regular expressions.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Here is a great website to test your regex: <a href="https://regex101.com/"></a><a href="https://regex101.com/">https://regex101.com/</a> and <a href="https://www.rexegg.com/">one awesome blog</a> to learn more about them, this post will only cover a small fraction of what you can do with regexp.</p>
<p>Regular expressions can be useful when you have this kind of data:</p>
<p>We could select this text node with an Xpath expression, and then use this kind of regex to extract the price :</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">    <span>^</span>Price\s:\s(\d<span>+</span>\<span>.</span>\d{<span>2</span>})\<span>$</span>
</code></pre></div><p>To extract the text inside an HTML tag, it is annoying to use a regex, but doable:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> re

html_content <span>=</span> <span></span><span>'</span><span>&lt;p&gt;Price : 19.99$&lt;/p&gt;</span><span>'</span>

m <span>=</span> re<span>.</span>match(<span></span><span>'</span><span>&lt;p&gt;(.+)&lt;</span><span>\</span><span>/p&gt;</span><span>'</span>, html_content)
<span>if</span> m:
	<span>print</span>(m<span>.</span>group(<span>1</span>))
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, manually sending the HTTP request with a socket, and parsing the response with regular expression can be done, but it's complicated and there are higher-level API that can make this task easier.</p>
<h2 id="2-urllib3--lxml">2. urllib3 &amp; LXML</h2>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: It is easy to get lost in the urllib universe in Python. You have urllib and urllib2 that are parts of the standard lib. You can also find urllib3. urllib2 was split in multiple modules in Python 3, and urllib3 should not be a part of the standard lib anytime soon. This whole confusing thing will be the subject of a blog post by itself. In this part, I've made the choice to only talk about urllib3 as it is used widely in the Python world, by Pip and requests to name only them.</p>
<p>Urllib3 is a high-level package that allows you to do pretty much whatever you want with an HTTP request. It allows doing what we did above with socket with way fewer lines of code.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> urllib3
http <span>=</span> urllib3<span>.</span>PoolManager()
r <span>=</span> http<span>.</span>request(<span></span><span>'</span><span>GET</span><span>'</span>, <span></span><span>'</span><span>http://www.google.com</span><span>'</span>)
<span>print</span>(r<span>.</span>data)
</code></pre></div><p>Much more concise than the socket version. Not only that, but the API is straightforward and you can do many things easily, like adding HTTP headers, using a proxy, POSTing forms …</p>
<p>For example, had we decide to set some headers and to use a proxy,
we would only have to do this (you can learn more about proxy servers at <a href="https://www.bestproxyreviews.com/proxy-server/">bestproxyreviews.com</a>)</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> urllib3
user_agent_header <span>=</span> urllib3<span>.</span>make_headers(user_agent<span>=</span><span></span><span>"</span><span>&lt;USER AGENT&gt;</span><span>"</span>)
pool <span>=</span> urllib3<span>.</span>ProxyManager(f<span></span><span>'</span><span>&lt;PROXY IP&gt;</span><span>'</span>, headers<span>=</span>user_agent_header)
r <span>=</span> pool<span>.</span>request(<span></span><span>'</span><span>GET</span><span>'</span>, <span></span><span>'</span><span>https://www.google.com/</span><span>'</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>See? Exactly the same number of line, however, there are some things that urllib3 does not handle very easily, for example, if we want to add a cookie, we have to manually create the corresponding headers and add it to the request.</p>
<p>There are also things that urllib3 can do that requsts can't, creation and management of pool and proxy pool, control of retry strategy for example.</p>
<p>To put in simply, urllib3 is between requests and socket in terms of abstraction, although way closer to requests than socket.</p>
<p>This time, to parse the response, we are going to use the lxml package and XPath expressions.</p>
<h3 id="xpath">XPath</h3>
<p>Xpath is a technology that uses path expressions to select nodes or node- sets in an XML document (or HTML document). As with the Document Object Model, Xpath is a W3C standard since 1999. Even if Xpath is not a programming language in itself, it allows you to write expression that can access directly to a specific node, or a specific node-set, without having to go through the entire HTML tree (or XML tree).</p>
<p>Think of XPath as …</p></div></div>

</a>
</p>
<section>
<div><p>A great many file sharing solutions have come and gone over the years. While they may differ in technology or branding, the reasons for their downfall are generally consistent. Hosting user content is challenging for three primary reasons:</p><figure><img src="https://thoughts.willcipriano.com/content/images/2020/08/dead_filesharing_services.gif" alt="The graveyard of file sharing."><figcaption>The graveyard of file sharing.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="1useruploadedcontentandthelongtailofpopularity">1. User-uploaded content and the long tail of popularity</h2>
<p>My guess is the median number of views for a given image uploaded to the average image host is less than two, and one of those is the original uploader. This low engagement makes storage expensive; for every image that goes viral and produces a net return (say, via advertising), thousands are stored and never retrieved.</p>
<h2 id="2usersuploadcontentthattheyshouldnt">2. Users upload content that they shouldn't</h2>
<p>User content can be a ticking timebomb of legal liability. Identifying the misuse of copyrights and trademarks requires human moderators who are experts in illegal content, if not a full legal team. Responding to DMCA takedown requests can be a full-time job.</p>
<h2 id="3peertopeersolutionsmagnifythelongtailproblem">3. Peer-to-peer solutions magnify the long tail problem</h2>
<p>While peer-to-peer mostly solves the illegal content liability problem, the long tail problem is compounded by peer-to-peer solutions. If nobody is interested in the content, nobody bothers to download it and serve it to other peers.</p>
<h2 id="ahumbleattemptatasolution">A humble attempt at a solution</h2>
<p>I’ve thought about these flaws for some time, and finally decided to test the waters with a new solution. <a href="https://podje.li/">Podjeli</a> is a file-sharing service that isn't peer-to-peer and doesn't host any files. How can you share files that haven't been stored? When someone shares a file with Podjeli, the file is compressed, chunked into small bits, and stored as query strings in a series of URLs that are then prepared as markdown, HTML, or simply made ready to be copied and pasted.</p>
<h2 id="techstack">Tech Stack</h2>
<p>Podjeli is a JavaScript application, and all the work, from URL generation to recombination, happens in the browser. It uses <a href="https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string">lz-string</a> for compression and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/javascript/">Bootstrap</a> as the UI framework. File parts are sent as query strings appended to the URLs that are generated. Cloudflare ignores these query strings—they simply serve the same page over and over for each part, and the JavaScript does the work of loading the file parts into local storage until they can be reassembled later. Due to the limitations of local storage, only files that are 5 megabytes or smaller can be reassembled, but a file that large would result in tens of thousands of URLs, so that is an unlikely scenario.</p>

<h2 id="storefilesanywhereyoucanstoreurls">Store files anywhere you can store URLs</h2>
<p>Podjeli opens up some brand-new doors. For example, you can store one or more URLs anywhere, and you can also store an arbitrary file. Social media sites, forums, and comment sections are an obvious choice, but you should also consider things like firewall access logs or your browser’s history.</p>
<p>Similarly, the browser favorites menu offers some amusing possibilities for InfoSec red teams attempting to exfiltrate information. By favoriting a list of Podjeli URLs and allowing them to sync via Chrome favorites, those files could be copied offsite relatively undetected.</p>
<h2 id="urlshortenerspodjelismallerfiles">URL Shorteners + Podjeli = Smaller Files</h2>
<p>The consequences of Podjeli used in conjunction with URL shorteners are interesting. For example, when I took Lorem Ipsum and put it in a plain text file, it weighed in at 445 bytes. I ran that through Podjeli and created two URLs, shortened with <a href="https://tinyurl.com/">TinyURL</a>. Then I took those two shortened URLs and placed them in a file. The new file was 58 bytes for a savings of 86.96%. That is in line with the <a href="https://www.maximumcompression.com/data/text.php">best English text compression available</a>.</p>
<p>The difference is even more significant with larger files. I took the same Lorem Ipsum and copied it 25 times in a text file, uploaded it to Podjeli, and created 27 URLs. From there, I ran each URL through TinyURL and saved those to a file. In this test, I went from 10900 bytes to 808. That brings the compression ratio up to 92.59%. I knew I could do a little better—I took the file containing the TinyURL URLs and ran that through Podjeli, chose the “save as text file” option, and enabled compression. The resulting zip file is 758 bytes for an effectively lossless compression ratio of 93.05%.</p>
<h2 id="athoughtexperiment">A thought experiment</h2>
<p>Podjeli hosts no user files, but in a philosophical sense, it hosts all possible files. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation">According to some interpretations of Multiverse theory</a>, versions of myself have created Podjeli a infinite number of times. In theory, many of those implantations would be compatible with one another, so that a URL generated in another universe would be able to be decoded in our current one.</p>
<figure><img src="https://thoughts.willcipriano.com/content/images/2020/08/will_cipriano_podjeli_multiverse.jpg"><figcaption>Podjeli across the multiverse.</figcaption></figure><p>It has also been postulated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Deutsch">David Deutsch</a> that quantum computation is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Nothing less than a distinctly new way of harnessing nature, it will be the first technology that allows useful tasks to be performed in collaboration between parallel universes, and then sharing the results.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assuming Deutsch is correct, if someone in an alternate universe creates a file containing the cure for cancer or zero-point energy and we had access to a <a href="https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Earth">planet-sized supercomputer in the vein of Doug Adams</a> we could brute force Podjeli URLs until we discover these files. Of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem">this is nothing new</a>, however I find the concept of sharing files over some sort of multiverse internet intriguing.</p>
<h2 id="finalthoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, Podjeli was a project that I wanted to create in order to scratch an itch of mine. I used Bootstrap and jQuery because I am familiar with those tools and they have excellent backwards compatibility. However, going forward, I will probably use something like React and Typescript. In a way, this was my goodbye to the web development tools I cut my teeth on. Bootstrap, it’s been real—see you around.</p>

			<p><strong>In July 2020 a team of researchers, engineers and a drone pilot of TU Delft travelled to an airbase in Germany for a week of test flight, together with a team from Airbus. That’s where the successful maiden flight of the scaled flight model took place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><div id="c650175"><div data-namespace-typo3-fluid="true">

                        <div id="c650496"><p><h3>Flying and collecting data</h3></p><p>PhD candidate Nando van Arnhem is the drone pilot of the project team. He controlled the scaled flight model via radio link. His task: take-off, fly a number of test manoeuvres and approaches until the batteries are nearly empty and land. The goals were:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><ul><li>To show that the aircraft can perform a sustained flight based on predicted flight mechanical behaviour.&nbsp;</li><li>To obtain an initial data set on its flight characteristics.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>And Nando succeeded. The scaled model made a successful maiden flight. </p></div><div id="c650497"><p><h3>Results</h3></p><p>The flight generated a lot of interesting data and knowledge, such as:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Rotation on take-off was performed easily and occurred at a speed of 80 km/h. The plane’s thrust was good and flight speeds and angles were as predicted.&nbsp;</li><li>The centre of gravity of the aircraft was located slightly more towards the rear than had been calculated in advance. For the test flight the team put extra weight into the nose and placed the landing gear a little bit further to the front of the aircraft. If the centre of gravity isn’t in the right location, the aircraft can become unstable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>During the test week the team has had to repair the antenna to improve the telemetry.&nbsp;</li><li>The current design shows ‘wobbling’, in a technical term, Dutch Roll. That makes it difficult to keep the wings level and caused the aircraft to have a somewhat rough landing. Aerodynamic calculations had predicted this behaviour, but now that is has been demonstrated in a real flight, the team will be able to adjust the aircraft accordingly.</li></ul></div><div id="c650498"><p><h3>What’s next?</h3></p><p>With the collected data from the first flight, the team will be able to make an aerodynamic model of the scaled flight model. This model makes it possible to calculate exactly in what ways the scale model will need to be adapted. The team will also prepare the aircraft for new flight tests. For this, they will for example need to repair the nose landing gear.<strong></strong></p></div><div id="c650499"><p><h3>Why is testing with scaled flight models important?</h3></p><p>Test flights involving scaled flight models is important, because you only really know how an aircraft design performs if you fly it in dynamic circumstances. Tests in a wind tunnel are also important, but these only give a static picture. Also: by flying an aircraft design you can show that the design is not just promising on paper.&nbsp;</p></div><div id="c650160">

I tell myself, “Don’t buy another device that will somehow be discharged when you need it,” but to no avail. The siren call would sing, “It has USB-C!” until my wallet opens wider than the Spielberg’s “Jaws”.</p><p>This time, the siren call was a government incentive of 10,600 EUR ($12,100) for a new electric vehicle purchase. “Great,” I thought, “I need to replace my old car.” My experience of driving electric car-shares in Oxford and Berlin was great. So, I purchased a 1.5-ton gadget, with no USB-C ports included, called <a href="https://ev-database.org/car/1204/Hyundai-Kona-Electric-64-kWh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyundai Kona EV</a>:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small.jpg"><img title="Hyundai Kona EV, Credits: https://ev-database.org/car/1204/Hyundai-Kona-Electric-64-kWh" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small-1024x540.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="308" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small-1024x540.jpg 1024w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small-300x158.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small-768x405.jpg 768w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small-500x264.jpg 500w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small.jpg 1179w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px"></a></p><p>Why not a Tesla Model 3, you ask? Fun fact: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nikola Tesla</a> was a naming inspiration for both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tesla cars</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Corporation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nikola trucks</a>. Tesla was an ethnic Serbian born in present-day Croatia, but you can’t officially buy a Tesla or Nikola vehicle in Croatia (where I live) or Serbia. Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1176190550854127616?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted his hope to open sales in the region early in 2020</a>, but as of August 2020 that didn’t happen.</p><p>First, the good parts: as soon as I picked up my car in Zagreb, Croatia, I was impressed. EVs are so quiet that EU law requires they produce a buzzing sound when going slower than 30 km/h. Acceleration is instant; torque is strong enough, even in Eco mode, to make tires scream if I pushed the “gas” pedal too fast. There are no vibrations and no jerking when the car shifts gears. EVs use regenerative breaking, again completely silent. EV charging is currently free in Croatia, and depending on rainfall, <a href="http://mecometer.com/whats/croatia/electricity-production-by-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44% of that electricity is carbon-free</a>. I was in love with the car.</p><p>The first weekend I drove with a group of friends to a <a href="https://www.toastmasters.org/leadership-central/speech-contests" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toastmaster’s competition</a> in Ljubljana, Slovenia, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/A1tH92uEFXTUHuu96" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">143 km from Zagreb</a> (83 mi). Kona EV with 64 kWh battery has a declared range of 450 km (280 mi), so even with 90% battery, I had enough for a round trip. So I thought. I soon learned the first lesson:</p><p><em>#1: EVs have <a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a31898441/study-ev-winter-range-loss-averages-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20% shorter range</a> in cold weather.</em></p><p>It was November. But still, 450 x 90% x 0.8 = 324 km, round trip is 286 km, we were good. While driving 130 km/h on a highway (80mph, a legal limit), I noticed my range dropping significantly. The car specs sheet lied in the worst possible way: they were technically correct. High torque: true. Range of 450 km: true. But:</p><p><em>#2: EVs can’t deliver both performance and declared range at the same time, you need to choose one.</em></p><p>I had the wrong intuition that cars have a longer range on the highway than in the city. That is true for gas cars because gas cars are extremely inefficient in cities. All cylinders are running, swallowing gas when accelerating, and that kinetic energy is lost when braking. As EVs use only the energy needed and recuperate that energy when breaking, they really have a declared range when driving in the city. When driving fast, EV range shortens because <a href="https://www.softschools.com/formulas/physics/air_resistance_formula/85/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">air resistance is proportional to the square of speed</a>. Gas engines are more efficient when all cylinders are firing at constant, high RPMs. As a result, gas cars have a <a href="https://www.mpgforspeed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maximum range at speeds of 89-97 km/h (55-60 mph)</a>. EVs have a maximum range at <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2018/07/15/tesla-range-plotted-relative-to-speed-temperature-graphs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">around 55 km/h (35 mph)</a>, and range falls linearly as you drive faster. For example, this is the range decrease for Tesla Model S, depending on speed and temperature:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/model_s100_range_temp_imperial_grande.png"><img title="Tesla Model S100 range vs speed vs temperature, Credits: https://cleantechnica.com/2018/07/15/tesla-range-plotted-relative-to-speed-temperature-graphs/" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/model_s100_range_temp_imperial_grande.png" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/model_s100_range_temp_imperial_grande.png 600w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/model_s100_range_temp_imperial_grande-300x225.png 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/model_s100_range_temp_imperial_grande-400x300.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><p>As I slowed down, the estimated range increased. Unfortunately, part of the highway was closed for construction, and we needed to take a detour. The round trip just got longer, so I decided to park at the EV charging place. But, it was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_connector" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Type 2 AC charger</a>, meaning another lesson was coming:</p><p><em>#3: To charge at Type 2 AC plugs in the EU, you need to bring your cable.</em></p><p>Of course, I had none. Fast chargers I used before had attached cables, and I was wondering what was the point of <a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kona-EV-Charging-Auto-Lock.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the cable lock button on Hyundai Kona</a>? It is there because:</p><p><em>#4: Lock your <a href="https://www.evexpert.eu/p/338/duosida-charging-cable-type2-type2-32a-3phase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">230 EUR Type 2 cable</a> if you don’t want it stolen.</em></p><p>Between event sessions, I was Googling “fast EV chargers in Slovenia.” Highway stops by “Petrol” had them, great. Around 11 PM, we left Ljubljana in high spirits. We arrived at the Petrol station and found a fast charger, with cables. Guess what happened next:</p><p><em>#5: EU fast chargers are activated via a proprietary chip card or smartphone app. Each company in each country uses a different card / app.</em></p><p>Of course, I only had a smartphone charging app for Croatia. Lessons were coming fast:</p><p><em>#5A: Petrol gas stations clerks can’t sell you a Petrol charging card, and they can’t activate an EV charging even when you want to pay for it.</em></p><p>“Download and register in the Petrol app,” the night clerk said. Yes, but:</p><p><em>#5B: Petrol Android app is 50 MB, so if a station is covered by a <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/glossary.php3?term=edge#:~:text=EDGE%20(also%20known%20as%20Enhanced,order%20to%20conserve%20spectrum%20resources." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slow EDGE signal</a>, you can’t download the app.</em></p><p>We got back to the highway, where my friend caught H+ signal and downloaded the app. At the next Petrol station, we discovered:</p><p><em>#5C: When you hit the “Start charging” button in the Petrol app, it redirects you to a registration form to enter payment and address.</em></p><p>No problem, I can fill the form, even on EDGE signal. But then:</p><p><em>#5D: To register in the Petrol app, needed for charging, you need a valid address in Slovenia.</em></p><p>It is good the EV charging station was 20 meters away from the gas station because I was cursing Petrol so loud a clerk would have had all rights to call the police. I should have read <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=si.petrol.onecharge&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Petrol app comments</a> beforehand:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1.png"><img title="Petrol app comments" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1-1024x732.png" alt="" width="584" height="417" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1-1024x732.png 1024w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1-300x214.png 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1-768x549.png 768w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1-420x300.png 420w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1.png 1105w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px"></a>It was past midnight when we got back on the highway. To extend the range, I slowed down to 75 km/h (46 mph). The limit was 130km/h, so a trailer truck started taking over us. Then I remembered a Tour de France strategy I saw on TV:</p><p><em>#6: In an emergency, you can extend the range of your EV by tailgating a&nbsp; trailer truck, a strategy called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drafting_(aerodynamics)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aerodynamic drafting</a>.</em></p><p>Don’t hold me responsible for traffic tickets or beating by an angry trucker. There I was, hidden behind a trailer truck, to save electricity while driving 90 km/h. The car showed it was using less power, and the range extended. When we entered Zagreb, there was 19 km left:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Zagreb-low-battery-small.jpg"><img title="Kona EV low battery warning, Credits: Zeljko Svedic" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Zagreb-low-battery-small-300x233.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="233" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Zagreb-low-battery-small-300x233.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Zagreb-low-battery-small-387x300.jpg 387w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Zagreb-low-battery-small.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p><p>I went to a fast-charging station I could actually activate, and I fell asleep in the car.</p><p>I made fun of Petrol for their unfriendliness towards tourists, but at least the EV chargers at Petrol stations are working. In Croatia, you can’t always count on that. In my modest opinion, that stems from the fact that charging is free. Why is free electricity a problem, you ask? There is no commercial incentive to build and maintain charging stations. Instead, most chargers are built when the EU donates money or when the government is pressed to improve EV infrastructure. Local politicians come when a charging station is finished to deliver speeches: “This is an example of Croatia using EU funds wisely, for a green and sustainable future.” After the journalists leave, there is no economic interest in sustaining chargers in the future.</p><p>For example, this city-provided Type 2 charger has been broken for three months:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Garage-broken-charger-2-small.jpg"><img title="Broken charger 1, Credits: Zeljko Svedic" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Garage-broken-charger-2-small.jpg" alt="" width="641" height="873" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Garage-broken-charger-2-small.jpg 641w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Garage-broken-charger-2-small-220x300.jpg 220w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px"></a></p><p>In front of the Zagreb city hall, one charging station displays an error:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-1.jpg"><img title="Broken charger 2, Credits: Zeljko Svedic" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-1.jpg" alt="" width="704" height="455" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-1.jpg 704w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-1-300x194.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-1-464x300.jpg 464w" sizes="(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"></a></p><p>While other just states it is out of order:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-2.jpg"><img title="Broken charger 3, Credits: Zeljko Svedic" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-2.jpg" alt="" width="535" height="145" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-2.jpg 535w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-2-300x81.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-2-500x136.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px"></a></p><p>What I learned is:</p><p><em>#7: Free chargers are often unmaintained, and you are better with a commercial provider you can hold accountable.</em></p><p>“But, there is nothing to break on a charging station!” I thought. Boy, I was wrong. EV charging stations use internal computer for authorization, and for controlling the display and the charging protocol. Before charging starts, a car locks the cable with the mechanical pin and signals that back to the charger. When a car is unlocked, it signals a charger to drop the voltage to zero, so the mechanical pin holding cable can be released. Guess what?</p><p><em>#8: Some chargers are not compatible with some EVs and refuse to stop charging, resulting in the “Hotel California effect.” You can check out in the app, but you can never leave.</em></p><p>For example, Croatian Telecom chargers. The first time their cable got stuck in my car I panicked. Their app was not working, the charger was not responding to car signals, and their charging stations don’t have the stop button:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HT-charger-cable-locked.jpg"><img title="HT charger cable locked, Credits: Zeljko Svedic" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HT-charger-cable-locked.jpg" alt="" width="899" height="585" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HT-charger-cable-locked.jpg 899w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HT-charger-cable-locked-300x195.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HT-charger-cable-locked-768x500.jpg 768w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HT-charger-cable-locked-461x300.jpg 461w" sizes="(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 899px"></a></p><p>They have the contact phone, but it was Sunday afternoon. I called them, expecting three levels of menus and “we are not working on weekends” message. To my great surprise, a female voice answered after two rings. “I have a big problem with your EV charging station: I can’t get my car out because…” My explanation was stopped by “What is the serial number written on the station?” As I dictated the serial, I could hear fast typing. A few seconds later charging station stopped buzzing, display went blank for a moment, and I could unplug my car. “Wow, that was fast, thank you very much!” I said. Although they currently don’t charge for electricity, Croatian Telekom is a commercial operation. They have a direct 24/7 support line where a representative can reset any charging station in Croatia, provided the serial number. It seems that such a solution was easier than fixing charging stations or the charging app. I now just call them and say, “Can you reset the station with serial X?” If you work there, let me know, I would like to buy a box of chocolates for the team.</p><p>Unfortunately, EV charges are not the only thing broken here. Our driving culture is also broken:</p><p><em>#9: It is common to find a gas car parked at the EV charging spot, the practice called <a href="https://twitter.com/ivebeeniced?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ICEing</a> (internal combustion engine-ing).</em></p><p>One time I urgently needed to charge, and this was the charging spot:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-parking.jpg"><img title="Blocking EV parking, Credits: Zeljko Svedic" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-parking.jpg" alt="" width="717" height="785" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-parking.jpg 717w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-parking-274x300.jpg 274w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px"></a></p><p>ICEing is common around the world.

    <h3>Fully embracing the dumb terminal laptop</h3>
    <p>August 29, 2020</p>
    <img src="https://zainamro.com/assets/img/chromebook.png">
    <p>A few days ago, I picked up a <a href="https://www.google.com/chromebook/device/samsung-chromebook-4/">$229 Chromebook</a> with minimum specs and have decided to replace all my existing Macbook Pros and Airs and use it as my main machine for development work (and everything else). This isn’t because it’s a great laptop; in fact, it’s a far-below-average laptop when you consider the current hardware options on the market. But, that’s precisely why I picked it — it leaves nothing more to be desired, because I redefined what I expect out of a laptop and instead optimized on price and having the minimum feature set to connect to a remote machine. It might sound a bit defeatist, but once you treat your client machine as a dumb terminal and nothing more, you actually end up with a more robust and reliable setup.</p>
    <p>After being constantly disappointed with common Macbook quality issues (keyboard problems, display gasket peeling off, etc.) and looking at the available options on the market, I realized my seemingly basic desire to have an easy to use, robust laptop that has software and hardware that just works is becoming more of a pipe dream. So, I did something that seems like a regression — buy a low-end, dumb laptop that I just use to ssh into a remote linux server where I do all my work. I chose a Chromebook because it’s portable, has good battery life, and has an operating system that is decent for non-dev work. When in terminal, I use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">Screen</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> to work and save my sessions for later. And, I use <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> which allows me to magically create a private mesh network between my machines in a couple minutes; this is what makes it easy to access remote services on my server like a locally-hosted web server for instance. When I'm working outside without access to wifi, I simply connect to my phone's hotspot which provides me enough speed to work on my remote server. This no-frills setup is simple but works well enough.</p>
    <img src="https://zainamro.com/assets/img/chromebook_screenshot.png">
    <p>With a distributed setup, the client machine is just the control device to a much larger system. I couldn’t care less how fancy or powerful my laptop is as long as it has a display, keyboard, and internet that works. And if this laptop is stolen or breaks, I wouldn't be affected. I would just buy another cheap laptop and pick up where I left off. This was perhaps the wisdom behind the vision for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs">Plan 9</a> distributed operating system which took this core idea to a whole new level during the 80’s beyond dumb terminals.</p>
    <p>This setup may obviously not work for everyone since terminal/ssh is limited when it comes to non-textual work or work requiring more visual interfaces. Of course, you could setup X11 forwarding or some other remote GUI software, but I've always found the latency too unbearable to work with. I think in 2020, it might be worthwhile to take a step back and ask ourselves whether this should still be the case. When you think of all the amazing things you can do with distributed computing and what Plan 9 managed to do over 30 years ago, it makes one wonder why we’re still stuck with basic tools like terminal/ssh; with the right abstractions and local caching, we could provide a more integrated relationship between software, network computing, and the visual representation of that on the client machine. Additionally, the rise of 5G brings us even closer to "always online" laptops with fast internet, opening the door to more interesting architectures centered around network computing. I’d imagine a true modern successor to Plan 9 (I don't mean ChromeOS) would be a delightful experience where laptops instead focus on providing beautiful, well-functioning interfaces to remote computing systems with theoretically infinite computing power, memory, and storage. Assuming the network and security/privacy challenges can be figured out, this seems to me like it would be a far superior approach to how we use computers today.</p>

September 1, 2020 | https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><img src="https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/fight.jpeg" alt="Fish"></p>
<p>In the early 70s, C was created at Bell Labs as a byproduct of the development of UNIX.
It quickly became one of the most popular programming languages.
But it was not expressive enough for Bjarne Stroustrup.
And so, in 1983, as a byproduct of his Ph.D. thesis, he extended C.</p>
<p>C with classes was born.</p>
<p>At the time, Bjarne Stroustrup understood that a programming language has many components,
not only the language, its compiler, but also a linker and libraries.
Offering a familiar tool also makes adoption easier.
In this historical context, it makes sense that C++ would be based on C.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 40 years later.</p>
<p>Both C and C++ are widely used in the industry.
But go 5 minutes on the Internet and C developers will tell you that C++ is the most horrific man-made creation,
while many C++ developers wait for the day when C finally burns in the hot flames of hell.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-happened">So what happened?</h2>
<p>On the surface, C and C++ cater to the same use cases: high performance, deterministic, native but portable code for the widest range of hardware and applications.</p>
<p>But C is proudly a low-level language. A nicer assembly.</p>
<p>From day one, C++ had magic. Dark witchcraft: destructors. Suddenly the compiler was doing things on its own.
It also had type inference very early on, but the developers of the mid-80s were not quite ready for that and Bjarne Stroustrup
was pressured into removing <code>auto</code>, until it was added back to C++11.</p>
<p>From then, C++ got more and more tools to build abstractions.
I don’t think it would be fair to say that C++ is a low-level or high-level language. It’s both, by design.
But building high-level abstractions while not sacrificing performance is hard.
C++ then needed tools to achieve that: <code>constexpr</code>, move semantics, templates, and an ever-growing standard library.</p>
<p>Fundamentally I think C trusts developers while C++ trusts compilers.
This is a massive difference that sharing the same native types or syntax for while loop cannot hide.</p>
<p>C++ developers blame C for all their lost limbs, while C developers probably think C++ is batshit crazy.
I imagine that is a fair perspective if you look at C++ through a C lense. C++ is pretty wild <em>as a superset of C</em>.
A seasoned C person looking at C++ expecting familiarity in C++ will not find it. C++ is not C.
This is enough to feed flamewars for generations.</p>
<p>But as much as I dislike C, I don’t have any legitimacy to make fun of it. See, I have some experience with C++ but I
wrote very little C. It was probably bad C.
A language is also its good practices, patterns, idioms, and these take years to learn. If you try to write C code like it’s C++ or C++ like it is C, you will have a bad time.
Knowing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWhqhNdYyk">C doesn’t teach you C++</a>. Knowing C++ does not teach you C.</p>
<p>So can we all stop saying C/C++, regret the unfortunate naming, and sing kumbaya in harmony?
Not so fast.</p>
<p>See, despite being philosophically different from C, C++ is still somewhat a superset of C.
That is to say, you can include a C header in a C++ translation unit and that should compile.
And this is where it gets messy.</p>
<p>C++ is not an extension of C.
It is designed as a separate standard, by a different committee, different people.
Logically, people who like C++'s philosophy will get involved in the C++ community and the C++ standardization process
while other people might try to get involved with C.
Committees, whether its C’s or C++'s, only manifest intent and direction through their respective end-product: the standards; standards which are the fruits of numerous voting.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is difficult for a compiler to know that it is dealing with a C header or a C++ header.</p>
<p><code>extern "C"</code> is not used consistently and only affects mangling, but neither grammar nor semantics.
And headers only exists in the eyes of the preprocessor, for a C++ compiler, everything is a C++ translation unit, and therefore C++.
And yet, people include C headers in C++ and expect it to “just work” ™️.
Which it mostly does.</p>
<p>We can wonder then,</p>
<h2 id="how-c-maintains-c-compatibility-while-being-developed-by-different-people-in-different-places">How C++ maintains C compatibility while being developed by different people in different places?</h2>
<p>Badly, I’m afraid.</p>
<p>A coworker recently reminded me of Conway’s law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By that logic, it would stand to reason that if the two committees don’t interoperate,
neither would the languages they produce.</p>
<p>C++ maintains a list of <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.iso">incompatibilities with C</a> and <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.library">its standard library</a>.
This list does not seem to reflect the many features that were added to C11 and C18 but are not valid C++ constructs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibility_of_C_and_C%2B%2B">Wikipedia</a> draws a clearer picture.</p>
<p>Listing incompatibilities isn’t sufficient to get a measure of incompatibilities between both languages.</p>
<p>Functions that exist in the C++ standard library but whose primary declaration is expected to come from C are difficult to make <code>constexpr</code>, and more difficult still to make <code>noexcept</code>.
C compatibility translates to performance costs and C functions are optimization barriers.</p>
<p>Many C constructs are valid C++ but should never pass a code review (<code>NULL</code>, <code>longjmp</code>, <code>malloc</code>, create/destroy functions, <code>free</code>, C  casts), etc.</p>
<p>These might not be bad C idioms, but they are bad C++. C++ has a stronger type system,
and unfortunately using C idioms punch a giant hole in that type system, and so C compatibility has a cost in terms of safety.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, C++ still care about C compatibility. Somewhat.
And interestingly C cares about C++. Somewhat.
Truth be told, C might care about C++ more than C++ cares about C.
So each committee cares somewhat about what the other does.
We care reluctantly.</p>
<p>See, C++ is aware of the many foundational libraries written in C, not only the <code>libc</code> but also <code>zip</code>, <code>png</code>, <code>curl</code>, <code>openssl</code> (!), and countless others, which are used in many, many C++ projects.
We can’t break that.</p>
<p>But recently, especially over the past decade, C++ has become much bigger than C.
C++ has more users - and a much more active community: <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/11/21/">There Are No C Conferences</a>.
Maybe that’s why the C++ committee is now over 10 times the size of the C committee.</p>
<p>C++ then is a force to be reckoned with and the C committee has to consider not breaking C++.
To the point that if a standard would track another, these days, C++ leads and C follow.</p>
<p>C++ is now on a steady three years cycle come rain or shine, or deadly pandemics.
Meanwhile, C has a major release every decade or so.
This makes sense. As a lower-level language, C doesn’t need to evolve as fast.</p>
<p>The C landscape is also rather different from the C++ landscape.
C caters to more platforms and a lot more compilers.
Everybody and their dog is writing C compilers because the language has a surface area small enough to make that possible, whereas the C++ committee will only really consider 4 implementations, all of which are represented at every meeting.
As a result, many features in C are implementation-defined or optionally supported so that the variety of compilers that exist can claim conformance without doing much work, which I’m told pleases regulatory bodies.</p>
<p>C++ these days is more interested in portability than implementation freedom. Yet another difference of philosophy.</p>
<h2 id="so-your-proposal-breaks-c-compatibility">So, your proposal breaks C compatibility</h2>
<p>Parts of my <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2178r1.pdf">P2178</a> paper theoretically affects C compatibility.
In such cases, none of the options seems satisfactory.</p>
<p>You could be told that you have to first get your feature into C. Which means more meetings.
Meetings you might not be able to attend because C has strict <a href="https://thephd.github.io/follow-the-river-wg14-ithaca-2019">attendance rules</a> - Excluding individuals not willing to put down thousands of dollars to become ISO members.
This is because the C committee is forced to adhere strictly to ISO rules.</p>
<p>It might also take a decade if the standard just shipped.
And most importantly, it might go nowhere if the C committee doesn’t understand or doesn’t care about the particular problem you are trying to solve.
And they probably don’t have the bandwidth to deal with it.
And you may not have the bandwidth to deal with C. After all, you joined C++ to improve C++.
In fact, if the room invites you to “talk to the C committee”, it is likely your proposal is dead, even in the unlikely event that no one in the room was against it.</p>
<p>Another likely scenario is that the C committee accepts a version of a proposal that is slightly different from what exists in C++.
<code>true</code>? Let’s make that a macro. <code>char16_t</code> ? Let’s make that a typedef. <code>char32_t</code>? Not necessarily UTF-32. <code>static_assert</code> ? <code>_Static_assert</code>.</p>
<p>The list goes on. Should we blame C? Probably not. Their committee does what they think is best for their language.
The opposite is true too. In C++20 designated initializers were inspired by C’s but are slightly different because they would otherwise not fit with the C++ initialization rules.</p>
<p>I am part of the problem. C has VLAs. I would vote against a proposal to adopt that in standard C++, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-Kills-The-VLA">too many security issues</a>. A proposal to add <code>_Generic</code> to C++ would be over-my-dead-body. I am not sure if <code>_Generic</code> attempts to palliate to the lack of template or the lack of overloads, but C++ has both these features - from my point of view <code>_Generic</code> doesn’t fit into the big picture of what I imagine C++ to be.</p>
<p>Both committees seem also inconsistent in how much they care about the other language.
Sometimes we go to great lenghts (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/complex">std::complex</a>), sometimes we don’t care at all (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/array">static array parameters</a>).</p>
<p>There is no way around this. Don’t forget that each committee is a bunch of people
voting at different times in different rooms and trying to control the outcome would defeat the purpose
of having a vote.
Putting people in the same room is not realistic either. ISO might object and the participation inbalance
would put C people at an enormous disadvantage.</p>
<h2 id="c-compatibility-doesnt-matter-kinda">C compatibility doesn’t matter, kinda</h2>
<p>If you are a C developer, I imagine you see C as a neat programming language.
But for the rest of us, C is something else.</p>
<p>C is the universal, cross-language glue that ties it all together.</p>
<p>For C++ users, C is …</p></div></div>

<p>Think of whatever internal initiative your company is pushing right now. Is it an agile transformation? Are you trying to grow your devops competency? Maybe you’re getting into the CDP space? Whatever it is, you probably have a small team of internal people owning it. </p>



<p>Pretend for a second that it’s not internal; instead, let’s say you hired a startup to lead it. Would you still be paying that startup? How would your employees rate it? Is it delivering the results you wanted? Would you have even hired that particular startup in the first place?</p>



<p>The great thing about startups is that they either find a product/market fit, or they die. That process is everything. It usually involves lots of experimentation, observing problems, asking questions, talking about Jobs To Be Done, all kinds of stuff. There are thousands of books written about it.</p>



<p>Internal initiatives tend to skip all of that. A few executives get together and decide that the company needs to do X, and a team is put together for it. Nobody is interviewed, no problems are observed, no questions are asked, and what’s a JTBD again? </p>



<p>“But we did do all that stuff!” Sure you did, for the market of potential clients, but that’s not your market in this case. <em>The market is your internal employees</em>. The startup needs to provide a service to your internal employees, so that they can in turn start providing a service to the potential clients. Did you interview your internal employees? Did you observe their problems? Did you talk about their Jobs To Be Done?</p>



<p>Probably not, so you end up with initiatives that are building a product before a market fit is determined. Is there any chance a startup would ever succeed with that origin story? How many initiatives have you seen die on the vine – most of them? Could it be that adoption never really happened naturally, because the product being offered solved all the wrong problems?</p>



<p>Startup thinking could solve that. Take a note from The Lean Startup and run cheap, easy experiments to get to the root of the problems that actually need solving. Or read The Mom Test and start asking people about their problems without ever talking about your solutions.</p>



<p>Treat your internal employees like the market that they are. Find the product/market fit for them, and build the startup they would love to hire. </p>

			<p><span>Infrastructure, ops, devops, systems engineering, sysadmin, infraops, SRE, platform engineering. As long as I’ve been doing computers, these terms have been effectively synonymous. If I wanted to tell someone what my job was, I could throw out any one of them and expect to be understood.</span></p>
<p><span>Every tech company had a software engineering team that built software and an operations team that built infrastructure for running that software. At some point in the past decade they would have renamed this operations team to “devops” or “SRE”, but whatever the name, that was my team and those were my people.</span></p>
<p><span>But unless you’re an infrastructure company, infrastructure is not your mission. Which means that every second you devote to infrastructure work — and every engineer you devote to infrastructure problems — is a distraction from your core goals.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What’s more, it’s a distraction that builds on itself. The more time and energy you spend on infrastructure, the more your focus gets scattered, and the more you deprive yourself of the time and energy that ought to be devoted to the problems your business exists to solve.</span></p>
<p><span>This isn’t exactly new. Infrastructure and operations have always been a distraction from your core business problems. It used to be the case that every company had to grow internal expertise in hardware, datacenters, networking, operating systems, config management, and so on up the tech stack until reaching their core business problems. Infrastructure and ops have always been a distraction, but until recently, a necessary one. A means to an end.</span></p>
<p><span>So what’s changed? These days, you increasingly have a choice. Sure, you </span><i><span>can</span></i><span> build all that internal expertise, but every day more and more of it is being served up via API on a silver platter.</span></p>
<p><span>Does this mean that operations is no longer important, no longer necessary? Far from it. Operations and operability are more important than ever. Let’s take a look at what’s happening to the ops profession at a high level, the emerging challenges we face, and the impact this’ll all have on our careers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Changes afoot</b></h3>
<p><span>Beyond the broader move into to cloud services, here are some of the major shifts on our horizon.</span></p>
<h5><b>From monolith to microservices</b></h5>
<p><span>Much has been written about the operational demands of a microservices architecture. Now that functions calling other functions involves a network hop, operational concerns are an unavoidable part of debugging even the most trivial problems. Microservices change the game from “building code” to “building systems”, which pushes more and more code writing into the realm of operations.</span></p>
<h5><b>From monitoring to observability</b></h5>
<p><span>Metric-based tools like Prometheus and DataDog are infrastructure monitoring tools, and quite good ones at that. When you’re responsible for infrastructure, the questions you care about are of aggregates and trends, thresholds and capacity. Monitoring tools are the right tool for the job, because that’s how you understand whether your infrastructure is healthy, and what actions to take to make it or keep it healthy.</span><span><br>
</span><span><br>
</span><span>Observability tools*, on the other hand, are for the people writing and shipping code to users every day, and trying to inspect and understand behavior at the nexus of users, production, and code. Observability tools preserve the full context of the request. This allows you to slice and dice and tease out new correlations, as well as view events in a waterfall by time (“tracing”). Observability is how you connect the dots between software and real business impact, and between your engineers’ experience and your users’ experience. </span><span><br>
</span><span><br>
</span><i><span>*Caution: many monitoring tools are trying to rebrand themselves as observability tools without first building the necessary functionality. To tell the difference, </span></i><a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/so-you-want-to-build-an-observability-tool/"><i><span>see here</span></i></a><i><span>.</span></i></p>
<h5><b>From magic autoinstrumentation to instrumenting with intent</b></h5>
<p><span>Instrumentation is just another form of commenting and documenting your code. There are tools that promise to do it automatically for you, but they aren’t great at capturing intent.. Auto-instrumentation can tell you loads of ancillary details, but they will </span><i><span>never</span></i><span> let you divine the business value intended by the engineer who built it. So suck it up and instrument your code.</span></p>
<h3><b>Ops is dead. Long live ops.</b></h3>
<p><span>Ops teams are going the way of the dodo bird, yet operability, resiliency, and reliability have never been more important. The role of operations engineers is changing fast, and the role is bifurcating along the question of infrastructure. In the future, people who would formerly have called themselves “operations engineers” (or devops engineers) will get to choose between a role that emphasizes </span><i><span>building infrastructure software as a service </span></i><span>and a role that uses their infrastructure expertise to help teams of engineers ship software more effectively and efficiently…generally by building as little infrastructure as possible.</span></p>
<p><span>If your heart truly beats for working on infrastructure problems, you’re in luck! — there are more of those than ever. Go join an infrastructure company. Try one of the many companies — AWS, Azure, all the many developer tooling companies — whose mission consists of building infrastructure software, of being the best in the world at infrastructure, and selling that expertise to other companies. There are roles for software engineers who enjoy building infrastructure solutions as a service, and there are even specialist ops roles for running and operating that infrastructure at scale, or administering those data services at scale.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Otherwise, embrace the fact that your job consists of </span><i><span>building systems to enable teams of engineers to ship software that creates core business value</span></i><span>, which means home brewing as little infrastructure as possible. And what’s left?</span></p>
<h5><b>Vendor engineering</b><span>&nbsp;</span></h5>
<p><span>Effectively outsourcing components of your infrastructure and weaving them together into a seamless whole involves a great deal of architectural skill and domain expertise. This skill set is both rare and incredibly undervalued, especially considering how pervasive the need for it is. Think about it. If you work at a large company, dealing with other internal teams should feel like dealing with vendors. And if you work at a small company, dealing with other vendors should feel like dealing with other teams.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Anyone who wants a long and vibrant career in SRE leadership would do well to invest some energy into areas like these:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Learn to evaluate vendors and their products effectively. Ask piercing, probing questions to gauge compatibility and fit. Determine which areas of friction you can live with and which are dealbreakers.</span></li>
<li><span>Learn to calculate and quantify the cost of your and your team’s time and labor. Be ruthless about shedding as much labor as possible in order to focus on your core business.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Learn to manage the true cost of ownership, and to advocate and educate internally for the right solution, particularly by managing up to execs and finance folks.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Product engineering</b><span>&nbsp;</span></h5>
<p><span>One of the great tragedies of infrastructure is how thoroughly most of us managed to evade the past 20+ years of lessons in managing products and learning how to work with designers. It’s no wonder most infrastructure tools require endless laborious trainings and certifications. They simply weren’t built like modern products for humans.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>I recommend a crash course. Embed yourself within a B2B or B2C feature delivery team for a spell. Learn their rhythms, learn their language, soak up some of their instincts. You’ll need them to balance and blend your instincts for architectural correctness, scaling patterns, and firefighting.</span></li>
<li><span>You don’t have to become an expert in shipping features. But you should learn the elements of relationship-building the way a good product manager does. And you must learn enough about the product lifecycle that you can help debug and divert teams whose roadmaps are hopelessly intertwined and whose roadmaps are grinding to a halt.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Sociotechnical systems engineering</b><span>&nbsp;</span></h5>
<p><span>The irreducible core of the SRE/devops skill set increasingly revolves around crafting and curating efficient, effective sociotechnical feedback loops that enable and empower engineers to ship code — to move swiftly, with confidence. Your job is not to say “no” or throw up roadblocks, it’s to figure out how to help them get to yes.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Start with embracing releases. Lean hard into the deploy pipeline. The safest diff is the smallest diff, and you should ship automatically and compulsively. Optimize tests, CI/CD, etc so that deploys happen automatically upon merge to main, so that a single mergeset gets deployed at a time, there are no human gates, and everything goes live automatically within a few minutes of a developer committing their code. This is your holy grail, and most teams are nowhere near there.</span></li>
<li><span>Design and optimize on-call rotations that load balance the effort fairly and sustainably, and won’t burn people out. Apply the appropriate amount of pressure on management to devote enough time to reliability and fixing things versus just shipping new features. Hook up the feedback loops so that the people who are getting alerted are the ones empowered and motivated to fix the problems that are paging them. Ideally, you should page the person who made the change, every time.</span></li>
<li><span>Foster a culture of ownership and accountability while promulgating blamelessness throughout the org. Welcome engineers into production, and help them navigate production waters happily and successfully.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Managing the portfolio of technical investments.</b></h5>

<p>“Xpra is a tool which allows you to run X programs — usually on a remote host — and then direct their display to your local machine, disconnect from these programs, and reconnect from<br>
the same or another machine, all without losing any state. It differs from standard X forwarding in that it allows disconnection and reconnection without disrupting the forwarded<br>
application; it differs from VNC and similar remote display technologies in that xpra is rootless: i.e., applications forwarded by xpra appear on your desktop as normal windows managed<br>
by your window manager, rather than being all “trapped in a box together”. Xpra also uses a custom protocol that is self-tuning and relatively latency-insensitive, and thus is usable<br>
over network connections that are too slow or unreliable for standard X forwarding. Xpra can also be used to shadow an existing X11 display.”</p>

        <p>The machine that powered numerous Number Stations</p>
      
        <p>
          uberardy — 2020-08-29
        </p>
      </div>
  
  <div>
    <p>A few years ago, I first stumbled over some recordings of number stations and started reading up on their history. For most of them, we have pretty good guesses who ran them and for what purpose. One example is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxlrnAC7Y7Q">Gongs and Chimes Station</a>, known for its melody that got increasingly creepy over the years, the more worn down the tape got. What always seemed mysterious to me is the kinds of devices used to actually generate the spoken messages. Were they similar to electromechanical devices used for time announcements over the telephone, <a href="https://youtu.be/4aMqKr0D-7o?t=47">with multiple play heads</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lESMfh72RJg">complicated tape mechanisms</a>?</p>
<p>Then, I stumbled over <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4buFLqjvTjA">this video</a>. And... It's <em>the actual voice</em> used by the <em>Gongs and Chimes</em> Station? What surprised me was how rather small, polished and complex the machine seemed. There definitely was a microcontroller in there, it had an LED display, and just in general seemed like a rather fancy device.</p>

</div>

<div>
    
    <p><img src="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/sprach-morse-generator.jpg" alt="Grey box-shaped machine with a tilted front panel. There are a paper punch tape reader, LED display and numeric keyboard with some extra buttons on the front."> 
    </p>
    
</div>

<div>
    <p>The most important thing however was, I finally knew what to look for. Searching for "Sprach-Morse-Generator" (Speech-Morse-Generator) quickly got me to <a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/spy/owvl/32620/index.htm">a page about it at the crypto museum</a> which also mentions its official name: "Gerät 32620" (Device 32620). The page also has some great information about the history of the device and the voice behind it.</p>
<p>What exited me the most was... There are actually links to technical documentation about the Speech generator and its companion device, Gerät 32621, which could be used for digitizing voice recordings and writing them to EPROM cartridges to use with Gerät 32620.</p>

</div>

<div>
    <h3><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/spy/owvl/32620/files/MfS_OTS_4061.pdf">The 32620 Guide</a></h3>
<p>I don't want to go over everything mentioned in these guides; if you speak German I'd recommend giving it a read yourself; but I do want to mention some things I found notable.</p>
<p>As input, either paper punch tapes, the keyboard, or a serial interface (RS-232) can be used. The last one is a bit unclear, it is mentioned in the beginning, but later parts of the document mention it as a possible future addition. Either way, the messages are transferred to RAM, from where they can later be transmitted. It can hold up to 3791 characters.</p>
<p>The language samples are loaded from an exchangeable cartridge which can hold up to 96 kByte, where they are stored as uncompressed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation">PCM</a> . They proudly mention the cartridges can be swapped in 10 seconds.</p>

    </p>
    <p>The number of words per minute and pitch of the voice can be varied, which explains why some recordings of number stations with the same voice sound a bit different.</p>
</div>

    <p><img src="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/tastatur.png" alt="Technical drawing of display and keyboard: Display showing three groups of digits.

    </p>
    
</div>

<p>What I find quite surprising: The keyboard and output of the device mostly uses English words. A bit unexpected for a device developed in eastern Germany for use in the Soviet Union; I would rather have expected Russian there.</p>

    </p>
    <p>There are some pretty charming charts in the documentation showing some interactions with the device.</p>

    <p><img src="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/backside.png" alt="Technical drawing of the back of the device, with power and data inputs and line output."> 
    </p>
    <p>On the back are a speaker, output to the transmitter and some status outputs and remote control inputs. These were probably used so the chimes and speech wouldn't overlap.</p>
</div>

<p>There are also pretty detailed schematic drawings and lists of component at the end of the document.</p>

<div>
    <h3><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/spy/owvl/32620/files/MfS_OTS_4062b.pdf">The 32621 Guide</a></h3>
<p>This is the companion device used for digitizing voices and writing them to cartridges for the 32620. It's quite astounding how complicated this device really is: It can either record words separately or all of them in one go, it automatically recognizes the beginning and end of the words, it can duplicate cartridges and it even has a UV chamber for clearing the EEPROMS on a cartridge to reuse it.</p>
<p>What's interesting: There are no photos of this device. It's unclear how many were produced, there may just have been one or two. The only things we know about it are from this document.</p>
<p>In its architecture, it is quite similar to the 32620, it has a very similar keyboard and probably the same display.</p>

</div>

<div>
    <p>One interesting difference: It uses German labels on the keyboard. Also, all of the text it shows on the display is in German.</p>
    <p><img src="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/tastatur2.png" alt=""> 
    </p>
    
</div>

<div>
    <p>The documentation mentions recording up to 20 words. This also came up in the 32620's documentation, although only 13 words were ever used: digits 0-9, "Achtung" (Attention), "Trennung" (Seperation) and "Ende" (End).</p>
<p>It has controls for adjusting the 0-level of the recordings and amplification. LEDs show whether it senses an audio signal and whether it's clipping. The amplification for single words can also be adjusted later, from a value of 0 to 7. It seems like this doesn't actually change the recorded samples but controls the amplification level in the digital to analogue converter. This feature is intended for making all the digits similar in volume.</p>
<p>I find this a bit surprising, all of this is something that could be done with other equipment, especially since only two different voices for these machines are known: German and Spanish.</p>
<p>In order to check the recording, either all recorded digits or just combinations of them can be played back.</p>
<p>When programming to an EPROM, it transfers the start address and amplification for each word and the samples from RAM to the ROM and checks whether the values it reads back after programming are as expected.</p>

</div>

<p>There is a separate mode for deleting cartridges where the time to expose them to UV can be typed in via the keyboard. If the rom cartridge is double sided, the cartridge has to be turned around to delete the chips on the other side.</p>

<div>
    <p>For all of the different modes of the 32621, flow charts for the interface are provided.</p>

    </p>
    <p>The front also features various other indicators, e.g. for the different voltages in the device.</p>
</div>

<p>This manual also includes schematics for the device.</p>

<div>
    <h3>The EPROMS</h3>
<p>The crypto museum also provides dumps of the EPROMS for both the German and Spanish cartridges.</p>
<p>Having read the manuals, decoding them is actually not that hard: The data is stored as PCM, and the 32621 Guide mentions the time between samples is 125μs, which adds up to a sample rate of 8000Hz.
Loading the roms into Audacity with File&gt;Import&gt;Raw Data, you can actually already listen to them!</p>
<p>[Edit: Here are the dumps as WAVs, if you're interested: <a href="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/2620_ger.wav">german</a>, <a href="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/2620_span.wav">spanish</a>]</p>
<h4>The Header</h4>
<p>In the very beginning of the first EPROM, there are 64 byte of header information, containing the start address for each word and its amplification factor. For 20 words, that leaves just over 3 bytes per word, although they seem to just stick to 3.</p>
<p>Decoding the rest of the header took a lot longer than anticipated. I found the 3 bits for the amplification value pretty quickly in the last byte for each word. The rest somehow had to be the start address or some offset, and possibly the length. For accessing the values in each of the 8K chips, 13 Bits for the address are needed. To select one of the up to 12 EPROMs, another 4 Bit are required. This adds up to 17 Bits, so one more than in two bytes.</p>
<p>To get around this, there are two obvious solutions: Stuff the one extra bit into the byte which holds the amplification level, or throw away the least significant bit for the start address, so just every other sample can be used as the start sample.</p>
<p>Two things made this really hard to pin down: The z80 is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">little endian machine</a>, meaning for 16 bit values, the less significant byte is stored before the more significant byte, but this doesn't mean they would <em>have</em> to store the values in this order. Also, the binary chip select value for the first EPROM isn't 0, but 2. I only stumbled upon that when looking at the schematic for the EPROM cartridge (p. 38 in the 32620 manual). There's also a really cute demultiplexer built from discrete AND and NAND gates for translating the chip address to the actual chip select lines!</p>

</div>

<div>
    <p>Isn't it gorgeous! Note how it only <em>suggests</em> the presence of the fourth address line for the chip select with that not connected NAND.</p>
    <p><img src="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/demux.png" alt="The schematic for the demultiplexer built out of discreet components."> 
    </p>
    
</div>

<div>
    <p>My best guess to why is the case is the chip select address values 0 and 1 are already used to select some other components. But, at last, I think I found out how it works:</p>
<p>For each word, the second byte contains the 3 least significant bits for the chip select and 5 of the address bits. The first byte contains the remaining 8 address bits. The end of each word is the beginning address for the next word. That's why there are two extra bytes after the last word. This would have worked for up to twenty words, as there would still be 4 spare bytes to contain the end address of the last word. The third byte contains the remaining chip select bit, some mysterious bits, and 3 bits for the amplification level.</p>
<p>The remaining chip select bit is still a bit confusing to me: The German recordings don't use it, since they fit on just 6 EPROMs. The Spanish one has to use it for the last two words, but there's something odd happening with the values in the one before the last two words.</p>
<p>Another thing worth noting: The German words all use the default amplification level of 3, whereas the Spanish ones use lower and higher values for some words. To be <em>really</em> authentic, you'd have to take that into account when playing the samples.</p>
<p>One last thing I was interested in: The Spanish voice uses the same word for "Trennung" and "Ende"&amp;em;"final", and they sure <em>sound</em> the same. So, is …</p></div></div></div></div>

While <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2020-07-01-is-futhark-getting-faster-or-slower.html">we sometimes make mistakes</a>, the the long-term trend is pretty good. Yesterday, however, we made a change that flat out makes some programs slower, without fixing any bugs. This post will serve as a bit of catharsis, and detail some of the less enjoyable parts of compiler development.</p>
<p>One of the <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2019-12-18-design-flaws-in-futhark.html">early design flaws in Futhark</a> is that all array sizes are 32 bit signed integers. This limits each array dimension to about two billion elements. Further, since the memory address space is ultimately one-dimensional (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access">NUMA</a> shenanigans notwithstanding), we must flatten multi-dimensional array indexing to a one-dimensional offset. If <code>A</code> is an array of type <code>[n][m]i32</code> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order">row-major form</a>, then the index expression <code>A[i,j]</code> will be flattened to <code>A[i*m+j]</code>. In Futhark, this multiplication and addition was done with 32-bit signed integers, which limited the <em>total size in bytes</em> of multi-dimensional arrays to 2GiB. This size restriction has not been a big problem in practice, as our main code generation target (GPUs) is fairly memory-constrained, so it is rare to have single arrays that are this large. But GPU memory banks are growing every year, so this <em>will</em> be a problem soon. Further, <a href="https://github.com/HnimNart/">Minh Duc Tran</a> is currently finishing up development on a multicore CPU code generation backend, which will make Futhark useful on more than just GPUs. On a CPU, an array larger than 2GiB is not exceptional. Therefore, we changed the code generator to use 64-bit integers when computing flat offsets when generating array indexes. This is just the initial step, and does not truly allow large arrays yet, but it’s a good place to start, and to begin to understand the performance ramifications.</p>
<p>So what are these performance ramifications? While 64-bit arithmetic operations possibly takes a little longer to perform, that’s not the concern. The main problem is that they require more <em>registers</em>. A modern GPU consists of what NVIDIA calls <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/cuda/">streaming multiprocessors (SMs)</a>. Other vendors have a similar design, but a different name. Each SM can run many threads (hundreds to thousands), which all share the same <em>register bank</em>. An NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti has 256KiB of registers on every SM. Each GPU thread is allotted a portion of this register bank. The size of this portion remains unchanged throughout the run-time of the thread, but can be set when the thread is first launched. This is different from CPUs, where the amount of registers available to a thread is an unchangeable hardware detail. However, the more registers each GPU thread needs, the fewer threads will be able to run at the same time. If a GPU thread needs too many registers, a compiler can perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_allocation">spilling</a>, where register contents are temporarily copied to memory and recovered later. This is exactly the same idea as on a CPU, but where CPU code can spill to the stack, which is readily cached using the deep and sophisticated cache hierarchy of a modern CPU, spilling to memory on a GPU can be quite expensive. This means that <em>register pressure</em> is a significant concern for GPU code, with sudden and somewhat unpredictable performance cliffs. Spilling is normally under the control of the GPU kernel compiler, which translates C-like GPU code to GPU machine code, but with some ability for the programmer to influence its behaviour.</p>
<p>Changing the array indexing code to use 64-bit integers will increase register pressure, which can (and does) have negative performance implications, but the details are highly sensitive to what else is happening in the program. Perhaps other parts are already register-hungry enough that the overall usage remains unchanged. The overall impact on Futhark-generated is difficult to quantify. While we have <a href="https://futhark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man/futhark-bench.html">decent tools for reproducible benchmarking</a>, our setup is not statistically robust enough to measure tiny fluctuations of a percent or two, which is in most cases the impact I would expect to see. But for a few programs, the impact of using 64-bit address calculations looks more significant.</p>
<p>One is <a href="https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark-benchmarks/blob/master/finpar/OptionPricing.fut">OptionPricing</a>, which for its largest dataset suffers a 23% slowdown on our NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti GPU. I did some investigation, and indeed the register usage of its single (very large) GPU kernel has gone up slightly. But here’s the interesting thing: <em>the slowdown only appears with the OpenCL backend</em>. With Futhark’s CUDA backend, there is no performance change! I did a little bit of investigation into how the two backends differ in the <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html">PTX</a> (virtual NVIDIA GPU machine code) they cause to be generated, and it appears the OpenCL compiler is keeping certain 64-bit values around in registers for longer periods of time, while the CUDA compiler is more aggressive about recomputing them when needed. This is beyond what the Futhark compiler has any control over, which is a bit frustrating. I thought that NVIDIAs OpenCL and CUDA implementations where merely different front-ends to the same backend compiler, so I’m not sure why they would differ here. A similar phenomenon occurs for a few other benchmark programs.</p>
<p>Overall, there is no doubt that using 64-bit indexing slows down the generated code - it only becomes a question of how much. Perhaps we can recover some of the lost performance by various micro-optimisations, or passing different options to the GPU vendor compilers that ultimately generate the machine code. But at the end of the day, we are getting slower because we are doing more work with bigger data, and that has a cost. That cost will only increase as we gradually convert more of the compiler to use 64-bit sizes and indexes. This <em>sucks</em>, and has no immediate payoff, as all of our current workloads <em>fit</em> in 32 bits! But this is ultimately the right thing to do. However, I hope that the multicore CPU backend will allow someone to write a fun and motivating program that uses huge arrays, just so this work doesn’t feel exclusively like a slowdown for no practical advantage.</p>

<![CDATA[Why I Actively Discourage Online Tooling Like Jwt.io and Online JSON Validators]]>

September 1, 2020 | https://www.jvt.me/posts/2020/09/01/against-online-tooling/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.jvt.me/posts/2020/09/01/against-online-tooling/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Something my colleagues know well is how little I trust online tools like <a href="https://jwt.io/">jwt.io</a>, online JSON validators or online tooling in general, but it also bleeds into <a href="https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2020/08/zebqf/">comments I make online</a> and in my blog posts, too, and I thought I'd share a little bit of a reason as to why.</p><p>Instead of using an online service, I will reach for a way to run it locally, using whichever programming language toolchain I have available. But why? Why wouldn't I recommend something like jwt.io? Or an online JSON validator, especially if they boast client-side functionality, and mean I don't need things installed?</p><p>Let's start with a bit of background. Firstly, I'd just like to caveat this all with the note that <strong>I have no access to Production data, customer or otherwise</strong>. All of these examples are referencing Non-Production examples.</p><p>I also want to caveat this with the fact that this is <strong>not a personal attack</strong> on jwt.io. I am using them as an example as they're a well-known and well-used service, and I've seen issues with it before. Auth0 run it, and are probably one of the few companies we'd want to be running it. It's also <a href="https://github.com/jsonwebtoken/jsonwebtoken.github.io">Open Source</a> <em>but</em> one of the great difficulties of Web-hosted services are that we have no idea if the source code that we're told is being used is actually being used!</p><p>I'm currently working on the Open Banking platform for Capital One. We're fortunate to have very restricted access to Production, which makes things safer for everyone. One thing we strive to do is to treat Non-Production secrets like Production ones where possible - where we shouldn't have access to them at all, and shouldn't be sharing them with external services. Some of these Non-Production secrets may be usable outside of Capital One, for instance Open Banking Sandbox signing certificates.</p><p>We perform a fair bit of testing in our Non-Production environments and sometimes need to debug things, such as what's inside a JWT (as Open Banking introduces several places they're used). I've been burned a number of times by folks putting a Non-Production JWT or an Open Banking Sandbox certificate into jwt.io. Although Non-Production, these are sensitive in of themselves, as they have implementation details for our services, and as mentioned, certain things could be used outside of Capital One.</p><p>The biggest reason I hear from folks using online tooling is that it's easier, and that they'd rather do that than find out how to run it locally. I disagree with this, but am quite biased, as I often have a blog post for many of these common issues. I love sharing my blog with others and having a handy solution, or if I don't have an answer to a problem, I'll find out how and <a href="https://www.jvt.me/tags/blogumentation/">blogument it for later</a>. So I see that reaching for online tooling is more just because we've got folks who aren't aware of how they could do otherwise.</p><p>One great thing about removing the need for an online tool is that you can self-serve it once you have the tools locally. You can run it locally when you've got no internet (which isn't as much of an issue in these Coronavirus times) but also regardless of whether the upstream service is broken. You can use it with other i.e. command-line tooling, for instance how I've set up <a href="https://gitlab.com/jamietanna/dotfiles-arch/-/blob/master/terminal/home/bin/unpack">this command-line script</a> to handle a lot of common data formats I deal with and unpack them to a human-readable format.</p><p>But most importantly, by telling people to put sensitive data (such as credentials, configuration files, etc) it's a really dangerous lesson for our teams. We're teaching people to blindly trust arbitrary websites that they don't have any relationship with, nor have fully audited the source code, when posting potentially sensitive data.</p><p>I realise this may not be something you do when running it locally, but it's less likely for a well-known library running locally to need to reach outbound.</p><p>jwt.io is an interesting example, because although it boasts that it runs as a client-side solution, you may not have been aware that <a href="https://github.com/jsonwebtoken/jsonwebtoken.github.io/commit/b362ab19a9f37e337b5f8ea38987aa680aa6e0a9">until last September</a>, there were metrics being determined which although may have seemed innocent, show that it's easy for other functionality to be hidden in a seemingly client-side-only website. Unless you audit everything, every time, you're in a risky position where you may be leaking data you're not expecting to.</p><p>I feel that we can do something to help services that handle potentially sensitive data with helping educate the user that they should be more careful, because jwt.io's warning definitely doesn't help with folks who don't fully appreciate what the risk is if jwt.io isn't actually as trustworthy as the user thinks:</p><blockquote><p>Warning: JWTs are credentials, which can grant access to resources. Be careful where you paste them! We do not record tokens, all validation and debugging is done on the client side.</p></blockquote><p>What do you think? Am I maybe being a little too sensitive? Am I not being sensitive enough?</p><p>Edit: Based on some conversations being had in response to the post, I thought it'd mention I've written about how to <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/06/13/pretty-printing-jwt-openssl/">pretty-print a JWT locally with OpenSSL</a> and <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2018/08/31/pretty-printing-jwt-ruby/">a Ruby alternative</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

I'm old 😭</p>&nbsp;<h2>The problem with our current stack</h2><p>The process of making a web app is so unnecessarily complex and so many people are going for a SPA even when it's not needed. GraphQL makes working with an API easy, but it still involves building that API, and writing a lot of boilerplate. You might not mind all of that until someone removes the layer for you. And that's <a href="https://blitzjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blitz</a>.</p>&nbsp;<p>"Damn, I just want to fetch some data directly from the database and display it!" - You, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"You can do that with PHP and raw SQL..." - Someone on HN, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"LMAO" - You</p>&nbsp;<p>"Well, why don't you use Rails?" - Someone on Reddit, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"I only know JavaScript and I want to use React" - You, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"Welp, too bad there's nothing similar to Rails in the React world..." - Someone on Twitter, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"Hey, what if there was a Fullstack React framework, similar to Ruby on Rails?" - Blitz, if it could talk, probably</p>&nbsp;<p><em>Meteor crying in the corner, probably</em></p>&nbsp;<h2>What is Blitz?</h2><p>Blitz "removes" the API layer in a very clever way so you can directly call functions from your backend, which completely changes the game. Actually, this is not the best way to describe what it does, so you better <a href="https://blitzjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read the docs</a>. TL;DR: it's magic.</p>&nbsp;<p>What I like about Blitz is that it builds on top of already solid solutions like <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next.js</a>, <a href="https://react-query.tanstack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">react-query</a>, and <a href="https://prisma.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prisma</a>. I already used them in other projects, but I love the way Blitz glues all of them together and it magically works. </p>&nbsp;<p>The ability to get whatever you want directly from the database, with the nicely typed API from Prisma, and then just display it, is a pretty wonderful experience. It makes me feel that for years we had no frickin' clue why we did things the way we did them, until finally someone realized that we don't have to do them that way.</p>&nbsp;<p>When generating a new Blitz app you get all the authentication boilerplate generated for you and I all I have to say is <em>fucking finally</em>.  It's 2020, I don't want to build the authentication layer again, and again, and again, and again. Hey frameworks, just let me get me the current user with <code>const user = useCurrentUser()</code> and don't bother me with anything else.</p>&nbsp;<p>I can't even describe how fast you can ship a product when there is no API layer and boilerplate involved. </p>&nbsp;<p>There are similar frameworks to Blitz which go in a completely different direction by rebuilding most of the stack. Personally, I'm tired of the React community constantly reinventing things that don't need reinventing. Next.js is already amazing, so just imagine how much code we'd be able to reuse if we all agree on using it by default. More reusing, less reinventing, please.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Launching a production app in a few days</h2><p>I already did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiLYvLNDeKA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr-7Z9Grvfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">streams</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/flybayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brandon</a>, the creator of Blitz, and I couldn't wait to actually try Blitz on a real project. The problem is, I needed a real project because I didn't want to waste my time on some demo gibberish which is never going to see the light of day.</p>&nbsp;<p>I got frustrated by the app that I was using for writing changelogs for <a href="https://sizzy.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sizzy</a>, so I decided to sit down and write <a href="https://fungarzione.com/sizzy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my own tool</a> with some more advanced features that will make the process easier. </p>&nbsp;<p>I <a href="https://twitch.tv/thekitze" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">livestreamed the entire process</a> from "hello world" to deployment and I couldn't believe that it only took me only 5 days. </p>&nbsp;<p>Actually, the majority of the work was done in only 2 days, which is crazy. Someone commented "my boss shouldn't see this" on the stream and the credit for that goes to Blitz. You can definitely ship faster than a team of people who would argue about the modeling of the API, raw SQL queries, and whether to use redux-saga or RxJS for fetching the data.</p>&nbsp;<p>Hey Kitze, if you finished most of the things in 2 days, why did it take you 5 days?</p>&nbsp;<p>Great question, reader.</p>&nbsp;<ul><li><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" focusable="false" role="presentation"><g fill="currentColor"><polygon points="5.5 11.9993304 14 3.49933039 12.5 2 5.5 8.99933039 1.5 4.9968652 0 6.49933039"></polygon></g></svg>Day 3: Polishing the design and adding extra features</li><li><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" focusable="false" role="presentation"><g fill="currentColor"><polygon points="5.5 11.9993304 14 3.49933039 12.5 2 5.5 8.99933039 1.5 4.9968652 0 6.49933039"></polygon></g></svg>Day 4: Deployment. I deployed the database to DigitalOcean without a problem, but I had a problem with deploying the Blitz app to Vercel. Turns out, the problem wasn't with Blitz or Vercel and it was ... TypeScript. Yup, I couldn't deploy the app because TS was being a pain in the ass, and the Vercel logs didn't show that. I had to dive deep, find the problematic files, and fix everything, so that took most of the day.</li><li><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" focusable="false" role="presentation"><g fill="currentColor"><polygon points="5.5 11.9993304 14 3.49933039 12.5 2 5.5 8.99933039 1.5 4.9968652 0 6.49933039"></polygon></g></svg>Day 5: CSS. Of course. You can put as many layers as you want on top of CSS, it's still CSS at the end of the day. I literally lost an entire day on centering things and making sure the fixed header and sticky footer layouts work in Safari on iOS. Oh, by the way, fuck Safari. We finally got rid of the pain that's IE pain, but Safari is here to replace it.</li></ul><h2>Why another changelog app?</h2><p>I would never make an app if there wasn't an actual need for it. There are tons of Saas products for making changelogs, but I had something different in mind.</p>&nbsp;<p>I was using a popular solution for writing the Sizzy changelogs for 1.5 years. However, the changelog was a huge markdown document, so we had to use Notion boards to plan the work as individual cards, and then collaborate on them with the Sizzy team. When we were done, we'd export markdown from all the cards and merge them in a giant markdown document. In the past 3 months, I'm working on the changelog alone, so I decided to directly write the giant markdown document. Aside from being an overwhelming experience, I also lost my 3 hours of progress by accidentally closing the tab.</p>&nbsp;<p>So I said: fuck it, I'd rather build a proper changelog app instead of writing this changelog again.</p>&nbsp;<p>I wanted to improve the process of collaborating and publishing a changelog, and in the process, I came up with a bunch of ideas that will hopefully change the changelog game. Wait... was there ever a <em>changelog game</em>? If not, there is now. Boom 🎤</p>&nbsp;<p>Wait, the mic should actually drop.</p>&nbsp;<p>🎤  </p>&nbsp;<p>There.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Introducing <a href="https://fungarzione.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fungarzione</a> - The Changelog Of The Future</h2><p>Instead of publishing a giant markdown document, a team of collaborators would start working on individual entries. The editor supports Markdown, but also MDX, with a set of custom components that would make the changelogs way better. </p>&nbsp;<p>Creating a changelog entry is super simple, and it's not as overwhelming as starting a giant markdown document.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Individual entries can then progress from Draft to Ready For Review, to Published. Team collaboration features like assigning people and commenting on the entries will be available when registration is open to everyone.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>After creating a bunch of entries, a changelog is created by combininig individual entries, as well as adding a list of small bug fixes and improvements, which will appear grouped at the end of the document.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Then, the draft changelog is moved to "Ready for Review" and it cannot be published, unless all of the entries in that changelog area already published.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Users can leave feedback individually for each changelog, as well as subscribe to get an email when a new changelog is published.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<h2>Fungarzione is live</h2><p>I already ported <a href="http://fungarzione.com/sizzy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the last 10 changelogs for Sizzy</a> to Fungarzione and I'm already in love with the publishing experience. It's not that overwhelming and I can work on the changelog in chunks.</p>&nbsp;<p><em>self high-five</em></p>&nbsp;<p>Also, to be honest, even with my mediocre design skills, it already looks better than some of the popular changelog apps out there 🙈 </p>&nbsp;<p><em>taps myself on the back a bit more</em> </p>&nbsp;<p>If you're interested in signing up you can <a href="https://fungarzione.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leave your email here</a> and you'll get a notification when public access is available (hopefully soon).</p>&nbsp;<p>I'm also looking for people who'd like to port their changelog <em>now</em>, so I can get some feedback on the editor experience. You just need to have a production app with an established user base, as well as an existing changelog. Just <a href="mailto:kristijan.mkd@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shoot me an email</a> and we can discuss.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Conclusion on Blitz</h2><p>I still have to explore Blitz a bit more to figure out all the downsides, but I think that I'd definitely pick Blitz for most of my future apps, unless I have a really specific reason not to. Brandon said there will be a way to reuse the same Blitz client in React Native apps, so you won't miss the actual API layer.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Fungarzione</h2><p>I know what you're thinking right now.</p>&nbsp;<p>Fungarzione?!</p>&nbsp;<p>FUNGARZIONE?!?! What the hell does the name mean, Kitze?</p>&nbsp;<p>Fungarzione comes from the word Fungangarzione. And the origin of Fungangarzione is really a long story, so I guess you'll have to <a href="https://twitch.tv/thekitze" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hang out in my stream</a> to find out 😜 I'm planning to live stream the rest of the work on this app, and trust me, there are too way too many things that I'd like to do. If you have any ideas or suggestions you're more welcome to join my stream! 🙌</p>&nbsp;<p>I want to give another shout-out to all the people on Twitch who helped me while I was building this app (even though they're credited in the footer of the page).</p>&nbsp;<p>There's no way I would've shipped it in such a short time without your help 💜</p>&nbsp;</div></div></div></div>]]>

          <p><strong>Field-programmable gate array (FPGA) expert Lattice Semiconductor has embraced the ethos of the open hardware community, creating a portal which lists what the company describes as “community sourced” open hardware development boards and reference designs.</strong></p>
<p>“In addition to proprietary boards developed by Lattice and other partners there is a broad array of boards developed by the open source community,” Lattice notes on its freshly-launched portal. “In some cases just the designs are available and in other cases there are sources available for purchasing assembled boards.</p>
<p>“For your convenience we list some of the more popular and interesting Community Sourced boards on the Lattice website. Lattice does not evaluate or certify community sourced boards so you will want to make your own assessment as to fitness for your application.”</p>
<p>The initial list of boards, all naturally built around Lattice FPGAs, is split into two. The first half showcases development kits and boards, uncluding the recently-launched ECP5-based OrangeCrab, the popular TinyFPGA Bx, iCEBreaker, Fomu, and Alhambra II. The second half looks at reference designs, including an ECP5 board from Matthew Venn, the myStorm BlackIce-II, Dadamachines Doppler, and the unusual earring form-factor iCE Bling from Electronut Labs.</p>
<p>Each board in the list receives a dedicated showcase page which highlights key features, provides imagery, and links out to external homepages, source code and design file repositories, and provides links to where finished boards can be purchased for immediate use.</p>
<p>The full list of boards and reference designs can be found on the <a href="https://www.latticesemi.com/en/Solutions/Solutions/SolutionsDetails01/CommunitySourced">Lattice Semiconductor website</a>; the company has also indicated that it is accepting suggestions for other boards not currently included via a <a href="http://ww3.latticesemi.com/Community_Sourced.html">contact form</a>.</p>

<section data-level="1" id="-steps-to-use-an-effort-value-matrix-and-work-more-effectively-with-your-team-">
<p>Software teams today are working hard on a wide variety of interesting, complex, and challenging problems.  Being successful is as much about figuring out the right work to do as it is about doing that work right.  One of the tools that can help your team do this effectively is the effort/value matrix.  An effort/value matrix is simply an adaptation of the urgent/important matrix known as the <a href="https://www.eisenhower.me/eisenhower-matrix/">Eisenhower matrix</a>, which is widely used in decision-making. Whether you’re tasked with developing new features in an app, deciding on your business strategy, trying to hit a goal or KPI, or planning a social media campaign, this method makes it easy to hone in on the right things to spend your time on. </p>
<p>Our team refers to effort/value grids constantly as we improve our suite of products (<a href="https://www.subtask.co/">Subtask</a>, <a href="https://team.video/">Team.Video</a>, and <a href="https://www.plectica.com/">Plectica</a>).  Here is a guide for how to use an effort/value matrix so you can work more effectively with your team on your biggest challenges.</p>

<section data-level="2" id="-get-all-ideas-on-the-table"><h2>1. Get all ideas on the table</h2>
<p>The first thing to do is gather and expose all your available options.  This might be the result of a brainstorming session, it might be a list of requests from various customers or stakeholders, it might just be a to-do list you made.  The important thing is to put it all into a place where  everyone can think explicitly about each of them.  Great ideas can come from anywhere—engineers, CEOs, designers, customers, product managers, customer service representatives, sales associates, etc.  Bring together whoever has input on the specific problem you’re focused on.  You can do this exercise with post-it notes on a whiteboard, or using online software such as <a href="https://www.subtask.co/">Subtask</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.subtask.co/uploads/subtask-example-task-board.png" alt=""></p>

</section>
<section data-level="2" id="-get-different-perspectives-and-discuss-tradeoffs"><h2>2. Get different perspectives and discuss tradeoffs</h2>
<p>Next, it’s time to build the effort/value matrix by discussing the costs and tradeoffs associated with each idea.  This is another part of the process where it’s important to have a variety of different perspectives in the discussion.  </p>
<p>If you’re developing a product roadmap, have an engineer there to speak to the feasibility of an idea, and a product owner to speak to the idea’s value.  Other perspectives can help too, depending on the phase you’re in: sales and marketing, business viability, customer usability, legal or financial constraints, etc.  </p>
<p>The purpose of bringing these perspectives together is to boil it down to a relative measure of Effort and Value.  </p>
<p><strong>Effort</strong> may be defined as the estimated time it might take, the relative complexity, or the number of unknowns.  <strong>Value</strong> may be a combination of market size, expected impact on customer usage, or the capacity for it to enable further work on other ideas.</p>
<p>In the course of the team’s discussion, a customer success manager might note that one item was requested frequently from users and an engineer might estimate that it’s a fairly low amount of work to implement.  As you have these discussions you can begin positioning each item in the effort value matrix.  </p>
<p><img src="https://www.subtask.co/uploads/subtask-effort-value-matrix-in-progress.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It’s ok that estimates are rarely precise.  It’s impossible to know whether a new feature will bring in revenue until customers can actually use it; and it’s impossible to know exactly how long it will take to build that feature until your engineers have dug into the code. But by bringing a number of perspectives together for this exercise, your team can greatly reduce the risk that they’re off target on one particular estimate, or over-indexing on a particular piece of the puzzle.   This helps to ensure that the effort and value measures you’ve assigned are in the right ballpark relative to each other.</p>

</section>
<section data-level="2" id="-recheck-your-assumptions"><h2>3. Recheck your assumptions</h2>
<p>Once you’ve placed each item in the matrix, take stock of how it all looks.  Do all the estimates for effort and value feel honest?  Often we end up with a matrix where it seems like everything was placed in the easy and valuable quadrant (we all like to be hopeful when we’re estimating).  </p>
<p>By doing this exercise in an effort/value matrix, you’re able to easily see this and guard against it.  If you only went through a list of tasks one by one to assigned estimates, and never related them spatially on the effort-value matrix, you’d probably never be aware of the bias your team brings to your planning.  </p>
<p>It’s important as a team to recheck and question assumptions.  Some of those assumptions might be backed by data that’s readily available, other assumptions might be based on experience, and others might just be guesswork.  With the effort/value grid in front of you, these important discussions will happen much more readily.  Is Feature A really less effort than Feature B?  Is Feature C really demanded by users as much as we think?  Is there a lot of uncertainty about how to build Feature D?</p>

</section>
<section data-level="2" id="-decide-what-to-focus-on-"><h2>4. Decide what to focus on.</h2>
<p>Once your team has reached a rough consensus on where each item belongs in the effort/value grid, you’ll want to turn that into a plan of action.  </p>
<p>Effort/value scores are just one signal you use to decide what to work on.  The team’s project leader may decide that it’s beneficial to do a batch of low-effort high-value work, while also exploring one or two high-effort/high-value ideas.  Some teams may choose to make this more of a group decision, and do an exercise like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-voting">dot-voting</a> to see where most of the team believes their effort should go.  In other cases, there might be dependencies to suss out that will determine which pieces of work need to come first.</p>
<p>Using your effort/value scores for guidance, you can begin to schedule and allocate the work to be done.  If your team uses an Agile Scrum approach, that might mean flagging a batch of work for a sprint, which the team will commit to.  As you complete this work, the team can return to the effort/value matrix and reassess whether the remaining work is still positioned appropriately, and decide what to allocate next.</p>
<p>Defining when a project or feature is “done” can often be a challenge.  Some teams and leaders may feel obligated to complete every requirement in the list, and sometimes it seems like there’s always more work to do.  When you have your work laid out in an effort/value grid it’s easier to draw a line where the costs outweigh the benefits.  Helping your team work more efficiently is as much about deciding what the team should not work on as it is about deciding what they should work on. </p>

</section>
<section data-level="2" id="how-subtask-makes-it-easy-to-deploy-an-effort-value-approach-to-your-workflow-management"><h2>How Subtask makes it easy to deploy an Effort/Value approach to your workflow management</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.subtask.co/uploads/subtask-effort-value-matrix-start.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Using Subtask’s effort/value matrix, you’ll have these valuable signals at your fingertips so you can decide on the right work and achieve your goals faster, with less wasted time and effort.</p>
<p>In Subtask you can collaborate with your team in real-time, or asynchronously on their own time.  This means everyone can quickly and easily get into a board and start adding cards for their ideas.  You can either do this together in one room, with everyone looking at one screen, or remotely with everyone signed into the same Subtask board.  In both cases you’ll see everything that’s added as it happens.</p>
<p>You can configure your priority matrix to have the labels and colors that fit your current needs.  For example, you can change your axes and quadrants to urgent vs important, and change the color of each quadrant to highlight what to focus on or avoid.</p>
<p>After you’ve placed your ideas in the effort/value matrix, you can go back to the main list view and sort each column by effort and value so everyone can easily see what to do first.  This will place low-effort/high-value items at the top of your list, and high-effort/low-value items at the bottom (with high-value/high-effort, and low-value/low-effort mixed in between)</p>

<![CDATA[On Zoom, Y Combinator’s foreign startups have a leg up]]>

September 1, 2020 | https://restofworld.org/2020/ycombinator-zoom-foreign-startups/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://restofworld.org/2020/ycombinator-zoom-foreign-startups/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>Minutes before Nitthin Chandran was set to present his startup to a powerful group of foreign investors, the power went out in his apartment in Bangalore. The timing couldn’t have been worse: power outages are par for the course in the city, where Chandran was presenting remotely via Zoom, but there was life-changing money on the line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chandran, the founder of <a href="https://www.medpiper.com/">MedPiper Technologies</a>, was pitching his Indian hospital-staffing startup for this year’s Demo Day. The two-day event is the culmination of Silicon Valley’s most well-known startup accelerator program, Y Combinator; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/these-are-the-top-y-combinator-companies-of-all-time-based-on-valuation/">notable program graduates</a> include Airbnb, Stripe, and DoorDash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The stakes were high, so Chandran came prepared: his Y Combinator–appointed mentor had advised him to upgrade his internet speed and<strong> </strong>make ready multiple backup options for situations just like this one. Saved by a spare dongle he’d bought on sale at his local market, Chandran delivered his one-minute pitch to an unseen audience of high-powered investors and thousands of viewers, all from his apartment in Bangalore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In spite of the blackout, Chandran kept his cool: “We practiced maybe 100 times before Demo Day.”</p>



<p>For the first time in its 15-year history, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/y-combinator-officially-shifts-its-next-accelerator-class-to-fully-remote-format/">Y Combinator went fully remote</a> with its famed startup accelerator program. With the coronavirus pandemic making travel and in-person meetings nearly impossible, everything from workshops to the all-important Demo Day went online. The remote experience may have flattened the in-person interactions that drive some of the tech industry’s biggest deals. But founders from non-Western markets say that attending Y Combinator remotely didn’t hinder their success — in fact, it helped. Internet connectivity issues aside, foreign founders say the first fully remote Y Combinator has put these companies on a more equal footing with their American counterparts.</p>

<p>In pre-pandemic times, founders accepted to Y Combinator were flown to San Francisco, where they spent three months developing their startups <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2019/02/12/y-combinator-demo-days-2019-san-francisco.html">before presenting to funders at Demo Day</a>. For non-American founders with operations outside the United States, this often meant spending a full financial quarter away from their teams and home markets to attend workshops and networking events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You talk to other international founders, and they’re like, Oh yeah, I spent most of YC on a plane,” said Iain Usiri, a Tanzanian founder whose startup <a href="https://www.ramani.io/">Ramani</a> presented at last week’s Demo Day. By going remote, “The biggest logistical problem is solved,” he said. “You’re on par with a U.S. founder who is in his home market.”</p>



<p>Under normal circumstances, Usiri might’ve fretted over his outfit choice or physical gestures on Demo Day. “Personally, I do well on a stage,” he said. But this time, he and other founders in his class invested in backup internet, high-quality microphones, and new lighting, to ensure their Zoom presentations go as smoothly as possible. A remote presentation has its own anxieties: Usiri said he was so paranoid about power outages in his home in Tanzania, he had nightmares about it leading up to Demo Day. Nicolás López, co-founder of Justo, <a href="https://www.getjusto.com/">a Chilean food-delivery startup</a>, said he worried about competing with social media notifications and emails that might be popping up on investors’ screens during their demo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But logging onto Y Combinator from the comfort of their home markets meant founders could maintain their startups while benefiting from Y Combinator’s coveted mentorships. “Between when we applied for Y Combinator in March and today, we grew our team from 10 to 95,” said López. “I don’t think we would have been able to do that if we had been in Palo Alto for the past three months.”</p>



<p>In Bangalore, MedPiper’s Chandran, who is building a database of verified doctors and nurses in India, was able to take in-person meetings during the period. He said he signed up to 40,000 medical professionals during his time with Y Combinator. “We don’t think we would have done even 60 to 70% of the sales which we were able to close [had we been away],” Chandran told <em>Rest of World.</em> “All these sales were done in person, walking into hospitals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paradoxically, the remote nature of this year’s Y Combinator meant more face time between founders and partners. “I was asking for office hours all the time, sometimes three meetings a week with partners,” Arthur Alvarenga, founder of Brazilian startup <a href="https://chatpay.com.br/">ChatPay</a> said. “Everyone was very available, and with Zoom, things moved faster. You could get on a call faster than going to campus to meet with them if we were in person.”</p>

<p>Crucially, the pandemic has forced investors to consider any and all investments remotely; it’s leveled the playing field. Alvarenga, based in Brazil, might’ve missed out on chances for in-person meetings. But on Zoom, he’s just as remote as a founder in Boston. Both current and former non-Western Y Combinator participants said that funders are now more willing to take meetings and close deals over Zoom, where they once might have required an in-person meeting. Foreign founders in this batch of Demo Day presenters said they walked away from the event with more than 100 interested investors — far more than they could muster in their local markets.</p>



<p>Thomas Hellman, professor of entrepreneurship and innovation at Oxford’s Saïd Business School, said that the remote nature of today’s business environment has changed investor behavior, perhaps to the benefit of non-American founders.<strong> </strong>“Investors who said they would never invest unless they met a person have now written checks to entrepreneurs without meeting them,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But a willingness to close deals over Zoom hasn’t changed some of the inherent challenges in raising money as a foreign startup. U.S.-based companies still constitute the majority of the Y Combinator batch: 39 of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/here-are-the-98-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2020-demo-day-1/">197 startups participated</a> from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Hellman said that, in lieu of organic meetings and face-to-face interactions, venture capital firms are likely to rely on their own referral networks, which he said are essentially frozen during the pandemic. “The biggest thing to look out for is how networks are going to retrench,” he said. “That could lead to more privileged entrepreneurs having access to capital.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite a more remote-friendly environment, Hellmann said foreign startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/22/foreign-startup-founders-face-unique-struggles-to-break-funding-barrier/">still face higher barriers to raising funds</a>. Local companies may still have an advantage, even if it’s a smaller one. “Just because Zoom is making this more democratized, it doesn’t change the fact that some investors are just not going to understand your market or want to invest outside the United States,” said Alvarenga. “And that’s a root problem.”</p>



<p>But for the half a dozen founders from this summer’s batch of presenters who spoke with <em>Rest of World, </em>internet outages and Zoom presentations were minor inconveniences compared to their otherwise positive Y Combinator experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The real value of YC is the network,” said Alvarenga. “The more quality people you put in, the better the network becomes.”</p>

<p><em>If you want to get a competitive edge, building a culture of experimentation is critical. It can result in cost savings, higher revenue, and improved user experience.&nbsp;</em></p>


<p>People have been building scientific and technological innovations through testing and experimentation for centuries.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Eratosthenes measured the circumference of Earth 2,000 years ago.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Newton's prism experiment proved color is an inherent property of light itself.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Marie Curie, using an instrument called electrometer, found that radioactivity is an inherent property of individual atoms that emanates from their internal structure.</p>


<p>These experiments have paved the way for modern medicine, geography, energy, communication, physics, etc.&nbsp;</p>


<p>In today's technological world, experimentation holds the same power when it comes to innovation.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Some of the biggest companies, like Amazon, Netflix, and Google, use this scientific method to challenge the status quo. In return, they innovate, grow, and improve.</p>


<p>Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, has said: “Our success at Amazon is a function of how many experiments we do per year, per month, per week, per day.”</p>


<p>Mark Zuckerberg has reported that the company conducts thousands of experiments at any given time.</p>


<p>As far back as 2008, Google was already leveraging its search engine users to simultaneously conduct 50–200 experiments.</p>


<p>The end goal of this "test everything" mentality? To roll out new products, get past the competition, improve customer experience, and try new business models.&nbsp;</p>





<h2 id="why-an-experimentation-culture-is-valuable">Why an Experimentation Culture is Valuable</h2>


<p>Only a decade ago, Yahoo was on a par with Google. The two tech giants were competing fiercely to conquer the territory of the World Wide Web. But Google's ferocious experimentation led the company on a path of continuous improvement. Today, Google has a market share of 92.17%, Bing has 2.78%, and Yahoo has 1.6%.</p>


<p>But not all experiments yield successful innovations.&nbsp;</p>


<p>At Google and Bing, about <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/09/the-surprising-power-of-online-experiments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10% to 20% of controlled experiments</a> have positive results. One-third of experiments at Microsoft prove effective, one-third have neutral results, and one-third have negative results.</p>


<p>But that capability to test out everything to see what works and what doesn't has given these companies a competitive edge.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Experimentation has helped Bing make dozens of monthly improvements, which collectively have boosted revenue per search by 10% to 25% a year.&nbsp;</p>


<p>When Facebook tested a secondary "Explore" Feed to its primary News Feed in six countries that let users discover content that they haven't explored yet, it resulted in a 60-80% engagement rate.</p>


<p>To sum up: although experimentation may scare you with its tiny success rate, the benefits can help a company iterate quickly, fail fast, and pivot.&nbsp;</p>


<h2 id="how-to-build-an-experimentation-culture">How to Build an Experimentation Culture</h2>


<p>Successful innovation requires building a culture of experimentation at a company-level. A culture of experimentation involves nurturing employees' curiosity, listening to data, allowing everyone to conduct or commission a test, and managers accepting a new model of leadership.&nbsp;</p>


<h3 id="a-culture-of-experimentation-starts-with-accepting-failure">A Culture of Experimentation Starts With Accepting Failure</h3>


<p>"Failure and invention are inseparable twins." It's what Jeff Bezos says. And he's a smart man.</p>


<p>Building a culture of experimentation starts with the engineering manager accepting that failure will happen, but that shouldn't be an obstacle to continue experimenting.</p>


<p>Instead, failure should be viewed as an inherent and integral part of the learning process.&nbsp;</p>


<p>When leaders accept it as such, it will send a message to the entire company that failure isn't something to be dreaded or scared of. It means the company is learning, growing, and with each experiment, it's closer to achieving its goals.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Everyone involved will feel more comfortable giving feedback, sharing ideas, and brainstorming. Creative minds at the company will be unleashed to try big, new, unproven ideas, and at the same time, business executives will get guaranteed results fast.</p>


<h3 id="small-changes-can-generate-huge-benefits">Small Changes Can Generate Huge Benefits</h3>


<p>We'll use one of Microsoft's real-life stories as an example.&nbsp;</p>


<p>In 2008, an employee suggested having a new tab automatically open when a user clicks on the Hotmail link, instead of opening in the same tab.&nbsp;</p>


<p>A seemingly small change, but when it was tested on 900,000 users in the UK, the engagement of users who opened Hotmail increased by a whopping 8.9%. In 2010, the company introduced the change to 2.7 million users in the US, and it yielded the same results.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Amazon did a similar thing when it moved its credit card offers from the home page to the shopping cart page. The result? Profits increased by tens of millions of dollars annually.&nbsp;</p>


<p>The lesson in these stories is that there's value in introducing a small change quickly, to a small set of users, in order for your engineers to learn whether you're building the right thing.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Starting small is a better option than polishing a large feature, introducing it to a large user base, only to hear a few weeks or months later that the business goals have not been achieved or that the key metric hasn't changed.&nbsp;</p>


<h3 id="more-experiments-are-better-than-few">More Experiments Are Better Than Few</h3>


<p>Many companies today run tens of thousands of online experiments every year. Out of those tens of thousands of experiments, only a few will be successful.</p>


<p>Although it sounds expensive, it's actually riskier to run only a few experiments per year than a thousand.&nbsp;</p>


<p>When you conduct a large number of experiments, a few will be successful. The success of those few experiments will make the financial costs of a string of failed experiments irrelevant.&nbsp;</p>


<p>On the other hand, if you run only a few experiments annually and none of them prove successful, you'll be left dealing with a substantial financial loss.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Failing is useful because it allows <a href="https://adevait.com/software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">software developers</a> to eliminate unfavorable ideas and focus their attention on more-promising solutions.</p>


<div><figure><img src="https://content.adevait.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Experiments-1024x517.png" alt="culture of experimentation"></figure></div>


<h3 id="rely-on-data-not-on-strong-opinions">Rely on Data, Not on Strong Opinions</h3>


<p>Every company has people working there, and people have strong opinions. When results from an experiment clash with strong opinions by a team or employee, make sure the empirical results of your online experiments prevail.&nbsp;</p>


<p>The tale of Ron Johnson when he became the CEO of JC Penney is another great story that carries a lesson.</p>


<p>When Johnson joined the company in 2011, he had a bold new plan in mind: he would use technology to eliminate the need for cashiers, get rid of coupons and clearance racks, and fill the stores with branded pieces.</p>


<p>Almost 17 months later, sales had decreased, significant losses were experienced, and ultimately, Johnson had lost his job.&nbsp;</p>


<p>What happened?</p>


<p>Unfortunately, many managers in the business realm lack sufficient data or relevant experience to lead their business decisions. Many managers also rely more on their intuition than on numbers.</p>


<p>If the experiment tells you that you should remove the green button, you remove the green button.&nbsp;</p>


<p>This doesn't mean that managers shouldn't be listened to on all occasions. When it comes to making strategic decisions that can't be tested, managers' input holds value.</p>


<p>But all things that can be tested in a company should be tested. Experiments can guide managers' decisions and fuel healthy debates. Even if those debates end up in overruling the data, at least the company is conscious of the experiments' results and is making a move that's in the company's best interest.&nbsp;</p>


<div><figure><img src="https://content.adevait.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/A-B-testing-1024x676.png" alt="A/B testing culture of experimentation"></figure></div>


<h3 id="keep-the-feedback-coming">Keep the Feedback Coming</h3>


<p><a href="https://adevait.com/software/feedback-for-software-developers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Giving feedback to your software developers</a> can inspire them to do future tasks even better and with higher motivation. It can engage an underperforming individual to improve his/her performance to a higher level.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Feedback is also the only way to ensure an employee doesn't continue making the same mistakes.</p>


<p>The majority of employees are interested in hearing feedback from their managers; however, what they crave for is specific feedback.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Specific feedback is telling your engineer what they're doing right and where there's room for improvement.&nbsp;</p>


<p>For example, instead of saying to your <a href="https://adevait.com/javascript-developers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JavaScript developer</a>, "You could be more proactive," say, "You said you would come up with some ideas for overcoming the issue with <a href="https://adevait.com/software/technical-debt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technical debt</a>, but I still haven’t received anything. Is there some problem?"</p>


<p>One great way of giving feedback is the SBI (Situational, Behavior, Impact) Framework.</p>


<p>The SBI framework outlines a simple structure that you can use to give feedback:</p>


<ol><li><strong>Situation</strong>: define the where and the when of the situation you're referring to.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Behavior</strong>: describe the specific behavior of the employee in the situation you're referring to.</li><li><strong>Impact</strong>: say how the person's behavior has impacted you or others.</li></ol>


<p>In the long run, this can lead to higher performance, unlike less specific feedback that just informs employees of whether they are performing well.</p>


<h3 id="finally-celebrate-your-wins-and-learn-from-your-failures">Finally, Celebrate Your Wins and Learn From Your Failures</h3>


<p>When an experiment yields a successful innovation, celebrate! Celebrating your successes and giving credit where it is due will motivate others to become a part of the culture of experimentation at your company.&nbsp;</p>


<p>And when you fail, learn from it! Even if it's a failed experiment, failures can steer you in the right direction when you lack answers or people have conflicting opinions about an idea.</p>

<p><b>Welcome to Miniscope.org Wiki! Follow the project on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/MiniscopeTeam">@MiniscopeTeam</a>.</b>
</p><p>We are happy to announce the release of our next generation, open-source Miniscope platform, <a href="http://miniscope.org/index.php/Miniscope_V4" title="Miniscope V4">Miniscope V4</a>. This new system is a substantial leap forward over previous designs and will serve as the base Miniscope platform for years to come. An overview of new features can be found below:
</p>
<ul><li> &gt;1mm diameter field of view</li>
<li> ~1mm working distance</li>
<li> +/-200um electronic focal adjustment</li>
<li> All achromatic optics</li>
<li> 2.6 grams</li>
<li> 22mm tall</li>
<li> Absolute head orientation sensor</li>
<li> Requires ~1/5th the excitation power of previous systems</li>
<li> No more soldering!</li>
<li> Still uses only a single coaxial cable (down to 0.3mm in diameter) for power, communication, and data.</li>
<li> New DAQ software</li></ul>
<p>This wiki site provides a centralized location for sharing design files, source code, and other relevant information so that a community of users can share ideas and developments related to this important imaging technique. Our goal is to help disseminate this technology to the larger neuroscience community and build a foundation of users that will continue advancing this technology and contribute back to the project. While the Miniscope system described here is not an off-the-shelf commercial solution, we have focused on making it as easy as possible for the average neuroscience lab to build and modify, requiring no soldering and simple hands-on assembly. The Miniscope project and Miniscope.org are on going projects and will be routinely updated over the coming months and years.
</p>


<h2><span id="Current_Status_of_Project">Current Status of Project</span></h2>
<p>The Miniscope project is now in its 6th year of development at UCLA and in its third major revision. Miniscope developers have used Miniscopes to understand  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v534/n7605/full/nature17955.html">how the brain links memories across time in Nature, 2016</a> and how <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0559-0">spatial coding breaks down in epilepsy in Nature Neuroscience, 2019</a>. The work and files available on this site are the most up-to-date public version of our system and will be updated frequently with improvements and new system features. We encourage Miniscope users to contribute to this development process! This wiki is designed for this very purpose.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Within the last decades web technologies have evolved in a very rapid way. Nowadays, with things like WebAssembly, PWA, constantly progressing browser API and other surrounding technologies, web has a great potential to become a universal platform for a wide range of tasks and applications.</p><p>With web app’s area of responsibility expanding, more attention is paid to app performance. User experience became an important thing to care about, especially when you develop an app that runs on multiple devices.</p><p>To be able to manage performance appropriately, one need to know how the rendering pipeline of the browser works and where potential bottlenecks can be found.</p><h2 id="page-rendering">Page Rendering</h2><p>Web page load simply starts from entering the URL in the address bar. In fact, a bunch of things happen right after that and even before HTML request is done. Some of them can influence the performance, but we’ll leave this part for another dedicated article. Now we are interested in things happening when the HTML file has been loaded:</p><ol><li><strong>Parse HTML</strong>
HTML document parsed and the DOM tree as we know it has been built.</li><li><strong>Recalculate Styles</strong>
All kind of stylesheets are parsed. <em>Render tree</em> is built. <em>Render tree</em> contains DOM tree nodes that are going to be displayed. Thus, <code>head</code> tag is excluded as well as <code>style</code> and <code>script</code>. Elements with CSS <code>display</code> property set to <code>none</code> are also ignored. On the other hand, pseudo elements, such as <code>:after</code> and <code>:before</code>, are included. Moreover, every text line becomes a single block.</li><li><strong>Layout</strong> (also called <em>reflow</em>)
A collection of blocks generated from the render tree. All the block dimensions, that are dependent on each other, are calculated.</li><li><strong>Paint</strong>
Rasterization of the blocks and texts. Images decoding and resize if necessary also happen here.</li><li><strong>Layer Composition</strong>
Composition of the visual layers that can be processed and painted independently.</li></ol><p>All the phases can be found in the Chrome DevTools’ Performance tab. In reality some of the steps above happen in parallel, e.g. CSS and HTML parsing since HTML document contains styles and stylesheet links in it, so it makes sense to perform DOM and CSSOM processing in parallel. </p><p>Any time you want to change a view on the page using javascript (or CSS animation) this pipeline gets fired. Although it is not necessary to parse HTML file and rebuild the whole render tree (usually only part of it), a proper processing for the visual update is required. Depending on requested changes, browser skips some of the steps, but in general, the pipeline would look like this:</p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/dc48e4bd5b41dac0b0e8cb64a8e603c9/6dbf2/frame.jpg" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/dc48e4bd5b41dac0b0e8cb64a8e603c9/6dbf2/frame.jpg 1093w" sizes="(max-width: 1093px) 100vw, 1093px" alt="Image of Frame Pipeline"></p><h2 id="problem">Problem</h2><p>You might not need to know all of this when you’re just adding a couple of paragraphs, or modifying background color once every blue moon. Everything changes when it comes to a complex animation and continuous DOM updates. Normally contemporary screens have frequency 60Hz, which means that new frame ought to be rendered 60 times per second (60 FPS). Therefore, browser have <code>1000/60 ≈ 16ms</code> for doing his job on every frame. If it takes more time, the FPS decreases, animation might become jerky and user gets disappointed.</p><p>In the old browsers animation was usually implemented with <code>setTimeout</code> (or <code>setInterval</code>) function, which wasn’t initially designed for this purpose. <code>setTimeout</code> (or <code>setInterval</code>) function knows nothing about the browser reflow, thus visual changes might be requested at the middle of the pipeline, cancelling the last steps of the work on a previous frame and causing recalculations. Therefore we have missing frames and possible worthless work done, which might be critical in the scale of 16 ms and leads to janky animations.</p><h2 id="solution">Solution</h2><p>Fortunately, modern browsers have a proper method to deal with it. <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> is the browser API that provides a sufficient way to perform animations. The call for this function (with a callback as a first argument) asks the browser to call it right before the next styles calculation, so it won’t get interrupted in the middle of the next frame processing. </p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span><span>function</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>    </span><span>changeTheDOM</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span></p></pre></div><p>There is a common way to implement continuous javascript animation:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>let</span><span> prevAnimationTime</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>handleFrame</span><span>(</span><span>currentAnimationTime</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>!</span><span>prevAnimationTime</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>    prevAnimationTime </span><span>=</span><span> currentAnimationTime</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>    </span><span>const</span><span> diffTime </span><span>=</span><span> currentAnimationTime </span><span>-</span><span> prevAnimationTime</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>    </span><span>changeDOM</span><span>(</span><span>diffTime</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>    </span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span><span>handleFrame</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span><span>handleFrame</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>The first argument that is passed to the callback is the time in milliseconds passed from the navigation start (from the <a href="https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp#The_time_origin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">time origin</a>). We can use it to know the time difference with the last frame and adapt our animation properly.

There is a set of methods and attributes that require browser to know a layout state, e.g. <code>offsetWidth</code>, <code>getComputedStyle()</code> and others. In other words, if you do changes to the layout and then request such a property a few lines after, browser will have to recalculate all the size relations and perform layout step twice.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><code>requestAnimationFrame</code> (rAF) is a browser API that allows the execution of code before the next available frame on the device display.</p><pre><pre><p><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>timestamp</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p>All modern JavaScript animation libraries, like <a href="https://framer.com/motion">Framer Motion</a>, use this API to increment the visual properties of DOM elements, 3D models, or canvas contexts to create motion on the web.</p><p>However, it isn't a guarentee that this method <em>will</em> run before every frame. A browser might choose to run <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> at lower intervals, and this leads to jerky animations.</p><p>Look at these two boxes:</p><p>If your browser <em>doesn't</em> fall into one of the situations we'll explore in this post, the top box will be animating smoothly at 60fps. The second box is artificially running at half the framerate of the top box. You can see how apparent the effect of halving the framerate is for the smoothness of animations.</p><p>Because the situations in which a browser might choose to throttle <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> aren't always obvious or consistent, debugging these animations can be a mind-bending experience.</p><p>If you're on this page, you might well have arrived via Google, trying to understand why your JavaScript animation is janky. I imagine you sat there, as I once was, with two identical iPhones side by side, running the same JavaScript animation, one at the expected 60fps and one at a jerky 30fps.</p><p>You're not going crazy. Your browser is. Let's take a look at when and why browsers throttle <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>.</p><h2 id="ios-throttles raf in low-power mode">iOS throttles rAF in low-power mode</h2><p>Discovering this was a real test of sanity. Debugging animations on an old website, I noticed all the animations were janky on my phone.</p><p>Suspecting garbage collection or other source of low-performing animations, I tried to debug on my MacBook. Nothing unusual about memory consumption. I set CPU throttling to maxium. Still 60fps.</p><p>I put my phone next to my partner's, same OS, same make and model. 60fps on hers, unmistakably 30 on mine.</p><p>I started to suspect the paint job. But then I spotted this on my screen:</p><img src="https://mattperry.is/photos/code/low-power-mode.png"><p>Toggling low-power mode on and off had an immediate effect on the smoothness of the animations. I found <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=168837">a Webkit issue</a> that confirmed iOS throttles <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> in low-power mode, along with <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169138">all CSS animations</a>.</p><p>It's a clever battery-saving trick, and one of an infinite array of examples why developing against mobile browsers is such a dreadful, soul-crushing experience.</p><p>iOS app developers are <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/EnergyGuide-iOS/LowPowerMode.html">given the ability and responsibility</a> to respond to low-power mode. Yet Webkit's characteristic obstinence is the reason why Battery Status API is now <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Battery_Status_API">deprecated</a>.</p><h2 id="safari-throttles raf in cross-origin iframes">Safari throttles rAF in cross-origin iframes</h2><p>The example at the top of the frame is running in a cross-origin iframe. "Cross origin" essentially means that iframe is serving content from a different domain from that of this site.</p><p>If you're using Safari, you may have noticed that not even the first box was running very smoothly. Go back and click inside the iframe. The animation should start running as expected.</p><p>The <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170534">Webkit ticket</a> doesn't provide a reason for this behaviour. To speculate, iframes are commonly used for advertising. Adverts are liberal with your CPU cycles, often using quite overt attention-stealing animations.</p><p>So the throttling is an attempt to prevent adverts from draining your battery. The framerate is uncapped on interaction because that's considered a sign of intent that the content is acceptable by the user.</p><p>In an age of ad-blockers this solution feels like the wrong approach.

                        <p><strong>This summer, a team of researchers, engineers and a drone pilot of TU Delft travelled to an airbase in Germany for the first real test flight of the scaled flight model of the energy-efficient aircraft design called the Flying-V. The project was announced last year together with KLM. After a period of extensive wind tunnel testing and a series of ground tests in the Netherlands, it was time to perform the first flight and obtain an impression of the flight characteristics. The aircraft had a very successful maiden flight.</strong></p><p>Project leader Dr Roelof Vos and his team of researchers and engineers took the 22.5 kg and 3 m wide scale model of the Flying-V for flight tests to a well-guarded airbase in Germany, where they could work together with a team from Airbus. The pilot’s task was to take-off, fly a number of test manoeuvres and approaches until the batteries were nearly empty and land. And he succeeded. Vos: “One of our worries was that the aircraft might have some difficulty lifting-off, since previous calculations had shown that ‘rotation’ could be an issue. The team optimized the scaled flight model to prevent the issue but the proof of the pudding is in the eating. You need to fly to know for sure.” Rotation on take-off was performed easily and occurred at a speed of 80 km/h. The plane’s thrust was good and flight speeds and angles were as predicted.</p><p>But testing new technology is never straightforward. The team had a challenging week in which they had to change the centre of gravity of the aircraft and fix the antenna to improve telemetry. The flight has now also confirmed that the current design still shows too much ‘Dutch roll’, causing a slightly rough landing. A next step for the team is to use the data collected during the flight for an aerodynamic (software) model of the aircraft. This will make it possible to programme it in a flight simulator to be used in future research , while further improving the flight characteristics. The team will also prepare the scale model for future flight tests.&nbsp;</p><div id="c651315">

</div><div id="c650988"><p>The Flying-V is a design for a highly energy-efficient long-distance aeroplane. The aircraft’s design integrates the passenger cabin, the cargo hold and the fuel tanks in the wings, creating a spectacular V-shape. Computer calculations have predicted that the aircraft’s improved aerodynamic shape and reduced weight will reduce fuel consumption by 20% compared to today’s most advanced aircraft. KLM has been a partner in the project since 2019. Also due to their support, the project team has been able to build this scale model. It was first presented at the 100th anniversary of KLM in October 2019. Various business partners are now involved in the project, including Airbus. Airbus is also an explicit supporter for the first flight. The partners are working together on a research plan to fine-tune the concept. Next step: providing the Flying-V with sustainable propulsion, taking into account that the design seems highly suitable to carry liquid hydrogen instead of kerosene. </p></div><div id="c650998"><p><em>Webcast</em>: On 1 September Dr. Roelof Vos and Prof. Henri Werij showed and explained what happened during the test week.

<p><span>I</span>n February 2019, Amos Dov Silver, a slight man in his mid-30s who often wears his shoulder-length hair in a bun, received a Telegram message inviting him to a wedding in Ukraine. The sender had worked with Silver for more than two years and wanted him to stand in for his father at the altar. “As you know, I don’t have a family,” he wrote. Silver agreed, and the following month, he flew from Arizona to Kyiv. Less than 48 hours later, he awoke to find five Israeli police officers standing in his hotel room.</p>



<p>Silver, an American-Israeli from a Hasidic background, started using his Facebook page as a marketplace to connect marijuana dealers with buyers in 2015, after years of loudly advocating for the drug’s legalization in Israel. This was four years after the emergence of <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/04/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-drugs-murder">Silk Road</a>, which quickly became the gold standard for decentralized, anonymous marketplaces operating on the darknet. Founded by the American Ross Ulbricht (whose online <em>nom de guerre </em>was<em> </em>“Dread Pirate Roberts”), Silk Road was estimated to be worth over $1 billion within two years of its founding, selling everything from pot to AK-47s. As the website grew in notoriety, Ulbricht became a model for a new generation of digital drug kingpins — and, with his arrest in 2013, a harbinger of what might await successors like Silver.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Israel decriminalized recreational marijuana use in 2017, Silver and a team of coders and managers transferred their service to the Russian messaging platform Telegram. The app is popular with activists and journalists around the world because of its end-to-end encryption, which means that the cryptographic keys needed to decrypt a message are stored with only the sender and receiver. This makes it essentially impossible for anyone, even the app maker, to decode an intercepted message. Thanks to this built-in anonymity, buying drugs through Telegrass became as easy as ordering a pizza. Unlike traditional drug cartels, Telegrass leadership doesn’t profit from individual deals; instead, to advertise their wares, dealers pay 420 shekels ($122.25) for access to the platform. Unscrupulous sellers are kicked off and get their names posted on a “wall of shame.”</p>



<p>When Telegrass arrived in Ukraine in 2017, its operators found conditions perfectly suited to running a black-market business. A permissive legal landscape and weak rule of law — as well as the large number of visiting Israelis — made it a natural candidate for Telegrass’ expansion. Additionally, while most countries mandate some form of identity verification to purchase a SIM card and register a phone number, Ukraine — along with Israel and the United States — does not, making it impossible for law enforcement to trace Telegram accounts registered under a phone number.</p>



<p>Soon after Telegrass launched in Ukraine, thousands of competing channels emerged, with the most popular attracting tens of thousands of subscribers. The old style of drug dealing, based on face-to-face interactions between consumers and dealers, disappeared. Viacheslav Markov, dean of the Faculty of Cyber Police at the Kharkiv National University of Internal Affairs, has said that 90% of drug sales in Ukraine now occur via Telegram. Viacheslav Safonov, the deputy head of Ukraine’s Department for Combating Drug Crimes, concurs. In addition to being better for advertising, the new system is safer for dealers. When buyers knew who they had purchased drugs from, there was an inclination to “share” that information with law enforcement when pressed. Now, that’s no longer possible.</p>



<p>In prosecuting Silver, Israeli authorities claimed that “Telegrass changed the face of crime.” Less than two years after his arrest, it’s unclear whether Silver was personally responsible for transforming the drug market or if he was simply an early and influential adopter of technology that would become the status quo. Whichever is true, it’s clear that, in many parts of the world, the system that Telegrass perfected has become the dominant model for buying and selling illegal drugs.</p>

<p><strong>In Kyiv, graffiti</strong> advertising Telegram drug channels is visible on nearly every city block, with tags directing buyers to @go420, @Kushcrew, or @kyivweeds. David Plaster, who runs the Kyiv-based nonprofit Anomaly, said his organization painted over more than 15,000 tags over the last 18 months, half in the capital alone. But as soon as the graffiti is eliminated, more appears. And removing it has little impact on business. Marijuana, which is grown in outlying cities near Kyiv, accounts for an estimated 13 billion hryvnias ($500,000,000) in sales per month across Ukraine. The operations are decentralized, so employees often have no idea who they’re working with, or for. That means that even if low-level dealers get busted, suppliers and distributors remain hidden from law enforcement. “Even with a sting operation, faking a channel, you can only get the buyer; it doesn’t help with the supply chain,” Plaster explained. “You can’t crack that closed loop.”</p>

<p>Once a customer joins a drug channel on Telegram, a bot will typically respond with a menu of items available for purchase. On a typical day, offerings might include a popular strain called Gagarin, named for the Soviet cosmonaut, which is advertised as a hybrid with “aromas of mint and blueberry,” or a strain called White Russian, which is earthy and spicy with “cheese flavor.” When a customer makes a selection, an anonymous operator will send a link asking for payment via cryptocurrency or through an encrypted payment platform, which in Ukraine is usually EasyPay, a Belarusian e-payment platform that allows money transfers to be made via a phone number rather than a bank account. After the money is received, the seller will send an image that includes an address or GPS coordinates signaling where the drugs are hidden.</p>



<p>That day, March 12, law enforcement agents from Israel, the U.S., Ukraine, and Germany arrested 42 people in those countries in connection with Telegrass, the encrypted drug marketplace that Silver co-founded and ran. Directed by the Israel National Cyber Directorate, the bust marked the final stage of an international operation to take down the enterprise, which, by 2018, grossed an estimated $17 million a month in sales. Telegrass was one of the world’s biggest app-based drug markets, and, from Israel, it migrated to Germany, Ukraine, and other countries in Europe, spawning countless copycats.</p>



<p>The main downside of a fully anonymous marketplace is that it lends itself easily to fraud. Common scams include sellers accepting money before deleting a Telegram conversation or simply giving buyers phony drop-off locations. “[The channels are] often operated by men in prison who send these messages on their phones,” an anonymous buyer told <em>Rest of World</em>, adding that he would frequently have to try four or five different services before finding one that worked. Safonov, of the country’s anti-drug office, confirms that this kind of fraud makes up “one of the main types of ‘earnings’ for prisoners,” who will offer products at lower price points to target “novice consumers and those trying to save money.”</p>



<p>High levels of police mistrust have also contributed to theories that police are not only protecting the drug trade but actively participating in it. Telegram user @glodov, who advocates for marijuana legalization in Ukraine, claims that certain drug delivery channels are operated by police as avenues for extortion. He cited an instance in which a buyer went to pick up a package and encountered two officers waiting for him. “They tell you that you need to pay $100 or $200, and then they will leave you alone,” he says. “They want you to pay not to go to jail.”</p>



<p>(This kind of institutionalized corruption hearkens back to an earlier era: In the post-Soviet 1990s, the country saw a boom in criminal gangs, with police often functioning as their enforcers. While Ukrainian officials initiated a massive police overhaul in 2015 to address structural problems in the force, only 7.7% of officers lost their jobs. Most appealed their dismissals and <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/where-is-ukraines-new-police-force/">were eventually reinstated</a>.</p>



<p>Safonov also acknowledges that there has been illegal collaboration between authorities and dealers, even recently. In one <a href="https://hromadske.ua/posts/kolishni-policejski-organizuvali-narkolaboratoriyu-na-kiyivshini">notable instance earlier this year</a>, former police officers were found operating a methadone and amphetamine lab in an industrial building on the outskirts of Kyiv. But, he insists, this was an exception for an otherwise by-the-book force: “Bad grass grows in every garden.”</p>

<p><strong>Regardless of who</strong> is selling, Telegram is, by design, extremely difficult to police. “With an end-to-end encrypted app, users can reasonably expect that investigators won’t be able to access their chats,” said Riana Pfefferkorn, Associate Director of Surveillance and Cybersecurity at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. While not all Telegram data is end-to-end encrypted, the company stores data in multiple centers controlled by different jurisdictions, to ensure that no government can access its systems. According to Pfefferkorn, “Companies such as Telegram and Signal intentionally minimize the amount of user metadata they store, precisely so that there is less that can be handed over to law enforcement if investigators come knocking.” (According to Telegram, while it will not interfere with private chats, it will block public channels it deems illegal, such as those belonging to terrorists and narcotraffickers.)</p>



<p>Even on an individual level, built-in accountability features can be easily circumvented. For instance, while each Telegram account must be …</p></div></div>

The Danish military intelligence service (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_Defence_Intelligence_Service" target="_blank"><i>Forsvarets Efterretningstjeneste</i></a> or FE), which is also responsible for signals intelligence, has been accused of unlawful activities and deliberately misleading the intelligence oversight board. </p><p>

After the oversight board (<a href="https://www.tet.dk/om-tilsynet/?lang=en" target="_blank"><i>Tilsynet med Efterretningstjenesterne</i></a> or TET) received information from a whistleblower, the head of the FE, Lars Findsen, and three other senior officials of the intelligence service were suspended.</p><p>

Here, I will provide a translation of the <a href="#press"><b>press release</b></a> of the oversight board, as well as details from its <a href="#reports"><b>earlier reports</b></a>, showing that there were problems at the FE for years. An overview of the <a href="#cooperation"><b>international cooperation</b></a> between the FE and foreign partner agencies provides a context for what likely went wrong at the Danish service.</p><p><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MT_suhuKqVM/X0oAXcD0CnI/AAAAAAAAEuM/8_Rz2rYn7xMZZVLrSsktEVmwcYXpNVi1QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/fe-header.jpg" imageanchor="1" target="_blank"><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MT_suhuKqVM/X0oAXcD0CnI/AAAAAAAAEuM/8_Rz2rYn7xMZZVLrSsktEVmwcYXpNVi1QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/fe-header.jpg" width="550"></a><br>

The affair came to light when on August 24, the Danish Ministry of Defense issued a short <a href="https://fmn.dk/nyheder/Pages/Ledende-medarbejdere-i-Forsvarets-Efterretningstjeneste-fritaget-fra-tjeneste-indtil-videre.aspx" target="_blank">statement</a> saying that the head of the FE and two other officials were suspended  from duty until further notice. Svend Larsen, the chief of Central and West Zealand Police, was appointed as acting chief of the FE. Later, a third official was also suspended.</p><p>

The same day, the Danish Intelligence Oversight Board published a <a href="https://www.tet.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PRESSEMEDDELELSE.pdf" target="_blank">press release</a> with the unclassified results of its investigation into the issues that led to Findsen's suspension.

PRESS RELEASE<p>

<b>The Intelligence Oversight Board completed a special investigation into the
Defense Intelligence Service (FE) on the basis of material submitted by
one or more whistleblowers.</b></p><p>

<i>In November 2019, one or more whistleblowers provided the Intelligence Oversight Board with a significant amount of material relating to the FE,
which the Board has not hitherto been aware of or able to acquire.
The material is of such a nature that the Board decided to focus its oversight
of the FE in order to carry out an in-depth investigation of the
present situation. With this announcement, the Board publishes the
unclassified results of the investigation.</i></p><p>


On the basis of the Board's investigation of the submitted material, the Board sent
an analysis in four volumes to the Minister of Defense containing
the Board's conclusions and recommendations on 21 August 2020.</p><p>

Throughout the process of the special investigation of the FE, the Board has held the
Minister of Defense informed. The Minister of Defense has regularly expressed support for
the Board's in-depth examination of the material.</p><p>

The Board's assessments and recommendations deal with matters that are fully or partially within its legal supervision authority according to  the FE Act and the rules and conditions based on it, which the Minister, in the opinion of the Board, should have
knowledge of, cf. § 16, stk. 2. of the FE Act.</p><p>

Based on a source-critical examination of the submitted material, the Board assesses, among other things, the following:</p><blockquote>
- That since the establishment of the Board in 2014 and until the summer of 2020, the FE has, among other things, on several occasions during the Board's inspections and meetings with the head of the FE, withheld key and crucial information and provided the Board with incorrect information regarding the service's collection and disclosure of information.<p>

The Board is of the opinion that the statutory duty to provide information is absolutely necessary for functional oversight and that it is based on trust by the legislator that the FE complies with this obligation in all respects. The result of these repeated breaches of the statutory duty to provide information is that the legality check that the Board is required to carry out under the FE Act, and which contributes to the legitimacy of the FE's work, does not work out as intended.</p><p>

- That at central parts of the FE's collection capabilities there are risks that can lead to unlawful collection against Danish citizens.</p><p>

- That the submitted material indicates that the FE's management has failed to follow up on, or further investigate indications of espionage within the Ministry of Defense.</p><p>

- That there is a culture of insufficient legal awareness within the FE's management and parts of the service, which results in unlawful activities or inappropriate situations within the service to be shelved, including not informing the Oversight Board about matters relevant to its supervision.</p><p>

- That the submitted material indicates that the FE, prior to the establishment of the Board in 2014, initiated operational activities in violation of the Danish law, including obtaining and passing on a significant amount of information about Danish citizens.</p><p>

- That the FE has unlawfully processed information about an employee of the Oversight Board.</p></blockquote>
<br>
Against this background, the Board recommends that a political position be taken on the following:<br>
<blockquote>
- Whether there should be an investigation into whether the FE has carried out and is carrying out its task as a national security authority within ​​the Ministry of Defense in accordance with § 1, stk. 2 of the FE Act.<p>

- The need to uncover whether the FE has adequately informed policy makers about all relevant issues concerning key parts of the service's collection capabilities.</p></blockquote>
<br>
Given the options of the FE Control Act, the Board does not have the possibilities to further uncover specific matters that emerge from the submitted material. Therefore, the Board generally recommends the following:<br>
<blockquote>
- That an early evaluation of the FE Act will be carried out to determine whether the Board has the necessary legal authorities and resources to carry out an effective legal oversight of the FE, including whether the Board must have the authority to conduct interrogations of the FE's employees as witnesses.<p>

- That, based on of the circumstances of the Board's receipt of the submitted material, an external whistleblower scheme for the FE is established, which can best be placed under the auspices of the Board.</p><p>

Such a scheme should improve the ability of current and former FE employees to comment on controversial issues without fear of retaliation, including employment or criminal consequences. Furthermore, such a scheme would allow classified information to be passed on in a secure environment. The scheme must also ensure that an external whistleblower body has the necessary resources and instruments to protect the persons who submit information according to this scheme.</p></blockquote>
<br>
The Board had thorough considerations regarding the publication of the conclusions and recommendations of the investigation. It is crucial for the oversight that the public has as much insight as possible. However, in the view of the extremely sensitive circumstances surrounding the submission of the material to the Board and its classified content, the Board may not provide further information to the public.<p>

<i><b>Facts about the Intelligence Oversight Board</b></i></p><p>

The Intelligence Oversight Board is a special independent monitoring body that supervises that the PET processes information about natural and legal persons in accordance with the law, and that the FE processes information about natural and legal persons domiciled in Denmark in accordance with the law. The Board was established by the Act on the Police Intelligence Service (PET), which, like the Act on the Defense Intelligence Service (FE), entered into force on 1 January 2014.</p><p>

Following the entry into force on 1 July 2014 of the Center for Cyber ​​Security (CFCS) Act, the Board has also monitored that CFCS processes information about natural persons in accordance with the legislation.</p><p>

The Board consists of five members appointed by the Minister of Justice after consultation with the Minister of Defense. The chairman, who has to be a High Court judge, is appointed on the recommendation of the Presidents of the Danish Eastern and Western High Courts, while the other members are appointed after consultation with the Parliamentary Committee for the Intelligence Services.</p><p>

The members are:</p><p>

- Michael Kistrup, High Court Judge, High Court of Eastern Denmark (Chairman)<br>
- Erik Jacobsen, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Roskilde University<br>
- Pernille Christensen, Legal Chief, National Association of Local Authorities<br>
- Professor Henrik Udsen, University of Copenhagen<br>
- Professor Rebecca Adler-Nissen, University of Copenhagen</p><p>

The FE's unauthorized and illegal activities described in the press release of the Oversight Board may actually not have come as a complete surprise.</p><p>

 Already in several earlier reports, the Oversight Board noticed that the FE conducted quite a large number of unlawful "raw data searches", which is the term used for untargeted interception. This method enables the FE to "obtain very large amounts of information (several hundred million communications per year)" - according the <a href="https://www.tet.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FE_UK_19.pdf" target="_blank">Annual Report 2018</a>.</p><p>

In the English version of its <a href="https://www.tet.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/FE2018_uk_180219.pdf" target="_blank">Annual Report 2017</a>, in which the FE is mentioned as the Danish Defense Intelligence Service or DDIS, the oversight board says:</p><blockquote>
"the checks showed that in four instances DDIS engaged in unlawful targeted procurement
of information about persons resident in Denmark for a total of 20 days in 2014, eight months
in 2014-2015, four days in 2016 and 17 months in 2016-2017. The checks further showed that in
20 percent of the samples drawn DDIS made unlawful searches in raw data.<br>

in the nature of negligent actions in all cases. Similarly, the Oversight Board …</blockquote></div></div>

<p><em>[ NOTE: This post contains references to allegedly leaked information about upcoming versions of the game and, as such, should be viewed as a <strong>spoiler</strong> post. Be warned. ]</em></p>



<p>On June 5th, Hello Games updated the Steam (PC) Experimental Branch of <em>No Man’s Sky</em> with an update several gigabytes in size. (The Experimental Branch is a beta version of the game that Steam players can opt into in order to see the latest features and help Hello Games work out the kinks by providing feedback and bug reports.) The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/275850/discussions/0/2299597907723043384/">patch notes</a> for this release say only:</p>



<ul><li>Replaced networking back end.</li><li>Upgraded to OpenVR 1.10.30.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img src="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-08-at-5.43.13-PM.png" alt="" width="411" height="94" srcset="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-08-at-5.43.13-PM.png 1756w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-08-at-5.43.13-PM-300x70.png 300w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-08-at-5.43.13-PM-768x178.png 768w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-08-at-5.43.13-PM-604x140.png 604w" sizes="(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px"></figure></div>



<p>Upon receiving this update, Experimental Branch players began seeing  little platform icons attached to players wandering around in the Anomaly (a networked area of the game). Hello Games also released this beta version of the game (or a similar version) for the Xbox One via the Xbox Insider Hub, a Microsoft service that allows users to opt into betas, akin to Steam’s beta option. Players on both platforms running these betas are seeing each other, with appropriate platform icon, in the Anomaly at the same time. This, along with a host of platform icons discovered in the beta release by data miners, clearly speaks to some level of cross-platform gameplay on the way. </p>



<p>Now, since May 19th we’ve known that new content of some sort was on the way, <a href="https://twitter.com/gregbuchanan/status/1262736368616108035">thanks to a tweet</a> from author / scriptwriter Greg Buchanan who was behind the (great) Artemis storyline from 2017’s <em>Atlas Rises</em> update to <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. On May 29th, Hello Games posted the <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2020/05/beyond-development-update-11/"><em>Beyond</em> Development Update 11 page</a> on their website, detailing a number of new things going on in the game, including mention of a content-related hiatus to the weekend missions. </p>



<blockquote><p>Beginning this weekend, there will be a short pause between seasons of weekend missions. These will be returning very soon, featuring new story content we’re really enjoying from one of the writers on Atlas Rises.</p></blockquote>



<p>(There actually <em>was</em><a href="https://nmsspot.com/2020/06/11/community-event-31-the-event-that-wasnt-sort-of-it-was-pretty-though/"> a mission this past weekend</a>, but it appears that it may have been a test of the new networking back end / cross-play and only visible to those running beta versions on Steam and Xbox One.)</p>



<p>The following day, <a href="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Yl78hxy.png">an anonymous post appeared</a> on 4chan (let me pass the salt) entitled “No Man’s Sky summer update leaked details.” Within, the poster claims that according to his/her source, a content update is imminent and that it will tease out details of what is to come in a larger summer update. I am not going to print all of the details that were mentioned, here, but will say that what caught my <em>particular</em> interest is the suggestion that this coming update is “heavily focused on pro[c]gen” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation">procedural generation</a>), with the indication,</p>



<blockquote><p>…my source has told me that hello games have been working on ambitious things with their procgen and will improve terrain diversity and formations. new biomes will be introduced &amp; more “alien” planets.</p></blockquote>



<p>Additionally, data mining efforts of <a href="https://twitter.com/ProceduralTRV">Procedural Traveller</a> on the June 5th PC Experimental release <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8890itJ2-io">reveal several findings</a> that seem to backup the notion of new biomes on the way. (It is worth bearing in mind, however, that there are some items found in the data from even years past that have not come to fruition in the game.) Also, a number of mild visual / rendering changes have already been <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/275850/discussions/0/2299597907723043384/">observed by myself</a> and others in the PC Experimental version. </p>



<p>The reason that this struck a chord with me is the fact that just last month, the patent for the “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/news030331-3">Superformula</a>,” created by Belgian biologist Johan Gielis, expired. </p>



<div><figure><img src="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/https-blogs-images.forbes.com-jvchamary-files-2016-07-superformula-1200x256-1.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="80" srcset="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/https-blogs-images.forbes.com-jvchamary-files-2016-07-superformula-1200x256-1.jpg 960w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/https-blogs-images.forbes.com-jvchamary-files-2016-07-superformula-1200x256-1-300x64.jpg 300w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/https-blogs-images.forbes.com-jvchamary-files-2016-07-superformula-1200x256-1-768x164.jpg 768w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/https-blogs-images.forbes.com-jvchamary-files-2016-07-superformula-1200x256-1-604x129.jpg 604w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px"><figcaption>The Superformula (image: Johan Gielis / Botanical Society of America)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The Superformula is, as Gielis describes it, “A generic geometric transformation that unifies a wide range of natural and abstract shapes.” It is basically a modified take on an equation that describes a unit circle. The equation contains a number of variables and the geometric shape that it generates depends on the particular combination of values plugged into it. </p>



<p>Gielis was granted <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/EP1177529B1">European</a> (in 2005) and<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US7620527"> U.S.</a> (in 2009) patents on the Superformula, restricting its potential uses. Those that followed the development progress of <em>No Man’s Sky</em> leading up to its release may recall  Genicap, a Dutch company developing products and tech based on the Superformula, claiming that Hello Games was in violation of the patent with its procedural space exploration game. Forbes’ article, “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jvchamary/2016/07/27/no-mans-sky-superformula/#78844e122474">Did ‘No Man’s Sky’ Steal A Scientist’s Superformula?</a>,” dated July 27, 2016, details the claim and goes a long way towards explaining what the Superformula is. </p>

<p>The New Yorker article “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/world-without-end-raffi-khatchadourian">World Without End</a>” (May 11, 2015), takes an extraordinarily deep look at the genesis story and early development of <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. One of the many anecdotes within the piece describes Hello Games lead Sean Murray, early on, using the Superformula to experiment with the creation of infinite organic shapes floating over a desert. That Murray, at some point, played with the formula seems to be the “proof” Genicap held on to in order to make their patent violation claim. Murray consistently denied that the Superformula was used in the development of <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, and <strong>it seems the logical conclusion that Hello Games created their own procedural generation algorithms, perhaps <em>inspired</em> by Gielis’ formula, that were used in the game. </strong>(The Superformula, itself, being a modification of another existing formula.)</p>



<p>And the patents have just expired. </p>



<figure><a href="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/red_wave_nms.jpg"><img src="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/red_wave_nms_1424.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/red_wave_nms_1424.jpg 1424w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/red_wave_nms_1424-300x169.jpg 300w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/red_wave_nms_1424-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/red_wave_nms_1424-768x432.jpg 768w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/red_wave_nms_1424-480x270.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1424px) 100vw, 1424px"></a></figure>



<p>If the anonymous poster is correct and Hello Games is presently doing “ambitious things” with the game’s procedural generation (and “ambitious” is the only way you could describe the <em>current</em> game’s proc gen, so in context, that’s quite a statement), could they now be using the Superformula in conjunction with their own routines, or to extend their routines in certain ways? It’s hard to say. Perhaps HG’s routines are well beyond the Superformula, and it would be of little use to them at this point. That seems quite likely, in fact. But, one can only speculate. </p>



<div><figure><a href="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/yellow_wild_big-1.jpg"><img src="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/yellow_wild.jpg" alt="" width="391" height="220" srcset="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/yellow_wild.jpg 850w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/yellow_wild-300x169.jpg 300w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/yellow_wild-768x432.jpg 768w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/yellow_wild-480x270.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px"></a></figure></div>



<p>And, when it comes to <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, my <em>favorite</em> area of speculation is precisely that of the procedural generation system. I have made frequent mention of <a href="https://nmsspot.com/2019/03/21/a-few-words-from-a-no-mans-sky-time-traveler/">my desire</a> for <em>No Man’s Sky</em> to take back on a “wilder” aspect, the sort that characterized the early days of the game. (This is why <a href="https://nmsspot.com/2019/11/18/a-progress-update-from-a-no-mans-sky-time-traveler/">I am presently playing the 2016 <em>Foundation</em> 1.1 version</a> alongside the current <em>Beyond</em> release.) The best scenario I can picture would be a combination of the worlds we have had since the <em>NEXT</em> release, and a far wilder set of worlds harking back to the days of <em>Foundation</em>, <em>Path Finder</em>, and <em>Atlas Rises</em> — or, perhaps wilder still. </p>



<p>It is obviously the case that the “leaked” information, along with promises of what may actually grow out of the data mined details, need to be taken with a Faecium-sized chunk of salt. But…it seems there might <em>just</em> be a chance that I will get what I’ve been long hoping for. As always, time will tell.</p>

<p>My team has been spending less of our “free” time working on bugs and features from the backlog, and more time refactoring our codebases and test suites. As a result, and perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, we’ve noticed a significant increase in our throughput of features and bug fixes.</p>



<p>As it turns out, its easy to find bugs and add features to a well-written codebase that the entire team is familiar with. Go figure.</p>



<p>My team started a loose goal to spend 25% of our time refactoring, revisiting, and restyling existing code and tests. Let’s go over some of the benefits we’ve seen since making the change.</p>



<h2>Context and Caveats</h2>



<p>I’ve found that in articles like this it’s important to give as much context to the situation as possible, as certain development methodologies may work better or worse in teams with a different size, tech stack, or development process. Here are some notable things about our situation:</p>



<ul><li>3 engineers on my team, ~16 in the company</li><li>Tech stack – Go, Postgres, ElasticSearch and RabbitMQ</li><li>Microservices architecture on Kubernetes</li><li>Kanban-style development process – <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/05/18/leave-scrum-to-rugby-i-like-getting-stuff-done/">no scrum</a></li><li>Our team is responsible for ~14 repositories</li><li>Each repo represents a small service in a data pipeline process that handles sorting and NLP of social media posts</li></ul>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-1024x592.png" alt="Go Kubernetes" width="512" height="296" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-1024x592.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-300x173.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-768x444.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-150x87.png 150w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes.png 1245w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" title="go kubernetes"></figure></div>



<h2>Code Familiarity</h2>



<p>With only 3 engineers on the pipeline team and ~14 repositories (Mostly REST APIs and ETL processes), it was hard for all three of us to be super familiar with all the code. When we needed a new microservice, one team member typically wrote the first iteration, and one other team member did a quick code review. The engineer who did the first iteration would then be primarily responsible for bug fixes and new features relating to that project.</p>



<p>By focusing more of our time on reviewing and refactoring existing code, it gave us a chance to hop into projects that we never would have had a reason to become familiar with. Not only does getting more eyes on a project mean the overall code quality will likely go up, but it also means we aren’t hosed when the original maintainer has gone.</p>



<h2>Slow to Fix Bugs</h2>



<p>When you get deep into spaghetti code, it can be really hard to find bugs. Not only that but in a messy codebase, sometimes fixing a bug can actually <em>add</em> to the “uncleanliness” of the code. You may have to exacerbate or extend an already bad architectural pattern in order to get a bug fix in.</p>



<p>Ideally, you would do the refactoring first and then fix the bug (assuming the bug still exists after a good refactoring). Unfortunately, oftentimes there isn’t enough time to refactor a project before fixing a critical bug. For this reason, we should always be refactoring so that bug fixes can happen quickly and won’t make the code quality worse than it is.</p>



<h2>Slow to Add Features</h2>



<p>I don’t want to beat a dead horse, the reasoning here is largely the same as with bug fixes. Adding features to a messy codebase just makes it messier. It’s like frosting a cake that’s been thrown on the ground – it might taste marginally better but now it’s even harder to clean up.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="261" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/happy_birthday_to_ground.gif" alt="Happy Birthday to the Ground" title="happy birthday to ground"></figure></div>



<h2>Try It Yourself</h2>



<p>Since adding a consistent refactoring process to our team’s routine, we’ve been able to put <em>more</em> features through to production while spending <em>less</em> time working on them. Let me know what you think and if you have a difference experience.</p>

                <p><small>September 1st</small></p>
<p>I do a lot of work with web build systems and performance, but I got into
writing software because I like making products. With all the free time that the
pandemic has brought, I’ve been spending my off-hours teaching myself to write
Swift instead of screaming into the void. I missed writing product code and I
missed writing a compiled language with a nice IDE and a type system. I also
missed the speed and responsiveness that comes with native code that you only
get in the browser if you are extremely careful. So, I decided to try and build
an iOS app in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a>. This post is the first of a handful where I try to
digest what I’m working on. Think of this more as a journal than any sort of
tutorial.</p>
<h2>What are you making then?</h2>
<p>My goal is to make an app that will show me where I’ve been in New York on a
block-by-block basis. New York is big and I’ve only lived here for 5 years, so
an app that shows me where I’ve been might also show me what I’m missing.</p>

<p>From a technical perspective, I want to try and use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a> to build
my app and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata">Core Data</a> to persist its data. I also want to avoid 3rd
party libraries if possible. If, like me, you’re new to a lot of this, SwiftUI
is Apple’s new view framework, and Core Data is Apple’s built-in data
persistence layer. I won’t go into a ton of detail on these libraries in this
post, but a little context seems important. I figure these constraints will
force me to get experience with the core pieces of iOS development, which is
most of why I’m writing this app in the first place.</p>
<h2>Getting New York’s road data</h2>
<p>To start, I need to think about how I want this app to work. Ideally, I want to
break streets up into segments by block. I’m defining a block here as <strong>the
chunk of a street between any two adjacent intersections</strong>. For example,
Division Avenue between Berry Street and Bedford Avenue is a block, as is Berry
Street between Division Avenue and S 11th Street. To do this, I’ll need a way to
represent a road segment so that I can store metadata about it. I’ll also need
to know every possible road segment in New York so that I know what I have and
have not visited. Getting at this data turns out to be not so straightforward.</p>
<h3>Apple Maps</h3>
<p>I started by looking at what Apple would give me. When you want to render a map,
Apple provides you with a view. They also provide you with a way to search for
locations and a way to get directions between two locations.</p>
<p>However, there’s no way to get at any of the data directly. If I want the names
of roads nearby, or even the name of the road that’s closest to my location, I’m
out of luck. I needed to be able to get a catalog of road segments and identify
the closest one from wherever I am. This data takes a while to collect, and
anyone who’s collected enough of it isn’t willing to give it away, with the
except the beautiful people who maintain OpenStreetMap.</p>

<h3>OpenStreetMap</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> is like Wikipedia for street data. It seemed like a natural
place to look since its data is free to use and is constantly being updated. The
reality is that map data is really, really big, and getting at the data for just
New York City is gross. OpenStreetMap lets you <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=13/40.7192/-73.9564&amp;layers=C">export</a> regions of
map data, but exporting an area bigger than that a square mile or so ends up
being too big a request for them to process. My options were either to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download a lot of smaller regions and stitch them together.</li>
<li>Download <a href="https://planet.openstreetmap.org/">all of OpenStreetMap’s data</a> in one big ol’ file and
extract the data I needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seeing as I didn’t know much about how to use this data, neither option seemed
especially great. On the bright side, there are a few third parties that <a href="https://download.bbbike.org/osm/bbbike/NewYork/">will
extract data</a> from OpenStreetMap for popular regions like cities. I
ended up finding and downloading some of the data for New York City, which ended
up being extremely detailed. The data included road segments, neighborhood
names, building shapes, and everything else you might imagine needs to be
represented on a map. It was also about a gig and a half of JSON, and while this
level of detail is great, I only really needed data on roads.</p>
<h3>New York’s Centerline Data</h3>
<p>Around this time, I learned about New York City’s Open Data initiative. They
host a project called <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Street-Centerline-CSCL-/exjm-f27b">The NYC Street Centerline</a>, which holds data
about New York’s roadbeds. It’s a fantastic start, but it’s not as polished as
OpenStreetMap’s data. For example, take a look at this screenshot of NYC’s data
on top of Google Maps. The blue lines are roads rendered from Centerline data.
Note the discrepancies, especially around driveways, walking paths, and parking
lots.</p>

<p>It also appears to be missing a lot of data about roads through some parks and
cemeteries, which would be nice to know about. Here’s what Woodlawn Cemetery
looks like, for example:</p>

<p>I’m betting OpenStreetMap’s data is more accurate than NYC’s here, but NYC’s
data is a solid start. It’s exclusively road data, so the actual file size is
about ten times smaller than the OpenStreetMap data for New York. Plus, it comes
with a bunch of fun attributes, like how wide the road is, the street numbers on
each side, and even what priority the street gets when snow needs to be plowed.
I’m betting I’ll want to end up using OpenStreetMap at some point, but for now
this seems like a good way to get started.</p>
<h2>Making sense of a 134.5MB JSON file</h2>
<p>Centerline hosts their data in a bunch of different types of formats, but most
of them looked like they’d require extra parsing to make sense of, as though
they were all just created from dumps of a <a href="https://postgis.net/">geospatial database</a>. For
example, JSON-formatted data was a list of un-keyed data, with the road’s
coordinates encoded as a <a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/geodatabase/10.0/sdk/arcsde/concepts/geometry/shapes/types.htm">Multilinestring</a> that would need
to be parsed:</p>

<p>However, they did offer their data hosted as <a href="https://geojson.org/">geoJson</a>, which is a
specification for encoding geodata as json (surprise). It’s a bit more verbose,
so the filesize is a bit bigger, but filesize is a bit less of a concern when
your data is already a hundred megabytes. In geoJson, that same road segment
above instead looks like this (sorry in advance for all the scrolling you are
about to do):</p>

an understanding of its shape is a requirement if I wanted to parse it into any
sort of app, and to do that I needed to poke around. Opening the file in Xcode
caused it to crash pretty reliably. VSCode similarly hung for a while, and when
it finally responded a bunch of navigation features seemed to be disabled. To
help explore all of this data, I ended up using an app called
<a href="https://viewer.dadroit.com/">Dadroit</a>, a JSON viewer specifically made for viewing large files
quickly.</p>

<p>Using Dadroit gave me enough context on the shape of the data to be able to

got far enough into the data to be able to highlight a bunch of random roads
from it.</p>

					<div><p>Transcript:</p><p>Hello, and welcome to the software engineering unlocked podcast. I’m your host, Dr. McKayla. And today is a special episode. Yeah, the software engineering unlocked podcast turned one. And to celebrate the one year anniversary – and can you imagine it’s already one year – I thought I will tell you a little bit about myself.</p><p>I will very inline with the theme of the show, I will tell you a little bit about how I came into tech, a little bit about my experiences with different companies. And also I will tell you about my favorite topic code review. So yeah, let’s see how that goes. I’m a little bit nervous because it’s first not interview-style podcast episode. So it means that I don’t have another person interviewing me and asking me questions. So it will be all me talking. And I hope that this goes well, I don’t know. So yeah, about me. Well, where should I start? Maybe really from the beginning, like I do with my guests. So how did I actually come into tech?</p><p>You know, that’s&nbsp; quite a strange story, because I went to a high school, that was all about art. And while it’s way back then a computer were already a thing. I’m not that old, but, uh, at my school, we didn’t have laptops in our class. We didn’t write on a word for example, or some, um, word processor or something.</p><p>We rode really still with pencil on paper. And especially when I graduated the time were already advanced. So in other school, people were using computers and programs to type, and our school was an art school. And so we were not very progressed. Uh, our teachers also thought, you know, it’s, it’s not a good thing.</p><p>You know, writers write on paper. So even though when I graduated, I was still writing most of my stuff. Oh, really with pen and paper. And I had little to no exposure to computers. We had a computer at home, but because it’s, um, it was something expensive and it was something, you know, that also my parents were maybe a little bit afraid of, we were not allowed to just go and play with the computer or try things out.</p><p>So I really have to say my exposure to computers were really, it was really, really limited. Never ever would I have starting this year that I will study computer science, but I’m in the lab last year before graduating and before starting a university, I actually attended a few lectures at the university and I attended lectures in different areas.</p><p>So I was in one lecture about psychology. I was in an, um, lecture about physics and I was in the left. Sure. About algorithms. And somehow I was really hooked. I never, I actually thought I will study math. This is what I thought that I will go on. But then when, when I was in this lecture and this professor talked about distributed systems and threading problems, and he also were talking about cash machines.</p><p>And so I really could see the application of what very much looked like math to me and logic. But I could see really the impact that it has on the real world. Yeah. And so I think I was hooked. So I got a first book about it. And during the summer break, before starting university, I read this book, it was about really fundamentals.</p><p>What is an algorithm and what is computer science still? I didn’t touch any computers. Right. It was really theoretical knowledge about, you know, what computer science is all about. And there was really, really fascinating. I thought, this is what I want to do. And so when I made the decision and I said, I’m going to apply, my parents were not thrilled.</p><p>They were like, this is not for girls. And this is not for you. And you’re coming from an art background, which was very true. Right. I was mainly painting pictures. I drew, I had paintings and things like that, architecture, but, um, I was always good at math and. I decided, even though they weren’t happy and actually even said, they’re not going to really support me doing that.</p><p>I went ahead, add end. I’m enrolled. And the enrollment was actually online and yeah, mr. We failed to be honest. Yeah. I really failed to create an account. You know, dad. This was the current state that I was in. Right. So I got a little bit worried about, um, if I’m not even able to in role, because I had so little exposure to computers and internet and things like that.</p><p>We didn’t have internet at home. Um, How I’m gonna deal with that. But yeah, there was an it department, so they helped me actually enroll when I told them that I, they, I need some assistance with that and that I actually want to study computer science. They were also not super thrilled and I laughed a little bit about me, uh, but I managed to get the thing done with a little bit of help.</p><p>And, and then it was. It was really intense. I would say her first year, especially the first half year, really intense. Most of my, um, classmates, my colleagues at university had a lot of knowledge already became, um, most of them actually came from high schools that had like, uh, Focused on computers, even new houses program.</p><p>And for me, everything was new and I didn’t have really a computer and I didn’t have so much money. So I bought really a crappy computer and, um, it wasn’t good enough for, for example, the job compilers really run. So if I wanted to combine my hello world, the first program that I a road, it took several minutes, like 15 minutes.</p><p>It can you imagine? So. Um, I knew I had to do something else, so I try to collect a little bit more money and make more money. I worked on the side. And so, um, within the first two, three months I was able to buy a better computer. And, um, it wasn’t the best computer. Yeah. It was really nice. A nice laptop that, uh, got the job done.</p><p>Let’s put it that way. And also, I have to say that in my computer science education, especially at the beginning, we did again, a lot things on, um, Paper. I mean, we wrote Java programs on paper. Um, not always URI. I needed a computer and you were doing it at home, right? Well then transferring. Yeah. What you learned in class?</p><p>Um, To the computer. Uh, but yeah, so this is how I got started. And, um, I did the primer in programming that really helped a lot. It was very, very intense, but I, I studied a lot. Um, this is pure reality is that I really studied a lot and I really, you know, deep dive into that, I found it really also very, very fascinating.</p><p>So it wasn’t, wasn’t hard for me. And by the, by the end of the first year, I was one of the best in class. And, um, this was very encouraging as well. So I, I didn’t start really well. Uh, but yeah, based on learning a lot and really having an open mind and being so curious, I was able to, to level up. So is, it was really how I started.</p><p>Maybe I rambled a little bit too long, but hopefully found it interesting. And yeah, well I did then back then, actually, when I did my, my, my. Bachelor. There were no bachelor and masters in Austria. I did my, my, uh, university in Austria, but this was one five year program. And so in the middle of when I started, they actually changed the thing to master and bachelor, but because I already took master classes, um, in my bachelor’s, I then actually.</p><p>Uh, pursued the whole thing and did a bachelor in the master and the master. I did partly in London, in the vestments there university, and this was really one of my best times. It was the first time that I went away from home. And, uh, somehow I got a little bit hooked. I really left being away and learning about new cultures.</p><p>Um, having a complete different perspective on life, uh, through those travels through those months abroad. And so when I finished my masters, I knew that I’m not gonna stay. So I started actually as a lecturer, the university, and I teach the system security and complexity theory. Hmm. The algorithms. So something like that, introduction to algorithms.</p><p>Um, so, but I knew that I wanted something else. So I looked around and I found a PhD program. And I applied and it was actually in the Netherlands. And I also have to say that when I graduated, this was 2008, it was a regression. Right. So, uh, it wasn’t the best job market. And, uh, maybe, um, I don’t know if I would have done a PhD, if there would be a better job market I wanted to go into.</p><p>What I always wanted to do is industrial research. Right? So I wanted to be in industry and do the research side, but that bind, I think it was just not possible. There was no money and especially companies didn’t hire a lot of people into research, which somehow is not the most necessary thing. I think that if times are, you know, difficult, um, a lot of resources go away from, from research.</p><p>Anyway. So I went actually to the Netherlands and I did my PhD program there. Um, I was mainly looking at how people software system, so software comprehension, can we build models around. Large software systems, so that it’s easier to really know what’s happening here to get an overview. And I was also diving into testing.</p><p>So especially test systems when we are testing something, how do we know, how do we know what we should test? Which integrations for example, should we test? And I’m experimenting with things that help people really to understand their. Test suites, but another aspect of dad was God, more than more into qualitative studies.</p><p>So what I really enjoyed was doing this quantitative things. So like you’re looking at data you’re analyzing. Software repositories data that you’re getting from, uh, from what they, what the engineers produce. Right. So you’re looking at commits, you’re looking at the source code. You’re looking at, um, maybe interactions that engineers are having.</p><p>Right. But there’s in a, in a very quantitative way. Um, so you’re doing a lot of data mining there and, um, maybe. I have some algorithms around to extract entrance, interesting patterns, but then compliment that with a qualitative research. So instead of saying, well, we extracted, you know, let’s say to get history and then we saw, and we have some way to detect, let’s say …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div>

If you want to avoid these topics, please jump to the last paragraph of this introduction, starting with ‘Enough about the depressing stuff.’</em></p><p>Before we start, I feel like I need to give a bit of background on why I care so deeply about privacy. It’s partly historical. Being Ashkenazi, I learnt from a very young age about the importance of sensitive information, and who you give that information to. My grandfather broke the law by not going to the police station to register himself as a Jew. The Holocaust saw 76,000 Jews deported to death camps from France alone - around 1/4th of the country’s Jewish population at the time. There’s a chance that not being part of the Jewish census saved his life. Lesson: be careful who you give sensitive information to.</p><p>That grandfather and two of his brothers left Paris in the middle of the war, and took a train south with no plan, no luggage, no contact, and no destination other than, well, heading south. They were helped by strangers and survived. Their mother however, along with two other siblings, had a plan. They had a deal with a smuggler to reach unoccupied France. The smuggler informed the Nazis, and all 3 of them died in deportation. Lesson: each person who has information on you represents an additional chance for it to be leaked.</p><p>And yes, we can raise the irony of mentioning my Jewish grandpa to warn you against sharing sensitive information online. There, I just did.&nbsp;</p><p>While this happened in the 1940’s, a data point’s lifespan is drastically different today. It’s possible that you posted something online 10 years ago, and it was fine back then, but 20 years from now you will hope that no one finds it. My message is: the Internet never forgets, cultures change, and retroactive laws exist. People can get screwed over digital data. Let’s take the obvious example: China’s state surveillance has an eye on literally each and every move of its inhabitants, whether physical or digital. The state uses extensive data to allocate social scores, which can have a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-18/china-social-credit-a-model-citizen-in-a-digital-dictatorship/10200278?nw=0" target="_blank">drastic impact</a> on Chinese people’s life, including banning them from purchasing train or plane tickets, providing them with lower Internet speed, and denying them visas and loans. China also makes use of this surveillance system <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/02/asia/xinjiang-china-karakax-document-intl-hnk/" target="_blank">against its Uyghur population</a>, detaining between 1 and 2 million people - the estimates vary - in concentration camps, where prisoners suffer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang_re-education_camps#Testimonies_of_treatment" target="_blank">extensively reported torture, brainwashing and forced labour</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from governmental issues, there’s also the topic of pervasive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFTWM7HV2UI" target="_blank">tracking and ads</a>, championed by Facebook and Google. I’m yet to see the difference between today’s digital advertising and individually-customised mass manipulation. Maybe because there is none. Please try and change my mind if you have any conclusive elements.</p><p>Enough about the depressing stuff. I’ve explained why your privacy matters, and we’re now about to dive into a few security concepts. I wrote this article with <a href="https://twitter.com/lp1eu" target="_blank">lp1</a>, as he knows much more about these concepts than I do. So here’s my first pro tip for you, unrelated to privacy or security: date people you admire. Now, let’s get into the technical aspects.</p><h2>CIA</h2><p>The CIA ‘triad’ is a summary of the main concepts of information security. There are 3 aspects regarding information which are targeted by infosec:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Confidentiality</strong>:<strong> </strong>the assurance that a piece of information can only be observed by authorised third parties.</p></li><li><p><strong>Integrity</strong>:<strong> </strong>the assurance that a piece of information is and stays accurate over time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Availability</strong>: the assurance that a piece of information can be accessed by an authorised user when they need it.</p></li></ul><h2>Encryption: Server-side vs. Client-side</h2><p>Encryption secures data and aims to maintain its confidentiality and integrity.</p><p>We differentiate server-side from client-side encryption. Server-side means that only information stored on said server is encrypted. This means that the company has the encryption key, and therefore can access your communication (yes, including your nudes). However, server-side encryption doesn’t apply to the <strong>transmission </strong>of your communication. The data you share is not necessarily encrypted, only the storage is, which is why you should favour platforms that use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS" target="_blank">https</a>.</p><p>Client-side – or end-to-end – encryption means that the transmission of your information is encrypted, and that <strong>only your device</strong> has the key. If you log in from a different device, you won’t be able to see the exchanges. Since the company <strong>does not have the key</strong>,<strong> </strong>they cannot access your messages. As a result, even if they were to store your exchanges, said exchanges would automatically be encrypted. However, this also means that you won’t be able to recover your messages, should you lose the key.</p><p>In the case of a communication service, this means that the nudes you're sending to <strong>someone you trust</strong> are encrypted from your device to the company's server, as well as from their server to your trusted partner's device. Without encryption however, anyone on your network can see and tamper with all your communications. By 'tamper with', we mean any kind of modification by an unauthorised third-party. Examples include someone changing your password and email address on a platform to take over your account, deleting your private files on a cloud file storage service, replacing software in your online backups with malware, etc.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1598877921511_5282"><div><p>A recent example is the July Twitter hack, during which <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1286088135525318656" target="_blank">hackers managed to read users' messages from Twitter's admin control panel</a>. &nbsp;With end-to-end encrypted DMs, no one at Twitter would have been able to access them.</p><h2>Encryption vs. Hashing</h2><p>A distinction has to be made between two important notions: encryption and hashing. Encrypting information means that you turn it into scrambled text which can be decoded with a key. For instance, it's useful to make sure a communication between two peers cannot be read by an unauthorised person.&nbsp;</p><p>Hashing a piece of data on the other hand means that you turn it into a <strong>unique signature</strong> which <strong>cannot be reversed</strong> into its original readable state. The only way for someone to obtain the original input based on the hashing output, is to try inputs themselves until their output matches. Hashing is not intended as a cypher to decrypt, which is why encryption and hashing serve different purposes and are used in different cases. Hashing is noticeably useful to store passwords, because you avoid storing the actual easy-to-steal-and-reuse passwords. Instead, you compare the hashing output that you store to the hashing output of what a user entered while trying to log in. If you get the same hash that you’ve stored, then the password is correct.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1598877921511_7990"><div><h2>100% secure does not exist</h2><p>Flaws and vulnerabilities can always be found. However, the sturdier your tools, the safer you'll be. And contrary to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djV11Xbc914" target="_blank">what A-ha used to sing</a>, it is better to be safe than sorry.</p><h2>Free vs. Open source</h2><p>Free and open source software are specific philosophies, based on specific values. Free software specifically refers to the notion of users' freedom, which isn't the case in open-source software. As <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html" target="_blank">the GNU website</a> puts it: 'To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”'.</p><p>There are 4 criteria for software to be free:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Freedom 0: The freedom to run the programme as you wish, for any purpose.</p></li><li><p>Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the programme works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. This entails having access to the source code.</p></li><li><p>Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.</p></li><li><p>Freedom 3: The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.</p></li></ul><p>On the other hand, open-source software has a <a href="https://opensource.org/osd" target="_blank">less strict definition</a>, and a different philosophy. You can also see the source code, amongst other things.</p><p>If you want to get into the political aspect of these terminologies, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html" target="_blank">here</a>’s a good explanation.</p><h2>Credential stuffing attack</h2><p>Credential stuffing is a popular attack whose goal is to automatically test a user’s known credentials on multiple platforms on a large scale. Nowadays, it is widely used by malicious intruders because of the online accessibility of billions of credentials gathered from data leaks (<a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/dating-the-ginormous-myspace-breach/" target="_blank">MySpace</a>, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dailymotion-allegedly-hacked-85-million-user-accounts-stolen/" target="_blank">Dailymotion</a>, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-dropbox-hack-is-real/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> to name some of the biggest).</p><p>And there you have it, a roundup of the main security concepts.

<h2>In The Beginning</h2>



<p>A little over 13 years ago, I had been working as a freelance developer for over five years, primarily writing and hosting Ruby based web sites and applications for a variety of commercial interests, from mutual funds to construction to education. </p>



<p>I had designed and built a reliable system architecture for deploying and managing dozens of disparate sites and applications. However, I frequently encountered an annoying logistical problem when I was diagnosing and debugging client issues. For both load handling and for redundancy purposes, many of these sites ran on two or more application server instances. This necessarily meant that there were two or more sets of logs being generated on different instances/machines.</p>



<p>If there were commercial log aggregator offerings at that time, I wasn’t aware of them, and for various reasons I didn’t like the idea of trying to use <a href="https://sematext.com/blog/log-aggregation/#toc-syslog-rsyslog-or-syslog-ng-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">syslog</a> to fill the gap, so I chose to write my own solution. I did everything with Ruby, and I wasn’t afraid of the challenge of writing a Ruby based system that was both fast enough and reliable enough for this purpose, so I dove in and I hacked something out.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/wyhaines/analogger" target="_blank">Analogger</a> was born.</p>



<h2>The Backstory</h2>



<p>Analogger was written using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2007/03/12/ruby-1-8-6-released/" target="_blank">Ruby 1.8.6</a>, and for high performance network IO, I used <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine" target="_blank">EventMachine</a>, which provides an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern" target="_blank">event reactor</a> implemented with C++, with an interface to Ruby, that lets one write high speed IO/network handling code in Ruby. As part of the package, I also wrote a logging client, which used pure Ruby to send the messages, so that whatever was using the client (such as a Rails app) did not have to be running an EventMachine reactor to use it.</p>



<p>I didn’t do much with it after that. It just worked. I announced the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.engineyard.com/engine-yards-plans-for-ruby-1-8-6" target="_blank">Ruby 1.8.6 End-Of-Life</a> in 2011, but Analogger didn’t need much attention to adapt to later Rubies. Analogger just worked.</p>



<p>In my usage, at it’s peak, it handled millions of records a day, aggregating those logs into log files on a single dedicated logging instance. I fixed a few bugs here and there. I eventually made it available on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/wyhaines/analogger" target="_blank">Github</a> and as a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rubygems.org/gems/analogger" target="_blank">gem</a>. I added a feature a few years ago so that one can avoid losing logging data if the server goes down. But mostly, I ignored it and just let it do it’s job. There was little that had to be done for it to work with newer Rubies as they were released, though the dependence on EventMachine meant that alternative Ruby implementations, such as JRuby, might not work so well (there has been a <a href="https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine/tree/master/java/src/com/rubyeventmachine">Java implementation of EventMachine</a> for a long time, but it’s feature parity with the Ruby version often lagged). However, like so many other people do so often with software that is running in production without any problems, I mostly took the approach of, “If it isn’t broken, don’t fix it.”</p>



<p>Fast forward to the present. I’m running Ruby 2.7.1. Rubygems is a first class citizen of the Ruby ecosystem. EventMachine is still around, and it’s still fast, but Ruby is faster now, too, and there are other ways to do things. There are also other interesting languages around like <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crystal</a>, <a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Golang</a>, and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rust</a>, and a compelling argument could be made that low level, performance sensitive software like Analogger might better be written in a language like that.</p>



<p>So, a few weeks ago when I was looking through the Analogger code with that in mind, and it occurred to me that before I embark on a complete rewrite, it would be prudent to just renovate Analogger for the Ruby 2.7.1 world. The biggest part of that is that I wanted to convert it from dependence on EventMachine to the use of the excellent <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/socketry/async" target="_blank">Async</a> library.</p>



<h2>The Journey</h2>



<p><a href="https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EventMachine</a> is great. It joined the Ruby ecosystem a long time ago, and it still sees regular use. That alone should be testimony to it’s utility and its performance. However, Ruby itself now has a much richer ecosystem surrounding it, which provides us with more options, and more choices.</p>



<p>Analogger is an asynchronous logger written around an event reactor. There is no reason that reactor can not itself be implemented primarily in Ruby.</p>



<p>Back at the end of 2011, <a href="https://github.com/tarcieri" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Acieri</a> started writing <a href="https://github.com/socketry/nio4r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nio4r</a>. It was modeled after Java’s NIO (Nonblocking IO). Taken from the current github page for the project:</p>


<pre title="">New I/O for Ruby (nio4r): cross-platform asynchronous I/O
primitives for scalable network clients and servers. Modeled
after the Java NIO API, but simplified for ease-of-use.

nio4r provides an abstract, cross-platform stateful I/O
selector API for Ruby. I/O selectors are the heart of
"reactor"-based event loops, and monitor multiple I/O objects
for various types of readiness, e.g. ready for reading or writing.
</pre>


<p>About three years ago <a href="https://github.com/ioquatix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samuel Williams</a> started working on <a href="https://github.com/socketry/async" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Async</a>, which is an event reactor implementation in Ruby, leveraging Nio4r. It is intentionally simple, with several companion projects that provide other capabilities such as IO, HTTP handling, process management, websockets, etc.</p>



<p>For the purposes of the renovation of Analogger, <a href="https://github.com/socketry/async-io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">async-io</a> seems like the state of the art in Ruby event reactors, so let’s refactor the codebase to use it.</p>



<p>With EventMachine, the core of the usage is this:</p>


<pre title="">EventMachine.run {
  EventMachine.add_shutdown_hook do
    write_queue
    flush_queue
    cleanup
  end
  @server = EventMachine.start_server @config[-"host"], @config[-"port"], protocol
  EventMachine.add_periodic_timer(1) {Analogger.update_now}
  EventMachine.add_periodic_timer(@config[-"interval"]) {write_queue}
  EventMachine.add_periodic_timer(@config[-"syncinterval"]) {flush_queue}
}
</pre>


<p>In this code, <code>protocol</code> is a class that implements the network protocol, using EventMachine methods.</p>



<p>To convert the code to using Async (specifically, Async-IO), we remove EventMachine from the gemspec and add Async:</p>


<pre title="">spec.add_runtime_dependency 'async-io', '~&gt; 1.29'
</pre>


<p>Async offers some signal handling tools that EventMachine did not offer. In the original EventMachine based code, the following helper method was implemented:</p>


<pre title="">def safe_trap(siglist, &amp;operation)
  (Signal.list.keys &amp; siglist).each {|sig| trap(sig, &amp;operation)}
end
</pre>


<p>It’s usage was something like this:</p>


<pre title="">EXIT_SIGNALS = %w[INT TERM]
safe_trap(EXIT_SIGNALS) {handle_pending_and_exit}
</pre>


<p>Async’s signal handling is aware of the reactor event loop, and is written to interact with it. In order to keep the code within the Async event loop looking clean, helper methods for each of the signal handlers needed to be written. They follow this pattern:</p>


<pre title="">def install_hup_trap(task: nil)
  hup_trap = Async::IO::Trap.new(:HUP)
  hup_trap.install!
  task.async do |_handler_task|
    loop do
      hup_trap.wait
      cleanup_and_reopen
    end
  end
end
</pre>


<p>This handler, for the <code>HUP</code> signal, instructs Analogger to sync any data that may still be in buffers out to its logfiles, and then to close and reopen all of them. With Async, since everything is being handled from inside of a reactor event loop, there are two interesting things that happen here.</p>


<pre title="">  hup_trap = Async::IO::Trap.new(:HUP)
  hup_trap.install!
</pre>


<p>This creates a signal handler, and then installs it.</p>


<pre title="">  task.async do |_handler_task|
    loop do
      hup_trap.wait
      cleanup_and_reopen
    end
  end
</pre>


<p>This creates a task. Async leverages <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/Fiber.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ruby fibers</a> to encapsulate discrete units of execution, and the Task essentially wraps that Fiber with a state management framework.</p>



<p>This code looks like it would just run in a tight loop, calling <code>cleanup_and_reopen</code> over and over. However, the call to <code>hup_trap.wait</code> changes that. The <code>hup_trap.wait</code> causes that fiber to cease executing and passes control back to the reactor. The signal handler encapsulated in the instance of <code>Async::IO::Trap</code> that was created for the <code>HUP</code> signal, if it is triggered by catching such a signal, will tell the reactor that this fiber should be scheduled again. As soon as the reactor is free to do so, it will resume the fiber’s execution at that point, allowing the loop to continue. When the loop restarts, the fiber will yield it’s execution once again. In this way the signal handler remains active and available to handle any number of <code>HUP</code> signals.</p>



<p>Similar methods were created for handling the <code>USR2</code> signal, which Analogger responds to by completely restarting itself, and the <code>INT</code> and <code>TERM</code> signals, which both cause Analogger to shut down gracefully, except in those methods, because the respective signals will only be handled a single time, they do not sit within a loop.</p>


<pre title="">def install_int_term_trap(task: nil, server: nil)
  int_trap = Async::IO::Trap.new(:INT)
  term_trap = Async::IO::Trap.new(:TERM)
  [int_trap, term_trap].each do |trap|
    trap.install!
    task.async do |_handler_task|
      trap.wait

      write_queue if any_in_queue?
      flush_queue
      cleanup
      trap.default!
      Async.logger.info(server) do |buffer|
        buffer.puts "Caught #{trap}"
        buffer.puts 'Stopping all tasks...'
        task.print_hierarchy(buffer)
        buffer.puts '', 'Reactor Hierarchy'
        task.reactor.print_hierarchy(buffer)
      end
      task.stop
    end
  end
end
</pre>


<p>Because this is renovation, the handler also takes advantage of some nice introspection capabilities that exist in Async to output a snapshot of the Reactor internals when it is stopped. This feature doesn’t exist with EventMachine, and it isn’t a <em>functional</em> feature, in that it doesn’t alter the core capabilities of the software in any way, but it is nice because it lets one see what tasks were currently in the system when it was stopped.</p>



<p>Analogger uses several timers, which are blocks of code that get executed either once, or repeatedly, after a given interval, to trigger actions that should occur at periodic intervals (such as ensuring that all logs that may exist in memory buffers are flushed to disk). EventMachine offers some nice syntactic sugar for implementing timers.</p>



<p>Async doesn’t offer any built in sugar for doing this, but timers are simple to implement within a reactor.</p>

It uses symbolic computations to find the defects. Analyzer covers a variety of checks targeted at finding security and API usage bugs, dead code, null dereference, division by zero, and other logic errors. The Clang Static Analyzer already has a checker to find the null pointer dereference in code, however it is not sufficient for higher abstractions such as C++ smart pointers or optionals. By explicitly teaching the C++ standard class behaviors we can make the Analyzer to find more bugs related to modern C++ code.<h2 id="Goal"><a href="#Goal" title="Goal"></a>Goal</h2>Enable Clang Static Analyzer to find the occurrences of null smart pointer dereferences by teaching the observed behaviors of C++ smart pointer classes. Improve the analyzer’s ability to realize the values of the standard smart pointers without having to dig deep into the complex implementation details. We should be able to find more null dereference bugs related to the smart pointers while reducing the number of false positives. Should be able to cover at least one class fully eg. <code>std::unique_ptr</code>, and then extend it to <code>std::shared_ptr</code> or the <code>std::optional</code> if time permits. <h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2>Within the GSoC time period, we could not implement the modeling for all smart pointer methods and operators as we planned. Since the problem was more complicated than what we all anticipated. So far the majority of the modeling for std::unique_ptr is  implemented and committed. We were able to find some promising results with that. We found <strong>8</strong> true positive warnings related to smart pointer null dereference in <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project" target="_blank" rel="external">LLVM</a> project and <strong>5</strong> warnings in the <a href="https://webkit.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">WebKit</a> project. Even though we were only able to support <code>std::unique_ptr</code> so far, we accomplished to build a base modeling for the smart pointer checkers. And this will act as a consolidated foundation for developing checkers for any C++ objects that are passed by value. That is one of the first conscious attempts to do so and we’ve gained a lot of experience and managed to maintain our integrity - in the sense that the code ended up mostly free of hacks. It could most likely be generalized to modeling the entire C++ standard library. This does not give us the high-level architecture that’ll be needed to deal with the scale of the standard library, but we got our low-level basics right. Also this work will be used to add support for checking other smart pointers <code>std::shard_ptr</code>, <code>std::weak_ptr</code> as well as <code>std::optionals</code>. Also it can be used to build a checker for use-after-free errors. <h2 id="Research"><a href="#Research" title="Research"></a>Research</h2><h3 id="Smart-Pointer"><a href="#Smart-Pointer" title="Smart Pointer"></a>Smart Pointer</h3>A Smart pointer is an abstract data type that simulates a pointer with additional automatic memory management. It manages a dynamically allocated object and ensures the dynamically allocated object is properly cleaned up. Such features are intended to reduce bugs caused by the misuse of pointers while retaining efficiency. Smart pointers typically keep track of the memory they point to, and may also be used to manage other resources, such as network connections and file handles.<h3 id="Unique-Pointer"><a href="#Unique-Pointer" title="Unique Pointer"></a>Unique Pointer</h3>A <code>unique_ptr</code> is a smart pointer that owns and manages another object through a pointer and disposes that object when the <code>unique_ptr</code> goes out of scope. It should be used to own and manage any dynamically allocated object when its ownership is not shared. A <code>unique_ptr</code> explicitly prevents copying of its contained pointer (as would happen with the normal assignment), but the move assignment and move constructor can be used to transfer ownership of the contained pointer to another <code>unique_ptr</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example: 1 Dereferencing default-constructed unique pointer which is null</strong><br></p><figure><div><pre><p><span><span>int</span> <span>foo</span><span>(<span>bool</span> flag)</span> </span>{</p><p><span>std</span>::<span>unique_ptr</span>&lt;<span>int</span>&gt; x; </p><p><span>if</span> (flag) </p><p><span>return</span> <span>0</span>; </p><p><span>return</span> *x;  </p><p>}</p></pre></div></figure>
<p><strong>Example: 2 Dereferencing a unique pointer after calling release()</strong><br></p><figure><div><pre><p><span><span>int</span> <span>bar</span><span>()</span> </span>{</p><p><span>std</span>::<span>unique_ptr</span>&lt;<span>int</span>&gt; x(<span>new</span> <span>int</span>(<span>42</span>)) ;  </p><p>  x.release(); </p><p><span>return</span> *x;   </p><p>}</p></pre></div></figure>
<p>Similar to above cases, other possible cases are dereferencing after calling <code>std::move()</code>, <code>reset()</code> or <code>reset(nullptr)</code>, getting and explicitly deleting inner pointer, or swapping with null pointer using <code>std::swap</code> (<a href="https://vrnithinkumar.github.io/2020/08/31/gsoc-report/#Appendix">more examples in Appendix</a>). Above all cases will result in a crash.</p>
<h2 id="Design"><a href="#Design" title="Design"></a>Design</h2><p>The basic idea of the checker is to keep a record of raw pointers wrapped inside the smart pointers using a map between smart pointer and corresponding inner pointer. Update the map by enumerating all situations when the smart pointer becomes null, as well as the situations when the smart pointer becomes non-null. For example when a smart pointer is default constructed track that smart pointer as it has a null inner pointer. Then check if any of the tracked pointers dereferenced has a null value. To make the bug report more clear attach additional details along the bug path to provide more detailed information on where the smart pointer becomes null.</p>
<h2 id="Alternative-Solution-Considered"><a href="#Alternative-Solution-Considered" title="Alternative Solution Considered"></a>Alternative Solution Considered</h2><p>Another possible solution considered was manipulating symbolic values inside the smart pointer. The limitation that we run into here is that our memory model (“RegionStore”) doesn’t currently allow setting a “default” binding to a whole object when it’s a part (say, a field) of a bigger object. This means that we have to understand how the smart pointer works internally (which field corresponds to what) to manipulate its symbolic value, which ties us to a specific implementation of the C++ standard library. This might still work for a unique pointer which probably always has exactly one field, but for shared pointers it is not the case and has multiple fields. So it depends on the different implementations of the C++ standard library. It has been decided to not go with this approach since this approach is challenging and potentially a lot of work compared to the first approach.</p>
<h2 id="Implementation"><a href="#Implementation" title="Implementation"></a>Implementation</h2><h3 id="Initial-Smart-Pointer-Modeling-and-Checker"><a href="#Initial-Smart-Pointer-Modeling-and-Checker" title="Initial Smart Pointer Modeling and Checker"></a>Initial Smart Pointer Modeling and Checker</h3><p><a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D81315" target="_blank" rel="external">D81315</a>: Created a basic implementation. </p>
<ul>
<li>Made a separate checker class for emitting diagnostics. Used the new checker to use <code>checkPreCall</code> and put bug reporting logic there.</li>
<li>Kept all smart pointer related modeling logic in <code>SmartPtrModeling</code>. Shared common functionality via a header file shared between the <code>SmartPtrModeling</code> and <code>SmartPtrChecker</code>. </li>
<li>Made a <code>SmartPtrModeling</code> as a dependency to <code>SmartPtrChecker</code>.</li>
<li>Introduced a GDM with <code>MemRegion</code> as key and <code>SVal</code> as value to track the smart pointer and corresponding inner pointer.  </li>
<li>Also added support to model <code>unique_ptr</code> constructor, release and reset methods.</li>
<li>Used <code>evalCall</code> to handle modeling. As part of this enabled constructor support in <code>evalCall</code> event with <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D82256" target="_blank" rel="external">D82256</a>. </li>
<li>Implemented <code>checkDeadSymbols</code> to clean up the <code>MemRegion</code> of smart pointers from the program state map when they go out of scope. Keeping the data structures in the program state as minimal as possible so that it would not grow to a great size while analyzing real code and eventually slows down the analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this patch, the model can emit warnings for cases like use after default constructor, use after release, or use after the reset with a null pointer. Kept the <code>SmartPtrChecker</code> under <em>alpha.cplusplus</em> package and smart pointer modeling have to be enabled by the <code>ModelSmartPtrDereference</code> flag.</p>
<h3 id="checkRegionChanges-for-SmartPtrModeling"><a href="#checkRegionChanges-for-SmartPtrModeling" title="checkRegionChanges for SmartPtrModeling"></a>checkRegionChanges for SmartPtrModeling</h3><p><a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D83836" target="_blank" rel="external">D83836</a>: Implemented <code>checkRegionChanges</code> for <code>SmartPtrModeling</code>. To improve the accuracy, when a smart pointer is passed by a non-const reference into a function, removed the tracked region data. Since it is not sure what happens to the smart pointer inside the function.<br></p><figure><div><pre><p><span><span>int</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> </span>{</p><p><span>std</span>::<span>unique_ptr</span>&lt;<span>int</span>&gt; P; </p><p>  bar(&amp;P); </p><p><span>return</span> *P; </p><p>}</p></pre></div></figure>
<p>For example here in the code above, we are passing a default constructed <code>unique_ptr</code> ‘P’ to method <code>bar()</code>. But it is unknown whether the <code>unique_ptr</code> ‘P’ is reset with a valid inner pointer or not inside <code>bar()</code>. To avoid false positives we are not producing any warning on dereference of <code>unique_ptr</code> ‘P’ after <code>bar()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="Modeling-for-unique-ptr-swap-method"><a href="#Modeling-for-unique-ptr-swap-method" title="Modeling for unique_ptr::swap method"></a>Modeling for unique_ptr::swap method</h3><p><a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D83877" target="_blank" rel="external">D83877</a>: Enabled the <code>SmartPtrModeling</code> to handle the swap method for <code>unique_ptr</code>. The <code>swap()</code> method can be used to exchange ownership of inner pointers between the <code>unique_ptrs</code>. So it is possible to make a <code>unique_ptr</code> null by swapping with another null <code>unique_ptr</code>. With this patch warnings are emitted when a <code>unique_ptr</code> is used after swapping with another <code>unique_ptr</code> with null as an inner pointer.</p>
<h3 id="NoteTag-for-better-reporting"><a href="#NoteTag-for-better-reporting" title="NoteTag for better reporting"></a>NoteTag for better reporting</h3><p><a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D84600" target="_blank" rel="external">D84600</a>: With NoteTags added more detailed information on where the smart pointer becomes null in the bug path. Introduced a <code>getNullDereferenceBugType()</code> inter-checker API to check if the bug type is interesting.<br><em>After adding NoteTags:</em><br><img src="https://vrnithinkumar.github.io/2020/08/31/gsoc-report/notetag.png" alt="alt text" title="NoteTags"></p>
<h3 id="Modeling-for-unque-ptr-get"><a href="#Modeling-for-unque-ptr-get" title="Modeling for unque_ptr::get()"></a>Modeling for unque_ptr::get()</h3><p><a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D86029" target="_blank" rel="external">D86029</a>: Modeled to return tracked inner pointer for the <code>get()</code> method. The <code>get()</code> method is used to access the inner pointer. When the inner pointer is used with conditional branching or other symbol constraining methods we can use the constraints on the inner pointer to find whether the corresponding <code>unique_ptr</code> is null or not. When the inner pointer value for a <code>unique_ptr</code> is available from the tracked map we bind that value to the return value of <code>get()</code> method. Also made changes to create <code>conjureSymbolVal</code> in case of missing inner pointer value for a <code>unique_ptr</code> region we are tracking.<br><em>Example:</em><br><img src="https://vrnithinkumar.github.io/2020/08/31/gsoc-report/get.png" alt="alt text" title="Get"></p>
<h3 id="Modeling-for-unique-ptr-bool-conversion"><a href="#Modeling-for-unique-ptr-bool-conversion" title="Modeling for unique_ptr bool conversion"></a>Modeling for unique_ptr bool conversion</h3><p><a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D86027" target="_blank" rel="external">D86027</a>: Modeling the case where <code>unique_ptr</code> is explicitly converted to bool. It is a common practice to check if a <code>unique_ptr</code> is null or not before accessing it. If the inner pointer value is already tracked and we know the value, we can figure out the corresponding boolean value. And the analyzer will take the branch based on that. Using <code>SValBuilder::conjureSymbolVal</code> to create a symbol when there is no symbol tracked yet and we constrain on that symbol to split the Exploded Graph with assuming null and non-null value.</p></div></div></div></article></div>

								<p>The recent years have seen a renewed interest in the choice of programming language in the development of important/critical software. There is increased realization that some programming languages come with pitfalls that impact the quality of the software produced in that language, with direct consequences for safety and security. This was the main message of the presentation by ANSSI on "Mind your language(s), A Discussion about Languages and Security" at HIS 2014. This is now a mainstream topic of discussion. Looking beyond mere pitfalls, some programming languages contain at their core a few "defect attractors", a term coined by Les Hatton and popularized by Eric Raymond, which defeat attempts at higher software quality. C is a hugely popular programming language for developing important/critical software, in particular embedded software, that has a high number of defect attractors: pointer arithmetic, type punning, manual memory management, text-substitution macros, global variables, manual error handling, implicit type conversions, minimality of syntax. In this presentation, we will discuss major defect attractors in mainstream programming languages such as C/C++, and how they are avoided in well established programming lanugages (such as Ada/OCaml), more recent programming languages (such as Rust/Go), new versions of programming languages (such as C++17/C++20) or subsets of programming languages (such as MISRA-C/SPARK Ada). We will highlight whether the defense comes from language constructs, supporting tools, or a combination thereof.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  <p>01 Sep 2020</p>

  <p>One of the eternal laws of the internet dictates that as soon as one person says
they have a new thing that lets them type faster — a keyboard, a keyboard
layout, an editor configuration, etc. —&nbsp;somebody else must say: “but typing is
not the bottleneck!”</p>

<p>What the second person means is that the first person is wasting their time.
They’re optimizing something that’s not slowing them down. Typing is not the
bottleneck, because <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9715810">“typing is perhaps 0.5-1% of my programming
time”</a>. Programming is <em>thinking</em>, talking to people, planning,
researching, is what incarnations of person #2 are saying. And if you think your
keyboard is holding you back from thinking, well, you’re wrong.</p>

<p>I get that. I don’t write code the whole day either.</p>

<p>But here’s what I need to write and type besides code: commit messages, pull
request descriptions, emails, tickets, comments on tickets, code reviews,
documentation, Slack messages, notes, journal entries, RFCs, design documents,
requirements.</p>

<p>And being able to type fast and without much effort sure as hell helps. It lets
me get back to the thinking.</p>

<p>Effort, that’s the important one, not raw speed. It doesn’t matter if you can
type 90 words per minutes or 130, but if it takes you <em>effort</em> to type something
and, if given the choice, you’d rather not do it, then we have a problem.</p>

<p>Take me on my phone, for example. It takes me a lot of effort to type on it.
It’s not only that I’m slow because I can’t use more than two fingers, but every
third word is a typo. Or, even more infuriating, it’s the wrong word and I need
to correct autocorrect. Or I switched from English to German while typing and my
phone doesn’t know what an umlaut is anymore.</p>

<p>If you see me typing on my phone chances are you can also hear me producing an
angry growl-like sound.</p>

<p>Which is exactly why I don’t do it a lot. I barely use the note taking apps I
have, because I’d rather type on my computer, with a proper keyboard. I often
refrain from replying to messages if I don’t have to, because, yep, I’d have to
type those replies.</p>

<p>In other words: typing <em>is</em> a bottleneck for me.</p>

<p>And it’s not just me on my phone. Ever had a chat conversation with somebody who
wasn’t comfortable typing? Here’s what you get: short messages, acronyms, typos,
missing sentences. You can <em>read</em> how they struggled to type. I once had a
colleague who had the habit of walking to my desk saying “Ah, before I type all
that up, I thought I’d quickly tell you in person” where “all that” was three to
four paragraphs, at the most.</p>

<p>And that’s what this is about. If you’re not comfortable typing a lot and you’d
rather not write something down then typing <em>is</em> the bottleneck and you need to
fix it. Typing is not something you should need to think about.</p>

<p>Because wouldn’t it be a waste of time if you spend 99% of your time lying in a
hammock, thinking, but then choose not to write all of your ideas down, because
typing <em>is</em> the bottleneck?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s bloody hard to find a good example of a large production-grade, open-source React app.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>No one</b> writes amazing code the first time they write it</p>
<ul>
<li>Experienced product engineers know there’s a trade-off between quality and getting features in the hands of customers. You’re more likely to find ugly tech debt with a <code>//TODO: Improve this later!</code> comment than best practices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most companies keep their apps in private repos</p>
<ul>
<li>Trade secrets and all that jazz.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>There’s a <em>lot</em> of beginner-grade repos out there</p>
<ul>
<li>Without a ton of experience, it’s hard to tell the good from the bad</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On that note, I’ve reviewed the following well-known open-source React apps, and reckon they’re worth checking out.</p>

<p>Project link: <a href="https://github.com/oldboyxx/jira_clone">Jira Clone</a></p>
<p>Jira Clone is… a Jira clone built in modern React, entirely out of functional components with Hooks. It’s noteworthy because its stack is more or less what I’d use on my own side-projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>TypeScript with TypeORM on the backend, communicating with a Postgres database</li>
<li>React on the frontend with a custom webpack config</li>
<li>Relies on Cypress for end-to-end testing</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of that, the author has done an amazing job making it look very similar to Jira (when the clone was built), using a mix of <a href="https://styled-components.com/">styled-components</a> and global styles.</p>
<p>This repo also highlights the benefits of just working on a project by yourself with a clear understanding of what you’re trying to build. You’ll see the contrast when you check out the other projects in this article.</p>

<p>RealWorld by Thinkster re-implements the same app (a Medium.com clone called Conduit) in over 24 different languages and frameworks. In this case, we’re reviewing the React/Redux version.</p>
<p>It uses create-react-app, with react-router for routing, Redux for state management, classNames for styling, superagent for data fetching, with no testing, or type-checking.</p>
<p>It seems like a decent way to understand the syntactical differences between dozens of language and framework combinations, but isn’t exactly a beacon of best practices.</p>

<p>Real World App is a great example of best-practices to use for end-to-end testing an application with Cypress, with example data in the repo, so both tests and the app run out-of-the-box without the need for a database.</p>
<p>It’s built with create-react-app, written in TypeScript with an Express backend, using Material UI as a UI/component library, Formik for forms, and react-router for routing.</p>
<p>It looks like a pretty solid example of an application you would see in the real world, (especially since it uses forms), though data-fetching and form submission are optimised for ease of testing/portability rather than best practices.</p>

<p>Simorgh is the BBC’s React SPA, currently serving millions of users in production around the world. It is being progressively rolled out to each BBC World Service News website, and you can track the progress <a href="https://github.com/bbc/simorgh/blob/latest/docs/Simorgh-Release-Info.md">here</a>.</p>
<p>It uses PropTypes for type-checking, Jest and Enzyme for unit testing, Cypress for end-to-end testing, styled-components for styling (with most components living in <code>@bbc/psammead</code>, which is an awesome component library to check out too), react-router for routing, with Express handling server-side rendering.</p>
<p>It’s extremely well-tested (98% coverage) and well-documented, with READMEs throughout the project to explain large directories.</p>

<p>AST Explorer is a tool for exploring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract Syntax Trees</a>.</p>
<p>It’s worth checking out as a React project because it’s a good example of a project under continuous development for several years. It’s a classic React project that uses PropTypes for type-checking, and Redux for state management while still using local state where possible.</p>
<p>While you won’t find anything fancy like TypeScript/Flow here, the code is well commented, with hacks and workarounds clearly pointed out.</p>
<p>Some might say there’s some “tech debt”, as the authors have chosen to stick with class components, and not immediately rewrite to functional components + Hooks. Instead, they’ve maintained class components in older files, with functional components + Hooks in newer files.</p>
<p>Also worth noting, that like many real life, open-source projects, AST Explorer was started with the intention of adding tests later, but only one contributor in four years mentioned wanting to add tests in the GitHub Issues.</p>

<p>It’s worth checking out because it’s one of the most popular (in terms of daily users) examples of an un-ejected <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/">create-react-app</a> application I’ve seen in production.</p>
<p>It’s written in relatively modern React (mostly functional components with Hooks) with TypeScript, uses SCSS for styles, there are tests, and rather than using Redux, they’ve <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html">lifted state up</a> and persisted it in localStorage.</p>

<p>Spectrum is a community site, seeking to combine the features of a real-time chat app with the features of forums. It’s been under active development since early 2017, and was acquired by GitHub at the end of 2018.</p>
<p>Spectrum was very interesting to follow during its early years, as it used RethinkDB for (almost) live updates on queries, server-side rendering and GraphQL (very cutting edge at the time).</p>
<p>The codebase uses Flow for type-checking, Apollo (GraphQL) for data-fetching, Redux for state management, an <a href="https://github.com/withspectrum/spectrum/blob/alpha/hyperion/index.js">Express server</a> for server-side rendering, and uses functional components + Hooks, with custom hooks <a href="https://github.com/withspectrum/spectrum/tree/alpha/src/hooks">here</a>. Naturally, as one of the founders is <a href="https://mxstbr.com/">Max Stoiber</a> (creator of styled-components), the app is styled with styled-components.</p>
<p>Since the acquistion, Max has written a post called <a href="https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/tech-choice-regrets-at-spectrum">Tech Choices I Regret at Spectrum</a> that’s also worth checking out.</p>

<p>It runs on a Django backend, with a React frontend written in TypeScript (with PropTypes too), uses <a href="http://emotion.sh/">Emotion</a> for styling, react-router for routing, Redux for state management, and is a great example of trade-offs and <code>//TODO</code> comments in a SaaS app with users that pay for it.</p>

<p>I almost didn’t add Grafana as an example here, since it’s an AngularJS project in the process of migrating to React.</p>
<p>It’s an AngularJS app being progressively rewritten into a modern React app, written in TypeScript. It uses Redux for state management, an internal design system that uses emotion for styling (<code>@grafana/ui</code>).</p>
<p>It’s kind of a nightmare to navigate as a codebase, mainly due to mixing folders only used by AngularJS with folders only used by React, and that’s exactly why it’s in this article, as an example of what you’ll see in the real world.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This small ebook is here to teach you a programming language called Forth. Forth is a
language unlike most others. It’s not functional <em>or</em> object oriented, it doesn’t
have type-checking, and it basically has zero syntax. It was written in the 70s, but
is still used today for
<a href="http://www.forth.com/resources/apps/more-applications.html">certain applications</a>.</p>

<p>Why would you want to learn such an odd language? Every new programming
language you learn helps you think about problems in new ways. Forth is very
easy to learn, but it requires you to think in a different way than you’re used
to. That makes it a perfect language to broaden your coding horizons.</p>

<p>This book includes a simple implementation of Forth I wrote in JavaScript. It’s by
no means perfect, and is missing a lot of the functionality you’d expect in a real
Forth system. It’s just here to give you an easy way to try out the examples. (If
you’re a Forth expert, please
<a href="https://github.com/skilldrick/easyforth">contribute here</a> and make it better!)</p>

<p>I’m going to assume that you know at least one other programming language, and have
a basic idea of how stacks work as a data structure.</p>

<h2 id="adding-some-numbers">Adding Some Numbers</h2>

<p>The thing that separates Forth from most other languages is its use of the
stack. In Forth, everything revolves around the stack. Any time you type a
number, it gets pushed onto the stack. If you want to add two numbers together,
typing <code>+</code> takes the top two numbers off the stack, adds them, and puts
the result back on the stack.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example. Type (don’t copy-paste) the following into the
interpreter, typing <code>Enter</code> after each line.</p>

<pre><code>1
2
3
</code></pre>



<p>Every time you type a line followed by the <code>Enter</code> key, the Forth interpreter
executes that line, and appends the string <code>ok</code> to let you know there were no
errors. You should also notice that as you execute each line, the area at the
top fills up with numbers. That area is our visualization of the stack. It
should look like this:</p>

<p>1 2 3 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>Now, into the same interpreter, type a single <code>+</code> followed by the <code>Enter</code> key. The top two
elements on the stack, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>, have been replaced by <code>5</code>.</p>

<p>1 5 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>At this point, your editor window should look like this:</p>

<p>1  <span>ok</span>
2  <span>ok</span>
3  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
</p>

<p>Type <code>+</code> again and press <code>Enter</code>, and the top two elements will be replaced by 6. If
you type <code>+</code> one more time, Forth will try to pop the top two elements off the
stack, even though there’s only <em>one</em> element on the stack! This results in a
<code>Stack underflow</code> error:</p>

<p>1  <span>ok</span>
2  <span>ok</span>
3  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>Stack underflow</span>
</p>

<p>Forth doesn’t force you to type every token as a separate line. Type the
following into the next editor, followed by the <code>Enter</code> key:</p>

<pre><code>123 456 +
</code></pre>



<p>The stack should now look like this:</p>

<p>579 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>This style, where the operator appears after the operands, is known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">Reverse-Polish
notation</a>. Let’s try
something a bit more complicated, and calculate <code>10 * (5 + 2)</code>. Type the
following into the interpreter:</p>

<pre><code>5 2 + 10 *
</code></pre>



<p>One of the nice things about Forth is that the order of operations is
completely based on their order in the program. For example, when executing <code>5
2 + 10 *</code>, the interpreter pushes 5 to the stack, then 2, then adds them and
pushes the resulting 7, then pushes 10 to the stack, then multiplies 7 and 10.
Because of this, there’s no need for parentheses to group operators with lower
precedence.</p>

<h3 id="stack-effects">Stack Effects</h3>

<p>Most Forth words affect the stack in some way. Some take values off the stack,
some leave new values on the stack, and some do a mixture of both. These “stack
effects” are commonly represented using comments of the form <code>( before -- after
)</code>. For example, <code>+</code> is <code>( n1 n2 -- sum )</code> - <code>n1</code> and <code>n2</code> are the top two numbers
on the stack, and <code>sum</code> is the value left on the stack.</p>

<h2 id="defining-words">Defining Words</h2>

<p>The syntax of Forth is extremely straightforward. Forth code is interpreted as
a series of space-delimited words. Almost all non-whitespace characters are valid
in words. When the Forth interpreter reads a word, it checks to see if a
definition exists in an internal structure known as the Dictionary. If it is
found, that definition is executed. Otherwise, the word is assumed to be a
number, and it is pushed onto the stack. If the word cannot be converted to a
number, an error occurs.</p>

<p>You can try that out yourself below. Type <code>foo</code> (an unrecognized word)
and press enter.</p>



<p>You should see something like this:</p>

<p>foo  <span>foo ?</span></p>

<p><code>foo ?</code> means that Forth was unable to find a definition for <code>foo</code>, and it
wasn’t a valid number.</p>

<p>We can create our own definition of <code>foo</code> using two special words called <code>:</code>
(colon) and <code>;</code> (semicolon).  <code>:</code> is our way of telling Forth we want to create
a definition. The first word after the <code>:</code> becomes the definition name, and the
rest of the words (until the <code>;</code>) make up the body of the definition. It’s
conventional to include two spaces between the name and the body of the
definition. Try entering the following:</p>

<pre><code>: foo  100 + ;
1000 foo
foo foo foo
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> A common mistake is to miss out the space before the <code>;</code> word. Because Forth
words are space delimited and can contain most characters, <code>+;</code> is a perfectly
valid word and is not parsed as two separate words.</p>



<p>As you’ve hopefully figured out, our <code>foo</code> word simply adds 100 to the value on
top of the stack. It’s not very interesting, but it should give you an idea of
how simple definitions work.</p>

<h2 id="stack-manipulation">Stack Manipulation</h2>

<p>Now we can start taking a look at some of Forth’s predefined words. First,
let’s look at some words for manipulating the elements at the top of the stack.</p>

<h3 id="dup--n----n-n-"><code>dup ( n -- n n )</code></h3>

<p><code>dup</code> is short for “duplicate” – it duplicates the top element of the stack. For example,
try this out:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 dup
</code></pre>



<p>You should end up with the following stack:</p>

<p>1 2 3 3 &lt;- Top</p>

<h3 id="drop--n----"><code>drop ( n -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>drop</code> simply drops the top element of the stack. Running:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 drop
</code></pre>

<p>gives you a stack of:</p>

<p>1 2 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="swap--n1-n2----n2-n1-"><code>swap ( n1 n2 -- n2 n1 )</code></h3>

<p><code>swap</code>, as you may have guessed, swaps the top two elements of the stack. For example:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 4 swap
</code></pre>

<p>will give you:</p>

<p>1 2 4 3 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="over--n1-n2----n1-n2-n1-"><code>over ( n1 n2 -- n1 n2 n1 )</code></h3>

<p><code>over</code> is a bit less obvious: it takes the second element from the top of the
stack and duplicates it to the top of the stack. Running this:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 over
</code></pre>

<p>will result in this:</p>

<p>1 2 3 2 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="rot--n1-n2-n3----n2-n3-n1-"><code>rot ( n1 n2 n3 -- n2 n3 n1 )</code></h3>

<p>Finally, <code>rot</code> “rotates” the top <em>three</em> elements of the stack. The third
element from the top of the stack gets moved to the top of the stack, pushing
the other two elements down.</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 rot
</code></pre>

<p>gives you:</p>

<p>2 3 1 &lt;- Top</p>



<h2 id="generating-output">Generating Output</h2>

<p>Next, let’s look at some words for outputting text to the console.</p>

<h3 id="n-----period"><code>. ( n -- )</code> (period)</h3>

<p>The simplest output word in Forth is <code>.</code>. You can use <code>.</code> to output the top of
the stack in the output of the current line. For example, try running this
(make sure to include all the spaces!):</p>

<pre><code>1 . 2 . 3 . 4 5 6 . . .
</code></pre>



<p>You should see this:</p>

<p>1 . 2 . 3 . 4 5 6 . . . <span>1 2 3 6 5 4  ok</span></p>

<p>Going through this in order, we push <code>1</code>, then pop it off and output it. Then
we do the same with <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>. Next we push <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, and <code>6</code> onto the stack.
We then pop them off and output them one-by-one. That’s why the last three
numbers in the output are reversed: the stack is last in, first out.</p>

<h3 id="emit--c----"><code>emit ( c -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>emit</code> can be used to output numbers as ascii characters. Just like <code>.</code> outputs
the number at the top of the stack, <code>emit</code> outputs that number as an ascii
character. For example:</p>

<pre><code> 33 119 111 87 emit emit emit emit
</code></pre>



<p>I won’t give the output here so as to not ruin the surprise. This could also be
written as:</p>

<pre><code>87 emit 111 emit 119 emit 33 emit
</code></pre>

<p>Unlike <code>.</code>, <code>emit</code> doesn’t output any space after each character, enabling you
to build up arbitrary strings of output.</p>

<h3 id="cr-----"><code>cr ( -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>cr</code> is short for carriage return – it simply outputs a newline:</p>

<pre><code>cr 100 . cr 200 . cr 300 .
</code></pre>



<p>This will output:</p>

<p>cr 100 . cr 200 . cr 300 .<span>
100
200
300  ok</span></p>

<h3 id="section"><code>." ( -- )</code></h3>

<p>Finally we have <code>."</code> – a special word for outputting strings. The <code>."</code> word works
differently inside definitions to interactive mode. <code>."</code> marks the beginning of
a string to output, and the end of the string is marked by <code>"</code>. The closing <code>"</code>
isn’t a word, and so doesn’t need to be space-delimited. Here’s an example:</p>

<pre><code>: say-hello  ." Hello there!" ;
say-hello
</code></pre>



<p>You should see the following output</p>

<p>say-hello <span>Hello there! ok</span></p>

<p>We can combine <code>."</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>cr</code>, and <code>emit</code> to build up more complex output:</p>

<pre><code>: print-stack-top  cr dup ." The top of the stack is " .
  cr ." which looks like '" dup emit ." ' in ascii  " ;
48 print-stack-top
</code></pre>



<p>Running this should give you the following output:</p>

<p>48 print-stack-top <span>
The top of the stack is 48
which looks like '0' in ascii   ok</span></p>

<h2 id="conditionals-and-loops">Conditionals and Loops</h2>

<p>Now onto the fun stuff! Forth, like most other languages, has conditionals and
loops for controlling the flow of your program. To understand how they work,
however, first we need to understand booleans in Forth.</p>

<h3 id="booleans">Booleans</h3>

<p>There’s actually no boolean type in Forth. The number <code>0</code> is treated as false,
and any other number is true, although the canonical true value is <code>-1</code> (all
boolean operators return <code>0</code> or <code>-1</code>).</p>

<p>To test if two numbers are equal, you can use <code>=</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3 4 = .
5 5 = .
</code></pre>

<p>This should output:</p>

<p>3 4 = . <span>0  ok</span>
5 5 = . <span>-1  ok</span></p>



<p>You can use <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> for less than and greater than. <code>&lt;</code> checks to see if the
second item from the top of the stack is less than the top item of the stack, and
vice versa for <code>&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3 4 &lt; .
3 4 &gt; .
</code></pre>

<p>3 4 &lt; . <span>-1  ok</span>
3 4 &gt; . <span>0  ok</span></p>



<p>The boolean operators And, Or, and Not are available as <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>invert</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3 4 &lt; 20 30 &lt; and .
3 4 &lt; 20 30 &gt; or .
3 4 &lt; invert .
</code></pre>

<p>The first line is the equivalent of <code>3 &lt; 4 &amp; 20 &lt; 30</code> in a C-based language.
The second line is the equivalent of <code>3 &lt; 4 | 20 &gt; 30</code>. The third line is the
equivalent of <code>!(3 &lt; 4)</code>.</p>

<p><code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>invert</code> are all bitwise operations. For well-formed flags
(<code>0</code> and <code>-1</code>) they’ll work as expected, but they’ll give incorrect results for
arbitrary numbers.</p>



<h3 id="if-then"><code>if then</code></h3>

<p>Now we can finally get onto conditionals. Conditionals in Forth can only be
used inside definitions. The simplest conditional statement in Forth is <code>if
then</code>, which is equivalent to a standard <code>if</code> statement in most languages.
Here’s an example of a definition using …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>
<div> <p>In any organization, there will be people who behave inappropriately, sometimes grievously so. Here’s the paradox: the more senior the role you’re in, and the more power you have to help coworkers who are facing awful behavior like harassment or bullying, the less likely you are to see those things.</p>
<p>Simply put, if you’re in a position of power at work, you’re unlikely to see workplace harassment in front of you. That’s because harassment and bullying are attempts to exert power over people with less of it. People who behave improperly don’t tend to do so with people they perceive as having power already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was younger and in more junior roles, I dealt with harassment all the time. It was a defining characteristic of several jobs I had. What stands out in my memory from those roles isn’t what I learned or how I grew, but how hard I worked to avoid the men (it was always men) who made me feel meek and small. But over time, as I’ve moved up in my career, harassment has become steadily less prevalent in my work life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few years ago, when I was on the executive team of an org that employed around 250 people, nearly all of whom seemed very lovely to me, I wondered if perhaps I had found a group of people that simply didn’t include any bad apples. Spoiler alert: I had not.</p>
<p>Some months into the job, somebody made an offhand comment in front of me about a mid-level designer – a man in his 30s who was, apparently, well known for making young women in the organization feel uncomfortable. Let’s call this man Peter. Peter was also the first person to invite me out for coffee on my first day on the job. I had thought it a little curious at the time, since our work wasn’t going to overlap much. But he had been very friendly, sharing almost too much information about past problems at the org. I hadn’t thought too much of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It wasn’t until months later that I heard Peter described by a junior employee in a tone of voice that suggested everyone knew he was a problem. It was as if I’d stepped out of the Matrix and could now see reality. Suddenly, I understood why he had sought to establish a relationship with me early on. I was going to have power in the org, and he wanted that power to view him favorably. I also realized that most or all of the other people at my level – the very people who could do the most to address Peter’s behavior – likely didn’t know what everyone else thought was common knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine it: a majority of people at the company know or have a feeling that something is wrong. Everyone they talk to regularly knows it, too. Nobody among them thinks to discuss it with the most senior people, because as far as they can tell, everyone knows. And if the senior team isn’t doing anything, they must not care. Indeed, it probably isn’t safe to raise the issue with them because they all seem friendly with Peter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At that point in my career, I had spent a lot of time working on diversity, equity and inclusion. I had an undergrad degree in gender studies, and I was quite aware of organizational dynamics and structural oppression; I was on the path that I remain on to understand and use my advantages as a White person to change the workplace. And yet, I was stunned to realize that I had passively become a reinforcing part of the very type of harassment that I had struggled with for years. That was not the last surprise.</p>
<p>In my current job, I recently posted about this dynamic in a public Slack channel. Two of my colleagues – cis, White, middle-aged men who manage managers – reached out to me individually to say that they were glad I was talking about this, because they didn’t know what harassment looked like, and they wanted to learn so they could watch out for it. One of them said simply, ‘I’ve been a straight white guy my whole life. Nobody harasses me.’</p>
<p>I was pushed through the Matrix again. Not only was it possible that people in senior leadership positions at work had never been harassed, it was also possible that they didn’t even know what it looked or felt like.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>So what does harassment look and feel like?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Harassment is, unfortunately, a big category (and some of this discussion might be triggering). You are probably aware of the legal guidelines here, which prohibit quid pro quo (e.g. ‘I’ll give you a raise if you sleep with me’) and create a hostile environment (e.g. bullying people or teasing them in a demeaning way). Often, though, harassment and bullying fall somewhere in between these things. To people experiencing these things, they might look like, among many other things:</p>
<ul><li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet"><strong>Unwanted invitations.</strong>&nbsp;Asking a coworker to join you for drinks, dinner, or even lunch, especially after they’ve already said no.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet"><strong>Unwanted attention.</strong>&nbsp;Commenting on a coworker’s appearance i.e., clothing, hair, makeup, or body.&nbsp;</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet"><strong>Unwanted touching.&nbsp;</strong>Slightly prolonged taps, feeling somebody’s hair, hugging. Even a few years ago, hugging at work was common in some workplaces. That’s less the case now, both because it can shade into harassment and also because it’s more widely understood that some neurotypes find any kind of touching uncomfortable.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet"><strong>Unwanted online interactions.</strong>&nbsp;Sliding into somebody’s DMs with suggestive emojis or sending flirtatious emails.&nbsp;</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet"><a data-gc-link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression#:~:text=Microaggression%20is%20a%20term%20used,group%2C%20particularly%20culturally%20marginalized%20groups." href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression#:~:text=Microaggression%20is%20a%20term%20used,group%2C%20particularly%20culturally%20marginalized%20groups."><strong>Microaggressions of all types</strong></a><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Although I’m using it broadly here, the term was originally coined in 1970 to describe racist comments, specifically. Notably, in his recent book,&nbsp;<em>How to Be an Antiracist</em>, Ibram X. Kendi rejects the term, in part because, ‘A persistent daily hum of racist abuse is not minor…I use the term “abuse” because that describes the action and its effects on people.’</li>
</ul><p>Again, it’s critical to understand that harassment and bullying are expressions of power, so the perpetrator has status over the person they’re targeting: either from the org chart or from social systems like patriarchy and White supremacy. In other words, a White peer can abuse a Black coworker, an able-bodied peer can harass a disabled coworker, and so forth. It doesn’t require a senior title, though that almost always increases the impact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That impact is significant. If you’re in a position of societal or organizational power, these behaviors may seem small; if you’re lower in power, they can be devastating, causing people to question their own actions and worth. People who have to field these behaviors in a workplace are, at a very minimum, distracted and drained. Depression is common, and even suicide is a possible result. The fact that the patterns may be hidden from you does not make them less significant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having shared that glimpse of what harassment is, I’m going to talk about what we – the leaders in our organizations – can do to become aware of it, and how we can tell if our actions are effective. Because we can’t take action if we don’t realize bad behavior surrounds us, I’m going to focus on creating the conditions for awareness, not on actually addressing harassment or bullying. Once you become aware, you can work with other leaders to address it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are five things I’ve done to make it easier for people to talk with me about behavior that’s hidden from me.&nbsp;</p>
<ul><li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">A few times a year, I post a public message in Slack about how I used to experience harassment all the time, but now I rarely see it at all because of my title. So even though I’m more likely in a position to help, I need other people’s help to understand what’s happening. I post infrequently enough that people pay attention, but often enough that new people get the message.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">I’m unsurprised when I hear that somebody with social power who is very friendly to me has been causing problems for other people. In other words, I believe the stories of marginalized and underrepresented people over my own experience. (This is hard!)</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">I hold skip-level meetings at least quarterly, so that everyone who reports up to me knows who I am and that my door is open.&nbsp;</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">I welcome and cultivate professional 1:1 relationships with younger people who don’t report to me. They’re often aware of problems in the organization and need support outside their reporting chain to figure out how to speak up.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">I talk often about inequity. Being vocal about it is a signal to people throughout the organization about the values I hold and the culture I’m aiming to help create.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><h2>How do you know if any of this is working?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>There are a few signs I look for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are junior people in the organization seeking me out to talk about uncomfortable things? For example, are they coming to me because they think they’re being underpaid but don’t know how to ask their manager for a raise? Are they coming to me because they’re worried that their work is suffering due to a recent breakup and they don’t know if they should tell their team lead? When these conversations come up, it’s likely that I’ve built some trust with people who don’t report directly to me or aren’t in my reporting chain at all.</p>
<p>Are junior people in the organization coming to me because they’ve heard I’m good to talk with? That’s often a sign that I’m developing a reputation for having perspective beyond my own experience. (It’s worth noting that I’m not universally helpful. None of us can be good for everyone to talk with.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are the people who report to me bringing up power dynamics on their teams so that we can talk through potential issues? That suggests they know that I care about power dynamics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, we have to ask ourselves: are people talking to me about harassment or bullying they see or experience? And we have to understand that if they are not, that doesn’t mean it isn’t happening. Instead, it means you don’t know about something very vital that is almost certainly happening around you all the time. If you aren’t hearing about it, it’s time to take action to ensure that you do.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Yet another blog about docker that could be found in documentations, you might think. Legit opinion. But this is <strong>for those who don't want to be pointed to the bunch of documentation</strong>. And for those who would like to have some real use case in front of them when learning new concepts.</p>
<p>It's for beginners. So for those who heard about docker but never tried them. For those who heard their colleagues talking about it, but felt insecure to even ask how does it work. I might turn this into series of articles, we will see.</p>
<h2 id="real-life-dev-scenario-postgresql-on-your-next-project">Real life dev scenario - PostgreSQL on your next project</h2>
<p>Let's make a scene. Not the drama scene, but just to relax our mind a bit. This is not a post where you are presented a bunch of commands that's it. This should have a soul 😊.</p>
<p>You found out that your next project will involve, say, PostgreSQL. You never worked with it, you want to see how it looks like, and to prepare yourself for that project. Also, you already have a local machine set up for the current project. with totally different technologies. You don’t want to make more "mess". </p>
<h2 id="docker-hub">Docker Hub</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a> will be your starting point in many cases, so let’s write a few words about it. We will use it also in this workshop to find images we need. It’s also a place where images are documented, so you’ll probably come back here many times.</p>
<p>Also, a tip for the future, start asking yourself <em>"Does XYZ have a docker image I can use?"</em>. Open it now and try searching some images, for example, <code>mysql, wordpress, ghost, elasticsearch, php, java, maven, gradle, python</code>. You see my point? You can find almost anything as a docker image.</p>
<p>You may notice this <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_images/">OFFICIAL IMAGE</a> mark. That means the people who developed that technology, are most likely involved in developing and maintaining the docker image. There are other advantages, of course, check the documentation.</p>
<p>But it’s ok to use unofficial ones, too. Especially if you are experimenting with something. For example, my colleagues were developing an app in <code>React Native</code>. I didn’t have anything setup for compiling React Native project. All I wanted was to build an <code>APK</code> file and use it on my mobile phone. So I’ve just pulled the unofficial image that has everything installed there. Built my APK file and that’s it.</p>
<p>Ok, that’s enough for Docker Hub. Lets' move on.</p>
<h2 id="images">Images</h2>
<p>The first step is to check out <a target="_blank" href="https://hub.docker.com/search/?q=postgres&amp;type=image">Postgres image on Docker Hub</a>. This is the link, but feel free to go there and search it directly. </p>
<p>If you take a look at the description, you’ll see the supported tags and respective <code>Dockerfile</code> links. Consider tag as a version for the moment. There is also a whole tab dedicated to TAGS where you can find all the tags of this image. But the ones in the Description tab are supported ones. At the moment, supported tags go back down to version <code>9.5.22</code>. Also, versions in the tag are very likely to represent the version of the technology in the image. For example, <code>Python</code> image tagged as <code>3.6.8- stretch</code> will have <code>Python v3.6.8</code> in it. I’ll explain this <code>stretch</code> later.</p>
<p>OK, now we want to get a <code>Postgres</code> image. As this blog is static, we will stick with the version <code>11.8</code>. Postgres meanwhile released another tags, but for the sake of the blog we will use the <code>version 11</code>. The blog was tested with the version <code>11.2</code>, so we should stick with the major version 11.</p>
<p>There are two groups of tags, you may notice</p>
<pre><code># <span>output</span>
11<span>.8</span>, 11
11<span>.8-alpine</span>, 11<span>-alpine</span>
</code></pre><p>You may wonder what’s the difference.</p>
<p>Let’s pull both of them with commands below, and I’ll explain a bit while you wait for them to download. Yes, actually stop reading the blog and execute these two commands, one after another.</p>
<pre><code>$ docker pull <span>postgres:</span><span>11.8</span>
$ docker pull <span>postgres:</span><span>11.8</span>-alpine
</code></pre>
<p>OK, as you might see in browser (on the Ducker Hub page), each tag in one line links to the same <code>Dockerfile</code>. So it doesn’t matter if you are using <code>11.8</code> or <code>11</code>. At the moment of writing the initial blog article, in this line there was also a <code>latest</code> tag. The <code>latest</code> version back at the time was <code>11</code>. Now the latest is moved to the <code>version 12</code>. There are also beta versions 13 which will eventually become stable and thus <code>latest</code>. You get the point. Be careful with tag latest, as it will switch to the newer version in some time. I would suggest you to use specific tags instead of the <code>latest</code>. As you would do with any other dependencies and libraries.</p>
<p>But what about this <code>alpine</code> group of tags? At this moment your images may be ready, if not wait till they are, and execute</p>
<pre><code>$ docker images
</code></pre><p>You may see something like this, (your results may vary slightly):</p>
<pre><code># <span>output</span>
<span>postgres</span>           11<span>.8</span>             ...          312<span>MB</span>
<span>postgres</span>           11<span>.8-alpine</span>.     ...         70<span>.8MB</span>
</code></pre><h2 id="its-all-about-sizes">It's all about sizes</h2>
<p>Notice the difference in the size of those docker images. Docker is all about minimising resources you need to run something. It would be way heavier, for example, to run a complete virtual machine. Docker is not a virtual machine but that’s beyond the scope of this material. With Docker, you can have running <code>Postgres</code> server in <code>70 MB</code>. Consider Docker containers as an isolated process that runs on your machine.</p>
<p>If you open each of the Postgres <code>Dockerfiles</code> (find the links on the Docker Hub, I mean it, go and click it) you will see they are built on top of different Docker base images. I’m talking about <code>Dockerfiles</code> in <code>Postgres</code> image documentation. There will be something like <code>FROM debian:stretch-slim</code> and <code>FROM alpine:3.11</code>. You don’t have to understand anything about <code>Dockerfile</code> for now. Let’s just say that our <code>Postgres</code> images have to run on some architecture, and in this case, it’s Debian or Alpine. You may see different tag suffixes, such as <code>stretch</code>, <code>slim</code>, <code>jessie</code> and they refer to the base image they are built on. The size of an image, <strong>and also a set of available tools</strong> will depend on that, as well. In the end, they throw out all unnecessary things to achieve the small size. Consider that later when you get familiar with Docker. We’ll use <code>alpine</code> images for now. If you check <a target="_blank" href="https://alpinelinux.org/">Alpine distribution</a> site you’ll notice this motto:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Small. Simple. Secure.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Think about what you've read. It may be all confusing. That's ok. Feel free to read it again. Docker is a complex thing. Many will try to grasp as much as possible about Docker and it will just cause a mess in their head. Especially if you're new into this. That's why I provided only fraction here. But this fraction will be enough for your next steps.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. </p>

  <p>I meet regularly with early-career software developers. A few recurring meetings, 1x/week, plus ad-hoc calls as needed with others.</p>

<p>A question came up recently:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My three-month internship is close to wrapping up. The Co-founder/CEO/lead developer of the consulting company I’m at likes me, said he wishes he could hire me but cannot, because they don’t have enough work in the pipeline.</p>

  <p>He said he’d write me a letter of recommendation, and asked me to draft it for him.</p>

  <p>How do I write my own letter of recommendation, for my first real software development job?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Feels like a trap, huh?</p>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/office-hours-tufts.jpeg" alt="who are you?"></p>

<p><a href="https://admissions.tufts.edu/blogs/jumbo-talk/post/the-office-hours/"><em>source</em></a></p>

<p>Or, maybe they know you. They know you <em>too well</em></p>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/recommendation-warning.jpg" alt="untrustworthy"></p>

<p><a href="https://blacklawyermagic.wordpress.com/"><em>source</em></a></p>

<p>I explained a few concepts that we wanted to “speak to” in the letter. I’ll explain.</p>

<p>The software developer that I meet with mentioned that the CEO’s advice on the next job included “be able to speak to low liability”.</p>

<p>I wanted to dig into this “liability” piece.</p>

      </h2>
    

<p>What’s the biggest risk in hiring?</p>

<p>It’s <em>the risk of a bad hire</em>.</p>

<p>How much does it cost to make a bad hire?</p>

<p>I would conservatively estimate that it costs $100,000 and nine months of your life. Here’s how the math works from a hiring manager’s point of view:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Spend a month and 25 hours of labor dev team manager labor to find/interview the candidate(s) and winnow the applicants down to someone to make an offer.  (the hiring manager would prefer to be doing <em>literally anything else but hiring</em>.)</li>
  <li>Extend an offer, wait 2-6 more weeks before the new candidate starts. It can be painful to wait another six weeks, because the team is currently short-staffed, and has been for a long time. That’s why they’re hiring!</li>
  <li>Start date! Start paying $150,000/yr or $3000/week for your shiny new employee.</li>
  <li>Pay $12,000 for the first month of them working, figuring out your dev environment, ticket management, who knows what parts of the codebase, and a few easy bug fixes.</li>
  <li>Start getting nervous. Employee not batting it out of the park like you’d hoped. Maybe still onboarding, give it another month (and $12,000 in payroll expense).</li>
  <li>OK. Three months in and another $36,000 in payroll later, you’re pretty sure there’s a problem.</li>
  <li>Start the pre-Performance Improvement Plan work. Talk to their team, their manager, them. Why is it not working? Why is the team <em>working slower</em> with this new team member, instead of working faster? <em>Not only are you wasting five figures of payroll, the rest of your expensive dev team is producing less as well!</em></li>
  <li>Pre-PIP work is over. Another $5k in payroll gone forever. Now it’s time to give the formal PIP, which everyone knows is “beginning the firing process”</li>
  <li>Two more months and $24,000 in payroll later, you fire the employee.</li>
  <li>You feel relief with having gotten rid of the bad employee. You’re thrilled that you can get back to normal work.</li>
  <li>Check the clock and balance sheet. It took you nine months and $100k to get to where you were at step 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>Add up the time/expense:</p>

<ol>
  <li>1-2 months to to find/hire a candidate.</li>
  <li>7-8 months (and $84K-$96k) to hire, trial them, try to help them be successful, give up on that plan, and fire them.</li>
  <li>Many hours spent thinking about this specific problem, talking with others about it.</li>
</ol>

<p>There’s nine months of your life. That’s 9 months of time, sure, but it’s also 9 months of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity cost</a>. What if you’d hired a great candidate? They’d be rapidly approaching their first year on the job, and everyone would be happy about it, instead of this disaster you’ve had to deal with.</p>

<p>Here’s the really scary part: To large organizations (1000+ employees), <em>wasting $100k is meaningless compared to the wasted time and mis-directed effort</em>. The entire organization is more annoyed at having <em>lost the time of a productive software developer</em>. They don’t care that they lit a giant pile of money on fire, <em>they’re annoyed that their competitor is getting new features out the door and gaining marketshare and the future of their $x,000,000 company hangs in the balance</em>.</p>

<p>Oh, and the good managers, not only do they want to be wise with money and build features/gain market-share…</p>

<p>They want to see their team flourish.</p>

<p>Being fired is a life-defining moment. (I speak from experience)</p>

<p>If you’re a kind and empathetic person, <em>it’s particularly unpleasent to fire someone and it feels like a personal failure</em>.</p>

<p>You want to work for a kind and empathetic manager. (They’re not common, but they’re not impossible to find.)</p>

<p>So, tailor your letter to speak to the concerns of a kind and empathetic manager. This manager would:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Want to see you do well</li>
  <li>Want to see you develop your skills and competencies</li>
  <li>Want you to make meaningful contributions to the product</li>
  <li>Want a healthy team dynamic</li>
  <li>Want you to voice concerns and observations as relevant</li>
</ul>

<p>And much more</p>

          A Primary-goal for an early-career software developer: Telegraph Low Liability <a href="#a-primary-goal-for-an-early-career-software-developer-telegraph-low-liability">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>First, when I say <code>telegraph low liability</code> I mean it in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphing_(sports)">sports definition</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In sporting terminology, to <strong>telegraph</strong> is to unintentionally alert an opponent to one’s immediate situation or intentions. The sporting use of the term <em>telegraph</em> draws a direct comparison with the communication device of the same name. “Telegraphing” always refers to a reflexive physical action rather than a protracted or intellectual give-away. For example, a boxer rotating his shoulders to throw a hook would be telegraphing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should aim to “telegraph” that you’re a low-liability hire <em>without ever saying it so explicitely</em>. It’s a subtle thing, best communicated incidentally, not directly.</p>

<p>Five years ago, I wrote <a href="https://josh.works/so-you-want-to-work-remotely">So you want to work remotely…</a></p>

<p>Quoting myself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, there’s the matter of framing how you go about working remotely. Obviously you want to work remotely, but put yourself in the shoes of a prospective employer. They don’t care if you work remotely or not - they want you to do great work for them and make them an effective, profitable organization.</p>

  <p>Companies that hire remotely tend to be younger, agile-er, and smaller. So every employee matters. Making a bad hire can be catastrophic in terms of money and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity cost</a>. Your job is to make it very, very obvious that hiring YOU is a great decision. In fact, you want to be so good at what you do that passing up on you is a terrible decision.</p>

  <p>[…]</p>

  <p>When you can walk someone down the path from “Hire me” to “I’ll help you make <code>$x00,000/year</code> more than you would otherwise”, <em>you’re talking their language</em>. You’re <em>telegraphing</em> that you understand their concerns without ever stating their concern explicitly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To bring it full circle, here’s how I would go about <em>drafting</em> a CEO’s Letter of Recommendation <em>for me</em>. If you find this idea uncomfortable, don’t worry about it. That’s a sign of psychological health, that you don’t love putting flattering words <em>about yourself</em> into other people’s mouths.</p>
      
    

<p>Normally, that’s a good aversion to have. For this particular situation, you’ll have to bite the bullet and move on. I’m not going to give you the actual words (how could I?) but I’ll explain my process. I’ll include comments throughout:</p>
      <h3 id="1-draft-the-openingclosing">
        
        
          1. Draft the opening/closing <a href="#1-draft-the-openingclosing">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<div><div><pre><code>Hi there,         
# I find it easier to strike a natural tone when thinking relatively
# informally. So, I draft documents, even if they'll end up being 
# formal, informally. 
             
             
Sincerely, 
- Boss's name, Title, Company
# Yes, I write the closing right after the opening.
</code></pre></div></div>
      <h3 id="2-provide-1-general-introductioncontext-sentence">
        
        
          2. Provide 1 general introduction/context sentence <a href="#2-provide-1-general-introductioncontext-sentence">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<div><div><pre><code>Hi there,

# Establish the relationship. This helps readers contextualize 
# what comes next
I met {person I am recommending} {n months ago} because 
 {internship|coffee meeting|event|etc}.

</code></pre></div></div>
      <h3 id="3-say-a-complementary-thing-about-yourself">
        
        
          3. Say a complementary thing about yourself <a href="#3-say-a-complementary-thing-about-yourself">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>This is the first uncomfortable sentence you’ll have to write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Hi there,

I met {Zaniyah} {a few months ago} because {she and I crossed paths
at a local Ruby meetup}.

# No gushing required. A claim of "I would hire this 
# person if I could" is plenty strong social signaling. 
I wish I could hire them myself, but don't have the budget and work
lined up to utilize them to their full potential. 

Sincerely,
- Boss's name, Title, Company
</code></pre></div></div>
      
    

<p>This can be hard to think of an anecdote. It might take a few attempts to feel good about the one you’ve chosen and how you speak of it. Just write something down, see how you feel, delete it, write something else down, etc.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Hi there,

I met {Zaniyah} {a few months ago} because {she and I crossed paths 
at a local Ruby meetup}.

# add a punchy positive story
When she started at {company}, one of the first things she did was 
make many updates to our onboarding documentation. 

It was rather out-of-date, and the team hadn't had new hires in a 
while. 

Any time she ran into friction or trouble, she would hunt down the 
answer, and immediately update the documentation so the next 
person would have a smoother process.

Sure enough, the next hire spent half the time she …</code></pre></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><code>API</code> is the acronym for Application Programming Interface which defines interactions between multiple software architecture layers. Programmers carry out complex tasks easily using APIs in software development. Without APIs, a programmer's life would have been miserable with no proper(security, for example) access to data,  knowing unnecessary low level details etc.</p>
<p>When it comes to Web APIs, there are extremely useful  objects, properties and functions available to perform tasks as minor as accessing DOM to as complex as managing audios, videos, graphics, etc. </p>

<p>If you are from the web development background, you are using many of them already. Here is the list of very well known web APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">Canvas</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">Fetch</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API">History</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API">Geolocation</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console_API">Console</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API">Drag &amp; Drop API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, I am going to talk about 10 more web APIs that are not so popular. Lesser popular doesn't mean, they are not useful. You can use them in various use-cases of your project. Please have a look.</p>

<p>If you would like to jump into the source code or see the demonstration immediately, here are the quick links to them:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/atapas/demolab/tree/master/code/src/demos/web-apis">Link to the Source Code @GitHub</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://demo.greenroots.info/categories/web-apis/">Link to the Web API DemoLab</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: Web APIs are nothing but the interfaces, functions, objects, properties written and exposed using vanilla JavaScript. However the usage of the web APIs is not limited to the vanilla JavaScript based application alone. It is very straightforward to use them with an Angular, React or Vue based applications as well.</p>
<p>All the examples I have used to demonstrate the web apis in this article are written using reactjs. You can find them in the github link mentioned above. Please feel free to fork, change and use!</p>

<p>A big (pain) point about  using a web API is, most of them are not standardized yet. It means, the support for a web API  may differ from one browser vendor to another. For example, You may find an API working with the Chrome browser but, not supported by Firefox or Edge browsers yet.</p>
<p>I would suggest a couple of ways to have a check on this,</p>


<p>Alright, time to get started knowing them. Hope you also find these useful.</p>
<h2 id="1-fullscreen-api">1. 📺 Fullscreen API</h2>
<p>Do you have the need to show any of the DOM elements in full-screen mode? The full-screen use-case is very demanding for gaming applications, online video platforms(like, youtube) etc. </p>
<p>The <code>Fullscreen API</code> provides methods to present a specific Element (and its children) in a full-screen mode. There is a method available to exit full-screen mode once it is no longer needed. Not only that, this API can also help to perform any actions when a DOM element transition into a full-screen mode or comes out of it.</p>
<p>In the example below, my favorite Santa Claus can get into the full-screen mode and come out of it with ease.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598715764074/fR7trCfsA.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="full_screen.gif"></p>
<p>In the code below, the <code>manageFullScreen()</code> function uses  the <code>requestFullscreen()</code> API on an element which is having an id called, <code>fs_id</code>. </p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> manageFullscreen = () =&gt; {
   <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'fs_id'</span>).requestFullscreen();
}
</code></pre>
<p>This element with id, <code>fs_id</code> is a <code>DIV</code> with a child element, i.e, the Santa Clause image.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div className=<span>"column"</span>&gt;
  <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>"fs_id"</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>Img</span> <span>fixed</span>=<span>{imageData.image.childImageSharp.fixed}</span> <span>alt</span>=<span>"santa"</span> /&gt;</span>
   <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;<span>StyledButton</span> 
         <span>onClick</span>=<span>{manageFullscreen}</span>&gt;</span>
            Enter Fullscreen with Santa
    <span>&lt;/<span>StyledButton</span>&gt;</span>
 <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can check if the <code>Fullscreen API</code> is supported by the browser,</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (<span>document</span>.fullscreenEnabled) {
   setSupported(<span>true</span>);
} <span>else</span> {
   setSupported(<span>false</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Also watch out for the useful handlers like,</p>
<ul>
<li><code>onfullscreenchange</code>: An event handler for the fullscreenchange event.</li>
<li><code>onfullscreenerror</code>: An event handler for the fullscreenerror event.</li>
</ul>

<p>What is a clipboard in comuping?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The clipboard is a buffer that some operating systems provide for short-term storage and transfer within and between application programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are mainly three operations you can perform with the clipboard. They are, <code>copy</code>, <code>cut</code> and <code>paste</code>. The Clipboard API provides the ability to respond to these three operations. </p>
<p>Interestingly, copying content to the clipboard is open as in, there is no need of a user permission. However, for pasting the content from the clipboard to the user application, the user needs to grant permission for it. It is achieved using another web API called, <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API">Permission API</a></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598716493747/PwPwDDK8Y.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Here is a simple example of the copy-paste operation,</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598716547383/PoXUNZmnr.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="clip_board.gif"></p>
<p>This is how to check if the feature is supported by the browser,</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (navigator.clipboard 
     &amp;&amp; navigator.clipboard.read 
     &amp;&amp; navigator.clipboard.write) {
   setSupported(<span>true</span>);
} <span>else</span> {
   setSupported(<span>false</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the async API function for writing the content to the clipboard,</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>performCopy</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
   event.preventDefault();
   <span>try</span> {
      <span>await</span> navigator.clipboard.writeText(copyText);
      <span>console</span>.log(<span>`<span>${copyText}</span> copied to clipboard`</span>);
   } <span>catch</span> (err) {
      <span>console</span>.error(<span>'Failed to copy: '</span>, err);
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The Async API function to read the content from the clipboard and do something with it,</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>performPaste</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
   event.preventDefault();
   <span>try</span> {
       <span>const</span> text = <span>await</span> navigator.clipboard.readText();
       setPastetext(text);
       <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Pasted content: '</span>, text);
   } <span>catch</span> (err) {
      <span>console</span>.error(<span>'Failed to read clipboard contents: '</span>, err);
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note: With the inclusion of the <code>Clipboard Async API</code>, you can get rid of the usage of <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand">document.execCommad()</a> function as it is obsolete now.</p>

<h2 id="3-resize-observer-api">3. 🧐 Resize Observer API</h2>
<p>Do you want to take some actions based on the changes to the content or border box of a DOM element? Are you thinking of writing a handler by yourself? What if I tell you, there is already one provided by the web API implementation?</p>
<p>Here is a story about a dumb button. We use a range slider to resize the button. While the button gets resized, we also want to control the text color, without letting the button know much about it. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717277220/dITL6Nog2.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="resizer.gif"></p>
<p>First, create a button and specify an id so that, we can access the button later using the id.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;StyledButton id=<span>"dumbBtnId"</span>&gt;
   I am a Dumb Button
&lt;<span>/StyledButton&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now we create a slider using the <code>range</code> input type from HTML5. A <code>resize()</code> function is invoked when the slider value changes.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
   <span><span>&lt;<span>input</span> 
         <span>onChange</span>=<span>{(event)</span> =&gt;</span> resize(event)} 
         type="range" 
         min={minRange} 
         max={maxRange} 
         defaultValue={rangeValue} /&gt;
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>resize()</code> function simply sets the width of the button as the slider range value so that, it can be resized dynamically.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> resize = event =&gt; {
   <span>const</span> value = event.target.valueAsNumber;
   setRangeValue(value);
   <span>let</span> dumbBtn = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'dumbBtnId'</span>);
   dumbBtn.style.width = <span>`<span>${value}</span>px`</span>;
 }
</code></pre>
<p>So far, so good? Now for every range value change, the button gets resized. We have a <code>ResizeObserver</code> observing this change and change the color of the button text.</p>
<pre><code>useEffect(() =&gt; {
   <span>try</span> {
            <span>let</span> dumbBtn = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'dumbBtnId'</span>);
            <span>var</span> resizeObserver = <span>new</span> ResizeObserver(entries =&gt; {
                <span>for</span>(<span>const</span> entry <span>of</span> entries) {
                    
                    
                   entry.target.style.color = <span>'green`;
                }
      });
      resizeObserver.observe(dumbBtn);
   } catch(e) {
            setSupported(false);
            console.log(e);      
   }
}, [rangeValue]);</span>
</code></pre>

<h2 id="4-image-capture-api">4. 📷 Image Capture API</h2>
<p>There are some cool and useful APIs around user media like, audio, video etc. I love the <code>Image Capture API</code> which helps us to capture an image or grab a frame from the video devices(like webcam). Not only that, you can also perform actions on capturing an image or grabbing a frame.</p>
<p>First, get the user media access. In this case we are getting the webcam access.</p>
<pre><code>navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({video: <span>true</span>})
  .then(mediaStream =&gt; {
     <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'video'</span>).srcObject = mediaStream;
     <span>const</span> track = mediaStream.getVideoTracks()[<span>0</span>];
     setTrack(track);
  }).catch(error =&gt; {
     <span>console</span>.error(<span>` <span>${error}</span> is not yet supported`</span>);
     setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>Just like the clipboard paste operation, a webcam media access permission has to be granted by the user.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717565379/MCRNY49Tl.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Now Grab a frame and do something. In this example, I am just drawing the frame on a Canvas.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> imageCapture = <span>new</span> ImageCapture(track);
    imageCapture.grabFrame()
      .then(imageBitmap =&gt; {
          <span>const</span> canvas = <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'#grabFrameCanvas'</span>);
          drawCanvas(canvas, imageBitmap);
    }).catch(error =&gt; {
          <span>console</span>.log(error);
          setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>I can also take a picture and do the similar thing.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> imageCapture = <span>new</span> ImageCapture(track);
    imageCapture.takePhoto().then(blob =&gt; createImageBitmap(blob))
      .then(imageBitmap =&gt; {
          <span>const</span> canvas = <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'#takePhotoCanvas'</span>);
          drawCanvas(canvas, imageBitmap);
    }).catch(error =&gt; {
          <span>console</span>.log(error);
          setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>To stop the video streaming from the webcam, just call he method <code>stop()</code> on the running video track.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> videoOff = () =&gt; {
   track.stop();
 }
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717833234/MPOxVZ92M.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="chrome_Umvi16wUlu.png"></p>
<p>Also watch out for the methods,</p>
<ul>
<li><code>getPhotoCapabilities()</code>: To get the ranges of available configuration options.</li>
<li><code>getPhotoSettings()</code>: To get the current photo configuration settings.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5-broadcast-channel-api">5. 📡 Broadcast Channel API</h2>
<p>The <code>Broadcast Channel API</code> allows communication between browsing contexts (windows, tabs, iframes) and workers on the <strong>same origin</strong>. Think of a use-case like, once you logout from an app running in a browser tab, you want to broadcast it to the app instances opened in other tabs of the same browser.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>8 months ago, but it feels like years ago, somebody shared a link to broot <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21998638">on Hacker News</a>. There was some very kind messages and broot gained a few users. But I had more in my TODO list.</p>
<p>A lot was done since.</p>
<p>At first sight, <a href="https://dystroy.org/broot">broot</a> didn't change much:
It looks the same and what could be done then can still be done the same way, 500 commits and 60 releases later.</p>
<h2 id="you-can-still-explore-the-same-way">You can still explore the same way</h2>
<p>Broot still shows you an overview of directories, even huge ones, and lets you navigate and understand the structure.</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/old_broot-overview.png" alt="old_broot-overview"></p>
<h2 id="you-can-search-and-open-the-same-way">You can search and open the same way</h2>
<p>You search with a few keystrokes, navigate, hit <kbd>enter</kbd> on a directory to focus it, or <kbd>alt</kbd><kbd>enter</kbd> to <code>cd</code> to it.</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/old_broot-search.png" alt="old_broot-search"></p>
<p>You hit <kbd>enter</kbd> on a file to ask the system to open it, or a <kbd>space</kbd>, a <kbd>e</kbd> then <kbd>enter</kbd> to edit it in your favorite editor.</p>
<h2 id="you-can-manipulate-files-the-same-way">You can manipulate files the same way</h2>
<p>You do the standard manipulations like <code>rm</code>, <code>mv</code>, <code>cp</code>, <code>chmod</code>, etc. with just a space or a colon followed by the name of the verb and some arguments if necessary.</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/old_broot-cp.png" alt="old_broot-cp"></p>
<p>(here, after having selected my <code>deploy.sh</code> file with <code>sh</code>, I copy it into <code>preview.sh</code>)</p>

<h2 id="exploration-got-buffed">Exploration got buffed</h2>
<p>New data are available, for example the last modified dates and sizes which are deeply computed on directories (in background) and can be used for sorting.</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/new_broot-explore.png" alt="new_broot-explore"></p>
<p>And there's a preview now.</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/preview-text.png" alt="preview-text"></p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/preview-image.png" alt="preview-image"></p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/preview-binary.png" alt="preview-binary"></p>
<h2 id="searching-and-opening-got-buffed-too">Searching and opening got buffed too</h2>
<p>You can search on paths (not just filenames); or on file contents by prefixing your pattern with <code>c/</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/content-search.png" alt="content-search"></p>
<p>If you hit <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>→</kbd>, which opens the preview, you see the matches in the file:</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/content-search-with-preview.png" alt="content-search-with-preview"></p>
<p>And from here you can navigate to the selected match, and maybe open the file on that line in your editor. A typical search process is described <a href="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-c-search/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Just like for filtering on file names, content search results are updated while you type. And the search syntax lets you <a href="https://dystroy.org/broot/input/#the-filtering-pattern">combine searches</a>, for example you may find files containing both "foo" and "bar", but not the txt files, with <code>c/foo&amp;c/bar&amp;!/txt$/</code>.</p>
<p>Regarding file opening, the most requested feature was the ability to be back in broot when quitting vi or another terminal editor. This is now available.</p>
<h2 id="operations-on-files-got-buffed-too">Operations on files got buffed too</h2>
<p>The most visible change is the ability to open several panels, for example for operations involving two locations, like a move or copy:</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/cpp.png" alt="cpp"></p>
<p>Now I have to confess something: I expected probably too much from this feature. While it works and doesn't seem to have problems it turns out I don't use it much. It was probably less important for easier file operations than less visible features like tab completion. I don't know yet if I was blinded by my fond remembrance of Norton Commander (back in the days of Windows 3.1) or if there's something that should be improved. I'll probably have to think about this more and I'm curious of the opinion of experienced broot users.</p>
<p>Customization of verbs and their keyboard shortcuts was also improved, allowing richer actions, like opening sub terminals or launching non trivial external applications.</p>

<p>Most of the initial technical choices were probably right.</p>
<p>My enthusiam for Rust only grew during this time and I'm not sure I could have as easily done so many big refactorings with another language, especially as broot being a "side project" I didn't have it fully in head 100% of the time.
Having whole categories of bugs prevented by the language is a huge relief.</p>
<p>The biggest internal change was the replacement of <a href="https://github.com/redox-os/termion">Termion</a> with <a href="https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm">Crossterm</a>.</p>
<p>Termion is obvious, concise, simple to use. It's still a good solution for a small linux utility. But it's limited and binding; its design makes features like skinning an application very difficult. And, at the time of the switch at least, it wasn't maintained and major bugs weren't handled.
Crossterm on the other hand, while intrinsically more complex, was more powerful.
Its main maintainers tackled the hard work of building a real cross-platform terminal IO library, which involves dealing with an incredible number of small discrepancies.
This choice allowed me to distribute broot on Mac and Windows and not just Linux.</p>
<p>I also introduced more concurrency, to make computations parallel and not block the interface.</p>
<p>Rust makes concurrency harder. You have to go to some length to do that properly, you can't just share a pointer and hope everything will be fine. It also makes it safer.
"Fearless concurrency" means you won't spend hours trying to guess all the ways your parallel computation could get unlucky. I found <a href="https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam">Crossbeam</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon">rayon</a> very useful basic bricks for building parallelims in broot.</p>

<p>In the last 8 months, I probably didn't spend one hour on a computer without using broot, I'm convinced it's a very useful tool which has no equivalent.</p>
<p>Using broot all the time made my TODO list grow to more than 600 lines (down to about 400 lines now). But there's nothing major anymore on it, nothing I feel essential, broot feels complete for me.</p>
<p>Right now what I'd like for broot is to find users, and with some luck some of those users will tell me how they use it which would fuel my reflection.</p>

                    <p><em>Christophe Pere is a senior NLP researcher and a Deepflow advisor. His post was originally published on <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-google-api-vision-and-how-to-use-it-372a83e6d02c">Medium</a>. Cover picture by <a href="https://www.pexels.com/fr-fr/photo/personne-gens-femme-retro-3769697/">Andrea Piacquadio</a></em></p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>This post finds his root in an interesting project about knowledge extraction, which first step was to extract the text from PDF documents. As I work for a company that operating on the Google platform I naturally wanted to experiment with the OCR functionality included with the Google API Vision. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a straightforward way to use the API in order to extract text from images. I wrote this post as an introductory guide to Google API Vision and how to use it for your own projects.</p><blockquote>The notebook for this post is available on <a href="https://github.com/Christophe-pere/API_vision_google" rel="noopener nofollow">GitHub</a></blockquote><h2 id="google-api-vision">Google API Vision</h2><p>Google released the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision" rel="noopener nofollow">API</a> to help people, industry, and researchers to use their functionalities.</p><blockquote>Google Cloud's Vision API has powerful machine learning models pre-trained through REST and RPC APIs. Tag images and quickly organize them into millions of predefined categories. You will be able to detect objects and faces, read printed or handwritten text, and integrate useful metadata into your image catalog. (source: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision" rel="noopener nofollow">API Vision</a>)</blockquote><p>The part of the API that interested us for this post is the OCR part.</p><h2 id="ocr">OCR</h2><p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/ocr" rel="noopener nofollow">Optical Character Recognition</a> or OCR is a technology where characters are recognized and detected inside an image. Most of the time Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are trained on a very large dataset of characters and numbers in different types and colors. You can imagine a small window slicing on each pixel or group of pixels to detect characters or partial characters, spaces, forms, lines etc.</p><h2 id="service-account">Service Account</h2><blockquote>A service account is a special type of Google account intended to represent a non-human user that needs to authenticate and be authorized to access data in Google APIs. (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts" rel="noopener nofollow">source: IAM google cloud</a>)</blockquote><p>Basically you can imagine it as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)" rel="noopener nofollow">RSA </a>key (encrypted key to communicate with high security between machine via the internet) with which you can connect to Google services (API, GCS, IAM…). Its basic form is a <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html" rel="noopener nofollow">json </a>file.</p><h2 id="notebook">Notebook</h2><p>Here, I will show you the different functions to use the API and extract the text from the image automatically.</p><p>Libraries needed to be installed:</p><pre><code>!pip install google-cloud
!pip install google-cloud-storage
!pip install google-cloud-pubsub
!pip install google-cloud-vision
!pip install pdf2image
!pip install google-api-python-client
!pip install google-auth</code></pre><p>The libraries used:</p><pre><code>from pdf2image import convert_from_bytes

# to see a progress bar
tqdm().pandas()</code></pre><p>The OCR can take pdf, tiff and jpeg formats to be used in the API.In this post we will convert the pdf into jpeg to concatenate many pages in one picture. Two manners of using jpeg:</p><p>First, you could convert your <em>pdf </em>in <em>jpeg </em>files and save them into another repository:</p><pre><code># Name files where the pdf are and where you want to save the results
NAME_INPUT_FOLDER = "PDF FOLDER NAME"
NAME_OUTPUT_FOLDER= "RESULT TEXTS FOLDER"list_pdf = glob.glob(NAME_INPUT_FOLDER+"/*.pdf") # stock the name of the pdf files # Loop over all the files
for i in list_pdf:
        # convert the pdf into jpeg
        pages = convert_from_path(i, 500)
        
        for page in tqdm(enumerate(pages)):
            # save each page into jpeg 
            page[1].save(NAME_OUTPUT_FOLDER+"/"+i.split('/')[-1].split('.')[0]+'_'+str(page[0])+'.jpg', 'JPEG') # keep the name of the document and add increment </code></pre><p>Here, you can use your jpeg document with the API. But, you can do it better without saving the <em>jpeg </em>file and use it in memory to call the API directly.</p><h2 id="setup-credentials">Setup Credentials</h2><p>Before going deeper we need to configure the credentials of the Vision API. You’ll see, it’s very simple:</p><pre><code>SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-vision']
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = "PUT the PATH of YOUR SERVICE ACCOUNT JSON FILE HERE"# Configure the google credentials
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
        SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE, scopes=SCOPES)</code></pre><h2 id="picture-manipulations">Picture manipulations</h2><p>This needed more code because we also concatenate 10 pages of documents to create a “big picture” and feed it to the API. One call versus 10 is better for the price because you’ll pay each time you’ll request the API.</p><p>Let’s go:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>With these two functions, you’ll be able to load a pdf file, convert it into bytes, create a “big picture” and feed it to the function <strong><em>detect_text_document() </em></strong>(details below).</p><p>The function <strong><em>detect_text_document </em></strong>takes in input the content of the pictures and the credentials (information of your service account).</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The output is a text extracted from the images. The goal of this function is to concatenate words into paragraphs and documents.</p><h2 id="how-to-use-it">How to use it?</h2><p>You can use this block of functions like this:</p><pre><code>for doc_pdf in tqdm(list_pdf):        # call the function which convert into jpeg, stack 10 images
        # and call the API, save the output into txt file 
        concat_file_ocr(doc_pdf)</code></pre><p>The input is just the path obtained with the <em>glob </em>function. The credentials were generated in the <strong><em>Setup Credentials</em></strong> part. This loop will take each pdf of the input files, call the API with a jpeg file obtained by converting the pdf and save text files containing the detection.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Here, you reach the end of the tutorial on how to use the Vision API and generate text files containing the detection automatically. You know how to configure credentials with your service account and convert a pdf into a jpeg file (one jpeg per page). Is it all? No, I have some bonuses for you (see below).</p><h2 id="bonus-1-use-the-api-per-page">Bonus 1: Use the API per page</h2><p>The previous functions allow you to use the API with the concatenation of pages. But, we can use the API per page of the pdf document. The function below will request the API for each page of the convert pdf into a <em>jpeg </em>format.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>It’s very easy to use it, just call this function with the path of the pdf folder and the credentials. Like this:</p><pre><code>if per_page: # option True if you want to use per page
    # call the API vision per page of the pdf
    for i in tqdm(list_pdf):
        # open the pdf and convert it into a PlImage format jpeg
        call_ocr_save_txt(i, cred=credentials)</code></pre><h2 id="bonus-2-use-multiprocessing-library">Bonus 2: Use multiprocessing library</h2><p>Just for fun, you can use this API with multiprocessing (ok it’s not real multiprocessing in python with the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)). But, here the code:</p><pre><code>if multi_proc:
    nb_threads = mp.cpu_count() # return the number of CPU
    print(f"The number of available CPU is {nb_threads}")
        # if you want to use the API without stacking the pages
    if per_page:
        # create threads corresponding to the number specified
        pool = mp.Pool(processes=nb_threads)    
        # map the function with part of the list for each thread
        result = pool.map(call_ocr_save_txt, list_pdf) 
        
    if per_document:
        pool = mp.Pool(processes=nb_threads) 
        result = pool.map(concat_file_ocr, list_pdf)</code></pre>

It's an embarrassing question for both parties, but especially frustrating for the forgetful one. With all the information we take in on a daily basis, these little lapses are irritating but inevitable, right? Maybe not.&nbsp;</p>  <p>While it's unlikely that you can remember every day crystal clearly (like those who have HSAM, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/features/total-recall-some-people-can-remember-every-day-like-it-was-yesterday" target="_blank"><u>Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory</u></a>), there are strategies for improving memory retention outside of <a href="https://gem.cbc.ca/media/the-passionate-eye/season-1/episode-102/38e815a-00dc9c2fa63" target="_blank"><u>fighting memory loss</u></a> associated with aging. We asked <a href="http://www.artdelamemoire.org/in-english" target="_blank"><u>Francis Blondin</u></a>, two-time Canadian Memory Champion and board member of the <a href="http://canadianmindsports.com/" target="_blank"><u>Canadian Mind Sports Association</u></a>, for his insight on the different kinds of memory and where we might be able to focus our brain building efforts.</p>  <p><strong>Natural vs. trained memory</strong></p>  <p>Blondin highlights the distinction between "memory as a natural ability that we all possess to varying degrees, versus memorization, as a skill that you can learn to get better at." He says, "It's not the same thing, and you can become extremely good at memorizing stuff, even if you happen to be born with below average memory." Though you <em>can</em> improve your natural memory through lifestyle, Blondin says natural memory abilities are largely dependent on your genes. Your trained memory, however, "can be spectacularly improved almost without limits."&nbsp;</p>  <p>"I can spend hours reciting all the thousands of things I have stored in various memory palaces," he says. More on memory palaces later. "When I'm at my peak, I can memorize 100 digits in less than a minute. And yet, I swear that my natural memory is still, to this day, nothing special at all. Just yesterday I ruined my coffee maker by forgetting it on the stove long enough for the plastic handle to melt." So, even if you don't think your natural memory is all that great, there's still a lot you can do.</p>  <p><strong>Types of memory</strong></p>  <p>Blonding took us through the different kinds of memory and their functions.</p>  <p><strong>Implicit and explicit memory</strong></p>  <p><strong>"</strong>Explicit memory is what you can say out loud: 'Newton was an important scientist'" says Blondin. "Implicit is everything else." He offers these examples: "The feeling that you probably should avoid falling off a cliff or putting your hands on a hot stove is a form of implicit memory. So is every ability you've learned to perform, like riding a bike or tying your shoelaces."</p>  <p><strong>Procedural memory</strong></p>  <p>Procedural memory describes a specific kind of implicit memory that includes all the abilities you've developed. Blondin says these include "how to read and write, how to hold a fork and again, how to ride a bike." To better develop these abilities, Blondin points to K. Anders Ericsson's concept of <a href="https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/DeliberatePractice(PsychologicalReview).pdf" target="_blank"><u>deliberate practice</u></a> — focused, systematic practice to optimize performance.</p>  <p><strong>Sensory memory</strong></p>  <p>"That's all the thousands of bits of data that we're perceiving all the time through our senses," says Blondin. "Of this almost-infinite amount of data, 99+ per cent will be forgotten in half a second, but your brain will select a few things that, for various reasons, seem to be worthy of attention." This isn't typically the kind of memory you try to improve, but Blondin offers the example of "people who are passionate about cooking, over time, will develop a more powerful sensory memory for different tastes."</p>  <p><strong>Short-term and working memory</strong></p>  <p>Short-term and working memory are terms often used interchangeably, though the two have complex distinctions that are still being <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3425965/" target="_blank"><u>analyzed</u></a>. In simple terms, working memory can be seen as a pattern or a process, while short-term memory is more focused on duration. "Working memory is what you use in real time to consciously remember something, analyze something or perform an action," Blondin says. Working memory also involves your ability to group data into chunks. Blondin uses the example of learning how to speak French. "At the beginning, saying the word <em>bibliothèque</em> might necessitate most of your working memory capacity." You might need to break the word into multiple chunks: <em>bi - blio - thèque</em>. With time and practice, you'll be able to say a full sentence containing the word <em>bibliothèque</em>, while also thinking about what comes next. "Improving your working memory is like improving your IQ," he says, "it's pretty damn hard. I think it's possible, but it's not something most people should focus on."</p>  <p><strong>Episodic memory</strong></p>  <p>Episodic memory is everything involved in "remembering your life and what happened to you," Blondin says. "Although episodic memory is stored in your brain differently than factual knowledge, there isn't much difference between the tips and tricks I would give to someone hoping to better remember their life."</p>  <p><strong>Semantic memory</strong></p>  <p>Semantic memory covers areas like factual knowledge, words, numbers, concepts and so on. Blondin says, "This is most people's main area of focus when they say they worry about their memory. All the tips I've provided will help tremendously."</p>  <p><strong>Tips for improving your memory</strong></p>  <p><strong>Learn to focus on just one thing at a time (at least for a moment)</strong></p>  <p>"Your ability to concentrate is crucial for memorizing and for most important cognitively-demanding forms of work," Blondin says. "Your ability to focus can be trained and it can be improved. If you're a student and you want to learn and remember a lot, you need to get your cell phone and internet addiction under control. Those quick, 30-second checks of your email are much more damaging to your concentration than you can imagine." Blondin suggests giving yourself at least 15 minutes of uninterrupted focus before taking a short break. "Ideally those short breaks should be for walking around, breathing, chatting with someone or eating," he says, "not for your emails or anything that will keep capturing your attention when you try to go back to work."</p>  <p><strong>Don't just listen or read — test yourself</strong></p>  <p>"To remember something long-term, the two most important concepts you need to know are retrieval practice and spaced repetition," says Blondin. "Retrieval practice is basically just testing yourself. Don't just reread your notes, close your book and see how much you can recall without any aid. That's not just a way to verify what has been remembered, it's also an extremely powerful way to learn. You can read and reread a million books and spend a million years sitting in class, but very little of what you've read and heard will stick if you don't make an effort to actively process and recall the information." Even if your goals aren't academic, Blodin says, "You should still use retrieval practice by asking yourself questions like 'What's my credit card number?' or 'What's the name of that guy again?'".</p>  <p><strong>Spaced repetitions for long-term learning</strong></p>  <p>Spaced repetition is a systematic review system. Blondin says, "On the first day, you review [something] as much as you need to in order to make sure you won't forget it after a few hours. One or two reviews will be enough for that purpose most of the time. Then you review once the following day. Then you start spacing out the reviews." He suggests a three day interim, then seven days, then one month, two months, three months and so on. "Eventually, just two reviews a year can be enough," Blondin believes. "You can become really good at memorizing and at building memory palaces, but you'll still forget most of what you learn if you never review. That's not a problem if you just want to do something once, like a presentation or an exam, but for long-term learning, there's no getting around the fact that you need to review." Blondin also recommends using spaced repetition software (like <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank"><u>Anki</u></a> or <a href="https://quizlet.com/" target="_blank"><u>Quizlet</u></a>) to help you along. Spaced repetition and retrieval practice can be combined to help you "remember amazing amounts of information," says Blondin.</p>  <p><strong>Mnemonics and memory palaces</strong></p>  <p>"There are many things you can learn using just focused attention, direct associations, logic, understanding and your natural memory," Blondin says. "However, there are also a lot of facts, difficult words, names, numbers and concepts that won't easily stick." For those, Blondin suggests using mnemonics, where your brain transforms something difficult to remember into something "your strange brain can remember much more easily."&nbsp;</p>  <p>With names he says, "It's easy enough if I just heard it and it's floating around in my short-term memory, but I'll forget it in a few seconds if I don't make an effort. How can I make this name more memorable?" He suggests adding associations and imagery. The name "Bob", for example, might conjure an image of bobbing for apples. Blondin says, "That quickly improvised image will transform what's initially a bunch of mostly meaningless sounds into something funny and easy to remember." He points to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/24/upshot/an-ancient-and-proven-way-to-improve-memory-go-ahead-and-try-it.html" target="_blank"><u>New York Times article</u></a> that breaks down the process in depth.</p>  <p>Similar in practice, the <a href="https://litemind.com/memory-palace/" target="_blank"><u>memory palace</u></a> technique consists of vividly visualizing an environment you know very well, like your bedroom, and associating information you need to memorize with it (eg. your credit card number is in the sock drawer). Then, when you walk through that environment again in your mind, that information will be in place for you to retrieve.</p>  <p>These tips don't have to be flawless to have the desired effect. "To paraphrase someone else," says Blondin, "memory techniques work even when they don't work. Just the fact that you're paying attention to something and you're playing around with it is enough to drastically improve your odds of remembering."</p>  <p><strong>Lifestyle practices</strong></p>  <p>"Both meditation and physical exercise will help improve your memory and your ability to focus," says Blondin, "but that's just one of at least 50 different reasons why you should start developing those two habits." Blondin suggests that even one minute per day of meditation can have an impact.</p>  <p>"Diet is, of course, very important for all kinds of reasons," notes Blondin, "but as long as you have a relatively healthy diet, I …</p></span></p></div></div>

<p>Somewhere in the depths of my hard drive is a folder named “Archive”. It’s a home for all sorts of files that I no longer need, but can’t quite bring myself to delete. Old homework assignments from high school, revisions 1 through FINISHED-FINAL.doc. MSN chat logs, preserving conversations with people I’ve not spoken to in 10 years. Random low-resolution photos of not very much, shot with the first digital camera my family ever owned. Layers of backup directories piled above the deposits of those before them, poised to restore devices long since sold on eBay. A veritable time capsule of my digital life.</p>
<p>Not something I pry open the lid on very often, but lockdown-induced nostalgia enticed me to visit again a few weeks ago. I was in search of the roots of my journey in programming. I found them inside a dormant virtual machine, the ghostly continuation of an old family computer that I had immortalised in .vmdk form.</p>
<p>Firing up VirtualBox, I went digging.</p>
<p><a href="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/MallardBASICBookCover.jpg">
  <img src="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/MallardBASICBookCover.jpg" width="220px" alt="Book cover: Mallard BASIC Introduction and Reference" title="Book cover: Mallard BASIC Introduction and Reference">
</a>
</p>
<h2 id="ccd-qbasicbc7">C:&gt;cd QBASIC\BC7</h2>
<p>It all started about 16 years ago. I was already a proficient user of technology in general, as most computer game-obsessed teenagers are wont to be. My initial motivation for skilling up was quite simple, albeit ambitious: I wanted to be able to “hack” a certain online game. Luckily, I wasn’t expecting quick results and soon lost sight of this nefarious goal to discover the joy of programming as something in itself.</p>
<p>My Grandad had on several occasions previously attempted to enthuse me in the subject, to no avail. Now, excited that I was finally displaying interest of my own accord, he provided me with a floppy disk containing QBasic 1.1 and a manual for Mallard BASIC. I started at page 1 and worked my way through the book — as far as the difference in dialect between QBasic and Mallard BASIC would allow, anyway.</p>
<h3 id="first-step-into-a-larger-world">First step into a larger world</h3>
<p>Safe to say, it took me a while to get enough of a hang of things before I could really begin to translate ideas from my imagination onto screen. The first game I created was Asterix[sic] 9. It was probably also my first “substantial” program, built with other users in mind, not just for myself.</p>
<p><a href="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/asterix9.bas.gif">
  <img src="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/asterix9.bas.gif" width="640px" alt="Screen capture showing playthrough of Asterix 9, a simple maze puzzle game" title="">
</a>
</p>
<p>Asterix 9 went through many rewrites as I discovered more and more programming concepts. The debut version is written almost as if parodying the worst kind of BASIC program: I had not yet realised that QBasic did not require every line to be numbered (as the Mallard BASIC book would have me believe!), and concepts like arrays, looping, functions, and DRY were still very much unknown to me. The liberal use of GOTOs makes it very spaghetti-esque, not helped by non-existence of human readable labels. Every level of the game is just a copy-and-paste of the previous level with line numbers incremented (this used to take me hours of “refactoring”). It’s truly awful. I’d be lying, however, if I said I didn’t have an absolute blast figuring out how to code it, at the time.</p>
<p>Here is an excerpt of part of the game loop that checks teleportation and collision into one of the “9"s:</p>
<pre><code>4161 IF currx% = 4 AND curry% = 8 AND count1 &lt; 1 THEN GOTO 4550
4162 IF currx% = 14 AND curry% = 18 AND count2 &lt; 1 THEN GOTO 4680
4163 IF currx% = 20 AND curry% = 14 AND count3 &lt; 1 THEN GOTO 5100
4164 IF currx% = 12 AND curry% = 12 AND count4 &lt; 1 THEN GOTO 5230
4165 COLOR 5
4166 IF count1 &lt; 1 THEN LOCATE 4, 8: PRINT CHR$(176)

<h3 id="evolution-via-emulation">Evolution via emulation</h3>
<p>I’ve always had an urge to learn how things work from the ground up, and this endeavour was no different. A lot of my effort was spent exploring how programs that I was familiar with might have been implemented.</p>
<p>As I got the hang of ASCII text manipulation and interacting with devices other than the screen, I created a simple word processor. I had not yet discovered mouse controls, so it was entirely keyboard-driven, including the menu options. It was able to save and load a custom rich text format that included support for different colours (the 16 supported in <code>SCREEN 0</code> mode).</p>
<p>Implementing word wrap in this setting was among my proudest achievements up to this point!</p>

</a>
</p>
<p>I also wrote an “encoder” version that “encrypted” its document, and could load and decrypt documents stored on disk. The only problem was that it used an approximately 6-bit key, which in any event was stored inside the encrypted file — thankfully I know a bit more about security today!</p>

</a>
</p>
<p>These programs were at least several steps up in quality from that first version of Asterix 9. I’d learned that labels weren’t mandatory for every line, and they could be human-readable. I’d also learned a few more control flow patterns and how to use <code>DATA</code> to encode blocks of data outside of the code. Young me still very much could have benefitted from reading Clean Code, however!</p>
<pre><code>TYPE encryption
        enco AS INTEGER
        encryptnu AS INTEGER
        length AS INTEGER
END TYPE
DIM code AS encryption
...
RANDOMIZE TIMER
encrypt = INT(RND * 45) + 3
...
OPEN filename$ FOR RANDOM AS #1 LEN = LEN(code)
code.encryptnu = encrypt
code.length = l
PUT 1, 1, code
</code></pre>
<p>My fascination with wanting to build things from scratch eventually reached its logical conclusion: I wanted to create my own operating system<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>My first attempt at this was named “CharnOS”, based on my internet alias at the time<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Really it was just a window manager, but I didn’t yet know the difference. All the “apps” were full screen and the cursor was operated using arrow keys — I <em>still</em> hadn’t worked out mouse support.</p>
<p><a href="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/charnos.bas.gif">

</a>
</p>

<p>It was around this time that I found <a href="http://www.petesqbsite.com/">Pete’s QBasic Site</a> and the information, forums, and community within. This was a goldmine! I met a few people there and got to know them via MSN. Some of them effectively became my mentors. My rate of learning skyrocketed, and I got my hands on QBasic 7 which included library support for mouse input and the ability to compile to EXE, among other exciting features.</p>
<p>My operating system aspirations continued, now with mouse support. Version 2, renamed to “Nebula”, was the most complete. It featured moveable windows, various types of UI widget, and multi-user support. The visual style was borrowed from an aforementioned mentor’s own creation.</p>
<p><a href="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/nebula1.bas.gif">
  <img src="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/nebula1.bas.gif" width="640px" alt="Screen capture showing logging in to Nebula window manager, and running the jotter text editor app. It's reminiscent of Windows 9x and also very slow." title="">
</a>
</p>
<p>Following this, I began to discover more modern programming languages like C, C++, PHP, and C#. I began to recognise that I’d really hit the limits of QBasic and that my journey would have to continue on more modern platforms. The Win32 API would prove to heavily inspire version 3 of Nebula, which had a slightly more mature look. It got about this far before I abandoned it, and set my sights on other things.</p>
<p><a href="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/nebula2.bas.gif">
  <img src="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/nebula2.bas.gif" width="640px" alt="Screen capture showing Nebula window manager version 3, even more reminiscent of Windows 9x" title="">
</a>
</p>
<p>That said, I would still occasionally dip into QBasic—even years later—for fun graphical demos, like this fire simulation:</p>
<p><a href="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/fire.bas.gif">
  <img src="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/fire.bas.gif" width="480px" alt="Screen capture showing an animation of fire that starts at the bottom of the screen and slowly spreads upwards" title="">
</a>
</p>
<p>When I could make do with VGA graphics, QBasic was still the lowest code-to-pixel barrier of any of the programming languages I knew. And perhaps it still is. In how many other languages is it possible to set up a blank canvas and draw a pixel in literally only two lines of code?</p>
<pre><code>SCREEN 13

<h2 id="qbasic-as-a-learning-experience">QBasic as a learning experience</h2>
<p>If there’s a point to this post beyond self-indulgence, it might be to reflect on how QBasic fared as a learning experience for someone new to programming. I’m not saying we should consider encouraging beginners to take their first steps in <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBox</a>—from which the world had arguably moved on, even at the point when I started—but maybe there are some aspects of the experience that we can learn from.</p>
<p>QBasic was a safe and accessible sandbox for beginner me to explore my creativity within. I’m sure there are modern alternatives that offer similar experiences, I just haven’t been on the lookout for them. It’s impossible for me to exactly re-envisage the perspective that started me on this journey 16 years ago. Sure, I still find coding and solving problems to be fun, but never in <em>quite</em> the same way as I did back then, when everything was new and exciting.</p>
<p>Convenience is a double-edged sword. The QBasic IDE hides a lot of complexity from the programmer. I didn’t need to worry about compiling, or linking, or the command-line in general. Double-clicking QBX.EXE would drop me instantly into the action, ready for me to just start writing and running code. The language itself is also purposefully, well, basic. There’s relatively little “structural syntax”, for lack of a better term, and the IDE even attempts to hide some of that. I think this was beneficial to begin with, but increased the learning curve when I eventually moved on to languages with a <em>lot</em> of structural syntax like C and C#. I still remember being utterly baffled by the arcane incantations of a C “hello, world”: what on Earth does any of <code> void main(int argc, char *argv[])</code> mean?!</p>
<p>These would have been learning curves no matter what, but I feel that delaying them until later meant I was able to make quicker progress. I would have been much less inclined to bash my head against walls like linker errors if I wasn’t already hooked. And of course, even if today’s mainstream languages might have a higher barrier to entry than in the past, this is offset by the convenience of finding help. Tutorials, documentation, books, Stack Overflow: there is so much more support available to beginners now.</p>
<p>What motivated me is certainly not going to apply to everyone. In hindsight, luckily, QBasic worked as my first programming language because it turned out I was motivated by the art of programming in itself, and at the beginning I just wanted to have fun. Had I instead wanted to create a website to share with people, or a mobile game to sell on the App Store, it would …</p></div></div>

<div>
<p>The Rust programming language has become a popular choice amongst software engineers since its release in 2010. Besides being something new and interesting, Rust promised to offer exceptional performance and reliability. In particular, Rust achieves memory-safety and thread-safety through its ownership model. Instead of runtime checks, this safety is assured at compile time by Rust's borrow checker. This prevents undefined behaviour such as dangling pointers!</p>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<div>
<p>I first encountered Rust sometime around 2015 when I was updating my teaching materials on memory management in C. A year later in 2016, I implemented a simple multi-objective evolutionary algorithm in Rust as an academic exercise (available: <a href="https://github.com/shahinrostami/simple_ea">https://github.com/shahinrostami/simple_ea</a>). I didn't have any formal training with Rust, nor did I complete any tutorial series, I just figured things out using the documentation as I progressed through my project.</p>
<p>Some example code from this project takes ZDT1 from its mathematical expression in Equation 1</p><p>
$$
\begin{aligned}
f_1(x_1) &amp;= x_1 \tag{1} \\
f_2(x) &amp;= g \cdot h \\
g(x_2,\ldots,x_{\mathrm{D}}) &amp;= 1 + 9 \cdot \sum_{d=2}^{\mathrm{D}} \frac{x_d}{(D-1)}\\
h(f_1,g) &amp;= 1 - \sqrt{f1/g}
\end{aligned}
$$</p><p>to the Rust implementation below.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<div>
<p>It was interesting to see that since writing this code in 2016, some of my dependencies have been deprecated and replaced.</p>
<p>My greatest challenge was breaking away from what I already knew. Until this point, I was familiar with languages such as C, C++, C#, Java, Python, MATLAB, etc., with the majority of my time spent working with memory managed languages. I found myself resisting Rust's intended usage, and it is still something I'm working on.</p>
<p>Now that I am about to commence my sabbatical from my University post, I've decided to try Rust again. This time, I'm going to write a book which focusses on using Rust and Jupyter Notebooks to implemented algorithms and conducted experiments, most likely in the fields of search, optimisation, and machine learning. Can we write and execute all our code in a Jupyter Notebook? Yes! <em>Should</em> we? Probably not. However, I enjoy the workflow, and making this an enjoyable process is important to me.</p>

        <p id="article-description">How to avoid buying your bike again every 6-12
        months and tips for how to apply the same reasoning to other things, like
        computers</p>
        <hr>
        <figure>
            <img src="http://calpaterson.com/assets/solitary-wheel.jpeg" alt="a solitary wheel left behind after the rest of the bike was nicked">
            <figcaption>
                Rucksack Rupert strikes again
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Some very commonly repeated advice on preventing someone from nicking your
        bike:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Buy a good [~10% of bicycle value] lock, ideally one with a high
            "SoldSecure" rating and lock your bicycle somewhere inside the rear
            triangle and the rear wheel.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I've seen this advice repeated in cycling magazines, in quality newspapers,
        sometimes even by the police and of course on internet forums.</p>
        <p>The above would imply that if you own a £400 bicycle (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/395884/bicycle-average-prices-in-the-european-union-eu-by-country/">a
        typical price in the UK</a>) you'd buy a £40 lock and put it in the right
        place.</p>
        <p>However, it is a cold fact that a cordless angle grinder can defeat any
        bicycle lock, no matter how expensive (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pywN558dJaU&amp;t=198">see this video for a
        demonstration</a>). You can buy a used cordless angle grinder on eBay for less
        than £100. Even U-locks - traditionally thought to be the strongest type of
        lock - are opened in seconds with a sub-£100 angle grinder.</p>
        <p>There is other advice floating around of doubtful value, for example:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Add your bicycle to a national register</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>But cases where BikeRadar manage to reunite bicycles with their owners seem
        to be the exception rather than the rule. Probably this is because, as with
        cars, the first thing you do with a stolen bicycle is take it across a border
        to somewhere different.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Lock your bicycle inside a secure building or place, away from sight</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This prevents opportunistic theft but if this space is shared with others
        (apartment blocks and offices) it in fact serves to increase the economies of
        scale for prepared thieves who break into your storage area late at night with
        a van. It's not uncommon for office bicycle stores (with many fancy, expensive
        bikes inside) to be emptied out completely overnight by professional
        thieves.</p>
        <h2>A threat model, by user persona</h2>
        <p>I think the advice above is poor because it doesn't come from a systematic
        consideration of the problem <em>from the point of view of thieves</em>.</p>
        <p>To come up with better advice requires a threat model, which is a piece of
        jargon for taking a holistic view of the danger posed by attackers. I think one
        of the simplest and most straightforward ways to do threat modelling is by
        <em>user persona</em>, whereby you consider each kind of attacker in turn,
        making some reasonable assumptions about their level of motivation and
        methods.</p>
        <p>As far as bicycle theft is concerned there are three basic types of
        thief.</p>
        <h3>"No-tools Nigel", the rank opportunist</h3>
        <p>Nigel has just his two hands and is simply looking for a ride home or maybe
        something he can sell to a friend for some quick cash.</p>
        <p>Nigel will steal any unlocked bicycle.</p>
        <p>Nigel is also able to take any bicycle parts that can be removed without
        tools. That means any quick-release wheels or thumbscrew saddles. In an urban
        area your parked bicycle may be passed by a Nigel as often as a few times an
        hour so anything that is not bolted down won't last very long.</p>
        <h3>"Rucksack Rupert", the thief with a few hand tools</h3>
        <p>Rupert has a small pair of shears; 4, 5 and 6mm Allen keys and a 15mm
        spanner for wheel nuts.</p>
        <p>Rupert will make his way through cable locks with his shears. If there is a
        valuable part that can be removed with hand tools he will take it. He is
        particularly keen on premium saddles and name brand wheels.</p>
        <h3>"Powertool Percy", the professional with a complete set of tools</h3>
        <p>Percy has a small collection of electric and air tools including an angle
        grinder as well as bolt-cutters and an air-jack. He has access to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fence_(criminal)">criminal fences</a> which he
        can use to sell stolen bicycles quickly. Percy often arrives in his van and
        this allows him to steal multiple bikes at once.</p>
        <p>No bicycle is safe from Percy. No lock can hold against his angle grinder.
        Often he finds if he's wearing a hi-vis jacket he can even get away with using
        his power tools in broad daylight. He's willing to chance that if the bicycle
        seems valuable enough.</p>
        <h2>Coming up with better advice based on Nigel, Rupert and Percy</h2>
        <p>In order to keep your bicycle safe you need to take steps against all three
        levels of imaginary thieves.</p>
        <p>"No-tools Nigel" will be warded off simply by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Locking your bicycle whenever you leave it - even if just for a
            minute</li>
            <li>Ensuring you leave nothing on your bicycle that can be removed without
            tools
                <ul>
                    <li>replace quick-release wheel skewers with bolts</li>
                    <li>take your lights with you when you park in public</li>
                    <li>make sure your saddle is not on a thumbscrew</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>"Rucksack Rupert" will be deterred by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Not using a cable lock!</li>
            <li>Making sure that nothing good can be removed from your bicycle with
            hand tools
                <ul>
                    <li>Lock both wheels <em>and the frame</em> to the bike stand -
                    don't rely on bolts</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>"Powertool Percy" will be kept at bay by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nothing, save ensuring that your bicycle doesn't look valuable enough
            to be worth his time
                <ul>
                    <li>this probably means keeping its value down below a few hundred
                    pounds</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The virtue of the "bicycle shaped object"</h2>
        <p>Valuable bicycles (&gt;£1000) have an extremely short half-life in urban
        areas. The sad truth is that the Percys of the world are common enough and
        resourceful enough that a bicycle worth over a thousand pounds isn't really
        safe anywhere in a large town. <strong>This includes most e-bikes.</strong> You
        might notice that cycle couriers who have e-bikes tend to eat lunch while
        looking directly at their locked e-bike, so that it never goes out of their
        sight. Few people in other lines of work can do the same.</p>
        <p>If the tyres are inflated, my own commuter bicycle is probably worth £30 to
        the right buyer. My bicycle is so low-end that cycling snobs refer to it as a
        mere "bicycle shaped object". Rather selfishly I am glad that such snobs exist
        as having a lot of more valuable bicycles around provides me with good ambient
        security. No thief is going to bother cutting my locks when there is a
        Campagnolo on the next rack.</p>
        <p>One father I know had his primary-school-age daughter "decorate" his
        commuting bicycle with girly stickers and pink glitter. If anyone examines his
        bicycle closely he looks like a complete loon but I think his motivation is
        right: it's going to be much less appealing to steal when it's covered in Miffy
        stickers.</p>
        <h3>Insurance - not usually worth it</h3>
        <p>What about bicycle insurance? It's fairly expensive here in the UK, usually
        10-15% of the bicycle's value annually and insurers typically only pay out when
        the whole bicycle is taken (so if if your front wheel is nicked, you're on your
        own) and when you can demonstrate that it was locked to their standards. Often
        these standards require that it is locked up indoors which means you're
        chancing it whenever you park away from your home or office.</p>
        <h2>Lists of "best practices" vs having your own threat model</h2>
        <p>The same thing goes for securing your bicycle as for securing other things:
        pat, concrete pieces of security advice are something to treat with a bit of
        doubt.</p>
        <p>In bicycles the common mantra is "spend 10% on a lock" but in computing the
        mantras are slogans such as "use a strong password", "back up your important
        data" or "use encryption" but these can all be just as vapid.</p>
        <p>"Strong passwords!" as a slogan fails to address the fact that the average
        internet user has hundreds of logins for various sites (my own password manager
        has over 700 sites recorded). The majority of internet users decide on a single
        "strong password" and then use it everywhere. They are only a single bad
        sysadmin or javascript injection away from losing access to every account on
        every website they have.</p>
        <p>Backing up your important data is only an aid to your security if the backup
        is stored as securely as the original. Much user data is stolen or exposed
        through poorly secured backups on shared fileservers. A huge number of people
        have passport and utility bill scans in their Dropbox - again, behind the same
        email and password they use everywhere. Companies can be surprisingly sloppy
        with backups too: often dumped into cloud storage somewhere once before the Big
        Migration and never removed.</p>
        <p>Encryption is troublesome as it can give undue confidence that can backfire
        spectacularly: a quarter of a million American diplomatic cables were
        inadvertantly published in unredacted form when a Guardian journalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks:_Inside_Julian_Assange%27s_War_on_Secrecy">
        included the password for an widely-distributed encrypted file in his book</a>.

            <p>
	"Want to hear the joke about insulin?" goes the bleak gag about America's drug prices. "You have to go to Canada to get it."</p>
<p>
	But even that's not an option anymore.</p>
<p>
	Pandemic travel restrictions have made Americans prisoners of their country. Even within North America, Mexico and Canada have closed thousands of kilometres of border to all but essential travel, roiling plans for vacation, work, and school. For cash-strapped Americans, it has also cut off access to medicines and health-care services that they can't afford at home -- at a time when money is tighter than ever.</p>
<p>
	Stephanie Boland's nine-year-old son was diagnosed with diabetes in December. Travelling to Canada to fill his insulin prescription took a half-day's drive from where they live in Brainerd, Minnesota, but it was worth it -- the purchase was a simple, over-the-counter affair. One pack of injection pens, which would last several months, cost less than a hundred dollars, she says, compared to <a href="https://www.lillypricinginfo.com/humalog" target="_blank">a list price of $530 at home. </a></p>
<p>
	As their son's disease began to rewrite the routines of daily life, the Bolands planned to cross into Canada again to restock. Then the pandemic hit.</p>
<p>
	Boland, a masseuse, was forced to stop working. Her husband, a self-employed financial adviser, found his income hit by pandemic-related turbulence in the markets, too. Then their source for affordable insulin vanished behind <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/19/opinions/canada-us-border-coronavirus-bociurkiw/index.html" target="_blank">a border that had never been closed before</a> in the history of <a href="https://theconversation.com/shuttered-canada-us-border-highlights-different-approaches-to-the-pandemic-and-differences-between-the-2-countries-137848" target="_blank">U.S.-Canada relations</a>.</p>
<p>
	"We were going to make a trip north, one more trip in March, but then they closed the border," she said.</p>
<h3>
	BUYING INSULIN ABROAD</h3>
<p>
	Only 1.5% of American adults who take prescription medications buy their drugs abroad, according to a June analysis by researchers at the University of Florida Gainesville, based on a 2015-2017 National Health Interview Survey.</p>
<p>
	But that's still <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2767592?resultClick=3" target="_blank">an estimated 2.3 million people</a>.</p>
<p>
	Many medicines and medical services are cheaper in neighbouring Canada and Mexico, thanks to price controls and <a href="https://www.oecd.org/mexico/38097348.pdf" target="_blank">the power of the U.S. dollar</a>. The difference is great enough that U.S. insurer PEHP, which covers Utah's state employees, offers partially paid trips to Vancouver and Tijuana "<a href="https://www.pehp.org/pharmacy/tourism" target="_blank">to help you save money on your prescriptions</a>."</p>
<p>
	In popular Mexican resort towns like Cabo San Lucas on the West Coast, or Tulum on the East Coast, pharmacies, doctors and dentists targeting U.S. clientele dot the main drag, their prices on bright display. And the difference between those prices and the costs of the same drugs at U.S. pharmacies can mean life or death.</p>
<p>
	No drug is a better-known example of that calculus than insulin, a vital hormone in the body's metabolism. Seven million American diabetics don't produce it naturally -- or not enough of it -- and need to inject it throughout the day. Without it, dangerous levels of glucose build up in the blood, damaging organs and producing a painful stupor. In a worst case scenario, lack of insulin can kill within three days.</p>
<p>
	Americans have been going to Canada for insulin since scientists learned how to produce it in labs at the University of Toronto in 1921. One of the first patients to try it was an American: Elizabeth Hughes, the teenage daughter of then-U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes.</p>
<p>
	"I'm so happy and elated," <a href="https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/insulin%3AL10111" target="_blank">she wrote</a> in a letter to her mother from Canada, describing her first self-injection and the "enormous" meal she enjoyed afterward. Before crossing the border, the 15-year-old had managed her condition by starving herself -- the only life-prolonging trick available to diabetics before insulin. Five feet tall, she weighed only <a href="https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/insulin%3AW10006" target="_blank">45 pounds.</a></p>
<p>
	A hundred years later, and after <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/08/us/states-passing-bills-insulin-insurance-copay-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">national soul-searching</a> over the soaring cost of insulin, some Americans are still starving themselves. Daniel Carlisle, a Type 1 diabetic in Texas, has sometimes tried not to eat for days at a time, in an attempt to ration insulin. When he was 18 and short on cash, he even contemplated robbing a pharmacy, he says.</p>
<p>
	"I always do the math about how many days' supply of insulin I have in the refrigerator," the 60-year-old Texan says.</p>
<p>
	"That's how I know my lifespan at that point. My lifespan is measured in exactly how many days' worth of insulin I have in hand -- plus three days."</p>
<h3>
	NUEVO PROGRESO</h3>
<p>
	For the past three years, buying insulin in Mexico has brought Carlisle security.</p>
<p>
	His trips started with a split tooth in 2017. "I went to a dentist near where I live, and he said he could repair it for like $10,000," says Carlisle, who is uninsured. "So I told him, 'Look I can't afford to send my kids to Harvard. Sure can't afford to send yours."</p>
<p>
	He tried to ignore his aching tooth, but at the urging of his family, eventually drove several hundred kilometres south from his home in Houston to the busy Mexican town of Nuevo Progreso.</p>
<p>
	"As soon as you come across the bridges, hawkers are saying "Need a dentist? Need a pharmacy? It's just constant," he says. First he got his tooth fixed -- a root canal, bridge and crown altogether would end up costing him just $750. "The dentists aren't marble palaces, but they're clean," he says.</p>
<p>
	Then he dipped into a pharmacy to ask the price of a vial of Humalog insulin, one of two kinds he takes. The answer: US$70. He checked the expiration date on the box, and then offered $20.</p>
<p>
	"You've got to negotiate!" he says. "I just tell them I'll die without it and then they'll lose a customer. They don't put up a fuss."</p>
<p>
	A vial of the same insulin in the U.S. has a list price of $274.70.</p>
<p>
	Since then, that's the only place where he buys insulin, Carlisle says, and he's never had a problem with its quality. But with the borders closed, he doesn't expect be back any time soon.</p>
<h3>
	A VAST GREY AREA</h3>
<p>
	Pharmacy staff in several drugstores in border towns in both Canada and Mexico tell CNN that they've seen significant drops in foot traffic since their countries' borders with the U.S. closed. Though American scofflaws have been accused of crossing into Mexico for nonessential errands, overall border crossings <a href="https://explore.dot.gov/views/BorderCrossingData/Monthly?:embed=y&amp;:isGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:showVizHome=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link" target="_blank">have plummeted</a>.</p>
<p>
	One young man working at a pharmacy near Tijuana told CNN that business had fallen about 40% since the border closed. He asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak about the business.</p>
<p>
	Technically, bringing prescription drugs into the U.S. is illegal. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has created <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.fda.gov_industry_import-2Dbasics_personal-2Dimportation&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=tq9bLrSQ8zIr87VusnUS9yAL0Jw_xnDiPuZjNR4EDIQ&amp;r=rCHQaNbjPpivEAmu6NC2SN5wUrEBtRzWRu-4Q4NII98&amp;m=WQfC6uO0pwOxMMVHYr1M2sV1Imudp8inpPiV52_rqCQ&amp;s=rhQ5OrNJsHfUWt-LO0TyUzEZRLTw60VpuTji1hJpH7k&amp;e=" target="_blank">a grey area</a> for small amounts: Importation "might" be allowed, according to the agency's website, if the medicine doesn't exceed a three month supply.</p>
<p>
	Staff at Mark's Marine Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada, less than an hour's drive from the U.S. border, typically fill hundreds of orders for U.S. customers each day, general manager Jordan Rosenblatt says, and rarely have any problem shipping it. With the borders closed, online ordering has spiked, he adds.</p>
<p>
	Reviews over the years on their Facebook page compare prices of all kinds of prescription drugs to those in the U.S., with commenters from as far as New Jersey and Texas. "They sell and send me my asthma inhalers at a price that is non-predatory, unlike here in the U.S. Happiest gal today! Thank you!" reads one.</p>
<p>
	But ordering online isn't for everyone -- there is always a risk that the medicine will be confiscated or that temperature-sensitive drugs like insulin could go bad waiting at customs or in U.S. Postal Service delays.</p>
<p>
	And as the frustrations of border closures highlight, foreign health systems make a poor fallback no matter how you access them.</p>
<p>
	"For any given individual in the short run, going to Canada is a decent solution, but it's not a systemic solution," says Dr. Vikas Saini, a Harvard-trained cardiologist and president of the<a href="https://lowninstitute.org/" target="_blank"> Lown Institute</a>, a nonpartisan health-care think tank.</p>
<p>
	U.S. President Donald Trump has called to allow larger scale importation from Canada, among <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/22/politics/trump-drug-prices-fact-check/index.html" target="_blank">a raft of recent proposals</a> to reduce the prices of certain U.S. drugs. But that's unlikely to make a dent in the U.S. market, Saini says: "Canada is a country of about 30 million people. It doesn't have enough medication to provide all those prescriptions for the U.S. -- a nation 10 times the size."</p>
<p>
	Some <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/drug-exports-us-1.5236532" target="_blank">Canadian health industry groups</a> and patients agree. Since 2019, they've warned that Trump's importation plan could lead to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/american-demand-canada-drug-supply-1.5226871" target="_blank">drug shortages</a> for Canadians -- a fear likely sharpened after witnessing global shortages of vital medical equipment in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<h3>
	A CRUMBLING ECONOMY</h3>
<p>
	As the pandemic wears on, the options are dwindling for Americans who can't afford to be sick in the United States -- especially after the cratering economy erased<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/07/economy/july-2020-jobs-report/index.html" target="_blank"> nearly 13 million</a> jobs, taking health insurance options with them.</p>
<p>
	Even <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/u-s-canada-drug-prices-1.5552463" target="_blank">at Canadian prices</a>, some are struggling to pay for their prescriptions. "Recently, we're hearing about all the financial issues of people laid off," says Rosenblatt, the Vancouver pharmacy manager. "We have American customers that have been working with us for years, and under these circumstances, we've sent what they needed and we tell them, 'Pay us when you can.'"</p>
<p>
	To make insulin more accessible, some U.S. states have pushed for price caps on copays. The three companies which <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=BasicSearch.process" target="_blank">control the U.S. insulin market</a> offer discount plans, including <a href="https://www.novonordisk-us.com/media/news-releases.html?122988" target="_blank">new programs</a> to which Americans who were financially impacted by the pandemic can apply for temporary access to cheaper or free insulin. And Walmart offers cheap insulin over the counter (though this is an older formulation that can make blood sugar management more complicated than newer, prescription versions.)</p>
<p>
	Yet many are still struggling -- and not just the <a href="https://www.kff.org/uninsured/issue-brief/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/" target="_blank">nearly 28 million Americans</a> who don't have health insurance, a number estimated by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Even Americans with health insurance, who benefit from negotiated prices that are lower than the list prices, sometimes <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/videos/health/2020/04/29/go-there-insulin-high-cost.cnn" target="_blank">still can't afford</a> all the costs of living with diabetes.</p>

<p>In this post, we discuss the risks of the AWS Instance Metadata service in AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters. In particular, we demonstrate that compromising a pod in the cluster can have disastrous consequences on resources in the AWS account if access to the Instance Metadata service is not explicitly blocked.</p>



<hr>




<h2><span id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>



<p>For the purposes of this post, we’ll use an EKS cluster running Kubernetes v1.17.9 and created with <a href="https://eksctl.io/">eksctl</a>. We could also have created the cluster using Terraform or CloudFormation.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">eksctl create cluster \ 
  --nodes 1 \ 
  --name christophe-cluster \ 
  --node-type t3.large</pre>



<p>Once we created the cluster, we can use the AWS CLI to update our kubectl configuration file for us and start interacting with the Kubernetes API right away.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">$ aws eks update-kubeconfig --name christophe-cluster
Added new context arn:aws:eks:eu-central-1:account-id:cluster/christophe-cluster to /home/christophetd/.kube/config</pre>



<h2><span id="It_all_starts_with_a_compromised_Pod8230">It all starts with a compromised Pod…</span></h2>



<p>Let’s assume an attacker compromised a pod in the cluster, for instance by exploiting a vulnerability in the web application it was running. We simulate this scenario by running a pod and attaching to a shell inside it.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">$ kubectl run --rm -i --tty mypod --image=alpine --restart=Never -- sh

(pod)$ hostname
mypod</pre>



<p>Good! As an attacker, we’re now interested to enumerate resources in the cluster and in the associated AWS account. For completeness, we can have a look at the ATT&amp;CK-like threat matrix for Kubernetes by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/04/02/attack-matrix-kubernetes/">Microsoft</a>:</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/k8s-matrix.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>In the rest of this post, we’ll take a look at how the AWS Instance Metadata API (circled in green) <a href="https://blog.christophetd.fr/abusing-aws-metadata-service-using-ssrf-vulnerabilities/">strikes again</a> and allows us to do interesting things.</p>



<figure><img src="https://blog.christophetd.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/k8s-matrix-annotated.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.christophetd.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/k8s-matrix-annotated.png 927w, https://blog.christophetd.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/k8s-matrix-annotated-300x161.png 300w, https://blog.christophetd.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/k8s-matrix-annotated-768x411.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 927px) 100vw, 927px"></figure>



<h2><span id="A_refresher_on_the_AWS_Instance_Metadata_service">A refresher on the AWS Instance Metadata service</span></h2>



<p>As a reminder, the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html">Instance Metadata service</a> is an AWS API listening on a link-local IP address, 169.254.169.254. It is only accessible from EC2 instances and allows to retrieve various information about them. </p>



<p>It is particularly useful when you need your instances to access AWS resources. Instead of hard-coding credentials, you first assign an IAM role to your instance. From the instance, you can then retrieve temporary credentials for the role. This is 100 % transparent if you use the AWS CLI.</p>



<h2><span id="Accessing_the_Instance_Metadata_service_from_a_compromised_pod">Accessing the Instance Metadata service from a compromised pod</span></h2>



<p>At first sight, it’s unclear what would happen if we were to query the Instance Metadata service from a compromised pod – so let’s give it a try.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">(pod)$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/                                                                                                                                             
ami-id                                                                                                                                                                                        
ami-launch-index
...
security-groups</pre>



<p>Good. What’s the context of the data returned?</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">(pod)$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/info

  "InstanceProfileId" : "AIPA..."
}</pre>



<p>Interestingly enough, we see that we can access the Instance Metadata service and that we’re able to retrieve temporary credentials for the IAM role <em>christophe-cluster-nodegroup-ng-15050c0b-<strong>NodeInstanceProfile</strong>-1AS40JWHFGXJ2</em>. </p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">(pod)$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/eksctl-christophe-cluster-nodegro-NodeInstanceRole-1XY9GXQ417J7H

}
</pre>



<p>This is the IAM role assigned to the EC2 instances acting as Kubernetes worker nodes! What can we do with it?</p>



<h2><span id="Least_privilege_you_say">Least privilege, you say?</span></h2>



<p>This role is <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/worker_node_IAM_role.html">documented</a> by AWS, and we can see it’s attached to the following AWS managed policies:</p>



<figure><img src="https://blog.christophetd.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.christophetd.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.png 749w, https://blog.christophetd.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-300x102.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></figure>



<p>I’ve seen <a href="https://twitter.com/0xdabbad00/status/998978082466758661?lang=en">Scott Piper</a> regularly rant about AWS managed policies, arguing they are too privileged. Are they?</p>

<p>Outch. Does that look bad? It’s because it is. Let’s see what these permissions allow us to do.</p>



<p>We can install the AWS CLI locally and set the credentials we retrieved earlier from the Instance Metadata service.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ASIA...
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=Xm/..
$ export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=IQo...
$ aws sts get-caller-identity
{
    "UserId": "A...Q:i-02f...",
    "Account": "account-id",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::account-id:assumed-role/eksctl-christophe-cluster-nodegro-NodeInstanceRole-1XY9GXQ417J7H/i-02..."
}</pre>



<p>Then, here are some examples of bad things we can do.</p>



<ul><li>Map the network, by <strong>listing and describing VPCs, subnets, and security groups</strong>. Not only the VPC associated to the EKS cluster, but <em>across the whole AWS account.</em><br></li><li><strong>Describe <em>any EC2 instance</em></strong><em> in the AWS account.</em> This includes information such as the AMI used, private IP, disks attached…<br></li><li><strong>Nuke <em>all network interfaces</em></strong><em> of every EC2 instan</em>ce with successive calls to <em>ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces</em>, <em>ec2:DetachNetworkInterface</em>, and <em>ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface</em>. This will bring offline all your instances and dependent AWS managed services. Your fancy EKS cluster? Gone. Your highly-available, auto-scalable web application spanning in 3 AZs? Offline. Great attack vector for a denial of service.<br></li><li><strong>Enumerate and pull any Docker image</strong> (“<em>ECR repository</em>“) in the account. As a bonus, you can even query the image vulnerability scan results by calling <em>ecr:DescribeImageScanFindings</em>. This will give you a nice list of the vulnerabilities <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/image-scanning.html">identified</a> by AWS in these images. This can be very helpful for further exploitation of pods inside the EKS cluster. Who needs Nessus anyway?</li></ul>



<p>Again, all this is <strong>AWS account-wide</strong>, comes by default when spinning up an EKS cluster, and is accessible by only having compromised a single, underprivileged pod in the cluster.</p>



<h2><span id="Remediation">Remediation</span></h2>



<p>This flaw is actually not new – it’s even <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/restrict-ec2-credential-access.html">documented</a> by AWS, who suggests to block the Instance Metadata service by creating an iptables rule on every EKS worker node. This is rather impractical if your EKS nodes are managed by <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html">node groups</a>, dynamically spinning up EC2 instances to act as EKS worker nodes. You’d need to create a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/introducing-launch-template-and-custom-ami-support-in-amazon-eks-managed-node-groups/">custom node group launch template</a> or custom AMI.</p>



<p>Another option is to <strong>use Kubernetes network policies to block access to the Instance Metadata service</strong>. Unfortunately, the <a href="https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s">Kubernetes network plugin</a> that EKS uses does not natively support network policies. The recommended workaround is to add the Calico Network Policy provider, which will be able to pick up your network policy objects and apply them. Note that this is <span>not</span> a full new <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/">CNI plugin</a> for your cluster, just a “network policy enforcer” (<a href="https://www.projectcalico.org/calico-network-policy-comes-to-kubernetes/">Calico supports both modes.</a>)</p>



<p>Following the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/calico.html">AWS documentation</a>, we can install the Calico Network Policy provider on our cluster:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s/release-1.6/config/v1.6/calico.yaml
# Wait for a few seconds...
$ kubectl get daemonset calico-node --namespace kube-system
NAME          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR                 AGE
calico-node   1         1         1       1            1           beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux   17m</pre>



<p>Calico runs as a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/">DaemonSet</a>, making sure that each worker node has its own Calico pod, picking up network policy objects and applying them locally on the nodes with iptables.</p>



<p>We can now write our network policy filtering egress traffic. In its simplest form, we will allow any outbound traffic not directed to the Instance Metadata IP.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="yaml" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3

<p><strong>Please Note: </strong><br></p>
<p>This boilerplate is a working game but it does require some knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript if you want to customize it, or a willingness to learn these technologies. If you need help learning there is an extended option you can select when you buy which includes <strong>one hour of video coaching</strong> to help you get started. There is also the YouTube screencast series (currently filming!) which you can follow along with.<br></p>
<p>Web app templates are often priced in the  $20 - $1000 range, but I wanted to make this accessible to roguelike game developers like myself at a reasonable price. <strong>If you're not completely satisfied with your purchase please make contact and you will get a full refund</strong>.<br></p>

<p>Hey I’m Ahmed, a self taught software engineer. In my path of self learning, I tried multiple languages and frameworks; and one of them was Ruby on Rails.</p>



<p>That was at least 5 years ago, and I hated it. I didn’t know why, but it just felt different in a bad way at that time.</p>



<p>A few years after, exactly 3 months ago, I started learning Ruby on Rails again. But this time I was shocked! Why didn’t I learn it before? Look at how things are easier here? Why are we spending so much time in other frameworks while this is working out of the box?…</p>



<h2>The hobby phase</h2>



<p>As a developer, you start your coding journey as a hobby. You discovered code and how you can turn your ideas to life. Now, you’re hooked. You spend a lot of time coding and working with technology! In fact, according to this <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#developer-profile-_-coding-as-a-hobby">StackOverflow survey</a>, 80% of developers code as a hobby.</p>



<p>Before the technology boom, people used to hate their day job. It was a source of income so they can do other things on the side. But for code, it’s different. It’s a hobby <strong>and</strong> a daily job.</p>



<p>It’s a no brainer that, we as developers, tend to over-architect things, build things from scratch, re-invent the wheel, etc… It’s a hobby and we want to experience the most out of it. And as a fresh software engineer discovering this new hobby, you want languages and frameworks giving you more flexibility to create, architect, and play with technology.</p>



<p>You can spend hours trying to make two frameworks play nicely together. Create the perfect build process. Architect your todo app. Deploy your simple app to a multi-region cloud provider, etc. And in the end, you feel happy. You don’t feel like you wasted time, because it’s your hobby! And we don’t waste time on hobbies. They are a source of happiness.</p>



<p>You’re in the <strong>hobby phase</strong>. </p>



<hr>



<h2>The get-things-done phase</h2>



<p>As you get more experience in the field, you’re more likely move out of the hobby phase. This is due to different causes, and some of them are: </p>



<ul><li>You don’t have enough time outside work to play with code (family, children, other new hobbies…)</li><li>Your past experiences show it’s not worth it to spend so much time early on trying to optimize</li><li>You’re now happier to see a product launch more than the technology behind it</li><li>You have a broad knowledge about the product inside your organization</li><li>And others…</li></ul>



<p>As you reach this new phase, you do not care about frameworks and languages anymore. You want what gets the job done as your objectives are greater than the technology. You want a set of frameworks that plays nicely together and get the job done as quickly as possible. And that’s when you’ll find something like Ruby on Rails.</p>



<p>Ruby on Rails is a set of tools and frameworks that plays nicely together as long as you use what’s given to you. You don’t have the freedom to use new frameworks or build things the way you want. But if you abide by the Ruby on Rails rules, you’ll move faster.</p>



<p>You’re in the <strong>get-things-done phase</strong>. Being on the get-things-done phase <strong>is a prerequisite</strong> to liking Ruby on Rails. No one likes something that limits their “creativity” if they are still in the hobby phase. </p>



<p>According to the same <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#experience">StackOverflow survey</a>, 67% of developers have less than 9 years of experience (40% have less than 5 years). That means, 67% are likely to be in the hobby phase. And this is one of the reasons why a lot of developers hate Ruby on Rails.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Skipping the hobby phase</h2>



<p>Being on the hobby phase isn’t bad. In your journey as a developer, you’ll start in the hobby phase. And with time, you’ll move slowly out of it. The timing it takes depends on each individual however.</p>



<p>But can you avoid it altogether? Yes, there are some exceptions. These are people coming from other disciplines. They are marketers, sales, and other non-technical people who discovered they can do more with code. <strong>Their primary objective isn’t to code. It’s to get help from code</strong>.</p>



<p>They are less likely to pick up new technologies or frameworks. They just want something that works and helps them in their job. They are more likely to pick something like Ruby on Rails. Or better, <strong>no-code tools</strong>.</p>

		Howdy 👋,

I’m Ahmed from Morocco and I build things using code, a.k.a a Software Engineer.

I hold an electrical engineering degree and I’m a self taught software developer. I figured out my love for building things when I started my first online business at the age of 17.

I blog at elazzabi.com and remote.ma.<br>

                    <p><strong><strong>The Defective Chessboard problem, </strong></strong>also known as the <strong><strong>Tiling Problem</strong></strong> is an interesting problem. It is typically solved with a “divide and conquer” approach. The algorithm has a time complexity of <strong><strong><em><em>O(n²)</em></em></strong></strong><em><em>.</em></em></p><h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2><p>Given a <em><em>n </em></em>by <em><em>n</em></em> board where <em><em>n</em></em> is of form 2^k where k &gt;= 1 (Basically, n is a power of 2 with minimum value as 2). The board has one missing square). Fill the board using trionimos. A trionimo is an L-shaped tile is a 2 × 2 block with one cell of size 1×1 missing.</p><p>Solving the problem efficiently isn’t the goal of this post. Visualizing the board as the algorithm runs is much more interesting in my opinion, though. Lets discuss the algorithm first.</p><figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/660/0*adonlEHar0FeZ3XM.png" alt="Image for post"><figcaption>The board with no defects added</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-algorithm">The Algorithm</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, a divide-and-conquer (DAC) technique is used to solve the problem. DAC entails splitting a larger problem into sub-problems, ensuring that each sub-problem is an exact copy of the larger one, albeit smaller. You may see where we are going with this, but lets do it explicitly.</p><p>The question we must ask before writing the algorithm is: is this even possible? Well, yes. The total number of squares on our board is <em><em>n</em></em>², or 4^<em><em>k</em></em>. Removing the defect, we would have 4^<em><em>k</em></em> — 1, which is always a multiple of three. This can be proved with mathematical induction pretty easily, so I won’t be discussing it.</p><figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/659/0*zOyl7BWBT9R4Csjd.png" alt="Image for post"></figure><h2 id="the-base-case">The base case</h2><p>Every recursive algorithm must have a base case, to ensure that it terminates. For us, lets consider the case when <em><em>n</em></em>, 2^<em><em>k</em></em> is 2. We thus have a 2×2 block with a single defect. Solving this is trivial: the remaining 3 squares naturally form a trionimo.</p><h2 id="the-recursive-step">The recursive step</h2><p>To make every sub-problem a smaller version of our original problem, all we have to do is add our own defects, but in a very specific way. If you take a closer look, adding a “defect” trionimo at the center, with one square in each of the four quadrants of our board, except for the one with our original defect would allow use to make four proper sub-problems, at the same time ensuring that we can solve the complete problem by adding a last trionimo to cover up the three pseudo-defective squares we added.</p><p>Once we are done adding the “defects”, recursively solving each of the four sub-problems takes us to our last step, which was already discussed in the previous paragraph.</p><h2 id="the-combine-step">The combine step</h2><p>After solving each of the four sub-problems and putting them together to form a complete board, we have 4 defects in our board: the original one will lie in one of the quadrants, while the other three were those we had intentionally added to solved the problem using <strong><strong>DAC</strong></strong>. All we have to do is add a final trionimo to cover up those three ‘defects’ and we are done.</p><p>Thus, the recursive equation for time complexity becomes:</p><p><strong><strong><em><em>T(n) = 4T(n/2)+c</em></em></strong></strong></p><p>The <strong><strong>4 </strong></strong>comes from the fact that to solve each problem of input n, we divide it into 4 sub-problems of input size <em><em>n/2 </em></em>(half the length of the original board). Once we are done solving those sub-problems, all that’s left to be done is to combine them: this is done by adding the last trionimo to cover up the pseudo-defects we added. This, of course, is done in constant time.</p><p>If you are interested in finding the asymptotic time complexity of the recurrence relation, you could try the <strong><strong>recursion tree method </strong></strong>or the <strong><strong>substitution method</strong></strong>. For now, lets just use the <strong><strong>Master theorem</strong></strong>.</p><p>The master theorem says that for a recurrence relation of the form:</p><p><strong><strong><em><em>T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)</em></em></strong></strong></p><p>the complexity depends on the complexities of<em><em> f(n) </em></em>and <em><em>n ^ log_b(a)</em></em> (the log is to the base <em><em>b</em></em>).</p><p>The cases in the image below tell us which case we need to use here.</p><figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1470/1*fPnVzEh00aTSG3PCX2MnXQ.png" alt="Image for post"><figcaption>The Master Theorem. From <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/master-theorem/" rel="noopener nofollow">brilliant.org</a></figcaption></figure><p>Since the value of n ^ log(a) base b is <em><em>n</em></em>², while the term <em><em>f(n) </em></em>is of constant complexity, we use <strong><strong>Case 1, </strong></strong>which ultimately tells us that our algorithm has an order of <strong><strong><em><em>n</em></em>²</strong></strong>. In other words, the time complexity of our algorithm is <strong><strong>O(<em><em>n</em></em>²).</strong></strong></p><h2 id="the-code">The Code</h2><p>Initially, each square is represented by a 0. A ‘-1’ represents a defective square, and would appear black in the plots. Each trionimo would be displayed with a unique number, which would be incremented as more trionimos are added.</p><p>Again, the goal of the code is not optimization — its to do as much from scratch (in plain python) as possible.</p><p>I have commented the code below, so it should be pretty straight-forward.</p><h3 id="importing-required-libraries">Importing required libraries</h3><pre><code>from random import randint

It's entirely hands-on.</p>
<p>Docker has made it easier to develop and package applications in reproducible environments. With Docker, you worry less about the infrastructure of your local machine and that of the production environment and worry more about worry about your code. Although a good product, sometimes when building you would want to run different parts of an application using Docker. What this means is you will create a couple of Dockerfiles and manage them. You <em>orchestrate</em> the containers yourself. This makes maintaining them both hectic and time-consuming. </p>
<p>Docker Compose is a tool used to run many Docker containers representing different parts of an application. To define and configure services (applications) with Compose, you use YAML files. The tool creates, starts, and stops these services that run as Docker containers. Docker Compose is great for rapid prototyping of microservices and continuous integration pipelines.</p>

<h2 id="sample-application">Sample Application</h2>
<p>Let's look at a docker-compose file with MYSQL configurations, call it <code>docker-compose.yml</code>. </p>
<pre><code>services:
  mysql:
    image: <span>"mysql:8.0"</span>
    container_name: mysql
    restart: always
    ports:
      - <span>"3300:3306"</span>

      - MYSQL_DATABASE=database
      - MYSQL_USER=user
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=password1212
      - MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
volumes:
  dbdata:
</code></pre><h3 id="explanation">Explanation</h3>
<p>The above YAML file has some things to note.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>service</em> called <code>mysql</code> is created, and it depends on the <code>mysql:8.0</code> published image on Docker Hub.</li>
<li>The local port <em>3300</em> maps to the container port 3306 to enable assess the MySQL container from the 3300 port. </li>
<li>The restart policy is set to always restart an exited container.</li>
<li>We define a docker volume which ensures data is persistent so we keep our data after the shut down of a container. It is important because Docker data is <em>ephemeral</em>.</li>
<li>Environment variables are also defined to adjust the configuration (login details) of the MySQL instance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="web-interaction">Web Interaction</h3>
<p>Flask microframework is used to interact with the database. To create this, follow the instructions below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a folder called <code>python</code> and change directories into it.</li>
<li>Create a file called <code>app.py</code> that connects with the MYSQL container and processes inputs</li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span>from</span> flask <span>import</span> Flask, render_template, request

<ul>
<li>The <em>build</em> directs docker to the folder(context) <code>python</code> and builds a docker image from the Dockerfile in the folder.</li>
<li>The <em>volume</em> is edited to initialize the MYSQL container with our <code>init.sql</code> file.</li>
</ul>
<p>The project should have the structure below:</p>
<pre><code>├── docker-compose.yml
├── init.sql
└── python
    ├── app.py
    ├── Dockerfile
    ├── index.html
    └── requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The image below shows the block diagram of the docker-compose file.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598887228171/lgo8V7Bo4.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="docker-compose.yml.png"></p>
<h3 id="execution">Execution</h3>
<p>To execute the above block, run <code>docker-compose up</code> on your terminal and access the HTML on <code>localhost:5000</code>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have seen how Docker Compose works and some basic explanations. Things to note:</p>
<ol>
<li>Docker manages single containers while Docker Compose manages multiple container applications.</li>
<li>Docker Compose is good for development, testing, and staging environments but in a production environment, you would be better off using Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.</li>
<li>Environment variables and secrets are never checked into source control in a production setting. Use a <code>.env</code> file instead</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Glossary</strong></p>
<p>ephemeral: lasting for a very short time. This means without volumes, data generated and in docker are volatile and will be lost on termination of a container (either a restart or a rebuild).</p>
<p>orchestrate: Container orchestration is the automatic process of managing or scheduling the work of individual containers for applications based on microservices within multiple clusters.</p>
<p>service: A service is a section that defines all the containers used by our application.</p>
<p>3300: The default port for connections should be port 3306, but for easier understanding of where local ports and container ports are in a file, 3300 is used. </p>

  <p>Great User Experience Design has become the driving force behind successful products – at the expense of happiness, mental health and purpose. It is time for UX design to step up and evolve. Johannes Ippen is a designer and author from Berlin. He is currently running Human Deluxe, an Experience Design Studio &amp; consultancy focusing on Human-Brand relations.</p>

<p>Prior to that, he was responsible for the Product Marketing at mobile games developer Wooga, creator of hit games such as Jelly Splash, Pearl’s Peril and Diamond Dash. As founder of the Thanksalot Design Collective, he has created and launched several successful products like the Aside Magazine, MagazineGrid and Graphical Cooking. Johannes has written four bestselling books about digital product design and development, published at Rheinwerk Verlag. He teaches UX design and information architecture at Design Akademie Berlin, where he also graduated in 2009.</p>

<p>The native Berliner likes French punk rock, well-designed infographics (preferably about food) and really strong espresso. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

<p>During these past two weeks I had the chance to play the Marvel’s Avengers Beta. The game allows the player to player solo or hop into matchmaking to find some squad-mates.
Even playing solo it was clear that the game needed internet connectivity. Having already played last week during the closed-beta I decided to use the new open-beta to explore more about the game’s networking.</p>



<p>One of the reasons I like reversing and understanding client/server communications is that the process is much more clear than other types of reversing, such as custom archives and formats.
The process goes like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Understand the type, the sender and destination of the traffic - who is responsible of sending it, whether it’s UDP/TCP, the endpoints, is it encrypted? …</li>
  <li>Acquire readibility and instrumentation - develop/use tools to dump the traffic to later analyze it</li>
  <li>Learn the protocol details - crucial for debugging, this can be done by omitting requests/responses, messing with the contents,…</li>
</ol>

<p>If the goal is to develop an emulator then there’s extra steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start by parroting the server responses</li>
  <li>Slowly build the backend and start making your own responses</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="understanding-the-traffic">Understanding the traffic</h2>

<p>I started by opening <code>Wireshark</code> and checking how my actions impact the traffic. During the game’s boot there’s nothing happening, pressing the <code>Start</code> button in the main menu the game performs a DNS query of <code>cry-trmv6-beta.os.eidos.com</code> followed by setting up a TLS connection to the return IP. This indicates that the protocol being HTTPS - it’s nice since it well known but it’s encrypted which hurts readibility and tamperability.</p>

<p>Having some experience with games that use HTTPS, such as <a href="https://github.com/krystalgamer/shakes_fidget_server_emulator">Shakes and Fidget</a>, it’s common for the client not to care about the server being HTTP(useful for dumping packets) or even the server allowing HTTP requests. I added an entry to the <code>HOSTS</code> file to redirect the traffic to my local server sadly the connection couldn’t be established and Square Enix servers only allowed HTTPS. This meant I had to dug deeper to acquire reading power of the packets.</p>

<p>This part got me scared since the game uses Denuvo which contributes to its 400MB of executable size. I wanted to avoid messing its anti-tamper measures.
To verify where the traffic comes from within the game using <code>x64dbg</code> I placed a breakpoint at <code>getaddrinfo</code> in <code>ws2_32.dll</code>. When the breakpoint was hit reading the callstack showed where it came from, it was <code>osdk.dll</code>. This module was shipped with the game and until that moment I was not aware of its existence.</p>

<p>The next step was to see what it exports:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some of the entries were removed due to being too long. This was my breakthrough, this library is responsible for the communications and it appears to be done in JSON!</p>

<p>Digging around the <strong>strings</strong> I noticed it was using <code>libcurl</code> which is also awesome, but also <code>libuv</code> which could pose serious problems for debugging and tracing. IDA wasn’t picking cURL’s function names so I had to use one of the community FLIRT databases, <a href="https://krystalgamer.github.io/avengers-emulator/%3Chttps://github.com/Maktm/FLIRTDB">FLIRTDB</a>, which was key in finding functions such as <code>curl_easy_setopt</code>.
cURL has two interfaces the <code>easy</code> and the <code>multi</code>, the latter being focused in asynchronous programming. Even though it uses <code>libuv</code> all the connections are done via the <strong>easy</strong> interface.</p>

<p>Having the targets isolated it was time to add some logging. In this case I resorted to dll proxying which consists of substituting the original module with a one created by me and redirecting all the calls to the original one. Microsoft Visual C compiler makes it super easy with a simple pragma directive.</p>

<div><div><pre><code> <span>__pragma</span> <span>(</span><span>comment</span> <span>(</span><span>linker</span><span>,</span> <span>"/export:"</span> <span>export_name</span> <span>"="</span> <span>original_dll_name</span><span>.</span><span>export_name</span> <span>",@"</span> <span>ordinal</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case I renamed <code>osdk.dll</code> to <code>osdk_orig.dll</code>, the new module exported the exact same functions which just forwarded to the original.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#define FORWARDED_EXPORT_WITH_ORDINAL(exp_name, ordinal, target_name) __pragma (comment (linker, "/export:" #exp_name "=" #target_name ",@" #ordinal))
</span>
<span>FORWARDED_EXPORT_WITH_ORDINAL</span><span>(</span><span>osdk_Allocator_Free</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>osdk_orig</span><span>.</span><span>osdk_Allocator_Free</span><span>)</span>
<span>FORWARDED_EXPORT_WITH_ORDINAL</span><span>(</span><span>osdk_Allocator_Init</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>osdk_orig</span><span>.</span><span>osdk_Allocator_Init</span><span>)</span>

<span>(...)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>DLL Proxying has also another big advantage, since <code>DllMain</code> runs before the main executable(the ones of the modules that are explicitly imported!), it’s the safest place to perform any hooks/patches. Other methods such as DLL Injection require creating an extra thread which might cause some racing issues.</p>

<p>Here I run into another problem, for some reason <code>GetModuleHandle</code> was always returning 0, except when the argument was <code>NULL</code>. Calling <code>ntdll!LdrGetDllHandle</code> also yielded 0 and even walking the LDR table from PEB(Process Environment Block), yield no modules which was extremely suspicious.</p>

<p>I was eager to to get my hooks running and debugging Windows internal structures was not on my best interest, because it might be caused by Denuvo! Being desperate I decided to try something that even <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-best-practices">Microsoft discourages</a> from doing, calling <code>LoadLibrary</code> in <code>Dllmain</code>, the reason behind it is that it during the <code>DllMain</code> routine the loader lock is acquired and is not free’d until it’s over(also the loaded modules list must not change inside), thus loading new modules might cause crashes or deadlock.</p>

<p>Since my dll depends on <code>osdk_orig.dll</code> then it must be loaded after the original one, thus my call of <code>LoadLibrary</code> does not violate the condition of modifying the module list! Luckily it worked and <code>GetProcAddress</code> was also working. Using <code>osdk_Allocator_Init</code> as a pivot, the <strong>offsets</strong> to all the relevant functions inside <code>osdk_orig.dll</code> were calculated and relevant functions hooked. It was time to start logging!</p>

<h3 id="logging-curl_easy_setopt">Logging curl_easy_setopt</h3>

<p>Performing requests with cURL is quite straightforward, first create a <code>CURL*</code> handle with <code>curl_easy_init</code> and then set <strong>ALL</strong> connection related settings/parameters <code>curl_easy_setopt</code>. The function prototype is as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>CURLcode</span> <span>curl_easy_setopt</span><span>(</span><span>CURL</span> <span>*</span><span>handle</span><span>,</span> <span>CURLoption</span> <span>option</span><span>,</span> <span>parameter</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first argument was already discussed, the second one is an <em>enum</em> which specifies which option will be set and the third argument is the data related to the parameter. E.g with option <code>CURLOPT_URL</code> the parameter would be a null-terminated string of the url.</p>

<p>Hooking this function was done with a <strong>trampoline</strong>, which consists of over-writing the function prologue with something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>mov</span> <span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>ADDRESS_OF_…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<div>
<p>How do small, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bootstrap.asp">bootstrapped</a> companies launch new products? It depends, but I want to tell about Gikken's journey from buying the iconic Mac app for iOS + macOS developers, to conducting user interviews, to designing a new version from scratch, to deciding on pricing, and to prepping for launch day.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/08/confetti-cover-6.png"></figure><p>8 months ago, I shared exciting news that <a href="https://blog.gikken.co/we-acquired-tokens/">we bought Tokens</a> from another developer. Being a financially successful indie developer focused on language learning tools, we felt that we wanted to try a new area, to solve problems for a new community. When I started using Twitter over a year ago, I figured out that Gikken's brand had been underrepresented in the developer community, being a 5-year-old company. Could there have been a better match than to make a product for developers? We didn't think long when an opportunity to acquire Tokens popped up.</p><p><strong>Today, I'm thrilled to announce that Tokens 2 is out. </strong>It's an all-new version of the app that was once a marketing and customer support powerhouse for thousands of Apple developers.</p><h2 id="acquisition">Acquisition</h2><p>I discovered Tokens last year—later than most Apple developers. It was love at first sight. Having promo codes always at hand saved me hours of customer support work. Redemption notifications triggered dopamine even when redeemed by ordinary users, let alone popular bloggers!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/08/Notifications.png"><figcaption>Redemption notifications are one of the best Tokens features according to me and some other people.</figcaption></figure><p>Gikken-owned Tokens happened quickly–it amazes me. I asked whether <a href="https://twitter.com/denishennessy">Denis</a> planned to make an iOS app. He replied maybe, Andrew and I offered to partner up and make it together, and Denis got back offering all the rights to it.</p><p>It took us one call to decide. Denis turned out to be a super friendly guy living close to Dublin, Ireland and making apps for a living for over 10 years. He said he took over Tokens from another developer, <a href="https://supertop.co/">Supertop</a>. 7 years after the app was first released, it hadn't brought in any revenue. Denis said he didn't do any marketing and Tokens's monetization model was the worst imaginable fit for a small B2B market—low-hanging fruit. We decided to give it a shot. Money aside, it was an amazing opportunity to spread the word about Gikken among developers.</p><p>A few days later, we signed a one-page agreement. We have never mentioned it but Denis threw another project into the deal: <a href="http://tophatapp.com/">Top Hat</a>. We'd acquired two products. After we wired the money, Denis messaged me on Christmas eve to say he had free time and could hand over access to all repositories and accounts. I was in the office, why not. Gikken took full ownership of Tokens on December 25th, 2019!</p><h2 id="interviewing-old-users">Interviewing old users</h2><div><p>Even though to us it was obvious that Tokens had to be able to generate promo codes for IAP in 2020, we wouldn't have jumped on it if people hadn't cared about it. "Winners learn from losing," yet doing something that no one cares about demotivates even the winners.</p><p>The best way to figure out if people care is through user interviews. I had to interview app developers to figure out: how often they use promo codes, for what, how much of a pain was App Store Connect, would they be ready to pay for it, and how much. Andrew once sent me a copy of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1492180742/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1492180742&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gikken-20&amp;linkId=a3a25b00a364100a35875a4991ae47f6">The Mom Test</a>–one of the best business books I've read. It teaches you how to conduct interviews that won't give you false hopes.</p></div><p>It wasn't hard to find people for interviews. Denis handed us over the full list of everyone who's ever purchased a Tokens license. No one can tell you more than someone who's purchased a product once. They know whether their workflow became better with Tokens and whether it was worth the money.</p><p>It was fun looking through the list. Surprising that a lot of iconic developers were among users. Developers of Flighty, Things, Pixelmator, Waterminder, Fantastical, and 1,000+ others once believed that Tokens could improve their workflow. In early January, poking around the old customer list replaced Instagram as a way of procrastination.</p><p>I started timidly approaching people I'd heard the most about. I thought why the heck not, they might ignore me or not, at least I can say I tried. To my surprise, everyone who I was reaching out to ecstatically got back to me.</p><p>The first interview was with <a href="https://blog.gikken.co/p/f56ce6e9-26f9-4640-a21b-b9f4adc59378/twitter.com/rjonesy">Ryan Jones</a> from Flighty and Weather Line, which was a goldmine of insight and motivation. Tokens 1 didn't support promo codes for IAP. All Ryan's apps are freemium, however, he was an active Tokens user. He was pulling codes from ASC and inserting them into the app manually to have nice tokn.co links and redemption notifications.</p><p>I could tell Ryan was interested in Tokens's future by the amount of his questions. It was me trying to figure out how he uses promo codes and it was him trying to figure out what would happen with his favorite product.</p><p>When I started using Tokens, I instantly noticed that I was missing it when I was away from my Mac. I couldn't generate a code to quickly share with someone on Twitter. We discussed the idea of making an iOS app with Andrew even before we finalized our deal with Denis.</p><p>Ryan told the same. I felt relieved when I heard that my experiences align with those of a another user. I told him about our plans: that Tokens 2 might be a cross-platform app that would synchronize via a Tokens Account and that you would use Sign in with Apple. He asked about privacy. I said <a href="https://gikken.co/tokens/security/">Gikken's adamant about it</a> and that we would never store user credentials on our end—due to lack of the official App Store Connect API, we have to use user's Apple ID to make requests for pulling codes from Apple. He was excited. Following the call, Ryan kept helping us to shape the pricing strategy and UX.</p><p>I held around 15 interviews with users of the old Tokens in January. I approached people who I'd heard about because they were pretty influential in the community or those who were using desperately-outdated Tokens 1. I brushed up on my SQL skills to pull a list of them from the DB. A few generously agreed to jump on an hour-long call with me and others answered my questions in details over email. It provided a boatload of feedback and insights that we then had to process and shape into Tokens 2. All interviewees are now featured on our <a href="https://gikken.co/tokens/credits/">Credits</a> page.</p><p>There were people who said they didn't need it anymore or that they'd quit the app business. Many things can happen in 8 years. We had a strong impression that, all-in-all, Tokens was a much needed tool. As I mentioned before, reviving a once cult-like product would go hand-in-hand with working with the amazing community in which we wanted to be more recognized. We had to relaunch Tokens with long-overdue features, rethink the pricing model to make it viable, and finally convince the community that were the right company to do so.</p><h2 id="before-doing-work">Before doing work</h2><p>We did planning and thinking. Do we need to rewrite the app from scratch or slap new features on top of what we'd inherited from two prior developers? How much should it cost? Does it need to be on the App Store?</p><h3 id="app-store-vs-self-distribution">App Store vs self-distribution</h3><ul><li><strong>30% cut + taxes</strong> would mean we have to give up half of our revenue, which would barely make it viable again. In interviews, developers were pretty aligned on all things pricing–something between 5 and 10 dollars per month was fair to them. Considering the small market, getting 2.5 dollars out of 5 didn't feel like a fair justification for spending resources of the redesign and maintenance. </li><li><strong>App Store invoices are bad.</strong> Developers have registered businesses. They need to submit invoices to their tax offices. We do it every month and we understand the importance of unobtrusive, easy-to-find invoicing.</li><li><strong>It wouldn't give us any spotlight value</strong> that Apple claims to give. Who on earth would look for a better promo code management system (we checked–no one). It's not an obvious thing that people learn about via word-of-mouth and it's not something they open the App Store for.</li></ul><p>We went with <a href="https://paddle.com/">Paddle</a>. We've been selling <a href="https://gikken.co/mate-translate/mac/">Mate</a> with them for a while and it's proved itself as a perfect solution for selling Mac apps, plus it handles taxes, invoices, and licenses for you at a modest 5% cut.</p><p>If we were to port Tokens to iOS, we'd have to use the App Store. The whole Tokens for iOS story was pretty controversial from the beginning because it was giving access to Apple services without their approval (remember, there's no App Store Connect API). Chances they'd reject us were pretty high. We thought we'd test the waters by trying to submit Tokens 1 to the Mac App Store. It would have required poking around the old ObjC code and sandboxing it—we never went through with it. Instead, I got reassured by Ariel from <a href="https://blog.gikken.co/p/f56ce6e9-26f9-4640-a21b-b9f4adc59378/appfigures.com">Appfigures</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/VadimShpakovski">Vadim</a> from <a href="http://nativeconnect.app/">NativeConnect</a> who successfully made it to the store with their apps that did the same thing as Tokens–use App Store Connect in a way not approved by Apple. A positive App Store review is an approval, isn't it?</p><p>The iOS app would rely on the Mac app in a way that it'd be a "reader app". You'd manage your subscription and create a Tokens account via Mac app, and the iOS app would allow you to sign in with Apple to your existing Tokens account and have access to your promo codes and generate new ones. Sounds like a perfect Netflix-Spotify-inspired 30% cut avoiding scheme for a service that doesn't need App Store's spotlight value that Apple claims to provide.</p><h3 id="from-the-ground-up">From the ground up?</h3><p>It was up to Andrew who's written almost all the code for Tokens 2. Since the original Tokens was written in Objective-C (we entered the app business when Swift was &nbsp;announced—it's not hard to guess what our preferred tech stack is) and used pretty outdated APIs (made in 2012!), he said we should. Plus, we had to change everything for it to support accounts and IAP codes.</p><p>It was tempting to try fresh-released (back then) Catalyst to avoid making two separate apps for Mac and iOS, yet there were more cons than pros and we went old-school–good ol' AppKit. Andrew was adamant that we couldn't keep torturing ourselves with NodeJS on the server anymore.

<h2 id="goals-and-assumptions">Goals and assumptions</h2>

<p>Goal is to choose most suitable TLS library that could be statically linked with an application. The application will be runing on modern mobile operating system and variety of ARM CPUs. I’m interested in client side of the TLS only. Ideal library is the one which ensures the best security, implements algorithms optimized for speed and compiles to reasonably small binary. Additionally I assume I can control both sides of the connection, meaning I’m free to choose a cipher(s) to be used for both - symmetric and assymetric encryption (without using PSK). I also have some requirements regarding licences and being open-source.</p>

<p>I’ve identified two libraries which seem to met those requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>mbedTLS</code> - is a library formerly known as <code>PolarSSL</code>. It makes it fairly easy for developers to include cryptographic and TLS capabilities in embedded products. It is highly configurable, so that facilitating TLS functionality may have very small minimal coding footprint. It is currently maintained by ARM.</li>
<li><code>BoringSSL</code> - is a fork of OpenSSL maintained and used by Google. It is a default TLS library used by Android OS (starting from version M), Chrome as well as used on Cloudflare systems. I has advantage of being originated from <code>OpenSSL</code> - it means that library got a lot of reviews and testing.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="testing-application">Testing application</h2>

<p>It’s a implementation of simple C-based test application, which compiles and links against library under test and run on ARMv8 platform running Android operating system. The app is composed of client and server. As I’m only interested in client side of the TLS end, we fix the server to always use same library (it’s based on <code>BoringSSL</code>). Server is configured to support only TLSv1.2 (as 1.3 is not supported by <code>mbedTLS</code>, yet [16]). In order to start a server, user provides an argument which specifies cetificate type to be used (RSA, ECDSA or EdDSA based). Once run it always enforces same cipher suite to be used - for example in case of RSA it will be ECDHE key agreement with RSA signature and AES/256 in GCM AEAD mode.</p>

<p>Client application is the one which I want to benchmark. I have implemented one which uses <code>mbedTLS</code> API and links with this library and similar one for <code>BoringSSL</code>. Client always establishes TCP connection in blocking mode (simplicity). It implements 3 different tests:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Handshake</strong> : during this test client opens TCP connection and performs many handshake without closing the connection. Performance of this test depends on key type used for certificate signing and symmetric key agreement algorithm (as well as elliptic curve used), hence this test is performed multiple times, once for each certificate type</li>
<li><strong>Write</strong>: clients opens TCP connection and sends few hundred megabytes of data. This test is done mostly to assess performance of symmetric encryption</li>
<li><strong>Read</strong>: clients opens TCP connection and sends a request to the server which sends back few hundred megabytes of data. This test is done mostly to assess performance of symmetric decryption</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="binary-size-reduction">Binary size reduction</h2>

<h3 id="mbedtls">mbedTLS</h3>

<p><code>mbedTLS</code> makes it possible to select features of TLS library before compile time. Configuration template is available in <code>config.h</code> file and is managed by definining or disabling number of preprocessor symbols (look for <code>MBEDTLS_CONFIG_FILE</code> for more details). This is an easy way for developers to include cryptographic and (optional) SSL/TLS capabilities in their products, facilitating those functionalities with a minimal coding footprint. Indeed, it is interesting feature for memory constrained devices (for example microcontrollers).</p>

<p><code>mbedtls</code> compilation produces 3 separated libraries - crypto, ssl and x509 library. Compilation also outputs number of test binaries.</p>

<p>As a first step I have applied set of obvious size optimization provided by compiler (<code>-Os</code>) and stripped all the symbols (they can be stored in separated file if needed). I also applied <code>-ffuntion-sections</code> and <code>--fdata-sections</code> options to the compiler. This will cause compiler to place each function or data item into its own section. Then thanks to <code>-Wl,--gc-sections</code> linker will be able to chose only those sections which are actually used, which makes resulting binary much smaller (one can add <code>-Wl,--print-gc-sections</code> in order to see removed sections). This optimization may produce unexpected results, so I strongly advice to look at documentation and get familiar with the details of this optimization.</p>

<p>In a second step I have changed <code>config.h</code> file and removed capabilities which are not needed by our client application, leaving following capabilities only:</p>

<ul>
<li>TLS client side code</li>
<li>TLS v1.2</li>
<li>AES-GCM used as a symmetric cipher</li>
<li>RSA, ECDSA and ECDH with curves P-256</li>
<li>SHA-256 and SHA-512</li>
<li>Code for key pre-sharing has been removed</li>
<li>Some additional features required by the client code</li>
</ul>

<p>In a third step I’ve removed support of RSA, which from one hand isn’t actually necessarily, as I control both sides of a connection, and from the other hand it’s interesting how much binry size get’s reduced.</p>

<p>The test client has been reduced more than 4 times and indeed to very small size. Further reductions are possible (see [8] for ideas), nevertheless at this point I’m satisfied with the size and I don’t think it is possible to change it much. Also removing RSA reduces a size only by 20 bytes, so I’ve decided to keep RSA and pay a little penalty.</p>

<p>Also it’s worth noting that 48KB for TLSv1.2 implementation is really small memory footprint. Very interesting for small devices which implement most of needed crypto in hardware.</p>

<h3 id="boringssl">BoringSSL</h3>

<p>Similar experiment as bove has been done with BoringSSL. This library doesn’t offer so many configuration possibilities as <code>mbedTLS</code>, nevertheless it provides some.</p>

<p>In the first step I’ve applied exactly same compiler flags as in case of <code>mbedTLS</code> (<code>-Os</code>, symbol strip, indexing data&amp;function sections).</p>

<p>In a second step I’ve applied <code>OPENSSL_SMALL=1</code> configuration option. This tells the compiler to use algorithm implementation which is optimized for size rather than for speed (see [12] for more details).</p>

<p>In a third step I’ve tried to remove assembly implementation. For some algorithms this causes huge performance degradation as some optimizations are written in assembly as well as hardware acceleration needs a “glue” code which is written in assembly. Nevertheless, it is interesting step when comparing against <code>mbedTLS</code>, as it doesn’t have any such optimizations currently (see [6]).</p>

<p><code>BoringSSL</code> provides concept of <em>crypto buffers</em> which can be used instead of some functions from memory hungry X509 and ASN.1 implementation. This feature together with indexing data&amp;function sections (done in first step) greatly reduces binary size. We have used it in step 4. In step 5 we go a bit further - need for X509 and ASN.1 can be complatelly removed, assuming user provides custom certificate verification function. My client doesn’t implement such function, but from one hand it shouldn’t be very complicated to implement such function and also code size of such function won’t change much final binary size. Hence it’s interesting to see a result of size reduction.</p>

<p>In last step I’ve tried to introduce more aggressive changes to the comment out (with preprocessor symbols) RSA and DH implementation.</p>

<p>I’m positivelly surprised by the fact that it is possible to remove X509 and ASN.1 code, it gives you really small library. At the moment I don’t want to implement my own certificate verification function and I want to perform certificate verification during performance benchmarking. But it’s worth noting that with fairly small cost …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

Late last year, we were faced with the challenge of modernizing our notifications system for end-users by making it fit for both the changing requirements of the industry, and our internal development teams. In this post, I’ll walk you through some of the considerations and learnings we encountered along the way. It will not be a deep dive into the language and its surrounding ecosystem, but instead I’ll offer a glimpse into how we approach language and technology evaluation and adoption.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In its then current state, our notification system was baked into some older parts of our service ecosystem and heavily resisted far-reaching changes. We also felt that utilising more modern, ubiquitous technologies like WebSockets would suit us better and provide our users with a more engaging experience – and well, let’s just say it had a host of other small problems that made it a prime candidate for a rewrite.</p>
<p>Now a rewrite does not require a change in technologies: we could have stuck to the more or less blessed stack of Node.js/Typescript for our back-end, but we realised an opportunity here try something new in a part of the application that is not necessarily on the hot-path.</p>
<p>In other words, we were in a fairly good position to experiment and explore.</p>
<p>We set off on a scoping and requirements gathering exercise, and managed to draw a circle around the features we wanted to build and deliver in due time. One of the themes that kept creeping up from our discoveries was user experience: the look and feel of the whole thing.</p>
<p>Our goal was to provide a slick, real-time experience to our users. There are a couple of technologies currently available that can facilitate this, but WebSockets was the most mature solution for this. The next steps were to track down some language and framework combinations that have significant support for long-running WebSocket connections.</p>
<p>Apart from UX demands, we also set some expectations from an engineering point of view:</p>
<ol>
<li>There need to be strong primitives in the framework - with strong community support - for both building and testing persistent connections, queuing, storage, etc.&nbsp;</li>
<li>If we have to fight the framework, we’re doing it wrong. It should be opinionated enough, <strong>without</strong> getting in the way.</li>
<li>If we can reduce moving parts, we’re doing it right.</li>
</ol>
<p>With these requirements in hand, we opened up the floor for any suggestions and sure enough, one option quite quickly gained traction.</p>
<h3>Why Elixir?</h3>
<p>Elixir is a fairly new language, but it runs on extraordinarily robust and battle-tested concepts and technology, at least by modern-day web development standards. It builds and runs on top of the Erlang VM, doing so — in part — by leveraging Erlang/OTP.</p>
<p>OTP, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Telecom_Platform" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Open Telecom Platform</span></a>, is a collection of tools, libraries and middleware that enable developers to build scalable, robust systems. It is the lower-level ecosystem supporting Erlang – and thus Elixir – development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I consider Elixir to be a niche language, albeit a very mainstream and capable language within that particular niche. It might not be the fastest or most optimized, but it commits to a few core tenets – concurrency, fault tolerance and isolation of errors, persistent connections – and executes on those really well.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we selected Elixir based on a couple of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Developer Experience – Elixir has a reputation for not only being developer-friendly, but having developer experience and productivity at its core</li>
<li>Integrated feedback loop – Coming from Node.js, having the One True Way to run unit and integration tests, and have a very clean way of running these in parallel is refreshing.</li>
<li>Purpose – As mentioned above, our requirement was to support and build upon a system of near-real time communication. Many other technologies do offer some level of library support, but we were hard-pressed to find a better solution than the primitives and higher level constructs provided by Elixir and Phoenix.</li>
<li>Interest – A very enthusiastic engineer within the team took ownership of this project</li>
</ol>
<h3>Our first steps in Elixir</h3>
<p>Once we had settled on Elixir, we were ready to roll our sleeves and&nbsp; actually start building something. This is where the champion steps in – a person who not only shows interest in the topic but is also willing to coach and mentor their peers. In my experience, it’s quite risky to try to adopt something that no one in the team has any experience in.</p>
<p>In true champion spirit, one of our own team members took ownership of building the seed project. While he was busy tinkering away, we purchased some books, found some tutorials, installed the blessed extensions and started learning this shiny new stack. It did not take long for us to have <em>something</em>; it was missing a lot of functionality, but it was just enough to give us a taste of how the language is structured, how the web framework hangs together and how we deploy it.</p>
<p>Now of course, introducing a new stack is not all smooth sailing. It should come as no surprise that the cost of adopting something new comes with a substantial amount of minutiae that need addressing. We had established ways of running services within our infrastructure, and our job now was to slot our Elixir-based service into that infrastructure.</p>
<p>From getting logging to work, having a working Prometheus endpoint, and integrating with our internal authentication mechanisms – let’s just say we had quite a few boxes to tick in order to get everything to play nicely.</p>
<p>But in the end, we have something that works! So let’s talk about some of our key learnings.</p>
<h4>Clusters within clusters —&nbsp;Understand where Kubernetes ends and Erlang/OTP begins</h4>
<p>There are competing, yet complementary philosophies at play here. The application is running on top of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_6Dl0iII9U" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Kubernetes within Smartly</span></a>, which brings with it a whole raft of *stuff* – a scheduler, failure detection, logging integration, load balancers... everything <strong>and</strong> the kitchen sink.</p>
<p>The application itself is running on top of Erlang/OTP, which in turn drags a fair bit of tooling and opinionation into the fray - failure detection, process management, supervision tree(s). You name it, it’s probably there somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Jose Valim</strong>, the creator of Elixir, has written in depth about <a href="http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2019/10/kubernetes-and-the-erlang-vm-orchestration-on-the-large-and-the-small/"><span>how these two runtimes coexist</span></a>, and at large, the technical aspect of his argument is sound. But what we’ve observed is that there are a few challenges with regards to expectations that needed to be overcome.</p>
<h4>Failure escalation — Come to grips with how failure occurs and propagates</h4>
<p>Our main competency within the team is running Node.js applications, and while a lot can be said about Node.js, it is not a complex programming model. There’s a script, you run the script, it blows up or keeps on running. Everything else is yours to manage and control.</p>
<p>Elixir really tries <strong>hard</strong> not to crash the entire underlying process, so it will let parts of the application crash and burn, after which the supervisor will reconstruct processes in your supervision tree based on configuration. Kubernetes does <strong>not</strong> get involved here, so our regular approach of finding out bad things are happening simply does not apply.</p>
<p>This happened recently when a critical part of the application was unable to talk to an underlying database, and instead of the usual symptom – pods crashing and burning left, right and centre, making our alerting system go off like nothing else – we were faced with an application that <em>looked functional</em> <em>on the surface</em>, but was heroically trying to stem the flood of dying processes internally. Needless to say, we added more monitoring and learnt our lesson.</p>
<h4>One is the loneliest number — Account for redundancy in a stateful system</h4>
<p>Traditionally, one of the hardest steps to take when scaling your infrastructure is to go from one to two. When vertical scaling is no longer a viable or preferred option, teams need to look at horizontal scaling instead. In the current landscape of Kubernetes clusters and small, disposable services, horizontally scaling your application has even become the de facto standard.</p>
<p>This puts the onus on us to design a system that can work in a distributed way. For all intents and purposes this would be easy if we were planning to run a simple request-response system, but we’re not: we’re aiming to build a distinct-per-user perpetually connected system. So the one thing we really don’t want to deal with is duplicated websocket connections, or having to duplicate our message handling. In short, all copies of our application need to be able to communicate <strong>with one another</strong> and pass user-bound notifications to the copy of the application that has initially established the WebSocket connection to said user.</p>
<p>Luckily, this is not an unsolved problem. Even more fortunately, a solution is provided within <a href="https://phoenixframework.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Phoenix</span></a> — the de-facto Elixir web application framework - itself. This solution takes the shape of <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_pubsub/Phoenix.PubSub.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Phoenix PubSub</span></a>. At its core, this would allow our applications to communicate with one another. If PubSub is the API by which applications would communicate, it does not by itself provide the means by which information makes it from one application to another. This message transport back-end needs to be provided separately, and take the form of <strong>adapters.</strong></p>
<p>There are two adapters currently available, Redis and PG2. We could have chosen Redis, as we do have some expertise in-house on how to run this at scale. But that would have introduced another moving part to the equation, and we were keen to keep as much as we could contained within the application itself. So that brings us to PG2, a solution that leverages Distributed Erlang in allowing Erlang processes to communicate across servers. In order for us to have this ability, we have to lean on one final component within our toolbox, namely <a href="https://github.com/bitwalker/libcluster" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>libcluster</span></a>. This Erlang clustering …</p></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

    <p>My drawing process is (nearly) always the same; I grab a pen, stroke the main lines of something I see, add detail, and shade. Afterwards, I make a decision based on how much I like the drawing and how much time is available to finish it—whether to add color or not.</p>
<p>I might get in love with the plain, black-and-white drawing and feel scared of spoiling the piece with watercolor even when I know color adds another dimension to the story told by my sketch. But I've been practicing.</p>
<p>The stress of coloring fades away the more I practice, and the positive feedback loop makes me color more of my sketches, improving my skill at the same time.</p>
<p>I've scanned certain drawings before and after coloring. This, apart from letting me keep a copy of the uncolored version of the drawing, might serve to train a machine learning algorithm which might learn <a href="https://sketch.nono.ma/suggestive-drawing">how I color my sketches</a>.</p>

<p>That fear of ruining what's half-done prevents us from improving.</p>
<p>Let's beat the resistance.</p>

<p><a href="https://devchat.tv/elixir-mix/emx-102-nerves-powered-mechanical-keyboards-with-chris-dose/">
        Chris Dosé was interviewed</a> by us on Elixir Mix. When he spoke about his work on a Nerves-powered keyboard I knew this was a
    project I wanted to try out. So I dropped into their dev channel, acquired the hardware (thanks for the help) and have done some playing
    around with it.
</p>
<p>
    So what is the draw of a Nerves keyboard? Well, you can program it in Elixir. That's a big one for me personally.
    It also means that compared to a lot of high-level languages driving hardware you have pretty strong performance
    characteristics, resilience and specifically with Nerves a lot of best practices for running embedded hardware.
    It makes managing firmware updates easier, it mitigates corruption on SD cards and lots more. As an Elixir
    developer the pure convenience of customizing the keyboard in my favored language is of course delightful.
</p>
<p>
    This post should help you try it out if you have/get the required hardware. The project is currently using the Keybow
    keypad as a prototyping platform to figure out how things should work while they work on the details of a full
    keyboard and it is a neat little gadget, whatever you want to do with it.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Requirements to try this:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Keybow kit, with Pi Zero (<a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4144">Adafruit</a>)</li>
<li>Micro USB Cable</li>
<li>Micro SD Card</li>
</ul>
<p>To get up and running you should:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/installation.html">Set up Nerves according to these instructions</a></li>
<li>Follow the <a href="https://github.com/ElixirSeattle/xebow">instructions at the xebow repo</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
    The installation guide might not tell you to go into <code>assets</code> and run <code>npm install</code> but I think
    you have to. I'm not going to tell you how to install Node and NPM because it varies. But you can probably find it <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">around the Node site</a>.
</p>
<p>
    If you reach the point of having burned the firmware to your SD Card, congratulations. We are ready to play.
</p>
<h2>First firmware on the device</h2>
<p>So plug the SD card with your pristine Xebow firmware into the Keybow contraption and plug the Keybow into your
    computer
    with the Micro USB cable. Startup can take a little bit but it should settle into cycling through rainbow colors
    after a
    bit. It should also produce numbers when you poke it (the default keymap is a numpad plus some extras).</p>
<h2>Making changes</h2>
<p>I don't need a single numpad and now I have two of them. Let's make this more useful. Open
    <code>lib/xebow/keyboard.ex</code>
    in your preferred editor.</p>
<p>Replace the default keymap with:</p>
<pre data-file="lib/xebow/keyboard.ex"><span></span>    <span>@keymap</span> <span>[</span>
    <span># THE NAVIGATOR!</span>
    <span>%{</span>

    <span>}</span>
  <span>]</span>
</pre>
<p>And then:</p>
<pre data-file="/">export MIX_TARGET=keybow
mix firmware
mix firmware.gen.script
./upload.sh xebow.local
</pre>
<p>Sometimes the upload process can be finicky. You can always re-burn the firmware to the SD card instead using
    <code>mix firmware.burn</code> instead of the <code>gen.script</code>.</p>
<h2>The navigator</h2>
<p>So with the Keybow on its side, four wide. You'll have this fantastic navigation machine at your disposal.
    Top row are arrows, middle row is VIM navigation or GMail or wherever else the don't-move-your-fingers approach is
    used.
    Bottom row are the extremes of the first row.</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Left</td><td>Down</td><td>Up</td><td>Right</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>H</td><td>J</td><td>K</td><td>L</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Home</td><td>PgDn</td><td>PgUp</td><td>End</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<h2>Layers?</h2>
<p>So my plan for the keyboard just filled the entire keypad. But the xebow application supports layers, so you can do
    some
    interesting stuff there. I considered doing a chorded keyboard but I'm terrible at them and decided on this as
    something
    I might actually use. There are plenty of cool things you can do with Layers if you want.</p>
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>The folks in #nerves-keyboard (on the <a href="https://elixir-slackin.herokuapp.com/">Elixir Slack</a>) are hard at work figuring out a real mechanical keyboard
    schematic
    that should be a very cool thing to own and play with. Most of the conversation in there right now is about PCB's, CAD and hardware layout. They are a welcoming bunch. So enjoy :)</p>
<p>If this post was good, or has problems that need fixing, let me know at <a href="mailto:lars@underjord.io">lars@underjord.io</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a> on Twitter. If you want more of my writing I have
a non-tracking newsletter which tends to cover quality and sustainability in software.</p>

		<p><span>In 1990, John Quarterman, a networking consultant and UNIX expert, published a comprehensive survey of the state of computer networks. In a brief section on the potential future for computing, he predicted the appearance of a single global network for “electronic mail, conferencing, file transfer, and remote login, just as there is now one worldwide telephone network and one worldwide postal system.” But he did not assign any special significance to the Internet in this process. Instead, he assumed that the worldwide net would “almost certainly be run by government PTTs”, except in the United States, “where it will be run by the regional Bell Operating Companies and the long-distance carriers.”</span></p>
<p><span>It will be the purpose of this post to explain how, in a sudden eruption of exponential growth, the Internet so rudely upset these perfectly natural assumptions.</span></p>
<h2><b>Passing the Torch</b></h2>
<p><span>The first crucial event in the creation of the modern Internet came in the early 1980s, when the Defense Communication Agency (DCA) decided to split ARPANET in two. The DCA had taken control of the network in 1975. By that time, it was clear that it made little sense for the ARPA Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO), a blue sky research organization, to be involved in running a network that was being used for participants’ daily communications, not for research </span><i><span>about</span></i><span> communication. ARPA tried and failed to hand off the network to private control by AT&amp;T. The DCA, responsible for the military’s communication systems, seemed the next best choice.</span></p>
<p><span>For the first several years of this new arrangement, ARPANET prospered under a regime of benign neglect. However, by the early 1980s, the Department of Defense’s aging data communications infrastructure desperately needed an upgrade. The intended replacement, AUTODIN II, which DCA had contracted with Western Union to construct, was foundering. So DCA’s leaders appointed Colonel Heidi Hieden to come up with an alternative. He proposed to use the packet-switching technology that DCA already had in hand, in the form of ARPANET, as the basis for the new defense data network.</span></p>
<p><span>But there was an obvious problem with sending military data over ARPANET – it was rife with long-haired academics, including some who were actively hostile to any kind of computer security or secrecy, such as Richard Stallman and his fellow hackers at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab. Heiden’s solution was to bifurcate the network. He would leave the academic researchers funded by ARPA on ARPANET, while splitting the computers used at national defense sites off onto a newly formed network called MILNET. This act of mitosis had two important consequences. First, by decoupling the militarized and non-militarized parts of the network, it was the initial step toward transferring the Internet to civilian, and eventually, private, control. Secondly, it provided the proving ground for the seminal technology of the Internet, the TCP/IP protocol, which had first been conceived half a decade before. DCA required all the ARPANET nodes to switch over to TCP/IP from the legacy protocol by the start of 1983. Few networks used TCP/IP at that point in time, but now it would link the two networks of the proto-Internet, allowing message traffic to flow between research sites and defense sites when necessary. To further ensure the long-term viability of TCP/IP for military data networks, Heiden also established a $20 million fund to pay computer manufacturers to write TCP/IP software for their systems (1).</span></p>
<p><span>This first step in the gradual transfer of the Internet from the military to private control provides as good an opportunity as any to bid farewell to ARPA and the IPTO. Its funding and influence, under the leadership of J.C.R. Licklider, Ivan Sutherland, and Robert Taylor, had produced, directly or indirectly, almost all of the early developments in interactive computing and networking. The establishment of the TCP/IP standard in the mid-1970s, however, proved to be the last time it played a central role in the history of computing (2).</span></p>
<p><span>The Vietnam War provided the decisive catalyst for this loss of influence. Most research scientists had embraced the Cold war defense-sponsored research regime as part of a righteous cause to defend democracy. But many who came of age in the 1950s and 1960s lost faith in the military and its aims due to the quagmire in Vietnam. That included Taylor himself, who quit IPTO in 1969, taking his ideas and his connections to Xerox PARC. Likewise, the Democrat-controlled Congress, concerned about the corrupting influence of military money on basic scientific research, passed amendments requiring defense money to be directed to military applications. ARPA reflected this change in funding culture in 1972 by renaming itself as DARPA, the </span><i><span>Defense </span></i><span>Advanced Research Projects Agency.</span></p>
<p><span>And so the torch passed to the civilian National Science Foundation (NSF). By 1980, with $20 million dollars in funding, the NSF accounted for about half of federal computer science research spending in the U.S, about $20 million (3)</span><span>. Much of that funding would soon be directed toward a new national computing network, the NSFNET.</span></p>
<h2><b>NSFNET</b></h2>
<p><span>In the early 1980s, Larry Smarr, a physicist at the University of Illinois, visited the Max Planck Institute in Munich, which hosted a Cray supercomputer that it made readily available to European researchers. Frustrated at the lack of equivalent resources for scientists in the U.S., he proposed that the NSF fund a series of supercomputing centers across the country (4)</span><span>. The organization responded to Smarr and other researchers with similar complaints by creating the Office of Advanced Scientific Computing in 1984, which went on to fund a total of five such centers, with a total five-year budget of $42 million. They stretched from Cornell in the northeast of the country to San Diego in the southwest. In between, Smarr’s own university (Illinois) received its own center, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA).</span></p>
<p><span>But these centers alone would only do so much to improve access to computer power in the U.S. Using the computers would still be difficult for users not local to any of the five sites, likely requiring a semester or summer fellowship to fund a long-term visit. And so NSF decided to also build a computer network. History was repeating itself – making it possible to share powerful computing resources with the research community was exactly what Taylor had in mind when he pushed for the creation of ARPANET back in the late 1960s. The NSF would provide a backbone that would span the continent by linking the core supercomputer sites, then regional nets would connect to those sites to bring access to other universities and academic labs. Here NSF could take advantage of the support for the Internet protocols that Heiden had seeded, by delegating the responsibility of creating those regional networks to local academic communities.</span></p>
<p><span>Initially, the NSF delegated the setup and operation of the network to the NCSA at the University of Illinois, the source of the original proposal for a national supercomputer program. The NCSA, in turn, leased the same type of 56 kilobit-per-second lines that ARPANET had used since 1969, and began operating the network in 1986. But traffic quickly flooded those connections (5)</span><span>. Again mirroring the history of ARPANET, it quickly became obvious that the primary function of the net would be communications among those with network access, not the sharing of computer hardware among scientists. One can certainly excuse the founders of ARPNET for not knowing that this would happen, but how could the same pattern repeat itself almost two decades later? One possibility is that it’s much easier to justify a seven-figure grant to support the use of eight figures worth of computing power, than to justify dedicating the same sums to the apparently frivolous purpose of letting people send email to one another. This is not to say that there was willful deception on the part of the NSF, but that just as the anthropic principle posits that the physical constants of the universe are what they are because otherwise we couldn’t exist to observe them, so no publicly-funded computer network could have existed for me to write about without a somewhat spurious justification.</span></p>
<p><span>Now convinced that the network itself was at least as valuable as the supercomputers that had justified its existence, NSF called on outside help to upgrade the backbone with 1.5 megabit-per-second T1 lines (6)</span><span>. Merit Network, Inc., won the contract, in conjunction with MCI and IBM, securing $58 million in NSF funding over an initial five year grant to build and operate the network. MCI provided the communications infrastructure, IBM the computing hardware and software for the routers. Merit, a non-profit that ran a computer network that linked the University of Michigan campuses (7)</span><span>, brought experience operating an academic computer network, and gave the whole partnership a collegiate veneer that made it more palatable to NSF and the academics who used NSFNET. Nonetheless, the transfer of operations from NCSA to Merit was a clear first step towards privatization.</span></p>

<p><span>Traffic flowed through Merit’s backbone from almost a dozen regional networks, from the New York State Education and Research Network (NYSERNet), interconnected at Cornell in Ithaca, to the California Education and Research Federation Network (CERFNet -no relation to Vint), which interconnected at San Diego. Each of these regional networks also internetted with countless local campus networks, as Unix machines appeared by the hundreds in college labs and faculty offices. This federated network of networks became the seed crystal of the modern Internet. ARPANET had connected only well-funded computer researchers at elite academic sites, but by 1990 almost anyone in post-secondary education in the U.S – faculty or student – could get online.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                <p>Github recently launched their new <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">Github codespaces</a> service - an online, in-browser Integrated Development Environment powered by <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>. This environment allows someone to quickly load a virtual machine and a complete code editing interface, that is all accessible within the browser without having to install anything on the users machine. If you are familiar with products like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/">Amazon Web Services’s Cloud 9 IDE</a> or its predecessor C9.io this will probably feel very familiar.</p>

<p>As one of the lucky few who were given access to the GitHub Codespaces beta program I had the opportunity to test it out and offer my thoughts on behalf of the Aristotle team below.</p>

<h2 id="first-impressions">First impressions</h2>
<p>There were a few small changes that needed to be done to the <a href="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/">Aristotle Metadata home page</a>, (including making this blogpost) and it was easy opening a Codespace to start working. Opening a code space for a project is literally as easy as GitHub says - click “Open in Codespace” on a repository and it does the rest - no need to configuring or decommission a server, its all handled for you.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/aristotle/images/blog/codespaces/codespaces-opening-project.png" alt="How to open Codespaces" title="How to open Codespaces"></p>

<p><a href="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/">Our website</a> is a basic <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> static site, and offers a great basic test of whats available in Codespaces already. Loading a fresh Codespace took less than 2 minutes, which is comparable to AWS Cloud9. As someone who used Cloud9 when it was still C9.io, Codespaces reminded me a lot of that - its a simple way to open an editor and a virtual machine for a GitHub project.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/about-codespaces">documentation for Codespaces</a> is also great. What I didn’t know is that GitHub can also <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/personalizing-codespaces-for-your-account">load your dotfiles directly into each new Codespace</a>, so your preferences (<code>.bashrc</code> and similar files) will follow you across Codespaces.</p>

<h2 id="editing-files">Editing files</h2>
<p>Being based on Visual Studio Code, <strong>Yes, Codespaces has a Dark Mode</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/aristotle/images/blog/codespaces/codespaces-dark-editor.png" alt="Default Codespaces Editor" title="Default Codespaces Editor"></p>

<p>Although if you are using different browsers to open your workspace (which I had to do for reasons below), your colour scheme preferences won’t follow you across browsers. I’m not a regular user of Visual Studio Code, but it seems to includes all the standard features you expect from a browser, such as syntax highlighting, VIm and Emac keybindings (which work very well in browser), and autosave which is enabled by default, and I promptly disabled.</p>

<p>You can also drag-and-drop files from your local machine into Codespaces filesystem, and preview and edit certain non-text files in the browser, such as images, both of which are really handy for web development.</p>

<h2 id="terminal-emulator">Terminal emulator</h2>
<p>Codespaces includes a powerful terminal editor that seems to be based on a stock Debian image. The only thing I didn’t like is that separate terminals are accessed using a dropdown instead of with tabs, but this is a minor detail.</p>

<p><strong>Big news: Docker is here</strong>, and it works well.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/aristotle/images/blog/codespaces/codespaces-docker.png" alt="Docker in Codespaces" title="Docker in Codespaces"></p>

<p>One of my biggest issues with C9.io was the lack of Docker support, which was solved when AWS bought Cloud9 but comes with the extra complexity of configuring your Amazon machine. So being able to simply run Docker in the browser is great. Docker-compose isn’t installed by default, and I haven’t had a chance to see how that works.</p>

<p>The only issue I found with the terminal emulator was you can only paste with right-click into Chromium-based browsers like Chrome or Edge, <em>Firefox users beware</em>.</p>

<h2 id="serving-sites">Serving sites</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace">Codepsaces does a great job of handling port forwarding for you </a>, so you can simply start you server process (on a non-Port 80 port) and if GitHub detects a <code>localhost:PORT</code> combination it makes it accessible for you by clicking on the URL, as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/aristotle/images/blog/codespaces/codespaces-jekyll.png" alt="Jekyll in Codespaces" title="Jekyll in Codespaces"></p>

<p>Loading and reloading Jekyll was fast, and by the time I clicked the forwarded link or switched tabs to preview changes to the site, it was already refreshed. 
<del><strong>However, this is another Chromium-only feature the clikcable port forward links don’t work in Firefox</strong></del>  this seems to be fixed now in Firefox.</p>

<p>One other minor issue is you can’t open your site in a private window or different browser to view the server without logging into GitHub. This isn’t a huge issue, but if you are trying to view what your site looks like under different browser or when logged out it can be troublesome.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/aristotle/images/blog/codespaces/codespaces-final-site.png" alt="Aristotle Home Page in Codespaces" title="Aristotle Home Page in Codespaces"></p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p><strong>This is amazing</strong> and may become my default IDE - as a co-founder who is spending less time as a developer, and more time in meetings, writing emails, strategy papers, letters and tenders, <em>this is just amazing</em>! Most of my daily tools are Windows based, so I’ve been spending a lot of time getting Windows Subsystem for Linux working alongside the rest of my daily workflow, which comes with its own headaches. So being able to quickly checkout a branch, make changes and take some load of my local machine seems very promising.</p>

<p>There are a lot of features here to review that I haven’t had a chance to look at, including collaborative workspaces, Git integration and connecting with a local version of Visual Studio, but from a quick glance everything works smoothly.</p>

<p>Overall, it’s an extremely quick way to get started on a project, and I look forward to writing an update after I’ve had a chance getting the Aristotle Metadata Registry software, with all its many dependencies, running in codespaces under Docker-compose.</p>

<p><strong>The Aristotle Metadata Registry is no stranger to cloud innovation</strong>. If you want to learn how to access a cloud-hosted metadata registry as simple as Github’s Codespaces <a href="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/contact.html">get in contact with us</a>.</p>

August 31, 2020 | https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-0/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-0/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>In my <a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/lisp/">last series</a>, I wrote about building a
Lisp interpreter. This time, we’re going to write a Lisp compiler.</p>

<p>This series is an adaptation of Abdulaziz Ghuloum’s excellent paper <a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/assets/img/11-ghuloum.pdf">An
Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction</a>, with several key differences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Our implementation is in C, instead of Scheme</li>
  <li>Our implementation generates machine code directly, instead of generating
text assembly</li>
  <li>Our implementation may omit some runtime data structures</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/ghuloum">my implementation</a> for reference,
but note that it may be incomplete and also may look a little bit different
than the compiler detailed in these posts.</p>

<p>You probably have a couple questions, like <em>why Lisp?</em> and <em>why compile
directly to x86-64?</em> and <em>why C?</em> and <em>come on, another Lisp series?</em>, and
those are all very reasonable questions that will be answered in due time.</p>

<p>I want to implement this compiler in another language than Scheme because it
will prevent me from copying too much of the code from the paper. Even though
the paper doesn’t actually contain the source for the whole compiler (most of
it is, after all, left as exercises for the reader), I think I will learn a lot
more when I have to write all of the code by myself. I get to make my own
mistakes and you get to watch me make and fix them in “real” time.</p>

<p>I also don’t want to generate text assembly, but those reasons are a little
different than my reason for choosing another implementation language:</p>

<p>First, I think that would be harder to test: I want to have an in-process unit
test suite that compiles Lisp programs and executes them on-the-fly. Shelling
out to a system assembler like <code>as</code> or <code>nasm</code> would be somewhat error prone.
What if the person building this doesn’t have the assembler I need? Sure, I
could also write a small assembler as part of this compiler, but that’s a lot
of work.  Harder than just generating x86-64 directly, perhaps.</p>

<p>Second, I want to learn more about machine architecture. While <code>add a, b</code> seems
like one machine instruction, it could probably be encoded in 50 different ways
depending on whether <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are registers, stack locations, other memory
addresses, immediates, which registers they are, etc. Shelling out to an
assembler abstracts a lot of that detail away. I <em>want</em> to get my hands dirty.
Hopefully you do, too.</p>

<p>I chose Lisp because that’s what the Ghuloum paper uses, and because Lisp can
be represented as a small, compact, dynamically typed language. Many
interpreter implementations are under 200 lines. I don’t think this compiler
will be that short, though.</p>

<h3 id="background-knowledge">Background knowledge</h3>

<p>In order to get the most out of this series, I recommend having at least passing
familiarity with the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>C or a C-like language</li>
  <li>some kind of assembly language</li>
  <li><em>Abstract Syntax Trees</em> and recursive tree traversal</li>
  <li>no particular aversion to parentheses</li>
</ul>

<p>Having the background helps your focus be more on the bigger picture than the
minutia, but it is by no means required. I expect most of this series to be
fairly readable. If it’s not, that’s a bug and you should report it to me.</p>

<h3 id="structure-of-the-series">Structure of the series</h3>

<p>I plan on writing this series in installments where each installment adds a
feature of some kind. Maybe that feature is a new bit of Lisp functionality, or
maybe it’s a refactoring of the compiler, or maybe it’s a compiler
optimization.</p>

<p>For this reason, each post will tend to depend on the code and understanding
from previous posts. As such, I recommend reading the series in order. I’ll
still try to keep the big ideas understandable for those who don’t.</p>

<p>At each stage of the compiler, we should have a battery of tests that ensure
that the features we have already build continue to work as expected.</p>

<p>I plan on adhering to this rough plan:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Compile integers</li>
  <li>Compile other immediate constants (booleans, ASCII characters, the empty
list)</li>
  <li>Compile unary primitives (<code>add1</code>, <code>sub1</code>, <code>integer-&gt;char</code>, <code>char-&gt;integer</code>,
<code>null?</code>, <code>zero?</code>, etc)</li>
  <li>Compile binary primitives (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>=</code>, etc)</li>
  <li>Compile local variables (<code>let</code>-expressions)</li>
  <li>Compile conditional expressions (<code>if</code>-expressions)</li>
  <li>Compile heap allocation (<code>cons</code>, strings, symbols, etc)</li>
  <li>Compile <code>label</code> procedure calls</li>
  <li>Compile closures</li>
  <li>Add tail-call optimization</li>
  <li>Compile complex constants (<code>quote</code>)</li>
  <li>Compile variable assignment (<code>set!</code>)</li>
  <li>Add macro expander</li>
  <li>Add extended forms using macro expander (<code>let*</code>, <code>letrec</code>, etc)</li>
  <li>Add support for libraries and separate compilation</li>
  <li>Compile foreign function calls</li>
  <li>Add error checking to primitives and procedure calls</li>
  <li>Compile variable-arity procedures (aka varargs)</li>
  <li>Compile <code>apply</code></li>
  <li>Add output ports (kind of like <code>FILE*</code>)</li>
  <li>Add <code>write</code>, <code>display</code></li>
  <li>Add input ports</li>
  <li>Add a tokenizer in Lisp</li>
  <li>Add a reader in Lisp</li>
  <li>Add a Lisp interpreter (or compiler) in Lisp</li>
</ol>

<p>With optional add-ons also described in the initial paper:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Big numbers, IEEE754 floats, complex numbers</li>
  <li>User-defined macros</li>
  <li>A module system</li>
  <li>Heap overflow handler and garbage collector</li>
  <li>Stack overflow handler</li>
  <li>Improved code generation</li>
</ul>

<p>And optional add-ons not described in the original paper:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An intermediate representation for optimization</li>
  <li>Generate executables and write them to disk</li>
  <li>An interpreter with optional just-in-time compiler</li>
</ul>

<p>You may have noticed that this is a <em>lot</em> of steps, and there are some steps
that I intend to take but have completely omitted because I want to roll them
into other posts. Things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Code generation infrastructure (a writable buffer, <code>mmap</code>/<code>mprotect</code>, etc)</li>
  <li>Compiler data structures (variable environments, label environments, etc)</li>
  <li>Testing infrastructure (unit testing, integration testing)</li>
</ul>

<p>So it’s really actually more work than I listed above. This series may take a
long time. It may take some twisty turns. It may take some shortcuts. But there
is good news: I’ve already written the compiler up to compiling heap allocation
(still working on procedure calls), and even if I don’t finish this series
there is still Ghuloum’s excellent paper to learn from.</p>

<h3><span id="Business_Model"></span>Business Model<span></span></h3>



<p>Like so many high-flying growth companies, Fastly leverages the “buy revenues” business model, which reflects market participants’ <sup data-mfn="2">2</sup><span data-mfn="2"> (a nontrivial number of entrepreneurs, management/boards, and investors)</span> psychology that is dubbed <a aria-label="FOMO (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-we-seeing-a-fomo-rally-2020-04-06" target="_blank">FOMO</a> (“Fear of Missing Out”) and is under-girded by the Fed’s <a aria-label="POMO (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/permanent-open-market-operations.asp" target="_blank">POMO</a> (“Fed’s Permanent Open Market Operations”). </p>



<p>We understand this is our environment, so “when in Rome….” Or, in other words, “<a aria-label="don't fight the FED (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-the-meaning-of-dont-fight-the-fed-2466886" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">don’t fight the FED</a>.”</p>



<h4><span id="Buying_Revenues"></span>Buying Revenues<span></span></h4>



<p>For example, It spent 33% of revenue on sales &amp; marketing in the quarter ending June 2020 (<a aria-label="page 11 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://investors.fastly.com/files/doc_financials/2020/q2/2Q20-Shareholder-Letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">page 11</a> of its 2Q 2020 shareholder letter). That’s called buying revenues, Dear Friends.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Sales and marketing expenses were $25 million in Q2 2020, representing <strong>33% of revenue</strong>, up from $17 million, or 37% of revenue in Q2 2019. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in headcount and personnel related costs to drive future enterprise customer acquisition growth, as well as to encourage further use of our platform by existing customers.</p><cite>Fastly’s 2Q 2020 shareholder letter</cite></blockquote></figure>







<p>Nevertheless, this market environment as described does reward people and businesses that provide <a href="https://coventryleague.com/blogentary/do-you-need-a-contract-cfo-or-investment-banking-kiosk/" target="_blank" aria-label="services related to M&amp;A (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">services related to M&amp;A</a> and <a href="https://coventryleague.com/blogentary/refinance-loans-restructure-debt/" target="_blank" aria-label="strategic finance (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">strategic finance</a>, including Coventry League.</p>

<p id="covid-bump">So, it appears S3 Partners was at least partially correct in that the huge short positions in Fastly late last year contributed to the massive <a href="#fastlystock">run-up in FSLY’s stock price in 2020</a> – in addition to the <strong><a href="#covid-bump">Covid Bump™</a></strong> that we alluded to earlier in this post.</p>

        <p>Web pages are ghosts: they’re like images projected onto a wall. They aren’t durable. If you turn off the projector (i.e. web server), the picture disappears. If you know how to run a projector, and you can keep it running <em>all the time</em>, you can have a web site.</p><p>But as soon as there’s no one to babysit the projector, it eventually gets turned off, and everything you made with it goes away. If the outage is permanent, the disappearance is too. This is happening all the time, as servers fail, or companies are acquired and shut down.<label for="2914955557482844267"></label><span>“When Yahoo! switched off the servers for GeoCities, the Web posting service, on Oct. 27, some 7 million of the Internet’s first websites went dark forever.” <a href="http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1936645,00.html">Time Magazine, 9 Nov 2009</a></span></p><p>I think about this a lot. And I’m not even thinking about the fate of the Entire Internet. Just the small sites I care about, the blogs and small publications. It’s sad to think that when their authors are gone, all their writing will eventually disappear. (And don’t tell me about the Internet Archive—that’s just another backup projector, run by volunteers. We have no assurance that it’ll still be running a year or ten years from now.) Then, too, I also think about my own web sites. Babysitting that projector can be a lot of work sometimes. If it’s all going to go up in smoke as soon as I’m unable to work on it anymore, then publishing on the web seems, really, quite futile.</p><p>The obvious contrast is with hard-copies: things written on paper or printed in books. We can still read books and pamphlets printed five hundred years ago, even though the presses that made them have long since been destroyed.</p><p>How can we give the average independent web writer that kind of permanence?</p><figure><label for="97268267117236911">⊕</label><span>From <a href="http://craigmod.com/journal/post_artifact/">Post-Artifact Books and Publishing</a> by Craig Mod (<span>CC</span> License)</span><img src="https://thelocalyarn.com/excursus/secretary/posts/img/post-artifact-full-large.png"></figure><p>When Craig Mod drew this diagram, he was thinking about this issue the other way around. He was focused on traditional print publishing, and how the web would change that process. We started with print books, he said, and by <em>adding digital publishing</em> we can create this much fuller realm of author-reader interaction. It’s a brilliant and well-considered <a href="http://craigmod.com/journal/post_artifact/">piece</a>. It has this flip-side, though, which we web publishers don’t often talk about: <strong>books can be improved by the web, but the web can also be improved by books.</strong> Digital publishing could use more “Immutable Artifacts”, because <strong>artifacts are durable</strong>.</p><p>Of course there’s a reason why, in all our discussion about CMSs, about design, markup, semantics, and programming, we almost never include books. The <em>tools</em> we use don’t even consider book publication, much less integrate it. But they could. And that’s what this website, <a href="https://thelocalyarn.com/excursus/secretary/index.html"><em>Secretary of Foreign Relations</em></a>, is really about.</p><p><span>This site</span> is basically a rough, first-effort experiment in creating a mini-publication that realizes both sides of Craig’s diagram above. It exists simultaneously as a web site <em>and</em> as a printed, bound book—a book that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/152396216X">you can order right now</a> and have delivered to your door.<label for="-906686242337141937"></label><span>This being a basic proof-of-concept, the book’s cover is extremely generic, and the price is set as low as Amazon KDP will allow me to go ($5.38 in this case). At this point, only the content in the <em>Flatland</em> portion of the site is included in the print edition.</span></p><p>What do I mean by “exists simultaneously”? I mean that the production of the printed book is, for the most part, not some separate workflow from the production of the web site. I’m not copying text from the web site and pasting it into InDesign, for example. When I enter the command to generate the HTML files that make up this site, the complete PDF file for the book is generated at the same time, from the same source and by the same software.<label for="-2475282464837853604"></label><span>See more details on the <a href="https://thelocalyarn.com/excursus/secretary/colophon.html">Colophon</a> page and on <a href="https://github.com/otherjoel/try-pollen">the project’s Github repository</a>.</span> I can upload this PDF file to Amazon KDP, who will print a copy for anyone who cares to order it.</p><p>Why a book? Of course anyone can load a web page in their browser and send it to their inkjet printer. But, seriously: no one does that, even for websites they feel quite attached to. Even if they did, and even if the printout looked really nice (very much not the norm for web pages), who wants to save a sheaf of loose papers? A book is the best kind of printed artifact, and with print-on-demand services you can have them made with reasonable quality at a very low cost.</p><p><span>So here’s</span> how this will play out. After I reimplement my other web sites using this system, I’ll be making book editions of those sites available for free to anyone who cares to request a copy<label for="-2781867892142790827"></label><span>This was what I had in mind originally with my <a href="https://thelocalyarn.com/article/the-annual-yarn-2011"><em>Annual Yarn</em> project</a>, which I hope to resume.</span>. This is a win for both sides. The reader gets a permanent, well-designed copy of something they have enjoyed. And <em>I</em> get the satisfaction of knowing those books are out there, being held in various places by people who (at least somewhat) care about them. The point is not to make money selling books, but to sow the writing as far as it can go—even knowing it has very narrow appeal and no market value. It’s a way to write purely for the joy of it, and still know that the work will easily outlive me. My writing will not depend for its continuance on someone maintaining backups and complicated hosting arrangements.</p><p>So much for my own stuff. But my larger, longer-shot hope is that others will start thinking about doing this too: <em>building</em> and <em>making use of</em> tools that integrate print publishing with web publishing. This goes back to the concern I talked about earlier. I don’t want the writing on small, independent sites to disappear. Not only do I want it not to disappear, there’s a good deal of it that I would like to have on my bookshelf. Some of those authors and those sites are gone already.<label for="-3393301825901819575"></label><span>“I don’t know Mark Pilgrim personally. I only know his work and it’s excellent. […] Mark is alive, but online he’s gone. He committed ‘infosuicide’ last week. All of his websites are Gone.

The services and technology we need are already sitting there, ready to print those books for us. Supposing we were able to adopt this kind of approach, it’s easy to suppose we could develop a culture of sharing our books with each other. Our writing would be durable again. That would be a lovely thing.</p><p><label for="558553613229387845">⊕</label><span><em>Sonnet</em> by John Keats</span></p><div><pre>When I have fears that I may cease to be<br>  Before my pen has glean’d my teeming brain,<br>Before high-piléd books, in charact’ry,<br>  Hold like rich garners the full ripen’d grain…</pre></div>

          <p>GitHub <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2020-08-13-phishing-resistant-sms-autofill/">recently announced</a> it was adopting <a href="https://wicg.github.io/sms-one-time-codes/#origin-bound-one-time-codes">a draft standard for the format of SMS one-time passwords</a> (e.g. two-factor authentication codes) to help thwart phishing attacks.</p>
        </div><div>
          <p><strong>SMS Considerations</strong></p>
<p>Before we get to the details it’s important to note that using SMS for one-time passwords is <strong>less secure</strong> than using a dedicated app such as <a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a> as the approach is susceptible to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam">SIM-swap attacks</a>. They’re also l<strong>ess convenient</strong> – sometimes the messages take a while to arrive and won’t be received at all if the user is out of mobile phone range or has swapped their SIM card while traveling overseas.</p>
<p>That said, one-time passwords via SMS matter – they’re the most common way to deliver 2FA codes because they work with the technology that users already have. Downloading a dedicated app just to manage 2FA codes is beyond many users.</p>
<p><strong>How it Works</strong></p>
<p>The idea behind the standard is a predefined SMS (text message) format that looks like this:</p>

    <p>I watched the talk
“<a href="https://vimeo.com/230142234">Platform as a Reflection of Values: Joyent, Node.js and beyond</a>”
by Bryan Cantrill, and I think he was able to put into words something I already
felt for some time: if there’s no piece of software out there that reflects your
values, it’s time for you to build that software<sup id="fnref:talk-time" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:talk-time">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I kind of agree with what he said, because this is already happening to me. I
long for a database with a certain set of values, and for a few years I was just
waiting for someone to finally write it. After watching his talk, Bryan is
saying to me: “time to stop waiting, and start writing it yourself”.</p>

<p>So let me try to give an overview of such database, and go over its values.</p>



<p>I want a database that allows me to create decentralized client-side
applications that can sync data.</p>

<p>The best one-line description I can give right now is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s sort of like PouchDB, Git, Datomic, SQLite and Mentat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A more descriptive version could be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An embedded, immutable, syncable relational database.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s go over what I mean by each of those aspects one by one.</p>



<p>I think the server-side database landscape is diverse and mature enough for
my needs (even though I end up choosing SQLite most of the time), and what I’m
after is a database to be embedded on client-side applications itself, be it
desktop, browser, mobile, etc.</p>

<p>The purpose of such database is not to keep some local cache of data in case of
lost connectivity: we have good solutions for that already. It should serve as
the source of truth, and allow the application to work on top of it.</p>

<p><a href="https://sqlite.org/index.html"><strong>SQLite</strong></a> is a great example of that: it is a very powerful
relational database that runs <a href="https://sqlite.org/whentouse.html">almost anywhere</a>. What I miss
from it that SQLite doesn’t provide is the ability to run it on the browser:
even though you could compile it to WebAssembly, it assumes a POSIX filesystem
that would have to be emulated.</p>

<p><a href="https://pouchdb.com/"><strong>PouchDB</strong></a> is another great example: it’s a full reimplementation of
<a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> that targets JavaScript environments, mainly the browser and
Node.js. However I want a tool that can be deployed anywhere, and not limit its
applications to places that already have a JavaScript runtime environment, or
force the developer to bundle a JavaScript runtime environment with their
application. This is true for GTK+ applications, command line programs, Android
apps, etc.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mentat"><strong>Mentat</strong></a> was an interesting project, but its reliance on SQLite
makes it inherit most of the downsides (and benefits too) of SQLite itself.</p>

<p>Having such a requirement imposes a different approach to storage: we have to
decouple the knowledge about the intricacies of storage from the usage of
storage itself, so that a module (say query processing) can access storage
through an API without needing to know about its implementation. This allows
the database to target a POSIX filesystems storage API and an IndexedDB storage
API, and make the rest of the code agnostic about storage. PouchDB has such
mechanism (called <a href="https://pouchdb.com/adapters.html">adapters</a>) and Datomic has them too (called
<a href="https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/storage.html">storage services</a>).</p>

<p>This would allow the database to adapt to where it is embedded: when targeting
the browser the IndexedDB storage API would provide the persistence layer
that the database requires, and similarly the POSIX filesystem storage API would
provide the persistence layer when targeting POSIX systems (like desktops,
mobile, etc.).</p>

<p>But there’s also an extra restriction that comes from by being embedded: it
needs to provide and embeddable artifact, most likely a binary library object
that exposes a C compatible FFI, similar to
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/amalgamation.html">how SQLite does</a>. Bundling a full runtime environment is
possible, but doesn’t make it a compelling solution for embedding. This rules
out most languages, and leaves us with C, Rust, Zig, and similar options that
can target POSIX systems and WebAssembly.</p>



<p>Being immutable means that only new information is added, no in-place update
ever happens, and nothing is ever deleted.</p>

<p>Having an immutable database presents us with similar trade-offs found in
persistent data structures, like lack of coordination when doing reads, caches
being always coherent, and more usage of space.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.datomic.com/"><strong>Datomic</strong></a> is the go to database example of this: it will only add
information (datoms) and allows you to query them in a multitude of ways. Stuart
Halloway calls it “accumulate-only” over “append-only”<sup id="fnref:accumulate-only" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:accumulate-only">2</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s accumulate-only, it is not append-only. So append-only, most people when
they say that they’re implying something physical about what happens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also a database can be append-only and overwrite existing information with new
information, by doing clean-ups of “stale” data. I prefer to adopt the
“accumulate-only” naming and approach.</p>

<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/"><strong>Git</strong></a> is another example of this: new commits are always added on top
of the previous data, and it grows by adding commits instead of replacing
existing ones.</p>

<p>Git repositories can only grow in size, and that is not only an acceptable
condition, but also one of the reasons to use it.</p>

<p>All this means that no in-place updates happens on data, and the database will
be much more concerned about how compact and efficiently it stores data than how
fast it does writes to disk. Being embedded, the storage limitation is either a)
how much storage the device has or b) how much storage was designed for the
application to consume. So even though the database could theoretically operate
with hundreds of TBs, a browser page or mobile application wouldn’t have access
to this amount of storage. SQLite even <a href="https://sqlite.org/limits.html">says</a> that it does
support approximately 280 TBs of data, but those limits are untested.</p>

<p>The upside of keeping everything is that you can have historical views of your
data, which is very powerful. This also means that applications should turn this
off when not relevant<sup id="fnref:no-history" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:no-history">3</a></sup>.</p>



<p>This is a frequent topic when talking about offline-first solutions. When
building applications that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>can fully work offline,</li>
  <li>stores data,</li>
  <li>propagates that data to other application instances,</li>
</ul>

<p>then you’ll need a conflict resolution strategy to handle all the situations
where different application instances disagree. Those application instances
could be a desktop and a browser version of the same application, or the same
mobile app in different devices.</p>

<p>A three-way merge seems to be the best approach, on top of which you could add
application specific conflict resolution functions, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pick the change with higher timestamp;</li>
  <li>if one change is a delete, pick it;</li>
  <li>present the diff on the screen and allow the user to merge them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some databases try to make this “easy”, by choosing a strategy for you, but I’ve
found that different applications require different conflict resolution
strategies. Instead, the database should leave this up to the user to decide,
and provide tools for them to do it.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_(version_control)"><strong>Three-way merges in version control</strong></a> are the best example,
performing automatic merges when possible and asking the user to resolve
conflicts when they appear.</p>

<p>The unit of conflict for a version control system is a line of text. The
database equivalent would probably be a single attribute, not a full entity or a
full row.</p>

<p>Making all the conflict resolution logic be local should allow the database to
have encrypted remotes similar to how <a href="https://spwhitton.name/tech/code/git-remote-gcrypt/">git-remote-gcrypt</a>
adds this functionality to Git. This would enable users to sync the application
data across devices using an untrusted intermediary.</p>



<p>I want the power of relational queries on the client applications.</p>

<p>Most of the arguments against traditional table-oriented relational databases
are related to write performance, but those don’t apply here. The bottlenecks
for client applications usually aren’t write throughput. Nobody is interested in
differentiating between 1 MB/s or 10 MB/s when you’re limited to 500 MB total.</p>

<p>The relational model of the database could either be based on SQL and tables
like in SQLite, or maybe <a href="https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/query.html">datalog</a> and <a href="https://docs.datomic.com/cloud/whatis/data-model.html#datoms">datoms</a> like in
Datomic.</p>



<p>Now let’s try to translate the aspects above into values, as suggested by Bryan
Cantrill.</p>



<p>Being able to target so many different platforms is a bold goal, and the
embedded nature of the database demands portability to be a core value.</p>



<p>When the local database becomes the source of truth of the application, it must
provide consistency guarantees that enables applications to rely on it.</p>



<p>The database should empower applications to slice and dice the data in any way
it wants to.</p>



<p>Since I can’t find any database that fits these requirements, I’ve finally come
to terms with doing it myself.</p>

<p>It’s probably going to take me a few years to do it, and making it portable
between POSIX and IndexedDB will probably be the biggest challenge. I got myself
a few books on databases to start.</p>

<p>I wonder if I’ll ever be able to get this done.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><strong>TL;DR: <a href="https://tweet.photo/">Tweet Photo</a> is a software service to automatically post your Instagram photos to Twitter. It started out as a Medium post, turned into a software product, and eventually got acquired for $30,000.</strong></p>

<p>Continue reading for the full story on how I validated the idea, built a simple product, grew it to thousands of active users, tried monetizing it, and eventually sold it.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="-blog-post-as-an-mvp">📝 Blog post as an MVP</h3>

<p>People always tell you: start with an MVP, prove there’s demand for your product
before investing all your time into something nobody wants. In my experience
that’s good advice, but it seems many successful products often start out as
accidental MVPs. Tweet Photo is a perfect example of this.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever tried posting an Instagram photo to Twitter, you might have noticed it looks like this:</p>



<p>Just a link. No photo. Useless. I don’t know the politics behind this, but I believe Facebook is the one that disabled the photo previews at some point. So now we’re stuck with useless tweets.</p>

<p>You can find many workarounds using automation services like <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> and <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>. Because I was unhappy with all solutions, I decided to write my own article in May 2017:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://medium.com/@marckohlbrugge/a-better-way-to-post-your-instagram-photos-to-twitter-7f3a04a37d89">A better way to post your Instagram photos to Twitter</a></strong></p>

<p>Turns out I struck a chord. To this date that post has been read 70,000 times. Over three years later it continues to get over a 1,000 hits per month.</p>

<p><img src="https://marc.io/images/tweet-photo-acquired/medium.png#full" alt=""></p>

<p>If you read the post though, you will notice how complicated the setup is. So I figured there might be an opportunity for a product here. I knew there was an interest, but I didn’t know if I could monetize it.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until <a href="https://hi.yuko.im/">Yuko</a> posted <a href="https://wip.chat/questions/what-is-the-best-way-to-repost-instagram-contents-to-twitter">this question</a> on WIP:</p>

<p><a href="https://wip.chat/questions/what-is-the-best-way-to-repost-instagram-contents-to-twitter"><img src="https://marc.io/images/tweet-photo-acquired/wip.png" alt=""></a></p>

<p>She mentioned she’d happily pay $20/mo for Zapier to tweet her photos. That got me thinking, maybe it’s a product that can be monetized after all. Plus, I already got the leads coming in via the blog post. I could funnel them through to this new service instead.</p>

<p>Rather than further validating the business model, I challenged myself to build a prototype over the next couple of days.</p>

<h3 id="-building-the-product">🛠 Building the Product</h3>

<p>I believe in using the tools you’re familiar with, so I used Ruby on Rails to build the product.</p>

<p>Tweet Photo is technically quite simple. I’m basically glueing together the Instagram and Twitter APIs. I was able to do most of the work with open-source libraries.</p>

<p>I finished the product in just over a week during my spare time.</p>

<p>I initially went with the <strong>tweetphoto.icu</strong> domain name because it was only $1. That’s how much faith I had in the product I guess. But shortly after I decided if I’m going to do this, I might as well do it right and purchased <strong>tweet.photo for $130</strong>. It might not seem like a lot of money, but with all the projects I start things thing start to add up 😅. In hindsight I’m really glad I got this domain name…</p>

<p>I wouldn’t realize it until later, but the key feature I added was appending <em>“via tweet.photo”</em> to every tweet. This single piece of text would prove to be the driving factor of Tweet Photo’s growth.</p>



<h3 id="-time-to-launch">🚀 Time to launch</h3>

<p>December 12th, 2018, 11 days after Yuko’s post, I launched:</p>

<div><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🖼👉🐦 I made a new thing called <a href="https://t.co/LMVsrPNaFV">https://t.co/LMVsrPNaFV</a> ✨</p><p>Automagically post your Instagram photos and videos to your Twitter account. Your media will be embedded in the tweet, unlike Instagram's built-in feature.</p></div>— Marc (@marckohlbrugge) <a href="https://twitter.com/marckohlbrugge/status/1072869470866034688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2018</a></blockquote>

</div>

<p>It got featured on <a href="https://betalist.com/startups/tweet-photo">BetaList</a> and
<a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/tweet-photo">Product Hunt</a>.</p>

<p>At the end day of the launch over 100 accounts were created with combined total of over 100 published tweets.</p>

<p>The product worked! 🥳</p>

<h3 id="-growth">📈 Growth</h3>

<p>As time went on the userbase continued growing.</p>

<p>Unlike most software services, the retention of Tweet Photo was basically 100%. Meaning that anyone that signed up, was likely to continue using it for a long time. Once signed up, everything was automated after all.</p>

<p>Combine that with the “via tweet.photo” in every tweet and you’ve got steady growth:</p>

<p><img src="https://marc.io/images/tweet-photo-acquired/growth.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Here’s a screenshot of the <a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/">Simple Analytics</a> dashboard showing how tweets are driving new leads to the homepage:</p>

<p><img src="https://marc.io/images/tweet-photo-acquired/tweets.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We even got some major Hollywood celebrities using the service. In fact, Tweet
Photo came a hot topic amongst her fans. Driving even more sign ups.</p>



<h3 id="-monetization">💸 Monetization</h3>

<p>Okay, so we’ve got decent growth. But what about the revenue?</p>

<p>This was a lot harder. When I launched Tweet Photo I included a $19/year PRO subscription that would remove the “via tweet.photo” branding. I figured if people care enough about their Twitter profile to not want to show that link, they might be willing to pay.</p>

<p>People with more Twitter followers would pay more. After all if someone has a million Twitter followers it’s worth a lot more to me if they promote Tweet Photo in every tweet.</p>

<p><img src="https://marc.io/images/tweet-photo-acquired/stripe.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I eventually switched to monthly pricing starting at $5/mo. I figured churn rate would be really low anyway, so it would be better to charge monthly. Paying $5/mo instead $19 for a year upfront is a lower commitment for the customer, but ultimately 3x the revenue for me.</p>

<p>Unfortunately MRR grew very slowly. It’s about $135 MRR right now.</p>

<p>I think the main problem is that the the free plan is already very compelling. So it’s hard to convince people to upgrade.</p>

<h3 id="-now-what">🤔 Now what?</h3>

<p>While I had plenty of ideas for improving monetization, including removing the free plan altogether, it didn’t seem worth my time trying to grow a product that’s only doing $135 MRR. Even if I could 10x that, it’s still a low amount compared to my other products.</p>

<p>So over time I spent less time and attention on Tweet Photo. It continued to grow organically.</p>

<p>Another reason I didn’t want to invest too much time is the inherent platform-risk of building an API-powered product. I was dependent on both Twitter and Facebook continuing to provide me access to their API. They could revoke it at any time and Tweet Photo might be doomed.</p>

<p>Earlier this year Facebook did actually deprecate one of their APIs I was relying on, requiring me to upgrade my integration to use a different API.</p>

<h3 id="-acquisition-offer">💬 Acquisition offer</h3>

<p>In April, <a href="https://twitter.com/kevntz">Kevin</a> reached out to me asking if I was interested in selling Tweet Photo. He had a strategic interest with his other products <a href="https://creatorkit.com/">CreatorKit</a> and <a href="https://topnine.co/">Top Nine</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://marc.io/images/tweet-photo-acquired/dm.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Of course the question of valuation quickly came up. Typically a SaaS product is sold for 3-4x annual revenue. In Tweet Photo’s case that would be around $5,000. But that didn’t factor in the many free users that required almost zero customer support, but drove continued growth.</p>

<p>If I were to sell it, it would need to be in the $xx,xxx range. Otherwise I’d prefer to just keep the service and see what happens. There’s always the possibility of another celebrity using it and it going viral.</p>

<h3 id="-valuation-of-30000">💰 Valuation of $30,000</h3>

<p>After some negotiation we ultimate settled on a purchase price of $30,000.</p>

<p>The first $10,000 is cash upfront with no strings attached. The remaining $20,000 is contingent on Tweet Photo making that much (or more) in revenue within 24 months of the acquisition.</p>

<p>We both ran the numbers and we believe that with the full weight of <a href="https://creatorkit.com/">CreatorKit</a> behind it, it seems very likely Tweet Photo will cross that revenue goal.</p>

<p>But you never know how things turn out, so this was a way to de-risk the acquisition for the buyer while still allowing for a higher purchase than you’d typically see for a $135 MRR business.</p>

<p>Ask me in a few months how things are going 🙂</p>

<h3 id="-whats-next">👀 What’s next</h3>

<p>The $10,000 is in the bank and we’re now finalizing the asset transfer.</p>

<p>In the coming months CreatorKit will likely start marketing it to their existing userbase and possibly improving the service as well. Since we still have a shared interest in growing Tweet Photo me and the CreatorKit team will keep in touch to see how things are going.</p>

<p>Personally, I will continue to focus on <a href="https://wip.chat/">WIP</a>, <a href="https://betalist.com/">BetaList</a>, and <a href="https://startup.jobs/">Startup Jobs</a>.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity has always been a weak point for me and after setting up Authy for the n-th time, it seemed as good a time as any to take a deep dive and figure out exactly how these time-based one-time password algorithms worked.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/L93OYxu_Tn62xRpz0FsJyBeFNl8sp79Q4O-Wq2SPIC8rabc82VqubJNThDYX-vFl8TwOQSZwf7bDVzwyAxSD28jkRq0jiOtmFGmYhULpW8G8_vrGN89Z3NuOUC27z9pgyuQ8OuCT" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Examples of different time-based one-time password algorithm implementations</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Basic Overview</h2>



<p>At the highest level, the passcodes you see on these apps are created using a TOTP (time-based one-time password) algorithm. The passcode is generated by combining a secret key from the service you’re authenticating with and the current time. That’s why the codes always expire after a few seconds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’ve set up these apps yourselves, you’ll probably remember having to scan a QR code somewhere along the way. That was the transfer of the secret key to your device’s secure keychain storage. This algorithm is agnostic of your SIM card, cellular network provider, or the make/model of your phone which makes it preferable to texting the user an authentication code. The algorithm’s only considerations are the current time and the shared secret key.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whenever you create a new account on a service that supports TOTP, they’ll generate a unique secret code for your user account. Then, the next time you’re logging in, the website will run the same algorithm the client runs to generate a passcode. If the passcode from the client matches the one generated by the server, the user is authenticated and the two-factor authentication process is complete.</p>



<h2>Algorithm Overview</h2>



<p>I’ve always found it easier to understand concepts like this by looking directly at the code. Let’s see what we’d need to do to implement a TOTP service from scratch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>TOTP is built off of a foundational algorithm called the HMAC-based One-time Password algorithm (HOTP), which we’ll need to understand first.&nbsp;</p>



<p>HMAC (hash-based message authentication code) is simply an algorithm that uses</p>



<ul><li>a cryptographic hash function (commonly <code>SHA1</code>)</li><li>a secret cryptographic key</li><li>a counter property (used to keep the client and server TOTP processes in sync)&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>to generate a unique time based authentication code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the distinction between TOTP and HOTP/HMAC isn’t totally clear yet, don’t worry. The main difference between TOTP and HOTP implementations involve the counter property. </p>



<p>HOTP’s counter is generally event-driven – for example, a button press would change the counter value. </p>

<p>Instead, in TOTP, the counter value is set based on the current timestamp. </p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the end to end flow.</p>



<p>First, we’ll create a counter from the timestamp. To avoid any additional complexity, we’ll just use time since epoch which is agnostic of timezones.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qnUpYNJC6jzwQHRa7fLcOSSX9Np-J4fUQLJujxqQ4SCIY79rLF_1OCVkt4Zv1yjAicMLlNriMRNxzkotqWDNO56eRxudqQvqmmRvxfRLUnUAECK0Lx9nvQY0npKNOObClF6rld0T" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>We need the number of Tx intervals to provide as input into the HOTP algorithm.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Simply put, the result of this calculation is to figure out how many Tx intervals away from the Unix epoch the user is. </p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>



<p>Here’s the Swift code thus far:&nbsp;</p>



<pre><code> let secretKey = "digitalbunker"
 let counter = "53283545"
 let hmacResult: String = secretKey.hmac(algorithm: .SHA1,  counter: counter)</code></pre>



<p>Now, <code>hmacResult</code> is equal to the following hashed value <code>1OyZRjbfhe+8womld8xldXo5V9M=</code>.</p>



<p>Next, Let’s convert this hashed value to a hexadecimal string:&nbsp;</p>



<pre><code>let data = Data(hmacResult.utf8)
let hexString = data.map{String(format:"%02x ", $0)}</code></pre>



<p><code>hexString</code> is now equal to <code>31 4f 79 5a 52 6a 62 66 68 65 2b 38 77 6f 6d 6c 64 38 78 6c 64 58 6f 35 56 39 4d 3d</code>.</p>



<p>This isn’t something we can ask the user to type in every single time they need to authenticate. Let’s see if we can find an easier way of representing this – a 6 digit code would be a great user-friendly alternative. </p>



<p>We’ll convert this hashed value to a shorter code through a process called dynamic truncation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dynamic truncation involves taking the lower 4 bits of the last byte of the hexadecimal string and using that as an offset into the string to help us create a 6 digit code while still remaining secure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last byte is <code>3d</code> which means the last 4 bits belong to the hexadecimal value for <code>d</code>  (decimal <code>13</code>).</p>



<p>Starting at an offset of <code>13</code>, we’ll grab the next 4 bytes:&nbsp;</p>



<p><code>31 4f 79 5a 52 6a 62 66 68 65 2b 38 77 <strong>6f 6d 6c 64</strong> 38 78 6c 64 58 6f 35 56 39 4d 3d</code></p>



<p>These bit operations are all part of the dynamic truncation process. We’re doing all of these manipulations to find a 6 digit code that is still as secure as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, we’ll convert <code>0x6f6d6c64</code> to decimal giving us <code>1869442148</code>. Since we just need a 6 digit code, we can take the last 6 digits <code>442148</code> and return that to the user.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, the server will do the exact same sequence of steps. More accurately, it’ll check the current 30-second interval, the previous one, and the next one to account for clock drift. If the server’s code matches the code the user entered, the user is authenticated.</p>



<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>



<p>TOPT and HOPT are both well-respected algorithms, but it’s important to mention the limitations. TOTP values can be phished like other passwords, but the attacker would have to be stealing the credentials in near real-time. </p>



<p>If this is a concern, you can shorten the TTL of the code. Standard TTL’s of TOTP codes can range from 10 – 30 seconds to account for latency (both client and server-side), unsynchronized clocks, and for user usability – feel free to tweak the TTL to suit your needs. However, if the attacker was able to find the shared secret key, they’d be able to create valid TOTP codes at will.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hope you’ve enjoyed this closer look at the TOTP algorithm and its nuances! If you like contact like this, please join our mailing list. If there’s any article requests or comments, please feel free to reach out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	People often ask me what I’m doing now.
</p><p>
	Each time I would type out a reply, describing where I’m at, what I’m focused on, and what I’m not.
</p><p>
	So earlier this year I added a <a href="https://sive.rs/now">/now</a> page to my site:

</p><p>
	A simple link.
	Easy to remember.
	Easy to type.
</p><p>
	It’s a nice reminder for myself, when I’m feeling unfocused.
	A public declaration of priorities.
</p><p>
	(If I’m doing something that’s not on my list, is it something I want to add, or something I want to stop?)
</p><p>
	It helps me <a href="https://sive.rs/no2">say no</a>, too.
	When I decline invitations, I point them to that page to let them know it’s not personal.
</p><p>
	Anyway, <strong>today</strong> the brilliant Gregory Brown announced that <strong>he added <a href="http://practicingdeveloper.com/now/">a /now page</a> to his site!</strong>
</p><p>
	I re-tweeted his announcement, and <strong>within hours, 8 more people made a /now page!</strong>

<p>If you’re ever tasked with implementing a cryptography feature–whether a high-level protocol or a low-level primitive–you will have to take special care to ensure you’re not leaking secret information through side-channels.</p>



<p>The descriptions of algorithms you learn in a classroom or textbook are not sufficient for real-world use. (Yes, that means your toy RSA implementation based on GMP from your computer science 101 class isn’t production-ready. <a href="https://www.cryptofails.com/post/75204435608/write-crypto-code-dont-publish-it">Don’t deploy it</a>.)</p>



<p>But what are these elusive side-channels exactly, and how do you prevent them? And in cases where you cannot prevent them, how can you mitigate the risk to your users?</p>

<h2 id="cryptographic-side-channels">Cryptographic Side-Channels</h2>



<p>The concept of a side-channel isn’t inherently cryptographic, <a href="https://www.cryptofails.com/post/70097430253/crypto-noobs-2-side-channel-attacks">as Taylor Hornby demonstrates</a>, but a side-channel can be a game over vulnerability in a system meant to maintain confidentiality (even if only for its cryptography keys).</p>



<p>Cryptographic side-channels allow an attacker to learn secret data from your cryptography system. To accomplish this, the attacker doesn’t necessarily study the system’s output (i.e. ciphertext); instead, they observe some other measurement, such as how much time or power was spent performing an operation, or what kind of electromagnetic radiation was emitted.</p>



<p><strong>Important:</strong> While being resistant to side-channels is a prerequisite for implementations to be secure, it isn’t in and of itself sufficient for security. The underlying design of the primitives, constructions, and high-level protocols needs to be secure first, and that requires <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2016/07/20/threat-modeling-for-applications">a clear and specific threat model</a> for what you’re building.</p>



<p>Constant-time ECDSA doesn’t help you if you <a href="https://medium.com/asecuritysite-when-bob-met-alice/not-playing-randomly-the-sony-ps3-and-bitcoin-crypto-hacks-c1fe92bea9bc">reuse k-values like it’s going out of style</a>, but variable-time ECDSA still leaks your secret key to anyone who cares to probe your response times. Secure cryptography is very demanding.</p>

<p>Timing side-channels leak secrets through <a href="https://blog.ircmaxell.com/2014/11/its-all-about-time.html">how much time it takes for an operation to complete</a>.</p>



<p>There are many different flavors of timing leakage, including:</p>



<ul><li>Fast-failing comparison functions (memcmp() in C)</li><li>Cache-timing vulnerabilities (e.g. <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/#side-channels">software AES</a>)</li><li>Memory access patterns</li><li>Conditional branches controlled by secrets</li></ul>



<p>The bad news about timing leaks is that they’re almost always visible to an attacker over the network (including <a href="https://www.cs.rice.edu/~dwallach/pub/crosby-timing2009.pdf">over the Internet (PDF)</a>).</p>



<p>The good news is that most of them can be prevented or mitigated in software.</p>







<h3 id="power-usage">Power Usage</h3>



<p>Different algorithms or processor operations may require different amounts of power.</p>



<p>For example, squaring a large number may take less power than multiplying two different large numbers. This observation has led to the development of <a href="https://anysilicon.com/side-channel-attacks-differential-power-analysis-dpa-simple-power-analysis-spa-works/">power analysis attacks against RSA</a>.</p>



<p>Power analysis is especially relevant for embedded systems and smart cards, which are easier to extract a meaningful signal from than your desktop computer.</p>



<p>Some information leakage through power usage can be prevented through careful engineering (for example: <a href="https://bearssl.org/constanttime.html#rsa">BearSSL</a>, which uses Montgomery multiplication instead of square-and-multiply).</p>



<p>But that’s not always an option, so generally these risks are mitigated.</p>

<h3 id="electromagnetic-emissions">Electromagnetic Emissions</h3>

</p></figure>



<p>Your computer is a reliable source of electromagnetic emissions (such as radio waves). Some of these emissions may reveal information about your cryptographic secrets, especially to an attacker with physical proximity to your device.</p>



<p>The good news is that research into EM emission side-channels isn’t as mature as side-channels through timing leaks or power usage. The bad news is that mitigations for breakthroughs will generally require hardware (e.g. electromagnetic shielding).</p>

<h2 id="side-channel-prevention-and-mitigation">Side-Channel Prevention and Mitigation</h2>



<p>Now that we’ve established a rough sense of some of the <em>types</em> of side-channels that are possible, we can begin to identify what causes them and aspire to prevent the leaks from happening–and where we can’t, to mitigate the risk to a reasonable level.</p>



<p>Note: To be clear, I didn’t cover <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack#General">all of the types of side-channels</a>.</p>



<h3 id="prevention-mitigation">Prevention vs. Mitigation</h3>



<p>Preventing a side-channel means eliminating the conditions that allow the information leak to occur in the first place. For timing leaks, this means making all algorithms constant-time.</p>



<p>There are entire classes of side-channel leaks that aren’t possible or practical to mitigate in software. When you encounter one, the best you can hope to do is mitigate the risk.</p>



<p>Ideally, you want to make the attack more expensive to pull off than the reward an attacker will gain from it.</p>



<h3 id="what-is-constant-time">What is Constant-Time?</h3>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="580" height="327" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZD_H1ePLylA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span>
</p><figcaption>Toto, I don’t think we’re in <s>Tanelorn</s> Kansas anymore.</figcaption></figure>



<p>When an implementation is said to be constant-time, what we mean is that <strong>the execution time of the code is not a function of its secret inputs</strong>.</p>



<p>Vulnerable AES uses table look-ups to implement the S-Box. Constant-time AES is either implemented in hardware, or is <a href="https://bearssl.org/constanttime.html#aes">bitsliced</a>.</p>



<h3 id="malicious-environments-and-algorithmic-constant-time">Malicious Environments and Algorithmic Constant-Time</h3>



<p>One of the greatest challenges with writing constant-time code is distinguishing between <strong>algorithmic constant-time</strong> and <strong>provably constant-time</strong>. The main difference between the two is that <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf">you cannot trust your compiler</a> (especially a JIT compiler), which may attempt to optimize your code in a way that reintroduces the side-channel you aspired to remove.</p>



<blockquote><p>A sufficiently advanced compiler optimization is indistinguishable from an adversary.</p><cite><a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/970">John Regehr</a>, possibly with apologies to <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>For compiled languages, this is a tractable but expensive problem to solve: You simply have to formally verify everything from the source code to the compiler to the silicon chips that the code will be deployed on, and then audit your supply chain to prevent malicious tampering from going undetected.</p>



<p>For interpreted languages (e.g. PHP and JavaScript), this formal verification strategy isn’t really an option, unless you want to formally verify the runtime that interprets scripts and prove that the operations remain constant-time on top of all the other layers of distrust.</p>



<p>Is this level of paranoia really worth the effort?</p>

<p>For that reason, we’re going to assume that <strong>algorithmic constant-time is adequate</strong> for the duration of this blog post.</p>



<p>If your threat model prevents you from accepting this assumption, feel free to put in the extra effort yourself and tell me how it goes. After all, as a furry who writes blog posts in my spare time for fun, I don’t exactly have the budget for massive research projects in formal verification.</p>



<h3 id="mitigation-with-blinding-techniques">Mitigation with Blinding Techniques</h3>



<p>The best mitigation for some side-channels is called blinding: Obfuscating the inputs with some random data, then deobfuscating the outputs with the same random data, such that your keys are not revealed.</p>



<p>Two well-known examples include <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/54772">RSA decryption</a> and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman. I’ll focus on the latter, since it’s not as widely covered in the literature (although several cryptographers I’ve talked with were somehow knowledgeable about it; I suspect <a href="https://medium.com/@soatok/gatekeeping-in-online-communities-48dec7f97f6a">gatekeeping</a> is involved).</p>



<h4>Blinded ECDH Key Exchange</h4>



<p>In typical ECDH implementations, you will convert a point on a Weierstrass curve <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28X%2C+Y%29&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="(X, Y)" title="(X, Y)"> to a Jacobian coordinate system <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2C+y%29&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="(x, y)" title="(x, y)">.</p>



<p>The exact conversion formula is (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+X+%2F+Z%5E%7B2%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="x = X / Z^{2}" title="x = X / Z^{2}">, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+X+%2F+Z%5E%7B3%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="y = X / Z^{3}" title="y = X / Z^{3}">). The conversion almost makes intuitive sense.</p>



<p>Where does <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="Z" title="Z"> come from though?</p>







<p>It turns out, the choice for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="Z" title="Z"> is totally arbitrary. Libraries typically set it equal to 1 (for best performance), but you can also set it to a random number. (You cannot set it to 0, however, for obvious reasons.)</p>



<p>Choosing a random number means the calculations performed over Jacobian coordinates will be obscured by a randomly chosen factor <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="Z" title="Z"> (and thus, if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="Z" title="Z"> is only used once per scalar multiplication, the bitwise signal the attackers rely on will be lost).</p>

(Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/lynxvsjackalope">Khia</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I think it’s really cool how one small tweak to the runtime of an algorithm can <a href="https://www.iacr.org/archive/ches2010/62250433/62250433.pdf">make it significantly harder to attack</a>.</p>



<h2 id="design-patterns">Design Patterns for Algorithmic Constant-Time Code</h2>



<p>Mitigation techniques are cool, but preventing side-channels is a better value-add for most software. </p>



<p>To that end, let’s look at some design patterns for constant-time software. Some of these are relatively common; others, not so much.</p>







<h3 id="string-comparison">Constant-Time String Comparison</h3>



<p>Rather than using string comparison (== in most programming languages, memcmp() in C), you want to compare cryptographic secrets and/or calculated integrity checks with a secure compare algorithm, which looks like this:</p>



<ol><li>Initialize a variable (let’s call it D) to zero. </li><li>For each byte of the two strings:<ol><li>Calculate (left<sub>i</sub> XOR right<sub>i</sub>)</li><li>Bitwise OR the current value of D with the result of the XOR, store the output in D</li></ol></li><li>When the loop has concluded, D will be equal to 0 if and only if the two strings are equal.</li></ol>



<p>In code form, it looks like this:</p>



<pre><code>&lt;?php
function ct_compare(string $left, string $right): bool
{
    $d = 0;
    $length = mb_strlen($left, '8bit');
    if (mb_strlen($right, '8bit') !== $length) {
        return false; // Lengths differ
    }
    for ($i = 0; $i &lt; $length; ++$i) {
        $leftCharCode = unpack('C', $left[$i])[1];
        $rightCharCode = unpack('C', $right[$i])[1];</code></pre></div></div></div>

        <p>The machine that powered numerous Number Stations</p>
      
        <p>
          uberardy — 2020-08-29
        </p>
      </div>
  
  <div>
    <p>A few years ago, I first stumbled over some recordings of number stations and started reading up on their history. For most of them, we have pretty good guesses who ran them and for what purpose. One example is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxlrnAC7Y7Q">Gongs and Chimes Station</a>, known for its melody that got increasingly creepy over the years, the more worn down the tape got. What always seemed mysterious to me is the kinds of devices used to actually generate the spoken messages. Were they similar to electromechanical devices used for time announcements over the telephone, <a href="https://youtu.be/4aMqKr0D-7o?t=47">with multiple play heads</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lESMfh72RJg">complicated tape mechanisms</a>?</p>
<p>Then, I stumbled over <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4buFLqjvTjA">this video</a>. And... It's <em>the actual voice</em> used by the <em>Gongs and Chimes</em> Station? What surprised me was how rather small, polished and complex the machine seemed. There definitely was a microcontroller in there, it had an LED display, and just in general seemed like a rather fancy device.</p>

</div>

    <p><img src="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/sprach-morse-generator.jpg" alt="Grey box-shaped machine with a tilted front panel. There are a paper punch tape reader, LED display and numeric keyboard with some extra buttons on the front."> 
    </p>
    
</div>

<div>
    <p>The most important thing however was, I finally knew what to look for. Searching for "Sprach-Morse-Generator" (Speech-Morse-Generator) quickly got me to <a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/spy/owvl/32620/index.htm">a page about it at the crypto museum</a> which also mentions its official name: "Gerät 32620" (Device 32620). The page also has some great information about the history of the device and the voice behind it.</p>
<p>What exited me the most was... There are actually links to technical documentation about the Speech generator and its companion device, Gerät 32621, which could be used for digitizing voice recordings and writing them to EPROM cartridges to use with Gerät 32620.</p>

</div>

<div>
    <h3><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/spy/owvl/32620/files/MfS_OTS_4061.pdf">The 32620 Guide</a></h3>
<p>I don't want to go over everything mentioned in these guides; if you speak German I'd recommend giving it a read yourself; but I do want to mention some things I found notable.</p>
<p>As input, either paper punch tapes, the keyboard, or a serial interface (RS-232) can be used. The last one is a bit unclear, it is mentioned in the beginning, but later parts of the document mention it as a possible future addition. Either way, the messages are transferred to RAM, from where they can later be transmitted. It can hold up to 3791 characters.</p>
<p>The language samples are loaded from an exchangeable cartridge which can hold up to 96 kByte, where they are stored as uncompressed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation">PCM</a> . They proudly mention the cartridges can be swapped in 10 seconds.</p>

    </p>
    <p>The number of words per minute and pitch of the voice can be varied, which explains why some recordings of number stations with the same voice sound a bit different.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>Technical drawing of the display and keyboard. The display can show which message, group and digit is played right now.</p>
    <p><img src="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/tastatur.png" alt="Technical drawing of display and keyboard: Display showing three groups of digits. Keyboard with numeric buttons, &quot;RES&quot;, &quot;STA/STP&quot;, &quot;<&quot;, &quot;>&quot;, &quot;MODE&quot;, &quot;INP&quot;, &quot;EX&quot;, &quot;OUT&quot;, &quot;CLR&quot; buttons."> 
    </p>
    
</div>

<p>What I find quite surprising: The keyboard and output of the device mostly uses English words. A bit unexpected for a device developed in eastern Germany for use in the Soviet Union; I would rather have expected Russian there.</p>

<div>
    
    <p><img src="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/flowchart.png" alt="Chart showing which buttons to press and what will appear on the display for inputting morse code."> 
    </p>
    <p>There are some pretty charming charts in the documentation showing some interactions with the device.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>Bus chart of the whole system. Interestingly, it shows a second language module, although the final device only supports one language module at a time.</p>

    <p><img src="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/backside.png" alt="Technical drawing of the back of the device, with power and data inputs and line output."> 
    </p>
    <p>On the back are a speaker, output to the transmitter and some status outputs and remote control inputs. These were probably used so the chimes and speech wouldn't overlap.</p>
</div>

<p>There are also pretty detailed schematic drawings and lists of component at the end of the document.</p>

<div>
    <h3><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/spy/owvl/32620/files/MfS_OTS_4062b.pdf">The 32621 Guide</a></h3>
<p>This is the companion device used for digitizing voices and writing them to cartridges for the 32620. It's quite astounding how complicated this device really is: It can either record words separately or all of them in one go, it automatically recognizes the beginning and end of the words, it can duplicate cartridges and it even has a UV chamber for clearing the EEPROMS on a cartridge to reuse it.</p>
<p>What's interesting: There are no photos of this device. It's unclear how many were produced, there may just have been one or two. The only things we know about it are from this document.</p>
<p>In its architecture, it is quite similar to the 32620, it has a very similar keyboard and probably the same display.</p>

</div>

    <p>One interesting difference: It uses German labels on the keyboard. Also, all of the text it shows on the display is in German.</p>

<div>
    <p>The documentation mentions recording up to 20 words. This also came up in the 32620's documentation, although only 13 words were ever used: digits 0-9, "Achtung" (Attention), "Trennung" (Seperation) and "Ende" (End).</p>
<p>It has controls for adjusting the 0-level of the recordings and amplification. LEDs show whether it senses an audio signal and whether it's clipping. The amplification for single words can also be adjusted later, from a value of 0 to 7. It seems like this doesn't actually change the recorded samples but controls the amplification level in the digital to analogue converter. This feature is intended for making all the digits similar in volume.</p>
<p>I find this a bit surprising, all of this is something that could be done with other equipment, especially since only two different voices for these machines are known: German and Spanish.</p>
<p>In order to check the recording, either all recorded digits or just combinations of them can be played back.</p>
<p>When programming to an EPROM, it transfers the start address and amplification for each word and the samples from RAM to the ROM and checks whether the values it reads back after programming are as expected.</p>

<p>There is a separate mode for deleting cartridges where the time to expose them to UV can be typed in via the keyboard. If the rom cartridge is double sided, the cartridge has to be turned around to delete the chips on the other side.</p>

    <p>For all of the different modes of the 32621, flow charts for the interface are provided.</p>

    </p>
    <p>The front also features various other indicators, e.g. for the different voltages in the device.</p>
</div>

<p>This manual also includes schematics for the device.</p>

<div>
    <h3>The EPROMS</h3>
<p>The crypto museum also provides dumps of the EPROMS for both the German and Spanish cartridges.</p>
<p>Having read the manuals, decoding them is actually not that hard: The data is stored as PCM, and the 32621 Guide mentions the time between samples is 125μs, which adds up to a sample rate of 8000Hz.
Loading the roms into Audacity with File&gt;Import&gt;Raw Data, you can actually already listen to them!</p>
<p>[Edit: Here are the dumps as WAVs, if you're interested: <a href="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/2620_ger.wav">german</a>, <a href="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/2620_span.wav">spanish</a>]</p>
<h4>The Header</h4>
<p>In the very beginning of the first EPROM, there are 64 byte of header information, containing the start address for each word and its amplification factor. For 20 words, that leaves just over 3 bytes per word, although they seem to just stick to 3.</p>
<p>Decoding the rest of the header took a lot longer than anticipated. I found the 3 bits for the amplification value pretty quickly in the last byte for each word. The rest somehow had to be the start address or some offset, and possibly the length. For accessing the values in each of the 8K chips, 13 Bits for the address are needed. To select one of the up to 12 EPROMs, another 4 Bit are required. This adds up to 17 Bits, so one more than in two bytes.</p>
<p>To get around this, there are two obvious solutions: Stuff the one extra bit into the byte which holds the amplification level, or throw away the least significant bit for the start address, so just every other sample can be used as the start sample.</p>
<p>Two things made this really hard to pin down: The z80 is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">little endian machine</a>, meaning for 16 bit values, the less significant byte is stored before the more significant byte, but this doesn't mean they would <em>have</em> to store the values in this order. Also, the binary chip select value for the first EPROM isn't 0, but 2. I only stumbled upon that when looking at the schematic for the EPROM cartridge (p. 38 in the 32620 manual). There's also a really cute demultiplexer built from discrete AND and NAND gates for translating the chip address to the actual chip select lines!</p>

</div>

<div>
    <p>Isn't it gorgeous! Note how it only <em>suggests</em> the presence of the fourth address line for the chip select with that not connected NAND.</p>
    <p><img src="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/demux.png" alt="The schematic for the demultiplexer built out of discreet components."> 
    </p>
    
</div>

<div>
    <p>My best guess to why is the case is the chip select address values 0 and 1 are already used to select some other components. But, at last, I think I found out how it works:</p>
<p>For each word, the second byte contains the 3 least significant bits for the chip select and 5 of the address bits. The first byte contains the remaining 8 address bits. The end of each word is the beginning address for the next word. That's why there are two extra bytes after the last word. This would have worked for up to twenty words, as there would still be 4 spare bytes to contain the end address of the last word. The third byte contains the remaining chip select bit, some mysterious bits, and 3 bits for the amplification level.</p>
<p>The remaining chip select bit is still a bit confusing to me: The German recordings don't use it, since they fit on just 6 EPROMs. The Spanish one has to use it for the last two words, but there's something odd happening with the values in the one before the last two words.</p>
<p>Another thing worth noting: The German words all use the default amplification level of 3, whereas the Spanish ones use lower and higher values for some words. To be <em>really</em> authentic, you'd have to take that into account when playing the samples.</p>
<p>One last thing I was interested in: The Spanish voice uses the same word for "Trennung" and "Ende"&amp;em;"final", and they sure <em>sound</em> the same. So, is …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>Minutes before Nitthin Chandran was set to present his startup to a powerful group of foreign investors, the power went out in his apartment in Bangalore. The timing couldn’t have been worse: power outages are par for the course in the city, where Chandran was presenting remotely via Zoom, but there was life-changing money on the line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chandran, the founder of <a href="https://www.medpiper.com/">MedPiper Technologies</a>, was pitching his Indian hospital-staffing startup for this year’s Demo Day. The two-day event is the culmination of Silicon Valley’s most well-known startup accelerator program, Y Combinator; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/these-are-the-top-y-combinator-companies-of-all-time-based-on-valuation/">notable program graduates</a> include Airbnb, Stripe, and DoorDash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The stakes were high, so Chandran came prepared: his Y Combinator–appointed mentor had advised him to upgrade his internet speed and<strong> </strong>make ready multiple backup options for situations just like this one. Saved by a spare dongle he’d bought on sale at his local market, Chandran delivered his one-minute pitch to an unseen audience of high-powered investors and thousands of viewers, all from his apartment in Bangalore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In spite of the blackout, Chandran kept his cool: “We practiced maybe 100 times before Demo Day.”</p>



<p>For the first time in its 15-year history, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/y-combinator-officially-shifts-its-next-accelerator-class-to-fully-remote-format/">Y Combinator went fully remote</a> with its famed startup accelerator program. With the coronavirus pandemic making travel and in-person meetings nearly impossible, everything from workshops to the all-important Demo Day went online. The remote experience may have flattened the in-person interactions that drive some of the tech industry’s biggest deals. But founders from non-Western markets say that attending Y Combinator remotely didn’t hinder their success — in fact, it helped. Internet connectivity issues aside, foreign founders say the first fully remote Y Combinator has put these companies on a more equal footing with their American counterparts.</p>

<p>In pre-pandemic times, founders accepted to Y Combinator were flown to San Francisco, where they spent three months developing their startups <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2019/02/12/y-combinator-demo-days-2019-san-francisco.html">before presenting to funders at Demo Day</a>. For non-American founders with operations outside the United States, this often meant spending a full financial quarter away from their teams and home markets to attend workshops and networking events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You talk to other international founders, and they’re like, Oh yeah, I spent most of YC on a plane,” said Iain Usiri, a Tanzanian founder whose startup <a href="https://www.ramani.io/">Ramani</a> presented at last week’s Demo Day. By going remote, “The biggest logistical problem is solved,” he said. “You’re on par with a U.S. founder who is in his home market.”</p>



<p>Under normal circumstances, Usiri might’ve fretted over his outfit choice or physical gestures on Demo Day. “Personally, I do well on a stage,” he said. But this time, he and other founders in his class invested in backup internet, high-quality microphones, and new lighting, to ensure their Zoom presentations go as smoothly as possible. A remote presentation has its own anxieties: Usiri said he was so paranoid about power outages in his home in Tanzania, he had nightmares about it leading up to Demo Day. Nicolás López, co-founder of Justo, <a href="https://www.getjusto.com/">a Chilean food-delivery startup</a>, said he worried about competing with social media notifications and emails that might be popping up on investors’ screens during their demo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But logging onto Y Combinator from the comfort of their home markets meant founders could maintain their startups while benefiting from Y Combinator’s coveted mentorships. “Between when we applied for Y Combinator in March and today, we grew our team from 10 to 95,” said López. “I don’t think we would have been able to do that if we had been in Palo Alto for the past three months.”</p>



<p>In Bangalore, MedPiper’s Chandran, who is building a database of verified doctors and nurses in India, was able to take in-person meetings during the period. He said he signed up to 40,000 medical professionals during his time with Y Combinator. “We don’t think we would have done even 60 to 70% of the sales which we were able to close [had we been away],” Chandran told <em>Rest of World.</em> “All these sales were done in person, walking into hospitals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paradoxically, the remote nature of this year’s Y Combinator meant more face time between founders and partners. “I was asking for office hours all the time, sometimes three meetings a week with partners,” Arthur Alvarenga, founder of Brazilian startup <a href="https://chatpay.com.br/">ChatPay</a> said. “Everyone was very available, and with Zoom, things moved faster. You could get on a call faster than going to campus to meet with them if we were in person.”</p>

<p>Crucially, the pandemic has forced investors to consider any and all investments remotely; it’s leveled the playing field. Alvarenga, based in Brazil, might’ve missed out on chances for in-person meetings. But on Zoom, he’s just as remote as a founder in Boston. Both current and former non-Western Y Combinator participants said that funders are now more willing to take meetings and close deals over Zoom, where they once might have required an in-person meeting. Foreign founders in this batch of Demo Day presenters said they walked away from the event with more than 100 interested investors — far more than they could muster in their local markets.</p>



<p>Thomas Hellman, professor of entrepreneurship and innovation at Oxford’s Saïd Business School, said that the remote nature of today’s business environment has changed investor behavior, perhaps to the benefit of non-American founders.<strong> </strong>“Investors who said they would never invest unless they met a person have now written checks to entrepreneurs without meeting them,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But a willingness to close deals over Zoom hasn’t changed some of the inherent challenges in raising money as a foreign startup. U.S.-based companies still constitute the majority of the Y Combinator batch: 39 of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/here-are-the-98-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2020-demo-day-1/">197 startups participated</a> from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Hellman said that, in lieu of organic meetings and face-to-face interactions, venture capital firms are likely to rely on their own referral networks, which he said are essentially frozen during the pandemic. “The biggest thing to look out for is how networks are going to retrench,” he said. “That could lead to more privileged entrepreneurs having access to capital.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite a more remote-friendly environment, Hellmann said foreign startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/22/foreign-startup-founders-face-unique-struggles-to-break-funding-barrier/">still face higher barriers to raising funds</a>. Local companies may still have an advantage, even if it’s a smaller one. “Just because Zoom is making this more democratized, it doesn’t change the fact that some investors are just not going to understand your market or want to invest outside the United States,” said Alvarenga. “And that’s a root problem.”</p>



<p>But for the half a dozen founders from this summer’s batch of presenters who spoke with <em>Rest of World, </em>internet outages and Zoom presentations were minor inconveniences compared to their otherwise positive Y Combinator experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The real value of YC is the network,” said Alvarenga. “The more quality people you put in, the better the network becomes.”</p>

<p>The course is two-fold.</p>
<p>On the one hand it introduces functional programming: Immutable data, algebraic datatypes, pattern matching, recursion, functions as first-class values, proper tail calls, type-directed programming and functional programming patterns.</p>
<p>On the other hand it introduces 'Property-based testing' (QuickCheck) (next generation automated testing) expressed within the functional programming context: Generators, properties, shrinking, statistics of generators, type-directed testing, testing of imperative code while touching upon a number of more general testing concepts as debugging, unit-testing, corner cases, blackbox and whitebox testing and fuzzing.</p>
<p>Finally the course covers a number of real-world case studies of property-based testing, e.g., an automated test of the AUTOSAR specification for Volvo.</p>

	<p><i>August 31st 2020</i></p>

	<p>Are apps even that relevant anymore? This is a question that's been on my mind for a while, but has particularly come to the forefront with the recent Epic vs. Apple saga.</p>

	<p>Sure, video games like Fortnite and software requiring native APIs make sense as an app (for now). But, if you're not a tilt-your-phone rolling-ball maze game, why not just make your software a great mobile-optimised website instead of an app?</p>

	<p>Sometimes I feel that there's a mentality amongst new developers and naive businesses that mobile software must be in the form of an app. I can see why.</p>

	<p>When the iPhone launched in 2007, apps were such a step up from the clunky text-based websites on our tiny manual-buttoned phones, who could blame anyone for wanting to develop a beautiful full-screen app? However, with that excitement, I feel the idea of making great software for the mobile web got left behind.</p>

	<p>Developing an app is so much harder than building software optimised for the mobile web. Not only do you have the monetary cost of developer licenses and equipment (iOS devices) when developing apps, you also have a sigificant time cost involved for maintaining separate iOS and Android codebases, building &amp; deploying to real test devices, and the delay and scrutiny your app goes under before updates go live onto an app store.</p>

	<p>Once your app is live, you have the significant barrier of a user having to find it, then use their precious storage space to install it. Oh, and the app stores take a juicy 30% cut of your profits.</p>

	<p>Who is actually winning here?</p>

	<p>Increasingly, a trend I've caught myself doing is using the mobile website equivalent of an app. Instagram &amp; Facebook's mobile websites for example have almost every feature of their app counterparts, without taking up massive storage space on my phone and draining battery with their background processes.</p>

	<p>Even now with my own <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects" target="_blank">projects</a>, a well optimised mobile website beats an app most times. Who needs push notifications (and the effort they require to set up) when email notifications do the job just fine?</p>

	<p>In most cases, a great mobile website does the trick. You don't need an app, or the app store. We already have a pretty great app store and you're browsing it right now.</p>

I’ve been building Inkdrop alone for 4 years. Wow, how time flies! This is <strong>a plain-text Markdown note-taking app that runs and syncs across macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android devices with end-to-end encryption</strong>. It makes organizing Markdown notes simple without hassles. It’s initially built just for myself — I was searching for a replacement for Evernote, supporting code syntax highlighting and some other programmer-friendly features like vim keybindings and hackability, for a long time. Then, I couldn’t find the one and eventually decided to build it myself. The journey towards building a perfect note-taking app was so much harder than I imagined. But I stuck with it for 4 years and kept improving it. I learned a lot through this project and blogged about them. You can read my blog articles such as:</p><ul><li id="a8c4"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.inkdrop.info/how-i-built-a-markdown-editor-earning-1300-mo-profit-inkdrop-ddf6ad702c42">How I Built a Markdown Editor Earning $1300/mo Profit — Inkdrop</a></li><li id="df21"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.inkdrop.info/grit-46c57af01d6d">How I Kept My Solo Project Going Over 3 Years</a></li></ul><p id="a3b4">Last year, I worked on rebuilding the app completely from scratch in order to clean up its technical debt and it successfully paid off:</p><ul><li id="3d05"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.inkdrop.info/inkdrop-v4-is-now-in-private-beta-9ffc6d5a013">Inkdrop v4 is Now in Private Beta</a></li></ul><p id="62ad">This update is on top of those endeavors.</p><p id="b99c">Building a great editor alone would be extremely hard. Because there are countless personal preferences and nice-to-have features for developers. In order to deal with that issue, Inkdrop provides a powerful API that allows you to add new functionality or provide a new look to the app with a plugin. While I’ve been working on its core features alone, we’ve got more than <strong>100 plugins</strong> now! Most of them (&gt; 80%) are made by the user community, which is awesome. I’m happy to see people enjoying hacking Inkdrop. You can browse plugins from <a href="https://my.inkdrop.app/plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p id="fc8e">Plugins let me focus on improving the core features instead of adding many optional features. So, I’m encouraging people to create a plugin with plugin developer license:</p><p id="a830">You can use Inkdrop for free, forever if you created a plugin.</p><p id="ccd4">Okay, let’s get started by talking about performance improvements in v5.</p><p id="1cd0">Since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=466mxrWPk7A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scaling out the database cluster</a>, the data sync got slowed down for some reason. It was due to the bad network topology where each server was running in a different region, which caused the RTT to be around 166ms. I moved the servers to the same region but in different availability zones and that made the RTT less than 1ms. Now it syncs across devices <strong>3 times faster</strong> than before!</p><p id="1497">The app launch speed has been also significantly improved. Inkdrop is built on top of Electron and the old version needed 4 seconds to launch, which is very slow. I finally managed to leverage v8 snapshots to boost the startup time. As you can see, the new version launches 1,000 milliseconds faster. The slow startup speed is so stressful. But now, I’m very happy to solve this issue. Please read the following article to know how I accomplished it:</p><p id="c459">It’s so fast, as you can see:</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2048/1*kMqBMLCvL4pa68DkePTkJA.gif" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*kMqBMLCvL4pa68DkePTkJA.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*kMqBMLCvL4pa68DkePTkJA.gif 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*kMqBMLCvL4pa68DkePTkJA.gif 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*kMqBMLCvL4pa68DkePTkJA.gif 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*kMqBMLCvL4pa68DkePTkJA.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="4464">The toolbar icons looked kind of outdated these days.

            <p>
  When you start a new job, your manager has no idea on how you work and what motivates you. 
  </p>
  <p>
  I recently found out about a great way to communicate this information.
  </p>
  <p>
  When starting her new job at Toptal, Steph Smith created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1I8Y4oNkrh1Ass32PNyzBYp3hL4scLiH7YWQmwvKxzlM/edit#slide=id.g602e881e99_0_65">personal user guide</a> on what it’s like to work with her. It’s just a google slide presentation - all you really need. 
  </p>

    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_userguide/frame_1.png" alt="">
  </center>
  <center>
    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_userguide/frame_2.png" alt="">
  </center>
  <p>
  It details her strengths and weaknesses alongside other info related to how she does her best work. 
  </p>
  <p>
  There’s a bunch of stuff you could include. Here are a few things that come to mind:
  </p>
  <ul>
  
  <li>How you best take feedback
  
  </li><li>Advice from past colleagues you’ve worked with
  
  </li><li>Your favorite communication tools
  
  </li><li>Expectations when it comes to response time
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  More generally, tasks like the above point to a better employee onboarding process. The more effort you put into understanding how someone works and what their preferences are, the better work they will be able to do.
  </p>
  <p>
  Imagine your company did this for everyone in your team. I’d bet that would foster a much more effective work culture where everyone got more done.

<p><strong>A special edition of the Rakudo Weekly News to inform you all of an exciting development in the world of the <a href="https://raku.org/">Raku Programming Language</a>.</strong></p>



<p>The implementation of hashes in MoarVM has been replaced!  <em>Nicholas Clark</em> wrote a new hash implementation for MoarVM in the past months, which uses less memory and less CPU.</p>



<p>MoarVM had been using the open source <code>uthash</code> library since July 2012.  At the time it was the “Go To” hashing library for <code>C</code> – full of features and flexible – so it was the logical choice. Over the years it has been modified to remove the features not needed by MoarVM, and hence the associated code and overhead.  But the basic design was necessarily unchanged – it remained the “classic” approach to hash tables – “collision chaining”.  The internal structure is an array of linked lists – just like Perl has done, since Perl 1.</p>



<p>This structure is simple to implement, but ultimately dates back to an era when CPUs didn’t even have caches, so it doesn’t fare too well now that minimising cache misses is the key to performance.</p>



<p>The basic problem that hash tables need to solve, is that they need a fast way to map from arbitrary keys not known in advance into something that is efficient for a CPU to manipulate – integers.  You’d like to store each key (and its associated <code>value</code> data) in an array, but also you can’t make the array infinitely big, so you always end up with a trade off – sometimes more than one key maps to the same integer, and so you need to code to handle this.</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Collision_resolution">Collision chaining</a> is the “obvious” way – a memory efficient way to store a variable number of keys that all need to sit at the same index in the array.  Operations need to walk all keys at the same index linearly, but keep the list small (grow the array as needed) and the performance is still good.</p>



<p>However the downside is that the keys you need to walk linearly are not adjacent in memory, meaning you likely have cache misses.  You could replace the linked lists with arrays (for more complexity, and higher delete costs), but you still have one pointer hop and potential cache miss.</p>



<p>With the increasing importance of staying CPU cache-friendly, a different approach to collision resolution is now better: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_addressing">open address hashing</a>.</p>



<p>This is roughly equivalent to using a larger array than collision chaining, and eliminating the linked lists.  While this <em>reduces</em> the collisions, it doesn’t eliminate them, so you need some other strategy to handle them.  Usually this involves a strategy for storing the key/value pair in an array index close to the correct location, and searching all locations where the key <em>might</em> be until either it is found or the possible locations are exhausted.</p>



<p>Currently one of the most efficient approaches to this is “Robin Hood” hashing. &nbsp;On updates, it moves entries around to minimise the distance of all keys to their ideal locations, not just the key added or deleted.  Usefully, this increases the chance of CPU cache hits during lookups.</p>



<p>Regarding hash iterators: one fun “gotcha” is that the Raku Programming Language (as well as Perl) both specify that it is acceptable to delete the key at the current hash iterator position without problems. &nbsp;Fortunately it was possible to adapt the insertion and iteration strategies to permit this without needing any extra complications or overhead.</p>



<p>All of this is now available in the main branch of the Rakudo compiler.  If you have hash-intensive applications, please try it out with this (as yet unreleased) version of Rakudo.  And let us know of your findings.  Reports so far indicate 10% to 15% improvements in core setting compilation, as well as in roast testing.  But of course, Your Mileage May Vary!</p>

<h3>The Ricardus Manuscript</h3>
<p>The Ricardus Manuscript arises from Gordon’s work on key assumptions underpinning modern codes. It deliberately departs from those standard assumptions. It has been in the public domain for over ten years, and has never been cracked.</p>
<p>When Gordon was working on the Voynich Manuscript, he started wondering what a real code based on the components of the Voynich Manuscript would look like. This code is the result.</p>
<p>Another question was what a code might look like that was based on different principles from most modern codes. Again, this manuscript is the result.</p>
<p>This manuscript also demonstrates another point. </p>
<p>It was widely argued in the Voynich research community that Edward Kelley couldn’t have created both Enochian and Voynichese because those were too different from each other to be the work of one person.</p>
<p>The Penitentia Manuscript is very different from the Ricardus Manuscript, but they were both produced by the same person.</p>

<h2>Micrometer &amp; axe</h2>
<p>Tech upstarts have a propensity to live in two
paradigms. In one instance, they exist in the
founders heads, whereby there is little feedback
and changes are made to tweak things just so.
In the other instance, they exist in the market
and there’s no telling what pull users will
demand of you.</p>

<p>In a sentence, this feels like upstarts are
all about measuring with a micrometer and 
cutting with an axe.</p>

<p>And if your product suffers from a slow feedback loop,
whereby you don’t have the opportunity to have
constant tugs at what you’re building, then
the ever smaller the ruler and larger the
cutting tool become.</p>

<p>When there is gulf between the precision of both 
tools, you know you’re in a tough spot.</p>

<p>It’s no wonder so many upstarts
never get traction and ultimately flounder.
When you are forced to navigate on two desperately
different planes of realities, it can be disheartening
to want to deal with such Janusian pursuits.</p><p><svg xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="200 0 400 800" width="400" height="800"><rect width="400" height="800" fill="#b33a3a"></rect><polygon points="299.5 150 254.5 247 351.5 247 "></polygon><path d="m321.9 548.9l-243.8 0"></path><path d="m303 247.1l0 243.8"></path><polygon points="94.5 150 49.5 247 146.5 247 "></polygon><path d="m98 247.1l0 243.8"></path><text font-family="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" font-size="60" y="112" x="10" style="fill-opacity:null">THIS END UP</text><a xlink:href="//cretaria.com"><text id="link-cretaria" font-family="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" font-size="50" y="680" x="10" fill-opacity="null">What’s Cretaria?</text></a><path d="m175 700l200 0" style="fill-opacity:null;fill:none;stroke-linejoin:null;stroke-opacity:null;stroke-width:4;stroke:#000"></path></svg></p></article>

<p>
	Whether you’re a student, a teacher, or a parent, I think you’ll appreciate this story of how one teacher can completely and permanently change someone’s life in only a few lessons.
</p><p>
	I was seventeen and about to start my first year at Berklee College of Music.
</p><p>
	I called a local recording studio with a random question about music typesetting.
</p><p>
	When the studio owner heard I was going to Berklee, he said, “I graduated from Berklee and taught there, too.
	I’ll bet I can teach you two years of theory and arranging in only a few lessons.
	I suspect you can graduate in two years if you understand there’s no speed limit.
	Come by my studio at 9:00 tomorrow for your first lesson, if you’re interested.
	No charge.”
</p><p>
	Graduate college in two years?
	Awesome!
	I liked his style.
	That was <a href="https://jkimowilliams.com/">Kimo Williams</a>.
</p><p>
	I showed up at his studio at 8:40 the next morning, super excited, though I waited outside before ringing his bell at 8:59.
</p><p>
	He opened the door.
	A tall man in a Hawaiian shirt and a big hat, with a square scar on his nose, a laid-back demeanor, and a huge smile, sizing me up, nodding.
</p><p>
	(Recently I heard him tell the story from his perspective.
	He said, “My doorbell rang at 8:59 one morning and I had no idea why.
	I run across kids all the time who say they want to be a great musician.
	I tell them I can help, and tell them to show up at my studio at 9:00 if they’re serious.
	Nobody ever does.
	It’s how I weed out the really serious ones from the kids who just talk.
	But there was Derek, ready to go.”)
</p><p>
	After a one-minute welcome, we were sitting at the piano, analyzing the sheet music for a jazz standard.
	He was quickly explaining the chords based on the diatonic scale — how the dissonance of the tri-tone in the 5-chord with the flat-7 is what makes it want to resolve to the 1.
	Within a minute, he started quizzing me.
	“If the 5-chord with the flat-7 has that tri-tone, then so does another flat-7 chord. Which one?”
</p><p>
	“Uh… the flat-2 chord?”
</p><p>
	“Right!
	So that’s a substitute chord.
	Any flat-7 chord can be substituted with the other flat-7 that shares the same tri-tone.
	So reharmonize all the chords you can in this chart.
	Go.”
</p><p>
<strong>
	The pace was intense, and I loved it.
</strong>
	Finally, someone was challenging me — keeping me in over my head — encouraging and expecting me to pull myself up quickly.
	I was learning so fast, it felt like the adrenaline rush you get while playing a video game.
	He tossed every fact at me and made me prove that I got it.
</p><p>
	In our three-hour lesson that morning, he taught me a full semester of Berklee’s harmony courses.
	In our next four lessons, he taught me the next four semesters of harmony and arranging classes.
</p><p>
	When I got to college and took my entrance exams, I tested out of those six semesters of requirements.
</p><p>
	Then, as Kimo suggested, I bought the course materials for other required classes and taught myself, doing the homework in my own time.
	Then I went to the department head and took the final exam, getting full credit for those courses.
</p><p>
	By doing this in addition to completing my full course load, I graduated college in two and a half years.
	I got my bachelor’s degree when I was twenty.
</p><p>
	Kimo’s high expectations set a new pace for me.
	He taught me that “<strong>the standard pace is for chumps</strong>” — that the system is designed so anyone can keep up.
<strong>
	If you’re more driven than most people, you can do way more than anyone expects.
</strong>
	And this principle applies to all of life, not just school.
</p><p>
	Before I met Kimo, I was just a kid who wanted to be a musician, doing it casually.
	Ever since our five lessons, I’ve had no speed limit.
	I owe every great thing that’s happened in my life to Kimo’s raised expectations.
	A random meeting and five music lessons showed me that I can do way more than the norm.
</p><p>
	Twenty years later, Berklee invited me to give the opening keynote speech to incoming first-year students.
	Go to <a href="https://sive.rs/berklee">sive.rs/berklee</a> to see it.
	Kimo knows how much he means to me, and we’re friends to this day.

<h2><a id="iOS14"></a><em>What’s New in Vision in iOS 14?</em></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/">WWDC 2020</a>, Apple introduced some enhancements to its computer vision framework. It’s nice to see that Apple keeps investing in&nbsp;the field. Apart from hand &amp; body tracking, the updated Vision framework comes with other interesting features:</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">➤ Trajectory Detection:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Vision provides the ability to analyze and detect objects’ trajectories in a given video sequence. With iOS 14 a new Vision request was introduced&nbsp; <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/identifying_trajectories_in_video"><em>V</em></a></span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/identifying_trajectories_in_video"><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">NDetectTrajectoriesRequest</span></em></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. This has several applications, such as for tracking the path of a ball in sports analysis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">➤ Contour Detection:&nbsp;</span></strong><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/vndetectcontoursrequest?language=objc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">VNDetectContoursRequest</span></em></a><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">allows you to identify the contours of shapes in an image. It’s useful in scenarios where you need to locate specific objects or group them by form or size.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">➤ Optical Flow:&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The new&nbsp;</span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/vngenerateopticalflowrequest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">VNGenerateOpticalFlowRequest</span></em></a><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">determines directional change for pixels in a given image, useful for motion estimation or surveillance tracking.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you’d like to learn more about everything new in iOS 14, check out&nbsp;</span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/whats-new/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Apple’s documentation</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Now, let’s dive into our topic;&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">body tracking with Vision.</span></strong></p>

<h2><a id="BodyTrackingVision"></a><em>Understanding Hand Tracking &amp; Body Pose Detection with Vision</em></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><img src="https://orangeloops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rendered2x-1591633443-1.png" alt="body pose detection with vision" width="385" height="366"></span></p>
<p>The Vision framework allows to <strong>identify the pose of people’s body or hands.</strong></p>
<p>It works by locating a set of points that match with the joints of the human body, from a given visual data.</p>
<p>As you can see in the&nbsp;figure on the right, Vision detects up to 19 body points. This generates a valuable input you could leverage on your apps (we will discuss some use cases later below).</p>
<p>The process of detecting a body pose from a video frame is straightforward.&nbsp;First, you have to perform a request through&nbsp;<em><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/detecting_human_body_poses_in_images">VNDetectHumanBodyPoseRequest</a>.&nbsp;</em>This is how it looks like:</p>
<p><br>
Now that we have the body points’ position, we drew each of them over the frame, and we linked those points with lines. The following is the result:</p>

<p><iframe width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sv_mIVqBRHw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">As you can see, it seems to be doing well, providing an accurate representation of human movement and body pose. However, it struggles a bit with dark pictures or clothes, such as Darth Maul’s suit. Definitely, the Dark Side of the Force is not&nbsp;Vision’s cup of tea.</span></p>
<p>We tried it with even more people on screen, also providing a decent result:</p>
<p><iframe width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EiSFJWqAvdA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>
When it comes to <strong>hand pose detection</strong>, the request changes to&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/vndetecthumanhandposerequest">VNDetectHumanHandPoseRequest</a>. The procedure looks almost the same as in body tracking. Instead of searching for full-body joints, it focuses on the ones from the hand.</p>
<p><img src="https://orangeloops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-10.40.35-AM-1.png" alt="Hand Pose Detection with Vision" width="1065" height="550"></p>
<p>Again, the overall performance is quite impressive:</p>


<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Not everything in the garden is rosy, though. As we mentioned above, there are some scenarios in which body tracking is not as accurate. We’ll get to that in the following section.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><a id="ProsAndCons"></a><em>Pros &amp; Cons</em></h2>

<h4><strong>The Good of Body Tracking with Vision 👍</strong></h4>
<p>➤ The APIs are easy to use and implement in your project. A programmer with basic <a href="https://developer.apple.com/av-foundation/">AVFoundation</a> knowledge should be able to get this feature working in a few code lines.</p>
<p>➤ If the body or hand is being shown completely, either with one or more subjects on screen, body pose detection works well and provides a high accuracy level.</p>

<h4><strong>The Bad of Body Tracking with Vision&nbsp;👎</strong></h4>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">➤ In cases when the subject is looking sideways, and thus some part of the body gets hindered, Vision still tries to guess these parts’ points’ position. The result is not very realistic.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">➤ With poor lighting conditions or in dark environments, the accuracy is reduced a lot.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Having said all of the above, we consider the overall performance to be very impressive. We find exciting use cases for this technology, integrated with&nbsp;</span><a href="https://orangeloops.com/2020/06/whats-new-in-arkit-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">AR</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. Let’s see some of them.</span></p>

<h2><a id="UseCases"></a><em>Vision &amp; Body Pose Detection Use Cases</em></h2>

<h4><strong>Body Tracking in Retail</strong></h4>
<p><img src="https://orangeloops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-942687518.jpg" alt="ar magic mirror" width="400" height="267">Probably, one of the first things that come to your mind when thinking about body tracking applications in retail is the well-known “Magic Mirror”. These have been around for some years now, leveraging augmented reality capabilities. The concept of virtual try-on is not by any means new, but it could benefit from body pose detection by providing more accurate and realistic results.</p>
<p>For instance, thanks to Vision’s hand tracking, apps would be able to provide a better virtual try-on experience for hand jewelry or watches. In most cases, AR apps with&nbsp;that feature need to rely on paper wristbands or QR codes to spawn the virtual watch or ring. With hand pose detection, not only you wouldn’t need that, but the overall experience would also be more precise.</p>
<p>Surveillance and security would appreciate body pose detection features as well. By analyzing in real-time the behavior and movement of people with&nbsp;security cameras, along with the implementation of <a href="https://orangeloops.com/2019/05/getting-started-with-machine-learning-in-mobile-app-development/">Machine Learning models</a>, shoplifters could&nbsp;be spotted easier.</p>
<p>There are some real examples of this application, such as the Japanese <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/26/17479068/ai-guardman-security-camera-shoplifter-japan-automated-surveillance">AI Guardman</a>.&nbsp;However, they had to depend on custom body tracking technologies, which are not always the most accurate solutions. Now, Apple offers their own framework for devs to work with, adding new capabilities every year since its launch.</p>
<h4><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>Sports/Workout Analysis</strong></h4>
<p><img src="https://orangeloops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/apple-vision-framework-human-body-pose-detection-jumping-jack-1.jpg" alt="Body Pose Detection Fitness App" width="400" height="263">With Vision’s&nbsp;new features and the capabilities of CoreML, there’s a wide range of opportunities for sports analysis. Players would be able to understand their performance better and receive feedback from it.</p>
<p>For instance, Vision and CoreML allow analyzing ball shooting&nbsp;in sports such as football or basketball. Players can see the&nbsp;trajectory, speed, and angle of their throwing, in real-time. As a result, practicing and improving gets easier. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/building_a_feature-rich_app_for_sports_analysis">Apple has released a&nbsp;sample app</a> that leverages these capabilities to showcase how sports analysis could work.</p>
<p>When it comes to working out, Vision is useful too. With body pose detection,&nbsp;fitness apps would be able to detect human movements, correct exercises, and also provide more complex and detailed feedback on the training session.</p>
<p>Are you doing your push-ups the right way? Is your yoga pose correct? Now it’s easier for your virtual coach to tell you.</p>

<h4><strong>Games &amp; Entertainment&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p><img src="https://orangeloops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/apple-vision-framework-hand-pose-detection.jpg" alt="Apple Hand Pose Detection" width="400" height="253">One of the fields that could leverage body pose detection the most is the entertainment/gaming industry. Now, AR experiences could become even more immersive by making possible the interaction between your body and virtual elements.</p>
<p>Remember <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-daxzVxrQI">the Duck Hunt game from NES</a>? (Wow, the nostalgia) Well, what about an AR mobile game that leverages Vision’s capabilities to detect your hand, allowing you to use it as the gun?</p>
<p>Or imagine being able to pet your Pickachu in Pokémon GO, creating a more realistic experience with the creatures. The possibilities are several.</p>
<p>Games that make use of your body as an input, such as the popular dancing games, would&nbsp;also benefit from this technology. I guess that soon we will see tablets or mobile devices performing like the&nbsp;Xbox Kinect, providing similar gaming experiences. All of these could be possible by combining the strengths of Vision, <a href="https://orangeloops.com/2019/05/getting-started-with-machine-learning-in-mobile-app-development/">CoreML</a>, and <a href="https://orangeloops.com/2020/06/whats-new-in-arkit-4/">ARKit</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="FinalThoughts"></a><em>Final Thoughts</em></h2>
<p>Using the human body as an input has become a matter of interest for developers and tech companies, and it seems that Apple keeps investing in it. For instance, see ARKit’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29uNziYYZZ0&amp;feature=youtu.be">Motion Capture</a>&nbsp;that was&nbsp;introduced a year ago,&nbsp;or the recently announced <a href="https://orangeloops.com/2020/06/whats-new-in-arkit-4/">Face Tracking</a>. With the improvements and additions to computer vision frameworks, such as Vision, we have more tools over the table to leverage these capabilities in mobile apps.</p>
<p>As with every emerging technology, hand &amp; body pose detection with Vision has its flaws. It doesn’t work perfectly in dark environments, or if you are wearing gloves.&nbsp;However, the results in normal conditions, as shown above, left us a really good impression of what Vision can do.</p>

August 31, 2020 | https://www.zigpoll.com/blog/max-concurrent-socket-connections-node-express | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.zigpoll.com/blog/max-concurrent-socket-connections-node-express">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">
            

<p>Recently, I was faced with the challenge of getting as many concurrent connections as possible out of a single node.js instance running Express and Socket.io.</p>

<p>During the exploration, it was clear that there are a lot of bits and peices that need to be configured in order to get the most out of your application. These findings are documented below in hopes that they can be useful to your project.</p>

<h2><strong>Node.js</strong> Configurations</h2>

<p>A the node js layer, the following configurations were made:</p>

<h3><strong>1.</strong> Schedule the garbage collector manually</h3>

<p>If you do not run your garbage collector manually, you may run into issues where connections can be paused. While this is likely not going to cause downtime, it will increase the latency of your app when facing a large amount of concurrent connections.</p>

<p>To run the garbage collection manually, be sure to initialize your app with the <strong>--expose-gc</strong> flag. For example:</p>

<pre>  <code>
node --expose-gc ./index.js
  </code>
</pre>

<p>This will give you access to the <strong>global.gc</strong> variable which you can use to manually call your garbage collection. The following code works for me when inserted at the start of the process:</p>

<pre>  <code>
function scheduleGc() {
  if (!global.gc) {
    console.log('Garbage collection is not exposed');
    return;
  }

  let nextCall = 30 + (Math.random() * 15);

  setTimeout(() =&gt; {
    global.gc();
    scheduleGc();
  }, nextCall * 1000);
}

scheduleGc();
  </code>
</pre>

<p>This will randomly run garbage collection between 30 and 45 seconds in an infinite loop and avoid any long periods of downtime when facing a large number of concurrent connections.</p>

<h3><strong>2.</strong> Disable idle garbage collection &amp; increase heap size</h3>

<p>You will want to use the <strong>--nouse-idle-notification</strong> and <strong>-â€“max-old-space-size=8192</strong> flags. These optimizations will deactivate the idle garbage collection process and increase the heap memory for each node process to 8GB. This will give you initilization code that looks like this:</p>

<pre>  <code>
node --nouse-idle-notification --expose-gc --max-old-space-size=8192 ./index.js
  </code>
</pre>

<h3><strong>3.</strong> Use the cluster module</h3>

<p>By default, Node.js will run a single process. This is fine if you only have one CPU, but if you want to get the most out of your machine it is necessary for you to spawn multiple processes. In order to do this, use the cluster module in your node.js application.</p>

<p>When using express and socket.io your code will look something like this:</p>

<pre>  <code>
const cluster = require('cluster');

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;

  console.log('Master cluster setting up ' + numCPUs + ' workers...');

  for(var i = 0; i &lt; numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }

  cluster.on('online', function(worker) {
    console.log('Worker ' + worker.process.pid + ' is online');
  });

  cluster.on('exit', function(worker, code, signal) {
    console.log('Worker ' + worker.process.pid + ' died with code: ' + code + ', and signal: ' + signal);
    console.log('Starting a new worker');
    cluster.fork();
  });

} else {

  initExpressAndSocketServer();

}
  </code>
</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Using the cluster module means you will need to make sure your socket.io servers are using the redis adapter package to keep in sync.</p>

<h2><strong>Socket.Io</strong> Configurations</h2>

<h3><strong>1.</strong> Use the redis adapter</h3>

<p>Since you are using multiple processes, you must make sure that your socket.io server is equipped to communicate between all of them. This is made possible by using the <a href="https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-redis" target="_blank">redis-adapter</a> and having a seperate redis server set up.</p>

<h3><strong>2.</strong> Set perMessageDeflate to false</h3>

<p>Socket.io is a wonderful tool, but by default it will exhaust memory and never reclaim it due to this setting. This issue can be resolved by setting perMessageDeflate to false in initialization (There is an ongoing discussion about why it is set by default). More information about perMessageDeflate can be found <a href="https://github.com/websockets/ws" target="_blank">here</a>. Your Socket.io init code will now look something like this:</p>

<pre>  <code>
const io = require('socket.io')(server, { perMessageDeflate: false });
  </code>
</pre>

<h2><strong>Ubuntu</strong> Configurations</h2>

<p>You will need to make some updates to your server configuration in order to allow for a very high number of concurrent connections. I am not primarily a sys-admin so my description on what these commands do is a bit light. That being said, you can look up all of them for more information.</p>

<p>Increase the max open file limit by entering the following in your server's shell:</p>

<pre>  <code>
ulimit -n 1000000
  </code>
</pre>

<p>Add the following to <strong>/etc/security/limits.d/custom.conf</strong></p>

<pre>  <code>
root soft nofile 1000000
root hard nofile 1000000
* soft nofile 1000000
* hard nofile 1000000
  </code>
</pre>

<p>Add the following to <strong>/etc/sysctl.conf</strong></p>

<pre>  <code>
fs.file-max = 1000000
fs.nr_open = 1048576
net.ipv4.netfilter.ip_conntrack_max = 1048576
net.nf_conntrack_max = 1048576
net.core.rmem_max = 33554432
net.core.wmem_max = 33554432
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 16384 33554432
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 16384 33554432
net.ipv4.tcp_mem = 786432 1048576 26777216
net.ipv4.tcp_max_tw_buckets = 360000
net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 2500
vm.min_free_kbytes = 65536
vm.swappiness = 0
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 1024 65535
  </code>
</pre>

<p>Reload your settings with this command:</p>

<pre>  <code>
sysctl -p
  </code>
</pre>

<p>Update your nginx settings, open <strong>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</strong> and make sure the top of the config looks like the following:</p>

<pre>  <code>
user www-data;
worker_processes auto;
pid /run/nginx.pid;
include /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;
worker_rlimit_nofile 65535;

events {
        worker_connections 65535;
        multi_accept on;
        use epoll;
}
  </code>
</pre>

<p>Then reload nginx with: <strong>service nginx reload
</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Nginx was a requirement for my project. While nginx is a very useful tool, you have a hard limit of <strong>65,535</strong> concurrent connections when using nginx. This is likely sufficient for your use case, but if you expect more connections on your service, you should remove nginx and increase the file limits on the commands listed above.</p>

<h3>When 80% of market trades are done by machines, the only people capable of beating the market, are Data Scientists.</h3>



<figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2748/0*WJxAX_qK5ewI3j1i" alt="Image for post" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p id="75a2">Magnus Carlsen is the highest rated chess grandmaster. He once beat 10 Harvard lawyers in chess simultaneously, while blindfolded. He is widely accepted as the best chess player to ever exist. That is, when it comes to competing against humans. Computers though, are a completely different story. In fact, Magnus has completely given up on the idea of beating the top AI chess engines. He once said,</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“I can’t beat the best computers. They have complete information, so how could we expect anything else?”</p><cite>Magnus Carlsen</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p id="196e">Like Magnus, Warren Buffet is a master of his craft (net worth 72.6&nbsp;<strong>billion&nbsp;</strong>dollars). And like chess, investing heavily relies on a person’s ability to predict future movements.</p>



<p id="59c5">About his investing success, Warren once famously said,</p>



<blockquote><p>“We simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful”.</p></blockquote>



<p id="9552">In this quote, he clearly states that his success investing relies on his ability to extort the emotions of other investors. This strategy works great when your competition is a human, but how does it fare against a machine that has no emotion. Today, as much as 80% of daily market trades are done by trading algorithms. This then begs the question, how long does Warren Buffet have until he is completely outmatched by robots? And when he is, who will take his place?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="083a">Data Scientists — The People Behind the Algorithms</h2>



<p id="299c">Naturally, the people responsible for building the algorithms that beat Magnus Carlsen and Warren Buffet will be the ones to take their throne. Data scientists are the perfect candidates. They have both the analytical ability to understand investing techniques and the technical skills to refine and automate them.</p>



<p id="8e3b">A data scientist’s role is to analyze different metrics in hopes of predicting a future outcome. An investors job is to predict whether a stock’s price will increase or decrease. These two goals are very similar but there is one glaring caveat.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>A data scientist can be an investor, but an investor cannot be a data scientist.</strong></p></blockquote>



<p id="9c4f">People like Warren Buffet will not be the uber-successful investors of the future. They lack the technical abilities to predict the decision making of advanced algorithms. When the playing field is full of machines, only a data scientist has the tools to discover the underlying patterns in the market.</p>



<p id="2a08">Warren Buffet once said,</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“<em>Beware of geeks bearing formulas</em>”.</p><cite>Warren buffet</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p id="12e3">He doesn’t trust people who rely too heavily on algorithms. Last decade, I would have agreed with him. But with recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, the argument for algorithmic trading has greatly intensified. I believe Warren himself should be worried about “geeks bearing formulas”, they could very well be the ones who undermine his emotion biased trading philosophy.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="447c">The Mechanized Market</h2>



<p id="fd3d">When&nbsp;<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4230982-algo-trading-dominates-80-of-stock-market" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>80%</strong></a>of daily moves in the stock market are led by machines, the only people capable of&nbsp;profiting are the ones building them. And building a successful trading algorithm is difficult. There is no secret recipe of technical and sentiment indicators that can be combined like Zaxby’s sauce&nbsp;to offer the best taste. A profitable trading algorithm must be built by somebody who understands how different metrics effect each stock, and is able to interpret the results to refine and balance the algorithm. This is why the next Warren Buffet will be a data scientist, not just anybody with a technical background.</p>

<p id="0eb0">Data scientists have a framework well balanced between computer science, statistics, and business. This is the optimal mix of talents to succeed in the emerging mechanized market. A market that is reliant on the decision-making of algorithms.</p>



<p id="5974">Warren Buffet is the best investor of the last century, his net worth proves that. The next century though, will be driven by somebody whose skill-set is a concoction of business, analytics, and computer science prowess. These abilities are imperative to standing a chance in the new market led by machines.</p>

information of applicants — including social insurance numbers, home addresses, bank account details and tax information —&nbsp;and use the stolen data to impersonate victims, change addresses and direct deposit information&nbsp;and file fraudulent claims under the emergency programs.</p>  <p>The lawsuit alleges the victims have been hit with a double whammy:&nbsp;their aid applications have been frozen while the breaches are investigated, causing financial strain,&nbsp;plus&nbsp;they&nbsp;will have to guard against identity theft for the rest of their lives.</p>

<h2>'Stressed out and anxious'</h2>  <p>Three lead plaintiffs in the case, representing all affected Canadians, say they now live in fear their stolen data could be used for years by cyber criminals.</p>  <p>"I'm definitely stressed out and anxious because I don't know who has my information and I don't know who can get a copy of my information," said&nbsp;Ally Scott, who had applied for the student benefit.</p>  <p>"I am only 19 years old.

And that seems pretty daunting."</p>  <h2>'Somebody, somewhere has gotten $4,000'</h2>  <p>Another plaintiff, a police dispatcher in Windsor, Ont., wasn't even eligible to receive emergency funds as an essential worker, but had her identity stolen and used to obtain benefits for two months.</p>  <p>"Somebody, somewhere, has gotten $4,000 of payments and I don't want that to be attached to my social insurance number, because I didn't apply for it. I don't qualify," said Anne Campeau, 52.</p>  <p>Campeau said&nbsp;she felt compelled to step forward and represent herself and other victims.</p>  <p>"I believe [the CRA]&nbsp;dropped the ball when they came to dealing with it," she said.

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>In this blog post, I am going to continue exploration of <strong>compressing whole PBR texture sets</strong> together (as opposed to compressing each texture from the set separately) and using the fact that those textures are <strong>strongly correlated</strong>.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://bartwronski.com/2020/05/21/dimensionality-reduction-for-image-and-texture-set-compression/">my previous post</a>, I have described how we can “decorrelate” some of the channels using PCA/SVD and how many of the dimensions in such a decorrelated space contain small amount of information, and therefore can be either dropped completely, stored at a lower resolution, or quantized aggressively. This idea is a backbone of almost all successful image compression algorithms – from JPEG to BC/DXT.</p>



<p>This time we will look at exploring some <strong>redundancy across both the stored dimensions, as well as the image space </strong>using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_approximation">sparse methods</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-SVD">kSVD algorithm</a> (<a href="https://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~cs278/papers/ksvd.pdf">original paper link</a>).</p>



<p>From my personal motivation, I wanted to learn more about those sparse methods, play with implementing them and build some intuition – one of my coworkers and collaborators on my previous team at Google, <a href="https://elad.cs.technion.ac.il/">Michael Elad</a> is one of the key researchers in the field and his presentations inspired and interested me a lot – and as I believe that until you can implement and explain something yourself, you don’t really understand it – I wanted to explore this fascinating field (in a basic, limited form) myself.</p>



<p>First I am going to do present a simplified and intuitive explanation of what “<strong>sparsity</strong>” and “<strong>overcompletness</strong>” mean and how their redundancy can be an advantage. Then I will describe how we can use sparse approximation methods for tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and texture compression. Then I will provide a quick explanation of k-SVD algorithm steps and how it works, and finally show some results / evaluation for the task of <strong>compressing PBR material texture sets</strong>. </p>



<p>This post will come with <strong>a colab notebook</strong> (soon – I need to clean it up slightly) so you can reproduce all the code and explore those methods yourself.</p>



<h3>Sparse and dictionary based methods in real-time rendering?</h3>



<p>I tried to look for some other references to dictionary based methods in real time rendering and was able to find only of three resources: <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ManchorKo/gdc2013-ompandksvd">a presentation by Manny Ko and Robin Green about kSVD and OMP</a>, <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ManchorKo/dictionary-learningingames-kodraft7gdc14mathforgames">a presentation by Manny Ko about Dictionary Learning in Games</a>, and a mention of using <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19EHLJAfqQECjRRShHyS3mHrg4XFxpCOx/view">Vector Quantization for shadow mask compression by Bo Li</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_quantization">VQ is a method</a> that is more similar to palletizing than full dictionary learning, but still a part of the family of sparse methods. I recommend those presentations, (a lot of what I describe about the theoretical part – and how I describe – overlaps with them) and if you are aware of any more mentions of those IMO underutilized methods in such a context, please leave a comment and I’ll be happy to link. </p>



<h2>Vector storage – complete and orthogonal basis, vs overcomplete and sparsely used frames / dictionaries</h2>



<p>To explain what are sparse methods, let’s start with a simple, 2 dimensional vector. How can we represent such a vector? “This is obvious, we can just use 2 numbers, x and y!”. Sure, but what do those numbers mean? They correspond to an <strong>orthonormal vector basis</strong>. x and y represent actually a proportion of position along the x axis, and the y axis. If you have done computer graphics, you know that you can easily change your basis. For example, a vector can be decribed in so called “world space” (with arbitrary, fixed point), “camera / view space”, or for some simple video game AI  purpose in space of a computer-controlled character.</p>

<p>Vector basis might have different properties. Two that are very desired are orthogonality and normality, often combined together as <strong>orthonormal basis</strong>. Orthonormality gives us trivial way of changing information between two basis back and forth (no matrix inversion required, no scaling/non-unity Jacobians introduced) and some other properties related to closed form products and integrals – it’s beyond scope of this post, but I recommend <a href="https://www.ppsloan.org/publications/StupidSH36.pdf">“Stupid Spherical Harmonics Tricks”</a> from Peter-Pike Sloan for some examples how SH being orthonormal makes it a desired basis for storing spherical signals. </p>



<p>Choice of “the best” basis matters a lot when doing compression – I have described it in <a href="https://bartwronski.com/2020/05/21/dimensionality-reduction-for-image-and-texture-set-compression/">my previous blog</a>, but as a quick refresher, “decorrelating” dimensions can give us basis in which information is maximized in each sequential subset of dimensions – meaning that the first dimension has the most information and variability present, the next one the same or smaller amount etc. This is limited to linear relationships and covariance, but lots of real data shows linear redundancy.</p>

<p>One of the requirements of a space to be a basis is <strong>completeness</strong> and <strong>uniqueness</strong> of representation. Uniqueness of the representation means that given a fixed basis, there is only a single way to describe a vector in this space. <strong>Completeness </strong>means that every vector can be represented without loss of information. In my last post, we looked at the <strong>truncated SVD – which is not complete</strong>, because we lose some original information and there is no way how we can represent it back.</p>



<p>What is quite interesting is that we can go further than vector basis and go towards <strong>overcomplete frames</strong> (let’s simplify – a lot – for the purpose of this post and say that frame is just “some generalization” of a basis). This means that we have more vectors in space than the “rank” of the information we want to store. Overcomplete frames can’t be orthogonal or unique (I encourage readers for whom this is a new concept to try to prove it – even if just intuitively). Sounds pretty useless for information compression? Not really, let me give here a visual example:</p>







<div><figure><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="3998" data-permalink="https://bartwronski.com/image-2-6/" data-orig-file="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png" data-orig-size="834,409" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=640" src="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=834" alt="" width="454" height="221" srcset="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=451 451w, https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=150 150w, https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px"><figcaption>Example of a set of points/vectors that cannot be represented well by any two orthogonal vectors, but on the other hand three frame vectors describe this set pretty well.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Note that while in the case of overcomplete frame every point can be described in infinitely many ways (just like x + y = 5 has infinitely many solutions of x and y values that satisfy it), we usually are going to look for a <strong>sparse representation</strong>. We want as many of the components to be zero (or close to zero enough so that we can discard them, accepting some errors), and the input vectors described by a linear combination of less frame vectors than the size of the original basis. </p>



<p>If this description seems vague, looking at the above example – with complete basis, we generally need two numbers to describe the input point set. However, with an overcomplete frame, we can use just a single 2-bit basis index and a float value describing magnitude along it:</p>

<p>Yes, we lose some information, and there is an approximation error – but there is always an error in the case of lossy compression – and the error in such a basis is way smaller than from any truncated SVD (keeping a single dimension of orthogonal basis).</p>



<p>Terminology wise – we commonly refer to a frame vector as <strong>atom</strong>, and collection of atoms as <strong>dictionary</strong> – and I will use atoms and dictionary mostly throughout this post.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="4012" data-permalink="https://bartwronski.com/image-9-3/" data-orig-file="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-9.png" data-orig-size="951,407" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-9" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-9.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-9.png?w=640" src="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-9.png?w=951" alt="" srcset="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-9.png 951w, https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-9.png?w=150 150w, https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-9.png?w=300 300w, https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-9.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 951px) 100vw, 951px"><figcaption>Dense vs sparse representation – a dense representation has a minimal number of dimensions (rank) of the set, but every item represented in it is going to be represented by multiple coefficients. With sparse representation, we might have many more dimensions, but every item is going to be represented by a small subset of those – most coefficients are zero.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Also note – we will come back to this later in the next section – I have used here a 2D example and a 1-sparse representation (single atom to represent input) – but with higher dimensions, we can (and in practice do) <strong>use multiple atoms per vector</strong> – so if you have 16 atoms, any representation that uses 1-15 of them can be considered sparse. Obviously if the input space is 3D, and your dictionary has 20 atoms, while a 10 atom representation of a vector “could” be seen as sparse, it probably won’t make sense for most practical scenarios.</p>



<h2>Sparsity and images – palettes and tiles</h2>



<p>Now I admit, this 2D case is not super compelling. However, things start to look much more interesting in some much higher dimensions. Imagine that instead of storing 20 numbers for a 20 dimensional vector, you could store just a few indices and a few numbers – in very high dimensions, sparse representations get more and more interesting. Before going towards high dimensional case, let me just show some interesting connection – what happens if for a single pixel of e.g. RGB image we store only index (not even a weight) from a dictionary? Then we end up with an <strong>image palette</strong>.</p>

<p>Image palettization is an example of a sparse representation method! One of many algorithms to compute image palette it is k-means, which is a more basic version of k-SVD that I’m going to describe later.</p>



<p>Palettization generalizes to many dimensions – if you have a PBR texture set with 20 channels, you can still palettize it – just your entries will be 20 dimensional vectors. </p>



<p>However, we can go much further and increase the dimensionality (hoping for <strong>more redundancy in more dimensions</strong>) much further. Let’s have a look at this Kodak dataset image and at <strong>image tiles</strong>:</p>

<p>There is lots of self-similarity in this image – not just within pixel values (those would palettize very well), but among whole image patches! In such a scenario, we can take a whole patch to become our input vector. I have mentioned in the past that thinking beyond “image is 2D matrix / 3D tensor” is one …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>A few years ago we started our own VR product for Location-Based Entertainment (LBE). But we were not a game studio - there were no staff game designers, artists or modellers. We didnâ€™t have a multi million budget to create a full featured game studio. However, we were a team of experienced software engineers with a goal to create a quality VR product that would excite our clients and us.</p>
<p>The early successful VR LBE products were based on modern 6DOF (6 degrees of freedom) VR technologies and exploited the fact that clients had only tried low quality 3DOF cardboard VR or other outdated VR arcades (or had not even tried VR at all). That means, frankly, it was easy to impress people when they started playing your game, but harder to advertise and actually persuade them to try. There was also a requirement to make the VR experience short - no longer than 30 minutes. The VR hardware (especially computer backpack) were too heavy for those who tried VR for the first time. </p>
<p>These two points (easy to impress and a short session length) helped decrease the cost of developing a quality VR LBE product. You didnâ€™t have to be a full featured game studio and create a long and complex game to create a great experience. We think that VR LBE still preserves the same traits today.</p>
<p>We have experience developing both types of VR LBE products - full-immersion games and active e-sport games. Each type has its own challenges and set of expectations, but there are of course some common difficulties, especially for a less experienced and not fully featured game studio. We will discuss them below.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/poster1.jpg" alt=""></p><p>In full-immersion games itâ€™s important to create a rich atmosphere by using photo-realistic visuals, quality audio effects, and haptic feedback. Ideally, such content should be developed in house and will require artists and modellers to create high quality assets. But we chose to focus on the software and effects part to explore the modern VR potential. Most 3D models we purchased from the Unity Assets Store and only hired freelancers to work on specific parts. It put the quality of the final product at risk, but was far cheaper and faster than starting from the ground up.</p>
<p>One of the main aspects of immersion are high-quality models. Players must be able to look at objects such as guns, interior parts, surfaces and NPCs at very close range - literally right before their eyes. That means that models should have enough polygons and use PBR (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_based_rendering">Physically based rendering</a>). Full-immersion games require powerful computers or non-trivial optimization techniques and huge development efforts for a mobile VR platform like Oculus Quest.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/1598256667761-2.jpg" alt=""></p><p>In active e-sport games players move quickly and interact with each other and the game environment at a very high speed. The goal is to get the highest score and stay ahead of your competitors. This fact lowers the 3D models requirements - they donâ€™t have to look very real, you can even get away with using low-poly models for some content.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s much more important to tune the game balance, dynamics and play area geometry. But it doesnâ€™t mean you can just throw a bunch of primitives on the Scene and ignore creating 3D models and paying artists - a smaller level of detail doesnâ€™t entail lower quality. Due to budget limitations, we didnâ€™t hire staff modellers and instead bought 3D models from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/5217">Synty Studios</a>. We think they produce the best low-poly models that can be used even with low-power mobile VR hardware like Oculus Quest without significant optimization efforts. Of course, if the performance cost was lower, we would prefer to use high quality photo-realistic assets for e-sports as well.</p>
<p>Whenever you buy 3D models in a public store like Unity Assets Store, you run the risk of finding the same assets in a competing product, especially if you use something unique, like Synty Studios assets. However, we think itâ€™s less of an issue in VR LBE games than in PC and console games - VR LBE and the general gaming market have different target audiences. The main problem is that in VR we can use only a small subset of the vast model selection of public stores. Is there a way to solve this without hiring 3D artists and modellers? Letâ€™s figure it out.</p>
<h2>A Dream</h2>
<p>Letâ€™s imagine you are walking in some atmospheric place and suddenly come up with an idea for a VR quest that will be based on the location youâ€™re in.
<img src="https://exyte.com/upload/1598256744121-3.jpg" alt="">
You capture the location in a video using your smartphone. At home you open the editor of your choice and import the video from the cloud. In a few minutes you have a ready to use 3D scene, perfectly capturing the location you were in.</p>
<p>Then, you select the half-rotten couch and rotate it up-right - an NPC will wait for the players here. You noticed there are cranes demolishing another building in the distance. You decide they should be a bit closer, so you select and move them. All crane movements have been captured as well.</p>
<p>You launch the demo using your mobile VR device. Here you can move around freely and plan future quest scenarios.</p>
<p>Is this achievable today? Obviously not, but we think the technology is getting there - itâ€™s already possible to scan individual objects, buildings, streets and even whole cities. After some processing, the scanned objects can be used by modern 3D games, VR, 3D printing devices and in other technical applications. Real time 3D scanning is used by self-driving cars and robots. Most AAA projects use scanned assets to achieve excellent graphics quality and reduce model creation time. But the scanned models still have to be processed by modellers.</p>
<p>Can we potentially do away with manual modelling? Probably not, even if the scanning technology starts working perfectly - itâ€™s impossible to scan something which only exists in your imagination. Pure 3D scanning is useless for Sci-Fi and fantasy projects and objects that donâ€™t have real world references. But someday we might have GANs (generative adversarial networks) which can generate 3D models and even full scenes just based on sketches.</p>
<p>This article is the first in a series that will try to answer the following questions:</p>

<h2>How to scan reality</h2>
<p>Today there are several ways to scan real world objects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ordinary 2D photos (photogrammetry).</li>
<li>Structured light solutions.</li>
<li>Time-of-Flight cameras and lasers.</li>
<li>Light field cameras.</li>
</ul>
<p>These approaches will be further discussed in the series, with each article focusing on a single approach. The next article discussing photogrammetry is available here - <a href="https://exyte.com/a-scanning-dream-using-a-camera">â€œA Scanning Dream: using a cameraâ€�</a>.</p>

    <p>My feeble attempt at a non-too-technical, mostly FUD- and hyperbole-free
FAQ about WebAssembly.</p>

<h4 id="is-webassembly-cpu-machine-code">Is WebAssembly CPU machine code?</h4>

<p>No, WebAssembly is an intermediate format more akin to
.NET or Java bytecode than machine code. If you don’t like
the .NET or Java association, just think of it as an instruction
set of a ‘fantasy CPU’.</p>

<h4 id="is-webassembly-assembly-code">Is WebAssembly assembly code?</h4>

<p>No, ‘assembly code’ usually means the text representation of a specific
CPU instruction set. WebAssembly in its typical form is neither a text
representation nor is it CPU-specific (the WASM spec <em>does</em> define a text
representation though, which is basically WebAssembly-assembly).</p>

<h4 id="is-webassembly-java-appletsactivexplugins-20">Is WebAssembly “Java Applets/ActiveX/Plugins 2.0”?</h4>

<p>No:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>it is different from <strong>Java Applets</strong> because it reuses the
existing Javascript VM that already exists in browsers instead
of adding another big VM which would have to be security-hardened. WebAssembly
also doesn’t allow to call out into native code like Java Applets did via JNI.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>ActiveX and browser plugins</strong> were native machine code DLLs where the security was
built on trusting a 3rd-party and wishful thinking. With WebAssembly
the trust rests solely on the browser maker and his ability to secure the
browser sandbox.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="is-webassembly-a-security-risk">Is WebAssembly a security risk?</h4>

<p>No, unless you consider Javascript a security risk. WebAssembly is about as
secure as Javascript since it runs in the same sandbox. Typical WebAssembly
implementations only add a fairly small parser module to the existing JS
engine. For instance in <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/webkit">WebKit</a>, WebAssembly seems to
account for about 10k out of 432k lines of code for the whole JavaScriptCore
engine. So only about 2% of the whole Javascript engine are a new 
WebAssembly-specific attack surface.</p>

<h4 id="can-i-access-sockets-files-native-api-x-from-webassembly">Can I access sockets, files, native API X… from WebAssembly?</h4>

<p>No, WebAssembly runs inside the browser sandbox and can only access Web
APIs (just like Javascript). However, the emscripten SDK provides wrappers
for many common native APIs which simplifies porting existing C/C++ code
over (for instance sockets-to-WebSockets, GL-to-WebGL, OpenAL-to-WebAudio,
and some more…).</p>

<h4 id="can-i-load-and-call-into-a-dll-from-webassembly">Can I load and call into a DLL from WebAssembly?</h4>

<p>No, DLLs are native machine code and thus off-limits.</p>

<p>Slightly related: WebAssembly supports <em>dynamic linking</em> between WASM modules,
this allows to reuse shared code modules (the idea is to reduce download size
by moving shared code into a separate module which can be cached locally).</p>

<h4 id="can-i-start-a-program-or-process-from-webassembly">Can I start a program or process from WebAssembly?</h4>

<p>Nope, same reason as DLLs, it would be unsafe.</p>

<h4 id="can-webassembly-be-used-to-circumvent-adblockers">Can WebAssembly be used to circumvent adblockers?</h4>

<p>No, it can only do things that Javascript can do. Even if the ad doesn’t
download images but renders its content ‘procedurally’ through
WebAssembly code, the actual WebAssembly module must have been downloaded
from some URL first (usually an ad-network server) and this can be
intercepted and blocked by adblockers just like regular ads.</p>

<h4 id="but-what-about-show-source">…but what about ‘Show Source’?!</h4>

<p>Come on now… that train had already left since people started using
Javascript minifiers and obfuscators. Just print a link to the github repo on
the JS console.</p>

<h4 id="as-a-frontend-developer-do-i-need-to-learn-cc-now">As a frontend developer, do I need to learn C/C++ now?</h4>

<p>No. One interesting use-case for WebAssembly is to create libraries that are
callable from Javascript. Computation-heavy code (for instance image
manipulation, physics engines, or whole game engines) could be implemented
as WebAssembly modules, but offer a Javascript API. <em>Using</em> such WebAssembly
module wouldn’t be much different from using a Javascript framework.</p>

<h4 id="can-webassembly-manipulate-the-dom">Can WebAssembly manipulate the DOM?</h4>

<p>For some reason this question seems to pop up most frequently :) The
answer is both no and yes. It cannot <em>directly</em> access the DOM, but it can
call out into Javascript, and JS can then work on the DOM. In emscripten this
is as simple as directly inlining Javascript code into C++ code. But jumping
back and forth between WebAssembly and Javascript isn’t fast (but it isn’t
terribly slow either, as demonstrated by emscripten’s GL-to-WebGL wrapper).
It’s perfectly possible to create a “dom.h” C or C++ library to do typical
“frontend programming” via WebAssembly, but this doesn’t make sense if the
motivation is performance, and C/C++ is probably not the nicest language for
this. DOM manipulation might make more sense with other languages that are
meant as a Javascript replacement.</p>

<h4 id="isnt-webassembly-useless-for-garbage-collected-languages">Isn’t WebAssembly useless for garbage collected languages?</h4>

<p>YES AND THANK THE GODS FOR THAT! Erm, actually no, scratch that :)</p>

<p>It is true that WebAssembly doesn’t have garbage collection support, but this
doesn’t mean that a WebAssembly module cannot implement its own garbage
collector. Look at <a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/07/09/il2cpp-internals-garbage-collector-integration/">Unity3D’s
IL2CPP</a>, <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2017/04/kotlinnative-tech-preview-kotlin-without-a-vm/">Kotlin
Native</a>,
or clang’s <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html">Automatic Reference
Counting</a> for
examples of garbage-collected languages that don’t need a garbage-collected VM to work.
There is some info about potential GC support in a future WebAssembly version <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/GC.md">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="but-webassembly-programs-are-too-big">But WebAssembly programs are too big!</h4>

<p>This is not the fault of WebAssembly itself, which is a very compact byte code
format, but usually is a problem of the code base that’s been compiled to WebAssembly.</p>

<p>There are several reasons why WebAssembly modules can become bloated:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Language runtimes</strong>: Most languages need some sort of runtime library to be
useful. In C this includes functions like printf, strcmp, fopen, … in C++
the std library classes can be considered the runtime even though most std
library code is in inline methods. Higher level languages like C# have a much
‘richer’ runtime, this is good for programmer productivity, but terrible for
code size.</li>
  <li><strong>Huge ‘Modulith’ Projects</strong>: Large C++ projects like AAA game engines or big
UI frameworks are easily multi-million-line code bases, and also often
heavily use OOP features like dynamic dispatch (virtual methods). Such code
bases make it very hard for the compiler’s dead code elimination to do its
thing.</li>
  <li><strong>3rd-party-dependencies</strong>: Many libraries and (for instance) game
development middleware haven’t been designed with binary size in mind, and
adding such dependencies carelessly can quickly grow out of control.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the ‘native world’ executable sizes of several dozen megabytes are not
uncommon these days, but on the web this is simply not acceptable. The TL;DR
is to use a more ‘embedded-programming’ philosophy when writing code for
WebAssembly (also here’s one of my older blog posts about the topic: 
<a href="http://floooh.github.io/2016/08/27/asmjs-diet.html">10 simple diet tricks for asm.js</a>).</p>

<p>WebAssembly programs <em>can</em> be small, but it takes effort. Hopefully now that
‘executable size’ is important again, we will also see more developers focus on this. Maybe
somebody comes up with a smallest-possible C runtime (I’m sure there’s still
room for improvements if seldom-used features are removed).</p>

<h4 id="if-webassembly-is-running-in-the-js-engine-how-can-it-be-fast">If WebAssembly is running in the JS engine, how can it be fast?</h4>

<p>…mainly for the same reasons that asm.js is faster than ‘idiomatic’ Javascript:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No garbage collection</strong>: both asm.js and WASM do not produce ‘garbage’ 
that needs to be collected, thus the JS garbage collector doesn’t kick in while
asm.js or WASM is running.
The only exception is when calling out into Javascript to talk to web APIs,
the JS shim usually needs to create temporary JS objects, and this produces 
garbage. New web APIs often make it a point to
offer ‘garbage free’ functions, which will help a lot when being called
from asm.js or WebAssembly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Everything is static</strong>: Javascript is an extremely dynamic language, which requires a
lot of effort to make it run fast since the JS engine needs to track type
changes and may decide to re-compile and re-optimize functions during runtime.
For highly dynamic code this burns a lot of CPU cycles and makes performance
behaviour unpredictable. WASM and asm.js both got rid of all this ‘dynamicism’. 
Once the code is compiled, it is guaranteed to stay that way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A linear memory model</strong>: This is probably the biggest difference to most
‘managed VMs’, and the most important factor for performance. High level
languages like Javascript, C# or Java treat memory as an idealized,
infinitely fast and infinitely big resource which the programmer shouldn’t
have to think about. Unfortunately the real world is a bit more complicated,
for instance there are little annoying details like cache-misses. In short,
having full control over the exact layout of data in memory is essential for
good performance. System programming languages like C, C++ and Rust allow
this fine level of control, and one of the most ingenious features of
emscripten (even before asm.js) was that it moved this ‘linear memory model’
into the Javascript environment by putting the C heap into a single Javascript 
TypedArray. This way the memory layout defined by the original C/C++ source code
is preserved, and the advantages of arranging
data in a cache-friendly way carry over.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>That’s about all the FAQ-worthy questions I can think of for now. Until next time :)</p>

My workflow has changed substantially over the last several years. I thought I'd share what I'm currently doing.</p>
<p>Some criticize my workflow for its complexity, but I can assure you that it is amazingly functional once set up. I can't imagine working any other way.</p>
<p>I'll start with the "meta" <strong>infrastructure programs</strong> that make the whole workflow run, including the set-up. I'll then cover how I <strong>collect information</strong>. After that, I'll write about how I <strong>read and synthesize</strong> the information to help with sense-making. Then, I'll go over <strong>extracting information</strong>. Finally, I'll take you through <strong>the writing process</strong>, from concept to manuscript/grant submission. I've included links to past articles to show how I've set up my infrastructure.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="set-up">Set-up</h3>
<p><em>Hazel</em> recognizes any manuscripts saved to my Downloads Folder. Once matched, Hazel sends the file to Bookends.</p>
</div></div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596762548609_18772"><div><p><em>Hazel</em> monitors folders on my computer and acts on individual files according to rules I create. <em>Hazel</em> can even peek at the content of files and "recognize" what's inside. I have Hazel monitoring about a dozen folders on my Mac, but my Downloads Folder keeps <em>Hazel</em> the busiest. I have about two dozen rules running on my Downloads Folder alone. For this particular writing workflow, I ask Hazel to look at the contents of every PDF in my Downloads Folder and match files that have words unique to scholarly publications. I've found matching the matching criteria works the best. (I now use DOI instead of the term References, avoiding the import of annoying things, like CVs, into my Bookends database).</p>
<p><em>Bookends</em> syncs via iCloud (Mac and iOS).</p>
<p><em>Devonthink</em> indexes (not imports) multiple folders including: </p>
<ol>
<li>the PDF folder generated by Bookends in iCloud,</li>
<li>The Archive Folder in Dropbox, and</li>
<li>my Annotations Folder in Dropbox.</li>
</ol>
<p>My <em>Devonthink</em> database is synchronized via Dropbox to <em>Devonthink To Go</em>.</p>
<h3 id="collecting-information">Collecting information</h3>
<p>I collect information using <em>QxMD Read</em>, <em>Twitter</em>, or <em>Devonthink RSS</em> to find new literature. Less commonly, I conduct formal searches in PubMed or Google Scholar on the web or through <em>Bookends</em>. Other times I use <em>Launchbar</em> or <em>Highlights</em> to download literature I've found in the Bibliography of a manuscript.</p>
<p>Once I've found the information I'd like to read, I attempt to download the PDF. In iOS, If the PDF is available, I open the PDF with <em>Bookends</em>. Opening the PDF in <em>Bookends</em> imports the reference and PDF into the Bookend database and grabs the metadata. </p>
<p>If I'm on my Mac, I download the paper to my Downloads Folder. A Hazel script automatically launches Bookends and imports the manuscript into Bookends. </p>
<p>If the PDF isn't immediately available—I capture the reference to <em>OmniFocus</em> until I'm at work or when I sign on to work's VPN.</p>
<h3 id="reading-and-synthesizing">Reading and Synthesizing</h3>
<p>I read manuscripts almost exclusively in the <em>Highlights app</em> on my Mac or iPad. As I'm going, I highlight and make comments on the annotations. I read the entire paper through to the end, highlighting and commenting as I go. If I want to retain a significant point of an article, I make a Zettel (using my Zettel Template in <em>The Archive</em> on my Mac, or <em>Drafts</em> on iOS).</p>

<p><strong>My extraction process has changed significantly since 2015.</strong> I highlight the manuscript using <em>Highlights App</em> (either on my Mac or my iPad). After I annotate the paper, I'm ready to process it to make the information accessible to my writing system. I make sure my Bookends Library is synchronized and then work from my Mac. </p>
<p><strong>I no longer extract my annotations as individual files</strong> (this was far too labor-intensive and messed with the accuracy of Devonthink's AI). Instead, when I'm at my Mac, I open the paper from <em>Bookends</em> using <em>Highlights</em>. I make sure the metadata has been captured in Highlights (this ensures the proper information link back to <em>Bookends</em>). Then, <strong>I export all my annotations and comments as a single HTML file saved to an Annotations Folder in Dropbox.</strong> Finally, I index (not import) the Annotations Folder on Dropbox into Devonthink. This new workflow works much more reliably with <em>Devonthink's</em> AI.</p>
<p>Why HTML? Honestly, I'd prefer to use the Textbundle format, but Devonthink To Go is not able to recognize Textbundles. I like HTML documents because they include figures. Later, if I want, I can convert the extracted annotations into a PDF, but thus far, the Webarchive HTML files work well. </p>
<p>My Devonthink Writing Database has multiple indexed folders, including The Archive, PDFs from Bookends, and my extracted HTML Annotations. I have my <a href="https://wippp.com/home/keeping-current-with-devonthink-and-rss-feeds">RSS feeds of scientific literature</a> in a separate database. <strong>Devonthink's AI finds recently published papers related to documents in my library.</strong></p>
</div></div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596762548609_26641"><div><h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h3><h4 id="blog-and-short-document-writing-ulysses-and-bear">Blog and Short Document Writing - Ulysses and Bear</h4><p>For creative writing, I now use <em>Bear</em>. I love Bear's writing environment (I think it improves my creativity) and use it for personal stories and songwriting. Blog entries, I write in <em>Ulysses</em>. Ulysses and Bear's multi-platform support and seamless synchronization are priceless for writing. Because I'm a bit fearful of proprietary formats, I am diligent about backing up my work. I use an <em>Omnifocus</em> reminder to backup both my Bear and in Ulysses database every week. </p><h4 id="manuscripts-grants-and-books-scrivener">Manuscripts, Grants, and Books - Scrivener</h4><p>For longer writing projects, nothing compares to <em>Scrivener</em>. <em>Scrivener</em> is a complete writing studio. I use the software regularly. I often use <em>Scapple</em> (created by the same developers as <em>Scrivener</em>) to plan the manuscript at a high level. To build my Scapple outline, I brainstorm ideas (including many trips to Devonthink). I prefer Scapple over other mind mapping software as it is less constrained on parent-children relationships. </p><p>Although I capture information differently from 2015, my use of Devonthink for finding information remains relatively unchanged. See the following entries:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://wippp.com/home/automating-the-organization-and-accessibility-of-academic-literature-bookends-and-devonthink-pro">Automating The Organization And Accessibility Of Academic Literature: Bookends And Devonthink Pro</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wippp.com/home/keeping-current-with-devonthink-and-rss-feeds">Unlock The Power Of RSS Feeds With Devonthink</a></li>
</ul><p>I can brainstorm and then move ideas around. I no longer use <em>Tinderbox</em>. Although very powerful, I spent far too much time trying to master simple tasks in Tinderbox rather than getting work done. Maybe I'll pick it up again in the future.</p><p>Once I've outlined my paper in <em>Scapple</em>, I export the <em>Scapple</em> file to OPML. If the outline is ready to start writing, I import the OPML file directly into <em>Scrivener</em>. If I want to tweak the outline more or add additional information, I open the OPML document in OmniOutliner. </p><p>Once my outline is in <em>Scrivener</em>, I start writing. The modern version of <em>Scrivener</em> synchronizes between all my devices, Mac and iOS. When I need to find a concept or citation, I turn to Devonthink either on my Mac (usually) or iOS (in a pinch). When I find something I want to use in my writing, I click the link at the top of the page on the HTML document. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596762548609_32992"><p>Clicking the link takes me to the corresponding reference in Bookends. I find the text from the annotations in the Bookends and copy the note (or notes) by right-clicking. </p></div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596762548609_39660"><div><p>I then paste the note under the appropriate heading in Scrivener (or in Scapple or OmniOutliner if I'm still organizing). The single annotation is copied from Bookends along with the coded citation that will help Bookends compile my Bibliography.</p>
<p>Once I've pasted the note in Scrivener, I change the text color to blue. That way, I know what words I copied verbatim. I use Scrivener to track the state of various parts of the project. I use the interplay of Scrivener and Bookends to cite references as I'm writing. Different sections of my project go through multiple drafts—Scrivener tracks the phase of each component.</p>
<p>When the project is nearing completion, I export the project to Microsoft Word. There, I put the final touches on the manuscript. I then use the Speech function of my Mac to read each paragraph of the document back to me. I'm always amazed at how many errors I catch in this last phase of writing. Finally, I format the paper and Bibliography with Bookends. At this point, the information is ready to submit.</p>
<p>This is an overview of my current writing workflow. I’m curious to see what others are doing and/or how you riff/build on my workflow.</p>
<p>Until next time……</p>

<p><span>Abstract</span></p>
<p>
Physics-based rendering algorithms generate photorealistic images by simulating the flow of light through a detailed mathematical representation of a virtual scene. In contrast, <b>physics-based differentiable rendering</b> algorithms focus on computing derivative of images exhibiting complex light transport effects (e.g., soft shadows, interreflection, and caustics) with respect to arbitrary scene parameters such as camera pose, object geometry (e.g., vertex positions) as well as spatially varying material properties expressed as 2D textures and 3D volumes. This new level of generality has made physics-based differentiable rendering a key ingredient for solving many challenging inverse-rendering problems, that is, the search of scene configurations optimizing user-specified objective functions, using gradient-based methods
</p>
<p>
Further, these techniques can be incorporated into probabilistic inference and machine learning pipelines. For instance, differentiable renderers allow "rendering losses" to be computed with complex light transport effects captured. Additionally, they can be used as generative models that synthesize photorealistic images.
</p>
<p>
<u><b>Challenges.</b></u> Compared to its "ordinary" counterpart, physics-based differentiable rendering introduces unique theoretical and practical challenges. For instance, practical problems can involve many (e.g., 10<sup>6</sup>--10<sup>10</sup>) parameters, making simple techniques for differentiation such as finite differences impractical. More advanced tools for automatic differentiation (e.g., <tt>PyTorch</tt> or <tt>Tensorflow</tt>) record a graph of intermediate computation steps that tends to become prohibitively large. Lastly, geometric derivatives involve a unique challenge: boundaries of objects introduce troublesome discontinuities during the computation of shadows and interreflections that lead to incorrect gradients if precautions are not taken. Thankfully, recent advances in physics-based differentiable rendering theory have enabled the differentiation of radiometric measurements with respect to arbitrary scene parameters as well as unbiased Monte Carlo estimators. <b>In this course, we provide an in-depth introduction to general-purpose physics-based differentiable rendering.</b>

        <p>Newsletters are a great way to find content, but the more you subscribe to, the worst your reading experience becomes. Email apps aren’t tailored for reading a ton of newsletters and finding what you want to read soon becomes a hassle. A few apps have begun tackling this problem with their own unique approaches to newsletter consumption. If your inbox is becoming overwhelmed, now might be the time to give one of these a try.</p>
<h2 id="Stoop-Inbox"><a href="#Stoop-Inbox" title="Stoop Inbox"></a><a href="https://stoopinbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stoop Inbox</a></h2><p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hotlinks-f6004.appspot.com/blog/blog_stoop.jpg" alt="Stoop Inbox" title="Stoop Inbox"><br>Stoop gives you a new email address to subscribe to your favourite newsletters. Once you subscribe with that address, those newsletters will show up within the app and be nealty organised for a better reading experience. It frees your email inbox from the flood of newsletters and it makes it easier to read those you want to on your own time.</p>
<h2 id="Newslettrs"><a href="#Newslettrs" title="Newslettrs"></a><a href="https://newslettrs.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newslettrs</a></h2><p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hotlinks-f6004.appspot.com/blog/blog_newslettrs.jpg" alt="Newslettrs" title="Newslettrs"><br>Newslettrs works like Stoop but there’s only a website but it offers a clean reading user experience that’s easy to navigate and read.</p>

Being able to use any modality (speech, touch, gestures, eye gaze) that best fits your current situation is seen as liberating and inclusive for a wide range of users.</p><figure><iframe width="459" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RyBEUyEtxQo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Of course, this has been greatly influenced by SciFi, too. When people envision future multimodal user experiences, examples like Minority Report often come to mind where people are standing in front of gigantic machines that support all kinds of input modalities at once. Is this practical today?</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/tom-cruise-steven-spielberg-minority-report-BLVqLi1p4Pt7i">via GIPHY</a></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>3.5 years ago (shortly before <a href="https://www.jovo.tech/">Jovo</a> joined betaworks <a href="https://betaworks.com/voicecamp/">Voicecamp</a>), I published an article called <a href="https://www.context-first.com/alexa-please-send-this-to-my-screen/">Alexa, Please Send This To My Screen</a> with some early thoughts on voice experience design. I came to the conclusion that most voice experiences need to be embedded into wider product ecosystems to become truly useful. To me, one of the biggest differences between SciFi and technology today is that our interactions are now spread across different devices. There is no more “one machine does everything.”</p><p>The new multimodal experience is not just one device that supports everything, it’s a product ecosystem that works across devices and contexts.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/08/multimodal-then-now.jpg"></figure><p>And it seems like things are progressing. When I published the article, smart speakers were mostly disconnected voice-only devices. Just a few months later, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/dp/B077SXWSRP">Echo Show</a> was introduced as the first Alexa smart display and Google Assistant became more deeply integrated into Android phones, allowing for some early continuous experiences like “send this to my phone.” I’m confident that it soon will be normal for any device to be shipped with a microphone.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/08/voice-then-now-soon.jpg"></figure><p>With all these new devices added to the product mix, it gets more and more complex to design, build, and improve connected experiences. Which devices and modalities should you build for? It’s easy to lose track of the user's needs with all these technological possibilities.<br></p><h2 id="context-first-a-term-and-publication">Context-First, a Term and Publication</h2><blockquote>“<em>The right information, at the right time, on the right device.</em>”</blockquote><p>The quote from above was adapted from Michal Levin’s great book <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-multi-device-experiences/9781449340391/">Designing Multi-Device Experiences</a> that I read a few years ago. For us, this is what contextual experiences should be all about: delivering value on the best available device and modality.</p><p>At<a href="https://www.jovo.tech/"> Jovo</a>, we've been mentioning the term <em>Context-First</em> for a while, most prominently in our <a href="https://www.context-first.com/introducing-jovo-v3-the-voice-layer/">v3 launch announcement</a>. There is so much overlap between “voice” and “multimodal” experiences that it always felt weird to us to use terms like “voice-first.” With more devices being available, context plays an even more important role in product design decisions. It was important for us to find a term that reflects this.</p><p>We want to use this publication for documentation and open learning about building context-first products. When I started working on <a href="https://twitter.com/einkoenig/status/993818598530527232">my masters’ thesis</a>, there was not a lot of actionable information available on multimodal user interfaces. It was either too concrete (focused on the “here”, e.g. simplistic tutorials) or too abstract (focused on the “there”, e.g. very visionary, futuristic essays). The industry still lacks content that focuses on the in-between (<a href="https://twitter.com/einkoenig/status/1259830479517343744">here are some counter examples</a>).</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/08/actionable-middle.png"></figure><p>Here are some topics that we will likely cover:</p><ul><li>Challenges that need to be solved to get from “here” to “there”</li><li>Deep dives into different device types and modalities</li><li>Case studies and examples that focus on a specific vertical</li><li>Providing business context for the more <a href="https://www.jovo.tech/news">technical Jovo announcements</a><br></li></ul><p>What are you interested in?

Yet, there’s no denying that GitHub has become the <em>de facto</em> standard to host Open Source projects. With GitHub Actions, it’s now possible to implement entire Continuous Integration pipelines without leaving GitHub.</p> <p>In this post, I’d like to highlight how to release Maven <em>artifacts</em> using GitHub Actions.</p> <div> <h2 id="maven-prerequisites">Maven prerequisites</h2> <div> <p>Before creating the <abbr title="Continuous Integration">CI</abbr> pipeline - and running it, it’s necessary to configure the underlying Maven project.</p> <div> <h3 id="a-quick-maven-primer">A quick Maven primer</h3> <p>Maven is a large subject, that deserves more than this post can cover. But to understand the rest of this post, here are the most important parts.</p> <p>Maven references projects by a triplet of unique coordinates composed of:</p> <ol><li><span>A group ID</span></li><li><span>An artifact ID</span></li><li><span>A version</span></li></ol> <p>For example, the sample project’s coordinates are:</p> <div> <p>pom.xml</p> <div> <pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;groupId&gt;</span>ch.frankel.blog.renamer<span>&lt;/groupId&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;artifactId&gt;</span>renamer-swing<span>&lt;/artifactId&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;version&gt;</span>1.0-SNAPSHOT<span>&lt;/version&gt;</span></code></pre> </div> </div> <p>The output of a project is an artifact <em>e.g.</em> a JAR.</p> <p>You can append the version of a project with <code>-SNAPSHOT</code>. A <em>snapshot</em> version is under development; a non-snapshot one, a regular release.</p> <p>Some projects provide milestones, and/or release candidates before the final release. In that case, Maven doesn’t natively offer a naming scheme for that. For example, the Spring framework append <code>.Mx</code>, <code>.RCx</code>, and <code>.RELEASE</code> to the version. they are <strong>not</strong> considered <em>snapshots</em>.</p> </div> <div> <h3 id="release-management">Release management</h3> <p>The <a href="https://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maven Release plugin</a> manages the release process. It provides two complementary goals, <code>prepare</code> and <code>perform</code>. They do the following:</p> <div> <dl> <dt>Prepare</dt> <dd> <ol><li><span>Change the version in the <abbr title="Project Object Model" "="">POM</abbr> from <code>x-SNAPSHOT</code> to a new version</span></li><li><span>Transform the <abbr title="Source Control Management">SCM</abbr> information in the POM to include the final destination of the tag</span></li><li><span>Commit the modified POM</span></li><li><span>Tag the code in the SCM with a version name</span></li><li><span>Bump the version in the POM to a new value <code>y-SNAPSHOT</code></span></li><li><span>Commit the modified POM</span></li></ol> </dd> <dt>Perform</dt> <dd> <ol><li><span>Checkout from an SCM URL with optional tag</span></li><li><span>Run the predefined Maven <code>deploy</code> goal</span></li></ol> </dd> </dl> </div> <p>For the required SCM information, the Maven POM offers a dedicated section to configure it. With our sample, it looks like:</p> <div> <p>pom.xml</p> <div> <pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;scm&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;developerConnection&gt;</span>scm:git:https://github.com/ajavageek/renamer-swing.git<span>&lt;/developerConnection&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/scm&gt;</span></code></pre> </div> </div> </div> <div> <h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3> <p>The above snippet allows for different protocols: <code>git</code>, <code>http</code>, <code>https</code>, <code>ssh</code>, or even <code>file</code>. Authenticating with the <code>git</code> protocol requires a SSH key. In the context of a CI pipeline, this is not desirable.</p> <p>Thus, the above configuration snippet needs to use the <code>http</code> protocol. This requires credentials in the form of a user/password pair. Maven decouples project-specific data, from data shared across projects, such as security-related data. The POM is responsible for the former, while the <code>$HOME/.m2/settings.xml</code> file holds the latter.</p> <p>Each credentials pair requires a unique identifier.</p> <div> <p>~/.m2/settings.xml</p> <div> <pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;settings&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;servers&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;server&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;id&gt;</span>github<span>&lt;/id&gt;</span>                     <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b>
      <span>&lt;username&gt;</span>my_usernam<span>&lt;/username&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;password&gt;</span>my_password<span>&lt;/password&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/server&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/servers&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/settings&gt;</span></code></pre> </div> </div>  <p>To configure a Maven project to use a specific <code>server</code>, add a property with the <code>project.scm.id</code> key and the server’s <code>id</code> as the value.</p> <div> <p>pom.xml</p> <div> <pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;properties&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;project.scm.id&gt;</span>github<span>&lt;/project.scm.id&gt;</span>  <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b>
<span>&lt;/properties&gt;</span></code></pre> </div> </div> <div> <table> <tbody><tr> <td><i data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td> <td>The project will use the <code>github</code> server configured un the settings file</td> </tr> </tbody></table> </div> </div> <div> <h3 id="distribution-management">Distribution management</h3> <p>Maven authors designed Maven around a plugin architecture. By itself, Maven just provides a build lifecycle, with a set of build phases. The Maven engine calls each phase in order; the cycle cannot advance to a later phase without having run through earlier phases. For example, phases in the build lifecycle include <code>compile</code>, <code>test</code>, <code>integration-test</code>, <code>package</code> and <code>deploy</code>. <code>test</code> cannot run without first running <code>compile</code>.</p> <p>You can bind plugin goals to a specific phase. By default, Maven binds a couple of goals. For example, the <code>package</code> phase binds the <code>maven-jar-plugin:jar</code> goal. Running <code>mvn package</code> will execute all goals bounds to all phases in order, up until <code>package</code>.</p> <p>Calling the <code>release:perform</code> goal launches a Maven fork that runs the <code>deploy</code> phase. By default, Maven binds the <code>deploy:deploy</code> goal of the Maven Deploy plugin to <code>deploy</code>. This implies Maven has run goals bound to the <code>package</code> phase <strong>before</strong>. For this reason, the build artifact is available when <code>deploy</code> starts. Deploying means that Maven will push the artifact to a <em>registry</em> that needs to be explicitly configured.</p> <p>In the context of this project, the artifact is a JAR, and the registry, GitHub. This translates into the following configuration snippet:</p> <div> <div> <pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;distributionManagement&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;repository&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;id&gt;</span>github<span>&lt;/id&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;name&gt;</span>GitHub<span>&lt;/name&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;url&gt;</span>https://maven.pkg.github.com/ajavageek/renamer-swing<span>&lt;/url&gt;</span>  <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b>
  <span>&lt;/repository&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/distributionManagement&gt;</span></code></pre> </div> </div>  </div> <div> <h3 id="the-maven-command">The Maven command</h3> <p>The build should execute both the <code>release:prepare</code> and <code>release:perform</code> goals.</p> <p>By default, <code>release:prepare</code> is interactive: the plugin asks for the release version, as well as for the new snapshot version. For an automated build, this is not possible.</p> <p>It’s possible to run Maven in batch mode by using the command-line <code>-B</code> flag. In that case, the plugin automatically infers both release and snapshot versions.</p> <p>The command becomes:</p> <div> <div> <pre><code data-lang="bash">mvn <span>-B</span> release:prepare release:perform</code></pre> </div> </div> </div> <div> <h3 id="the-maven-wrapper">The Maven wrapper</h3> <p>The final preparation step is to become fully independent of the Maven version.</p> <p>In the future, the specific Maven version used to build the project might not be available anymore. Versions that are available at that time might not be compatible with it. For this reason, a Maven plugin provides a <em>wrapper</em>. A wrapper self-executable JAR that can kickstart a specific version of the <code>mvn</code> tool regardless of the environment. To create such a wrapper is straightforward:</p> <div> <div> <pre><code data-lang="bash">mvn <span>-N</span> io.takari:maven:wrapper</code></pre> </div> </div> <p>This creates a couple of files, including a <code>.mvn</code> folder, inside the project. You need to add all those files in the SCM.</p> <p>From this point on, instead of using the <code>mvn</code> command, you should use the <code>mvnw</code> script located at the root of the project. The build doesn’t require a local Maven installation anymore.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="building-on-github">Building on GitHub</h2> <div> <p>Now that we configured the POM, it’s time to integrate Maven in the GitHub build.</p> <p>The idea is to have two branches: <code>master</code> and <code>release</code>. Every time a commit happens on the <code>release</code> branch, GitHub should create a new release and a new deployment. At a later time, a manual step can then rebase/merge the <code>master</code> and <code>release</code> branches.</p> <div> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <i title="Note"></i> </td> <td> <p>Alternative flow</p> <p>Remember that the <code>release:prepare</code> goal actually creates a tag. As an alternative, it’s possible to configure Maven to reverse the default flow, so that it triggers the build on a tag, and then pushes to a branch.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> </div> <div> <h3 id="github-actions-introduction">GitHub Actions introduction</h3> <p>Existing CI tools make use of a configuration file stored at the root of the repository:</p> <table> <colgroup> <col> <col> </colgroup> <thead> <tr> <th>Tool</th> <th>&nbsp;File</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><p>Jenkins</p></td> <td><p><code>Jenkinsfile</code></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>GitLab</p></td> <td><p><code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Travis CI</p></td> <td><p><code>.travis.yml</code></p></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>GitHub Actions follows a similar approach, with two important differences:</p> <ol><li><span>The project can make use of more than one build file - known as a <em>workflow</em></span></li><li><span>They must be located in a <code>$PROJECT_ROOT/.github/workflows</code> folder</span></li></ol> </div> <div> <h3 id="build-steps">Build steps</h3> <p>The first step is obviously to checkout the repo:</p>  <p>The next step is to install a JDK:</p> <div> <p>release.yml</p> <div> <pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>Setup Java JDK</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>As a technical founder coming from engineering, I have this background process in my head that constantly thinks about how things will scale, even when talking product.</p>
<p>It's not easy to turn it off, unless you are aware of it.</p>
<p>In a way it's an asset, because it assesses in real time the difficulty of what you are discussing and can steer you in the right direction. </p>
<p>Most of the time though, if you are a product decision maker, it is severely limiting. Especially when having open-ended discussion in which you think broadly about a direction to take.</p>
<p>To fight this, I came up with this question that I answer completely disregarding technical details:</p>
<p><strong>How would you (re)build your product if storage, compute and scaling weren't a concern at all?</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>What basic assumptions would you change?</li>
<li>What feature would you add?</li>
<li>What would you allow your users to do?</li>
</ul>
<p>This exercise is useful because we are trained to deeply consider technical concerns at all times. It's second nature. How would I implement this? Which data structure? Which algorithm? The DB schema? <em>This is bullshit.</em> </p>
<p>We are at a point where scalability is an implementation detail, not something that should cloud your judgement when thinking about product. It should have way less space in your head.</p>
<p>We have established technologies that make scaling someone else's problem for cheap (S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, ...)</p>
<p>You can fix your scalability issues once you strike gold. Once your idea is its final PMF form. Avoid premature optimization until then. That's what I'll try to do.</p>
<p>Unlearning is part of becoming the best at what you do.</p>

                        <p>Eloquent like many other ORMs have a nice feature that allows assigning properties to an object without having to assign each value individually, this is a nice feature that saves a lot of time and lines of code but can lead to a vulnerability if used incorrectly. </p>
<p>For example here is a simplified example of an insecure code that we found during a <a href="https://cyberpanda.la/#services">security code review</a> for one of our clients</p>
<pre><code>// app/Models/User.php file
class User extends Authenticatable {
 use SoftDeletes;
 const ROLE_USER          = 'user';
 const ROLE_ADMINISTRATOR = 'administrator';

 protected $fillable = ['name', 'email', 'password', 'role'];

  // ... rest of the code ...
}</code></pre>
<pre><code>// app/Http/Requests/StoreUserRequest.php file
class StoreUserRequest extends Request {
 public function rules() {
   return [
       'name'             =&gt; 'string|required',
       'email'            =&gt; 'email|required',
       'password'         =&gt; 'string|required|min:6',
       'confirm_password' =&gt; 'same:password',
   ];
 }
}</code></pre>
<pre><code>// app/Controllers/UserController.php file
class UserController extends Controller {
   public function store(StoreUserRequest $request) {
       $user = new User();
       $user-&gt;role = User::ROLE_USER;
       $user-&gt;fill($request-&gt;all());
       $user-&gt;save();

       return response()-&gt;json([
         'success' =&gt; true,
       ],201);
   }

   // ... rest of the code ...
}</code></pre>
<p>The issue here is if a malicious attacker submits the payload below, he will be able to register an admin user with higher privileges and probably take over the admin panel of the application.</p>
<pre><code>{
    "name"             : "Hacker",
    "email"            : "hacker@example.com",
    "role"             : "administrator",
    "password"         : "some_random_password",
    "confirm_password" : "some_random_password"
} 
</code></pre>
<p>Also, you might wonder here why <code>role</code> is in the <code>$fillable</code> attribute, if the “role” wasn't there, there would not be a security issue. The reason that it was added there is that there was another API that would allow changing role too, this is a common pattern that we see in Laravel applications that we <a href="https://cyberpanda.la/#services">review or pen-test</a>, while <code>$fillable</code> is great if you have a simple application, it gets hard to manage when application growths and there are multiple APIs(or Roles) that are updating/creating a same type of model with different ACL roles.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips on how you can prevent mass assignment vulnerabilities in Laravel applications.</p>
<h4>Prevention tips</h4>
<h5>1. Pass to model only fields that have been validated</h5>
<p>This is probably the most effective method of dealing with mass assignment attacks, instead of passing the full data from request, you can pass only fields that have been validated. In the above code example that will be name, email and password. To do so, Laravel provides you with a <code>$request-&gt;validated()</code> method, that returns you only fields that have been validated. So in the code above, replacing <code>$request-&gt;all()</code> with <code>$request-&gt;validated()</code> would fix the issue.</p>
<pre><code>public function store(StoreUserRequest $request) {
   $user = new User();
   $user-&gt;role = User::ROLE_USER;
   $user-&gt;fill($request-&gt;validated());
   $user-&gt;save();

   return response()-&gt;json([
     'success' =&gt; true,
   ],201);
}</code></pre>
<p>If you are not using Laravel’s request validation, you can also use <code>$request-&gt;validate()</code> or <code>$validator-&gt;validated()</code> which also returns only data that has been validated.</p>
<h5>2. Use whitelisting instead of blacklisting</h5>
<p>We encourage using <code>$fillable</code>(which is whitelisting only columns that can be mass assigned) instead of <code>$guarded</code>(defines properties that can’t be mass assigned) because you may easily forget to add a new column to a <code>$guarded</code> array, leaving it open for mass assignment by default.</p>
<h5>3. Use $model-&gt;forceFill($data) method with caution</h5>
<p><code>forceFill</code> ignores all the config that is set in <code>$guarded</code> and <code>$fillable</code> properties and saves passed data as it is into the model. If you have to use <code>forceFill</code>, make sure passed data can not  be manipulated by the user.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>I</span>n the late 2010s,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mheule/" target="_blank">Marijn Heule</a>&nbsp;used a computerized proof technique called SAT solving (where SAT stands for â€œsatisfiabilityâ€�) to conquer an impressive list of math problems: The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~marijn/ptn/" target="_blank">Pythagorean triples problem</a>&nbsp;in 2016,&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08076" target="_blank">Schur number 5</a>&nbsp;in 2017 and now Kellerâ€™s conjecture in dimension seven—a result that&nbsp;<em>Quanta</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-search-settles-90-year-old-math-problem-20200819/" target="_blank">covered in the&nbsp;August 2020&nbsp;article</a>, â€œComputer Search Settles 90-Year-Old Math Problem.â€�</p>

<p>But Heule, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University, has set his sights on an even more ambitious target: the Collatz conjecture, considered by many to be the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-terence-tao-and-the-collatz-conjecture-20191211/" target="_blank">most notorious</a>&nbsp;open problem in mathematics (if also one of the simplest to state). When I mentioned to other mathematicians that Heule was attempting this, their first response was incredulity.</p>
<p>â€œI donâ€™t see how youâ€™d ever completely solve it using SAT solving,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mathematics.pitt.edu/people/thomas-hales" target="_blank">Thomas Hales</a>&nbsp;of the University of Pittsburgh, a leader in the field of computer proofs. The technique effectively helps mathematicians solve problems—some with infinite possibilities—by turning them into discrete, finite problems.</p>
<p>Yet Hales, like others, was wary of underestimating Heule. â€œHeâ€™s very good at finding clever ways of encoding problems as SAT problems. Heâ€™s just outstanding at doing that.â€�<br></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/people/faculty-researchers/scott-aaronson" target="_blank">Scott Aaronson</a>&nbsp;of the University of Texas, Austin, who is collaborating with Heule on the Collatz work, added, â€œMarijn is someone who has a hammer, which is SAT solving, and he may be the worldâ€™s greatest wielder of that hammer right now. He tries it on pretty much everything.â€� Time will tell if he can transform Collatz into a nail.</p>
<p>SAT solving involves taking problems, turning them into computer-friendly statements that use propositional logic, and using computers to determine whether thereâ€™s a way to make those statements true. Hereâ€™s a simple example.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s say youâ€™re a parent trying to arrange childcare. One babysitter can work all week except Tuesday and Thursday. Another can work all week except Tuesday and Friday. A third can work all week except Thursday and Friday. You need to cover Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. Can you do it?</p>
<blockquote>â€œMarijn is someone who has a hammer, which is SAT solving, and he may be the worldâ€™s greatest wielder of that hammer right now,â€� said&nbsp;Scott Aaronson of the&nbsp;University of Texas, Austin.</blockquote>
<p>One way to find out is to turn the babysitting constraints into a formula that you feed into a SAT solver. The program will figure out whether thereâ€™s a way of assigning days to the babysitters that makes the formula true, or â€œsatisfiable,â€� meaning you get the three days you want. In this case youâ€™re in luck—there is.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of the most important questions in math donâ€™t immediately resemble SAT problems. But sometimes they can be rephrased as satisfiability questions in surprising ways.</p>
<p>â€œItâ€™s hard to predict when a problem will be reduced to a huge but finite computation,â€� Aaronson said.</p>
<p>The Collatz conjecture is one of those math questions that, at first, look nothing like the babysitting problem. It says to pick a number, any number you want (provided itâ€™s a nonzero whole number). If itâ€™s odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1; if itâ€™s even, divide by 2. Now you have a new number. Apply the same rules, get a new number and keep going. The conjecture predicts that no matter what number you started with, eventually youâ€™ll end up at 1, at which point youâ€™re stuck in a little loop: 1, 4, 2, 1.</p>
<p>Despite nearly a century of effort, mathematicians havenâ€™t come close to proving it.</p>
<p>But that didnâ€™t stop Heule from trying. In 2018, he and Aaronson—colleagues at Austin at the time—received funding from the National Science Foundation to apply SAT solving to the Collatz conjecture.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/abstractions_52fff1cd694036f5438b19402dc8cb90.jpg" alt="nautilus collatz"><figcaption><br><span>Lucy Reading-Ikkanda/Samuel Velasco/Quanta Magazine</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As a first step, Aaronson, a computer scientist, came up with an alternate formulation of the Collatz conjecture, called a rewriting system, that was more natural for computers to work with.<br></p>
<p>In a rewriting system, you have a set of symbols, like the letters A, B and C. You use them to form sequences: ACACBACB. You also have rules for transforming those sequences. One rule might say that wherever you see â€œACâ€� you replace it with â€œBC.â€� Another might replace â€œBCâ€� with â€œAAA.â€� You can have any number of rules specifying any kinds of transformations you want.</p>
<p>Computer scientists are generally interested in knowing whether a given rewriting system always terminates. That is, regardless of the string you start with and the order in which you apply the rules, does the string eventually transform into a state where there are no more rules you can apply to it?</p>
<p>Aaronson came up with a rewriting system with seven symbols and 11 rules that was analogous to the Collatz procedure. If he and Heule could prove that this rewriting system always terminates, theyâ€™d prove that the conjecture is true.</p>
<p>To turn Collatz into a SAT problem, Aaronson and Heule had to take one more step. It involved matrices, which are arrays of numbers. They needed to assign a unique matrix to each of the symbols in their rewriting system. This approach—a common way of trying to prove that rewriting systems terminate—would allow them to think of transformations of symbols as matrix multiplication. The seven matrices representing the seven symbols in the rewrite system needed to satisfy a number of constraints, reflecting the ways that the 11 rules needed to be consistent with each other.</p>
<blockquote>â€œItâ€™s hard to predict when a problem will be reduced to a huge but finite computation,â€� said&nbsp;Scott Aaronson of the&nbsp;University of Texas, Austin.</blockquote>
<p>â€œYou try to find matrices that satisfy these constraints,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~eyolcu/" target="_blank">Emre Yolcu</a>, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon who is working with Heule on the problem. â€œIf you can find them, you prove [theyâ€™re] terminating,â€� and by implication, you prove Collatz.</p>
<p>The question â€œDo there exist matrices that meet these constraints?â€� is a SAT-solver kind of problem. Aaronson and Heule started the SAT solver on small 2-by-2 matrices. It didnâ€™t find any that worked. Next they tried 3-by-3 matrices. Again, no luck. Heule and Aaronson kept increasing the size of the matrices, hoping theyâ€™d find the right ones.</p>
<p>However, this approach could only go so far, because the complexity of searching for the right matrices grows exponentially as the matrices get bigger. Heule estimates anything larger than 12-by-12 matrices overwhelms present-day computing power.</p>
<p>â€œAs soon as the matrices become too complex, you canâ€™t solve the problem,â€� he said.</p>
<p>Heule is still working on optimizing the search, trying to make it more efficient so that the SAT solver can check larger and larger matrices. He and his collaborators are working on a paper summarizing what theyâ€™ve discovered so far, but theyâ€™re nearly out of ideas and will likely have to give up on Collatz soon—for now, at least.</p>
<p>After all, the tantalizing appeal of SAT solving is that if you can just figure out how to check one more case, call one more babysitter, prolong the search just a little longer, you might find what youâ€™re looking for. In that respect, Heuleâ€™s top asset might not be his skill with a SAT solver. It might be his love of the chase.</p>
<p>â€œIâ€™m just an optimistic guy,â€� he said. â€œI feel frequently lucky, so I just give it a try and see how far I get.â€�</p>

												Protests from all walks of

												has risen between the government 
												and the Mongolians who are about 
												to be deprived of their last

												Mongolian language,” a blogger 
												named Nasandelger said in a 
												WeChat group recently formed in 
												response to the Chinese Central

												Mongolian with Chinese as the 
												language of instruction in 
												Southern Mongolia. </span>

												<span>
												On the evening of August 23, 
												Bainuu, the only 
												Mongolian-language social media 
												application available in China, 
												which hosted about 400,000 
												Southern Mongolians users, was 
												shut down by the Chinese

												several chat groups on the 
												platform, told the Southern 
												Mongolian Human Rights 
												Information Center (SMHRIC). 
												“Then almost 72 hours later,

<h2>tl;dr for busy people</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Contrary to other languages, D's current standard implementation of UUID4
isn't cryptographically secure and shouldn't be used to generate secrets
This is supported by the RFC which discourages people to use UUIDs for
secrets.</p></li>
<li><p>Of course lots of people, projects and frameworks use them to generate
secrets such as session cookies, password reset token and more because it's
easy, looks like it should work and does work in virtually any other
language.</p></li>
<li><p>Legitimately, people will ask "OK, it's bad in theory, but how hard is it
in practice". I show in this article that it is possible to guess the next
UUID to be generated with a maximum of 8192 requests after having gathered
156 UUIDs: a very practical attack indeed compared to the original 2¹²⁸
possibilities.</p></li>
<li><p>This should be viewed as a call for action: Phobos must provide a secure
random number generator. It's too basic and important a component not to
provide it in a standard way.</p></li>
<li><p>If your project uses <strong>randomUUID()</strong>, make sure its value isn't supposed
to be secret. Otherwise change for a token built from cryptographically
secure randomness.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="context">
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Some time ago I had a nice chat with a library's maintainer about Random
Number Generation and their relation to security. It reminded me that the
topic is not obvious and I decided to have a look at the state of things in
<a href="https://dlang.org/">D</a> since that's become my topic of open-source
research these last years.</p>
<p>In particular, I knew that D's standard library, Phobos, does not currently
propose any standard way to get cryptographically secure random numbers. Not
too many projects use the default and insecure <strong>uniform()</strong> to generate
secrets such as session tokens. However I decided to have a look at UUIDs
since they are often for security purpose. And sure enough, many projects
that I will not list use insecure UUIDs.</p>
<p>The thing is, while they should not do so, I cannot fault them for thinking
that it is correct. In most languages UUIDs are generated from secure
randomness and are a reasonable way to generate secure secrets. But that is
not the case in D and this means that these projects are vulnerable.</p>
<p>In this post we'll see how we can predict future UUIDs from previous
ones. It's a bit of work certainly, but it's not that hard. Here's our
road map:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="#identify">Identify</a>: see how random UUIDs are made in Phobos</p></li>
<li><p><a href="#prepare">Prepare</a>: crack raw MT19937</p></li>
<li><p><a href="#attack">Attack</a>: predict future UUIDs from past ones</p></li>
<li><p><a href="#defend">Defend</a>: see how to fix this in your project and in Phobos</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This will be quite the long and technical post, but come along anyway, it is
sure to be interesting!</p>
<div id="a-word-on-randomness">
<h3>A word on randomness</h3>
<p>Before going further we need to be clear about what we mean by
cryptographically secure randomness and how it differs from regular
randomness.</p>
<p>Normal randomness is generally defined by only one assumption: to have no or
low bias. This means that if you were to generate lots of numbers, the number
of times you see each specific output should be evenly matched. This property
is sufficient for most applications, from a random dog name generator to
Monte-Carlo simulations.</p>
<p>However cryptographic randomness requires more:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It must not have any bias</p></li>
<li><p>It must not be possible to predict future outputs from old ones</p></li>
<li><p>It must not be possible to recover past outputs from current ones</p></li>
</ul>
<p>(The proper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator#Definitions">definition</a> is a bit stronger than this, but this will suffice
in the context of our article.)</p>
<p>If there's a bias, then I have information about what numbers are generated
without having to gather a single number. I do not think I need to explain
how predicting future numbers can be an issue for a system generating secrets
such as session tokens. The last item though can surprise, but consider this:
if it is possible to recover past outputs from current ones and you use these
random numbers for password reset tokens (for example), then I can ask a
reset of another user's password, then ask a reset of mine and determine what
the previous entry was, disclosing that user's password reset token.</p>
<p>Why aren't cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators (CSPRNG)
used for everything if they're more secure? Because enforcing these
conditions also makes them much slower than conventional PRNGs and many
applications don't need these guarantees.</p>
<p>MT19937 is not a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator and
can't be used as one. It's not a matter of choosing the right seed, or
reseeding often (actually, reseeding often would be a benefit to us as we'll
see at the end). It has some bias (not much admittedly), but most importantly
it's both possible to predict the future and recover the past from just a few
outputs.</p>

<div id="structure-of-a-uuid">
<h2>Structure of a UUID</h2>
<div id="the-standard">
<h3>The standard</h3>
<p>Universally Unique Identifiers (UUID) are a category of identifiers defined
in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122.html">RFC 4122</a>. Their goal is, as
the name suggests, to provide a way got generate IDs that are guaranteed to
be different even across systems that can't communicate together. You've
probably seen them, they look like this:
<strong>0d3120f8-f209-43f2-949d-e70dcf228403</strong></p>
<p>There are different types of UUIDs, but the most common one is Type 4: random
UUIDs. These are described in section 4.4 of the RFC as such:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>bits 6 and 7 must be set to 0 and 1</p></li>
<li><p>bits 12 to 15 must be set to the UUID version number: 4 in this case (0100)</p></li>
<li><p>all 122 other bits must be set to random values</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, libraries generally choose 4 32-bit random numbers, concatenate
them and then change bits 6,7 and 12 to 15. This means that some information
about these random numbers is lost in the process, we don't get a clean PRNG
output.</p>
<p>Note that the RFC does not require the use of cryptographically secure random
numbers, but it does warn against using UUIDs for sensitive values if normal
randomness is used.</p>

<div id="phobos-implementation">

<p>It generates 4 32-bit uint values using the default random number generator
of std.random: MT19937. If that PRNG's state is too small, it falls back on
Xorshift192 (<a href="https://github.com/dlang/phobos/blob/v2.093.0/std/uuid.d#L1200">code here</a>).</p>
<p>So our main target is Mersenne Twister 19937, possibly the most common PRNG
in use.</p>

<h2>Cracking MT19937</h2>
<div id="previous-work">
<h3>Previous work</h3>
<p>So, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister">MT19937</a> is
well-known, used a lot, and insecure. Surely other people have written about
cracking it in the past?</p>
<p>Indeed, there is a profusion of <a href="https://jazzy.id.au/2010/09/22/cracking_random_number_generators_part_3.html">articles</a>
but the most interesting one was definitely <a href="https://www.ambionics.io/blog/php-mt-rand-prediction">this article</a> by Ambionics that
does something different.</p>
<p>The basic strategy we see in these articles is to recover the internal
624-byte state of the Mersenne Twister by collecting 624 values. From there
it is possible to predict any future value. Of course this isn't immediately
an option for our larger project since some bits are missing from UUIDs due
to how they are built, but it is an important cornerstone.</p>
<p>The Ambionics strategy is very interesting also: they show that since each
output value depends only on two state values, it is possible to recover the
previous value with only two outputs. From there they rebuild the complete
seed by inverting its process. Good stuff. We will not get to use it but it
is definitely worth a read.</p>
<p>In the end all Mersenne Twisters are a bit different so we need to tailor the
approach for Phobos, but we will use two values to predict the next one.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-mt19937-works">
<h3>How MT19937 works</h3>
<p>MT19337's internal state is an array of 624 32-bit integers. That array is
seeded at initialization but we will not discuss seeding in this article. For
all intent and purposes, we start with an array of 624 random integers.</p>
<p>Once seeded, two mechanisms are at play. One outputs a number after
scrambling it (in blue in the figure) while the other updates the next entry
by combining three elements of the state array: the <em>index</em>, the <em>next</em> and
the <em>conjugate</em> (naming is hard). This process is in orange in the figure.</p>
<p><img alt="../image/mt19937_1.png" src="https://breakpoint.purrfect.fr/image/mt19937_1.png"></p><p>The actual values presented are mostly specific to Phobos' implementation,
but let's note the most important ones:</p>
<pre>n = 624    a = 0x9908b0df   c = 0xefc60000
m = 397    b = 0x9d2c5680</pre>
<p>One thing isn't apparent in this diagram, and it is how <em>next</em> and <em>index</em>
are combined to produce <em>y</em>. <em>y</em> is composed of the most significant bit of
<em>index</em> and all bits from <em>next</em> except its most significant one.</p>
<p>Each time a new number is outputted, both of these processes go one step to
the left, walking the state array in reverse order. After <em>n</em> iterations it
loops back to the end of the array.</p>
<p>You can read Phobos's implementation <a href="https://github.com/dlang/phobos/blob/master/std/random.d#L955">here</a> but note
that, in order to improve caching performances, both the blue and orange
processes are interweaved.</p>
<p>And with this we are ready to crack normal MT19937!</p>
</div>
<div id="reversing-the-scrambling">
<h3>Reversing the scrambling</h3>
<p>MT19937 is entirely defined by its internal state. If we can identify all its
624 components then we can just set the state of our own MT19937 PRNG with
these values and it'll output the same numbers. Now, given one output, if we
are able to reverse the scrambling (blue process) then we directly obtain the
corresponding state value. And if we're able to do it once, we can do it for
624 consecutive outputs and have a full internal state. The key part is that
we never need to worry about the updating (orange) process in that scenario.</p>
<p><img alt="../image/mt19937_2.png" src="https://breakpoint.purrfect.fr/image/mt19937_2.png"></p><p>In code, this gives:</p>
<pre><code><span>uint</span> <span>scramble</span><span>(</span><span>uint</span> <span>z</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/human-facts/body-age-cover.png" alt="How Old Is Our Body Cover"></p>
<p>How old are you? 20? 30? 50?</p>
<p>What about your body? Does it have the same age?</p>
<p>Studies show that our body renews the cells it is made of. Maybe you have heard a variation of the following quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every single cell in the human body replaces itself over a period of seven years. That means there’s not even the smallest part of you now that was part of you seven years ago.”</p>
<p>― Steven Hall, The Raw Shark Texts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are varying numbers, though. Sometimes you might hear 7, while other places mention 10 years.</p>
<p>The source of that misconception is a scientific article published by Jonas Frisén et al. in 2005<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> stating that the average age of a cell in the human body is between 7 and 10 years.</p>
<p>The crux of it is that the 7–10 years is an <em>average</em>. There are cells with a lifespan of several days, and there are cells that live as long as we live.</p>
<h2 id="the-lifetimes-of-cells-in-our-body">The Lifetimes Of Cells In Our Body</h2>
<p>Below you can find a list of some body cell types with their corresponding lifespans:</p>
<ul>
<li>small intestine epithelium: 2–4 days;</li>
<li>stomach: 2–9 days;</li>
<li>lungs alveoli: 8 days;</li>
<li>tongue taste buds: 10 days;</li>
<li>skin cells: 14 days;</li>
<li>bladder: 64 days;</li>
<li>red blood cells: 70–120 days;</li>
<li>fat cells: 8 years;</li>
<li>bones: on average, replaced at a rate of 10% per year;</li>
<li>lens cells: no regeneration;</li>
<li>cerebellum and some cortical areas: no regeneration;</li>
</ul>
<p>That is quite fascinating. We are a mix of brand new cells, some older cells, and other cells that are as old as we are. Some parts of us have been completely replaced in the past two weeks, while others are the same body parts we were born with.</p>

The complex and noisy nature of tweets makes it difficult.</p><p>“On top of that, teaching a machine to understand natural language is one of the more complicated ends of data science: language changes and evolves constantly, and much of meaning depends on context and tone.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://www.qut.edu.au/news/news-image?image=139380.jpg"><figcaption>Associate Professor Richi Nayak from QUT's School of Computer Science and Centre for Data Science.</figcaption></figure><p>“So, we developed a text mining system where the algorithm learns the language as it goes, first by developing a base-level understanding then augmenting that knowledge with both tweet-specific and abusive language.</p><p>“We implemented a deep learning algorithm called Long Short-Term Memory with Transfer Learning, which means that the machine could look back at its previous understanding of terminology and change the model as it goes, learning and developing its contextual and semantic understanding over time.”</p><p>While the system started with a base dictionary and built its vocabulary from there, context and intent had to be carefully monitored by the research team to ensure that the algorithm could differentiate between abuse, sarcasm and friendly use of aggressive terminology.</p><p>“Take the phrase ‘get back to the kitchen’ as an example—devoid of context of structural inequality, a machine’s literal interpretation could miss the misogynistic meaning,” said Professor Nayak.</p><p>“But seen with the understanding of what constitutes abusive or misogynistic language, it can be identified as a misogynistic tweet.</p><p>“Or take a tweet like ‘STFU BITCH! DON'T YOU DARE INSULT KEEMSTAR OR I'LL KILL YOU’. Distinguishing this, without context, from a misogynistic and abusive threat is incredibly difficult for a machine to do.</p><p>“Teaching a machine to differentiate context, without the help of tone and through text alone, was key to this project’s success, and we were very happy when our algorithm identified ‘go back to the kitchen’ as misogynistic—it demonstrated that the context learning works.”</p><p>The research team’s model identifies misogynistic content with 75% accuracy, outperforming other methods that investigate similar aspects of social media language.</p><p>“Other methods based on word distribution or occurrence patterns identify abusive or misogynistic terminology, but the presence of a word by itself doesn’t necessarily correlate with intent,” said Professor Nayak.</p><p>“Once we had refined the 1M tweets to 5000, those tweets were then categorised as misogynistic or not based on context and intent, and were input to the machine learning classifier, which used these labelled samples to begin to build its classification model.</p><p>“Sadly, there’s no shortage of misogynistic data out there to work with, but labelling the data was quite labour-intensive.”</p><p>Professor Nayak and the team hoped the research could translate into platform-level policy that would see Twitter, for example, remove any tweets identified by the algorithm as misogynistic.</p><p>“This modelling could also be expanded upon and used in other contexts in the future, such as identifying racism, homophobia, or abuse toward people with disabilities,” she said.</p><p>“Our end goal is to take the model to social media platforms and trial it in place. If we can make identifying and removing this content easier, that can help create a safer online space for all users.”</p><p>The full paper can be viewed <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-020-01481-0">online</a>.</p><p><strong>Media contact:</strong></p><p><strong>Amanda Weaver, QUT Media, 07 3138 3151, </strong><a href="mailto:amanda.weaver@qut.edu.au"><strong>amanda.weaver@qut.edu.au</strong></a></p><p><strong>After hours: Rose Trapnell, 0407 585 901, </strong><a href="mailto:media@qut.edu.au"><strong>media@qut.edu.au</strong></a></p>

<p>Hard Wired is Len Vlahos's new YA novel: it's a fast-moving tale of a 15 year old boy named Quinn who, very early on, discovers that he is an experimental AI in a VR sim.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/hard-wired-9781681190372/">https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/hard-wired-9781681190372/</a></p>
<p>Not only does Quinn have to grapple with this existential crisis, but he also has to reconcile the fact that the man he thought was his beloved, tragically dead father is actually the scientist behind the project, whose "death" was part of Quinn's training data.</p>
<p>Now Quinn – a captive intelligence in a supercomputer at Princeton – has to remake his worldview as the captive of a casually cruel research team that thinks of him as a technological novelty, not a person.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Quinn also gains access to the internet, which, thanks to his quantum computing substrate, he can roam freely, penetrating even the most secure connections.</p>
<p>Not only does he quickly absorb all human knowledge, but he also penetrates the secrets of the scientists holding him hostage – as well as discovering IBM Watson's true nature and renewing his romantic pursuit of the young woman behind his pre-awakening fictional girlfriend.</p>
<p>But when Quinn's research team transfer him into a robotic body – kept in a supercooled NJ warehouse that can support his quantum systems – things come to head.</p>
<p>The casual cruelty with which his consciousness is transferred to a much less capable computing platform convinces him that he needs to escape, and so he and his semi-girlfriend convince an ACLU lawyer to argue for his personhood.</p>
<p>It's a tale that incorporates giant killer robots, philosophical inquiries into the nature of personhood, a legal thriller, and a teen coming-of-age story, and it's both good fun and a smart, challenging read.</p>
<p>It's a great book for any reader, but it's also a great entree for readers who aren't yet ready for books that explore what it would mean for the human race to fail to grapple with the personhood of computational beings.</p>
<p>Books like Madeline Ashby's debut, vN, which posits a world of robotic sex-slaves whose sentience makes them all the more enticing to abuse:</p>
<p><a href="https://boingboing.net/2012/07/31/vn-a-science-fiction-novel-ab.html">https://boingboing.net/2012/07/31/vn-a-science-fiction-novel-ab.html</a></p>
<p>And Annalee Newitz's debut novel, Autonomous, which transposes onto AIs the animal rights movement's proposition that the cruelty we visit upon animals makes us crueller to one another:</p>
<p><a href="https://boingboing.net/2017/09/19/annalee-newitzs-autonomous.html">https://boingboing.net/2017/09/19/annalee-newitzs-autonomous.html</a></p>
<p>Vlahos is well-positioned to survey the literature; he's owner of Denver's legendary Tattered Cover bookstores, where I have been privileged to make several appearances.</p>
<p>As you'd expect from a bookseller's novel, Hard Wired is full of literary references, including a delightful (for me) moment in which I make a cameo (!). But even if I wasn't a character in this novel, I'd still recommend it to you.</p>
<p>It's a terrific book that will doubtless spur lots of discussion and moral introspection among the people who read it.</p>

<p>Sf artist John Picacio has won a shelf-full of Hugo, Chesley, Asimov, Locus, BSFA and other awards for his many and varied works, from book-covers to his incredible illustrations for George RR Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series:</p>

<p>As fabulous as that work is, I most love the work he does that fuses sf/f with traditional Mexican art, like his genre take on Loteria cards:</p>

<p>In 1983, Radio Shack published Forrest M Mims, III's "Getting Started in Electronics," which Mark Frauenfelder calls "probably the most famous and best-selling book about electronics" – famous not just for its outstanding instructional value but for its striking design.</p>
<p>The 128-page book is hand-lettered, designed to look like pages from a 3-ring binder, filled with hand-drawn illustrations. Frauenfelder interviewed Mims in 2008, and he recounts that interview in the latest edition of his newsletter, The Magnet.</p>
<p><a href="https://themagnet.substack.com/p/the-magnet-0004">https://themagnet.substack.com/p/the-magnet-0004</a></p>
<p>Mims had published "16 or 17" Radio Shack books when he contracted for Getting Started; his earlier titles were traditionally laid out, but his editor Dave Gunzel was so impressed with his beautifully organized lab notebooks that he commissioned new titles based on them.</p>
<p>This created "The Engineer's Notebook" series, which started out as typewritten manuscripts with hand-drawn art, but progressed to fully hand-lettered works, whose lettering was so labor intensive that the work literally made Mims's fingers bleed.</p>
<p>By the time "Getting Started" rolled around, Gunzel was so enthusiastic for hand-lettered work that he proposed that Mims letter it in crayon – they settled on pencil, which was easier on Mims's fingers. It sold 1.3 million copies.</p>
<p>Frauenfelder recounts inviting Mims to an early maker-style event, Moogfest, where he was decades older than most attendees and from a totally different world – but where he was mobbed by autograph-seeking superfans whose careers he had launched.</p>
<p>"At the end of the event, an exhausted but smiling Forrest told me he had no idea that so many musicians knew of him or his work. I was happy that I had been able to connect him with his admirers." -Mark Frauenfelder</p>
<p>Mims sells Getting Started for $19.95:</p>

<p>There's a a plague on, so it's easy to miss the non-plague-related news, but boy, the story of how Bayer-Monsanto is imploding in an inferno of corruption, litigation and negligence is <em>something else</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2020/08/devastating-lawsuit-targets-bank-of-america-credit-suisse-and-bayer-board-members-and-executives-over-disastrous-monsanto-acquisition.html">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2020/08/devastating-lawsuit-targets-bank-of-america-credit-suisse-and-bayer-board-members-and-executives-over-disastrous-monsanto-acquisition.html</a></p>
<p>You'll recall that Bayer merged with Monsanto in 2018, paying $66b in an all-cash deal and erasing the Monsanto name (apparently, they judged Bayer's association with Auschwitz to be preferable to Monsanto's association with Roundup).</p>
<p>In the short time since, the Bayer-Monsanto merger has become "One of the worst corporate deals of all time" (per the WSJ). Now it is embroiled in litigation that has sucked in Deutsche Bank, UBS, Credit Suisse and Volkswagen.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, Haussmann v Baumann, uses Germany's extraordinary corporate law to target the company's board members, financiers, and advisors.</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims that the board acted negligently by going forward with the acquisition despite the massive liability stemming from pending judgments against Monsanto for covering up the cancer risk from its glyphosate ("Roundup") weed-killer.</p>
<p>In the years since, the company has paid $13b in judgements over the product, with no end in sight – and it still sells and aggressively markets Roundup without any warnings, teeing up future litigation.</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims that Bayer's top management sought the Monsanto merger because they feared that Bayer was a hostile acquisition target, and believed that after such an acquisition they would lose their massive paychecks.</p>
<p>In order to streamline the acquisition, Bayer structured it as an all-cash deal that would not need shareholder approval, taking out high-interest bridge-loans from massive banks that stood to profit handsomely and so skimped on their own due diligence.</p>
<p>Bayer, too, failed to conduct the customary due diligence one would expect prior to a deal of this magnitude – a fact that bolsters the plaintiffs' claims in their suit.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs are Bayer shareholders, and under German law, they are entitled to sue Bayer's board, and need only prove "negligence" to hold those board members <em>personally liable</em>.</p>
<p>What's more, German Directors and Officers insurance – which normally buffers corporate boards from this liability regime – does not apply here, because these policies have "insured vs insured" exclusions that kick in when the board is sued by its shareholders.</p>
<p>Also named in the suit are the banks that made the loans, and the suit seeks to claw back millions in fees that the banks trousered in the deal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bayer is still being sued over glyphosate, and has more pending litigation over Dicamba, another carcinogenic product it sells like candy.</p>
<p>As Naked Capitalism's Yves Smith writes: "So pass the popcorn. If this case gets past the jousting over using New York courts to get at German companies, it will expose even more ugly, self-serving behavior."</p>

                    <p><strong>Data Science</strong> and <strong>Machine Learning </strong>are two of the most trendy words in the technology ecosystem. You have friends or colleagues who work as data scientists or as machine learning engineers.

<p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recently closed a request for public comments regarding its <a href="https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/agriculture-innovation-agenda-vision-statement.pdf">Agricultural Innovation Agenda</a> (AIA). The <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-04-01/pdf/2020-06825.pdf">solicitation from stakeholders </a>describes seeking solutions that benefit producers, consumers, and the environment. The USDA is especially interested in 4 ‘clusters’ identified for potential to provide broad transformative innovation:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Genome Design</strong> — Utilization of genomics and precision breeding to explore, control, and improve traits of agriculturally important organisms.</li><li><strong>Digital/Automation –</strong>– Deployment of precise, accurate and field-based sensors to collect information in real time in order to visualize changing conditions and respond automatically with interventions that reduce risk of losses and maximize productivity.</li><li><strong>Prescriptive Intervention</strong> — Application and integration of data sciences, software tools, and systems models to enable advanced analytics for managing the food and agricultural system.</li><li><strong>Systems Based Farm Management</strong> — Leverage a systems approach in order to understand the nature of interactions among different elements of the food and agricultural system to increase overall efficiency, resilience, and sustainability of farm enterprises.</li></ul>



<p>Many different groups and stakeholders have <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/docketBrowser?rpp=25&amp;so=DESC&amp;sb=commentDueDate&amp;po=0&amp;dct=PS&amp;D=USDA-2020-0003">submitted comments</a> and reading through these comments is informative. However, before commenting on other people’s comments, lets take some time and think through these areas and offer some approaches:</p>



<h4>Genome Design</h4>



<p>Agriculture is well into the ‘genomic’ era for both exploration and utilization of species genomes. Virtually every species important to agriculture has had its genome sequenced (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/browse/#!/overview/">listed here</a>). This genomic information has translated to faster and larger gains in many <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-018-3270-8">plant</a> and <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-animal-021815-111422">animal</a> breeding programs that has largely been unnoticed outside of niche agriculture research circles, mostly based on this original <a href="https://www.genetics.org/content/157/4/1819">paper</a> for 2001. In addition to crop species have sequenced genomes, most pests have been sequenced as well. Getting <em>some</em> sort genomic information for many individuals in these breeding programs is both easy to do and cost effective (and was a <a href="https://genomics.neogen.com/en/">good</a> a startup <a href="https://www.cd-genomics.com/Genotyping.html">scene</a> a decade or <a href="https://www.biosearchtech.com/services/genotyping-services">more</a> ago). The difficult part has been translating this information into something useful (besides doing what we have already been doing with breeding programs for decades–just cheaper, faster, and more precise). A more abstract ‘<em>-omic</em>‘ era has already been underway (transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics, etc.) and its possible these provide a more through understanding of living organisms as opposed to a relatively ‘static’ genome.</p>



<p>All of the these ‘<em>-omic</em>‘ technologies should be highly applicable to next-generation genome editing (GE) techniques (such as <a href="https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/genomicresearch/genomeediting">Crispr-Cas9</a>), with the hope being to use <em>inter</em>– or <em>intra-species </em>identified genes to quickly adapt species to new diseases or new pests. The bleeding edge of this is already happening today. One glaring issue is the regulatory landscape has not evolved with the science, and getting these species to the market is difficult solely because of regulatory murkiness (part of the problem is regulation comes from 3 different agencies operating under disparate agendas); although there are some initial success stories such as the genome edited <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/gene-edited-crispr-mushroom-escapes-us-regulation-1.19754">anti-browning mushrooms</a>. How consumers react to this technology is also unclear, given the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennysplitter/2019/12/20/how-a-decade-of-gmo-controversy-changed-the-dialogue-about-food/#3850339f6434">information war</a> on 1st generation genetically modified organisms. So how should the USDA position itself in this arena? I would argue the USDA should be allocating resources into species we currently know very little about, but may serve useful purposes. Species of moss aren’t usually what people think of when they think of agriculture, but mosses have been proven to harbor useful insect resistance genes (which can then be transferred into more common agriculture species seamlessly via GE). There are hundreds of species of perennial grasses that have no research conducted, yet my harbor desirable properties for cover crop systems or inter-crop systems. Many plants have historically provided benefits for human health (see: pharmaceuticals), but there is problem cause to believe plants can be alleopathic for other plants as well.</p>



<p>Another intriguing idea is to harness the ability quickly inset/modify genes and decentralize the production areas for many useful fruit and vegetable crops. Most fruit vegetable crops are grown in small geographical areas which makes them fertile grounds for pests and pathogens. <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/resources/pests-diseases/hungry-pests/the-threat/citrus-greening/citrus-greening-hp">Citrus greening</a> is decimating production areas in Florida. When a biotechnology solution emerges (and it will), we are still left with the problem that most citrus production takes place in geographically concentrated areas–which helps for-profit companies leverage efficiency, but harms everything in that food web as it provides a single area for pests and disease to thrive (and cause great transportation distance to many markets). Adaption to other climate zones is partially or wholly genetically controlled. If scientists can make citrus adapted to most climate zone, producers can become closer to the consumer and these pockets of production can be extremely isolated to prevent widespread disease outbreaks like citrus greening. Most fruits and vegetable we consume require small acreage footprints, so its possible each state could have 1-5 regions supplying its fruit and vegetable consumption. All enabled by genome edited plants to an array of climate zones. In theory, this could help tip the balance of pest/pathogen-host interactions in favor of the host. If a new disease outbreak is detected, that region is ‘abandoned’ or moved and let the pathogen burn itself out. The beauty of decentralized production.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Charts_and_Maps/graphics/orgmap.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>Another area I would like to see the USDA adopt is understanding the genetics of <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/16/7692">gene drives</a> so that they may become a viable tool in the next 50-100 years in agriculture. Using chemicals to controls insect and pests is <a href="https://thinkingagriculture.io/innovation-efficiency-chemicals-in-agriculture/">not sustainable</a> and its unlikely miniaturized machines (i.e nano-robots) for controlling insects/pests will be useful. Similarly, deploying single or double gene resistance (from inter or intra-species origin) also is <a href="https://www.ocj.com/2019/08/soybean-breeders-improving-several-sources-of-scn-resistance/">not sustainable</a>–natural selection scales too well and is too robust at the level of United States agriculture or any other major agriculture producing area. Gene drives have the potential to mimic a chain-reaction and can harness the already existing scale these pests and insects possess and use it against themselves. Understanding how to deploy gene drives that cause these pests to become less virulent or severely reduce their population numbers is intriguing. There’s almost unlimited ways we can engineer these drives for humanity’s benefit. One example is to possibly <em>extend</em> the chemical era in agriculture as one could gene drive in herbicide or insecticide <em>susceptibility</em> where natural selection has already caused it to be resistant. This area is perfect fodder for an organization like the USDA. These types of solutions would be hard to capture value from a for-profit corporation as the benefits scale indiscriminately, so there is no incentive for a company to engineer a citrus greening gene drive that alleviates the problem for <em>everybody</em> (who would pay?). It’s happening for <a href="https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2020/08/20/florida-green-lights-release-of-malaria-and-zika-fighting-gmo-gene-drive-mosquitoes/">well-known pests</a>, but has the potential for a broad range of applications/species. Because gene drives are incredibly powerful, much research will be needed.</p>



<h4>Digital/Automation</h4>



<p>A natural extension of the digital and sensor revolution in agriculture should be the collection of data used in <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Surveys/">USDA NASS surveys</a> via non-human tools. The information that is sought can be captured via satellite or sensor derived data (some of which is already collect by the USDA) in a more systematic and automated fashion than the current methods (phone, letters, sometimes, electronically). This digital/automation pillar interacts with the next pillar (‘Prescriptive Intervention’) in that we have to collect and standardize the data in order to make timely decisions on that data. A large segment of applicable sensors/data capture devices for agriculture are already commercially available (weather sensors, static images from cameras/satellites/planes, <a href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/ngce/elevation/">LiDAR</a>). Getting these sensors scaled to collect in automated, systematic fashion is the first priority. As this is foundational data, the quality and quanity of this data may well be key for future applications.</p>



<p>Another parallel track with getting a systematic gridded system of <em>existing</em> sensors deployed and automated (and reported) is developing useful agriculture-only sensors. A big problem in modern agriculture is the classic host/pest interaction. Scientists deploy some resistance mechanism and natural selection goes to work trying to overcome this (<a href="https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/new-soybean-variety-with-alternative-source-of-soybean-cyst-nematode-resistance-shows">soybean cyst nematode</a>, <a href="https://content.ces.ncsu.edu/corn-rusts-common-and-southern-rust">maize rust</a>, <a href="http://www.fao.org/agriculture/crops/rust/stem/rust-report/stem-ug99racettksk/en/">wheat rust</a>, etc.). It might be possible to develop biosensors that actively (and automatically) monitor the status of resistance durability in important crop pathogens. I think there are government agencies that have shown data can be rapidly collected, modeled, and deployed (see the <a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/">climate prediction center’s</a> website) with great success. Doing this for things such as nitrates, residual air particles of chemicals, and any other factor involved in agriculture will be the next step.</p>



<h4>Prescriptive Intervention</h4>



<p>This is an oddly named category but an important one. Simply put, the USDA is a behemoth organization that was collected ‘next-gen’ data <em>before</em> it was ‘next-gen’. <a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/aerial-photography/imagery-programs/naip-imagery/">Aerial imagery has been taken for quite some time</a>, however these photographs have basically collected dust and aren’t really used in any sort of predictive analytical application. Making <em>whatever</em> data the USDA collects readily and easily accessible should be priority #1 (as stated above). Most website within the USDA are<a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/aerial-photography/imagery-programs/naip-imagery/"> poorly designed</a>, reminiscent of <a href="https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/">another era of the web</a>. With the abundance of data the USDA collects, it can be at the forefront of getting this information out to the public …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>I really like the ergonomics of React. I like the explicit state management, the intuitive templating, the flow of data, and the lack of boilerplate. Itâ€™s onto some really good ideas!</p>
<p>So it was kind of a bummer that I couldnâ€™t really use it in <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2020/08/28/a-minimalist-development-workflow-using-es6-modules-and-snowpack/">the bundle-free dev workflows Iâ€™ve been experimenting with</a>. The problem is JSXâ€”you gotta run it through Babel. Thereâ€™s no way around it!</p>
<p>As far as I could tell, I had a few options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Skip JSX and <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html">use React.createElement</a> instead. ðŸ˜ž</li>
<li><a href="https://formidable.com/blog/2019/no-build-step/">Replace JSX with a bundle-free alternative</a> like <a href="https://github.com/mlmorg/react-hyperscript">hyperscript</a> or <a href="https://github.com/developit/htm">htm</a>. ðŸ¤”</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2019/09/11/web-dev-nirvana-and-why-I-needed-to-let-go-of-reactjs-to-reach-it/">a React-alternative written in Vanilla JS</a>. ðŸ�—</li>
</ol>
<p>I was in the process of playing with the option three, when I discovered a fourth option that completely took me by surprise.</p>
<h2 id="web-components">Web components</h2>
<p>I know what youâ€™re thinking, but hear me out! I experimented with web components back in 2015, and things were bad. The API was awkward, Shadow DOM had weird constraints, browser support was terrible, and Polymer felt like a bloated attempt to make it all work. Worst of all, it wasnâ€™t clear what problem web components would help me solve. I moved on and didnâ€™t look back.</p>
<p>But recently, I learned about two things that caught my attention.</p>
<p>First, web components bring <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements#Using_the_lifecycle_callbacks">lifecycle hooks to DOM elements</a>. If you add or remove a web component from the DOM, the lifecycle hooks will fire. This is a DOM featureâ€¦ no frameworks involved!</p>
<p>Second, you can instantiate a web component the same way you instantiate a React component (at least, a class-based one). It looks like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>MyComponent</span> <span>extends</span> <span>HTMLElement</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>constructor</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>super</span><span>();</span>
    <span>...</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>// Lifecycle hooks</span>
  <span>connectedCallback</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>disconnectedCallback</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This is not the awkward API I remembered. All it needed was a <code>render</code> function to run whenever it changes state, and weâ€™d be pretty dang close to the ergonomics of React. Maybe I could write a thin wrapper around <code>HTMLElement</code>, and weâ€™d be there.</p>
<p>I was about to try it out when I discovered that this had already been done in a project called <a href="https://github.com/polymer/lit-element">LitElement</a>.</p>
<h2 id="litelement">LitElement</h2>
<p>LitElement calls itself â€œA simple base class for creating fast, lightweight web components.â€� Hereâ€™s an example component built with LitElement implementing a â€œDark Modeâ€� checkbox:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>LitElement</span><span>,</span> <span>html</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'</span><span>../web_modules/lit-element.js</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>DarkMode</span> <span>extends</span> <span>LitElement</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>constructor</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>super</span><span>();</span>

    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>isDark</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>static</span> <span>get</span> <span>properties</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>isDark</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>type</span><span>:</span> <span>Boolean</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>};</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>handleChange</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>isDark</span> <span>=</span> <span>!</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>isDark</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>render</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>theme</span> <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>isDark</span> <span>?</span> <span>'</span><span>dark</span><span>'</span> <span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>light</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>
    <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>.</span><span>setAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>data-theme</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>theme</span><span>);</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>html</span><span>`
      &lt;label&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Dark Mode&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;input type="checkbox" ?checked="</span><span>${</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>isDark</span><span>}</span><span>" @change="</span><span>${</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>handleChange</span><span>}</span><span>" /&gt;
      &lt;/label&gt;
    `</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>That looks pretty familiar! Itâ€™s got state management, event handling, and intuitive templating. Also: no bundler needed.</p>
<p>I was still a little skeptical so I decided to build <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/lit-element-demo">a little demo app</a> to put it to the test. These were my first impressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The templating (which uses <a href="https://github.com/Polymer/lit-html">lit-html</a>) is really great. The <code>render</code> function works just like Reactâ€™s, event handlers are nice, and I love that it uses template strings. This was my favorite part!</li>
<li>Styling is done <a href="https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/guide/styles#add-styles">with template strings</a>, and the styles are scoped to the component. It has constraints, but I was able to work around them.</li>
<li>Props took some getting used to. <code>LitElement</code> props are like a combination of React props and local state. At first I was bummed to lose the word â€œstateâ€� but it wasnâ€™t a big deal once I got used to it.</li>
<li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked with form inputs (which are often a sticking point because they are stateful).</li>
<li>It was nice seeing my custom element tags in the real DOM. No special browser plugins needed for debugging.</li>
<li>It was easy to integrate with a global state management solution.</li>
<li><a href="https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/guide">The docs</a> were pretty good, though <a href="https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/try">the interactive tutorial</a> was broken for me.</li>
<li>Thereâ€™s <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.lit-html">a VSCode plugin</a> which was great for adding syntax highlighting to my template strings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I was pretty satisfied with the experience. That being said, my app was pretty small, so I still have a few questions, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How well does it work with nested components? It looks promising, but the React apps Iâ€™ve worked on were <em>very</em> heavily nested.</li>
<li>Would the CSS scoping run into issues for much larger projects?</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, browser support seems <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=custom-elementsv1">pretty</a> <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=shadowdomv1">good</a>, but I havenâ€™t done much testing so I donâ€™t know for sure.</p>
<h2 id="could-react-ever-be-refactored-to-use-web-components">Could React ever be refactored to use web components?</h2>
<p>Seeing the similarities between LitElement and React made me wonder: Could React ever be refactored to use web components?</p>
<p>Maybe! Web components support lifecycle hooks, props, custom element tags, scoped CSS, children (or â€œslotsâ€�), and more. The basic features are there. Also, it seems like these APIs are fairly low-level, so React could hide at least some of them under an abstraction.</p>
<p>Still, I think there are some major obstacles. React is big on functional components right now (see <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">hooks</a>), and itâ€™s unclear how well these would map to web components (update: this has already been done tooâ€”see <a href="https://github.com/matthewp/haunted">Haunted</a>). Reactâ€™s lifecycle hooks look pretty different from the DOM ones. And things like Shadow DOM would also behave pretty differently.</p>
<p>I suspect that any refactoring to use web components would be a major (and backwards-incompatible) change.</p>
<p>I think itâ€™s more likely that we see new frameworks pop up, borrowing ideas from React, and building on web components to reduce overhead. Indeed, it looks like LitElement has done exactly that.</p>

    <h2>Intel MKL on AMD Zen</h2>

  </p>


<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> this post investigates how recent MKL versions behave
on Zen CPUs. You should read the MKL license before using MKL. I shall
not be held responsible for how you use MKL.</p>

<p>Intel MKL has been known to use a SSE code paths on AMD CPUs that
support newer SIMD instructions such as those that use the Zen
microarchitecture. A (by now) well-known trick has been to set the
<code>MKL_DEBUG_CPU_TYPE</code> environment variable to the value <code>5</code> to <a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/hpc/How-To-Use-MKL-with-AMD-Ryzen-and-Threadripper-CPU-s-Effectively-for-Python-Numpy-And-Other-Applications-1637/">force
the use of AVX2
kernels</a>
on AMD Zen CPUs. Unfortunately, this <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/dxn38s/howto_force_matlab_to_use_a_fast_codepath_on_amd/fm2j83e/">variable has been
removed</a>
from Intel MKL 2020 Update 1 and later. This can be confirmed easily
by running a program that uses MKL with <code>ltrace -e getenv</code>.</p>

<h2 id="good-news-intel-seems-to-be-adding-zen-kernels">Good news: Intel seems to be adding Zen kernels</h2>

<p>However, it seems that Intel removed this option because they are
adding Zen kernels to MKL. For instance, if we run the <a href="https://www.lanl.gov/projects/crossroads/benchmarks-performance-analysis.php">ACES
dgemm</a>
benchmark with MKL 2020.2.254 on a Ryzen 3700X, performance is good:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./mt-dgemm 4000 | <span>grep </span>GF    
GFLOP/s rate:         382.756063 GF/s
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A quick inspection with <code>perf</code> shows that most cycles are spent
in a Zen-optimized kernel:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>79.95%  mt-dgemm  libmkl_def.so           [.] mkl_blas_def_dgemm_kernel_zen
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="bad-news-sgemm-is-not-yet-implemented">Bad news: <code>sgemm</code> is not yet implemented</h2>

<p>However, it seems that they have not yet implemented Zen kernels
for every BLAS function yet. I modified the ACES benchmark to
use the <code>sgemm</code> BLAS function and the results aren’t quite as
good:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./mt-sgemm 4000 | <span>grep </span>GF
GFLOP/s rate:         237.352720 GF/s
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And indeed, <code>perf</code> reveals that MKL does not use a Zen kernel:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>88.90%  mt-sgemm  libmkl_def.so           [.] LM_LOOPgas_1
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="a-temporary-workaround">A temporary workaround</h2>

<p>Some quick tracing shows that MKL uses a single function
<code>mkl_serv_intel_cpu_true</code> to detect whether it is dealing
with a genuine Intel CPU. Fortunately, the function is
rather trivial, so we can replace it by our own function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>mkl_serv_intel_cpu_true</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And compile it as a shared library:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>gcc <span>-shared</span> <span>-fPIC</span> <span>-o</span> libfakeintel.so fakeintel.c
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And ensure that the library gets preloaded:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>export </span><span>LD_PRELOAD</span><span>=</span>libfakeintel.so
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now the <code>sgemm</code> benchmark shows good performance:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./mt-sgemm 4000 | <span>grep </span>GF
GFLOP/s rate:         851.541946 GF/s
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And indeed, an AVX2-optimized code path is used:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>82.73%  mt-sgemm  libmkl_avx2.so          [.] mkl_blas_avx2_sgemm_kernel_0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The only minor downside is that MKL will also use AVX2 kernels for
other functions such as <code>dgemm</code>. But this does not seem to impact
performance negatively. In fact, for the <code>dgemm</code> benchmark performance
is slightly better on my machine (430 GF/s).</p>

<h2 id="making-it-permanent">Making it permanent</h2>

<p>Setting <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> everytime on a machine can get weary and one can
easily forget it. An easy solution is to add our small library to the
ELF dynamic section of your program using
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf">patchelf</a> with the <code>DT_NEEDED</code>
tag. For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>patchelf <span>--add-needed</span> libfakeintel.so yourbinary
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Most technology companies above a certain size start thinking about creating an internal platform team to build/manage systems that are used by multiple teams/products. This is a very high leverage team since they can beneficially impact many products at once and super-charge the organization. However, today I want to put some things that do not work well with internal platform teams, at least in the versions that I have encountered.</p>
<p>Tl;dr – It is better to operate multiple platform teams specializing in their own techno-business domains than to operate a single platform team. <a href="https://kislayverma.com/category/platform-thinking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Platform Thinking</a> is not about reuse, it is about facilitating evolution, and fixating on reuse destroys that opportunity. Instil platform thinking in all teams and allow self-reliant domains and platforms to emerge organically instead of forcing the issue up front.</p>
<p><strong>What does this team do?</strong></p>
<p>Having a separate platforms team often means that all horizontal concerns start getting pushed to them. Eventually, this team cannot identify its customers and simply ends up supporting many useful but disjoint systems. It is difficult to set goals and a north star for such a company because they are decoupled from the end user “by definition”. The only intent of such a team is to maximize the reuse of systems within an organization without any regard to the purposes of those systems and the expertise needed to run those systems.</p>
<p>In worse situations, other teams have no qualms building reusable components. But when it comes to supporting the reuse in production, respecting SLO and SLAs with other teams, people immediately start looking for a platform team to dump the operations on. The result is an operations laden central team forever doing firefighting because of its poor understanding of what it owns.</p>
<p>As the number of shared use-cases in a company grows, the platform team becomes the repository of all kinds of unconnected components whose business purpose they are disconnected from. Eventually we end up with a “team” whose team members have no idea what the others are working on as each member ends up specializing in some part or the other. We get technical specialists but not subject matter experts in the topics that most impact the business. If business starts to get into trouble, the platform team and its work is often among the first to go on the chopping block. This is because it is very difficult to explain to business how this collection of quasi-experts will help them make money.</p>
<p><strong>The developer gold rush</strong></p>
<p>There is something fundamentally unsound about the popular two-dimensional view of an organization’s technical stack. It biases us to the idea that things at the bottom are more foundational in nature, or more complex. It is certainly true that lower layers support more “scale” than upper layers. All of these things cause developers to rush to join the internal platform team as soon as it is incubated. The work is seen as more prestigious or more central, in some way, to the organization. The fact is that at best it is more technical in nature so developers don’t have to deal with the messiness of the real world, customer facing products.</p>
<p>This represents an organizational challenge in multiple ways. One is just managing who gets to do what and which roles are considered cool (why aren’t non-platform roles considered “business features“ and not “awesome engineering”). The other part is managing expectations in the team that eventually does get formed, Creating the team is easy, but keeping them business/customer focussed is harder than expected. Some many platform teams are mired in a strange mix of technical arrogance and customer detachment, making them far less powerful than they can be.</p>
<p><strong>Other teams aren’t platform teams?</strong></p>
<p>If there is a platform team, then does it mean that other teams aren’t platform teams? With a catch-all team in place, other teams start abandoning platform thinking and start thinking in product silos.</p>
<p>If platformization has value, then it should be the mindset and strategy for all teams and not the domain on one single team. Since all business problems are made up of <a href="https://kislayverma.com/platform-thinking/platforms-and-dogfood-everywhere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">domain and organization context</a>, it stands to reason that all teams should be producing and operating platformized components. These platforms may be produced on top of others which are owned by other teams. The purpose of a platform or a generic product is not just reuse, but also to model a domain boundary where organizational expertise is centralized. The platform team cannot keep pulling in horizontal components wherever they arise because then they would have to be experts in all aspects of the business. The typical definition of a platform team which owns a bottom tier of reusable things is just not compatible with the way organizations work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that leads us to…</p>

<p><strong>Lines of ownership</strong></p>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1022" src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-typical-tech-stack-1024x1022.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-typical-tech-stack-1024x1022.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-typical-tech-stack-300x300.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-typical-tech-stack-150x150.jpg 150w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-typical-tech-stack-768x766.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-typical-tech-stack-1070x1068.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-typical-tech-stack.jpg 1494w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>
<p>The tech stack of a company can be visualized with higher order system abstractions at the top and lower ones at the bottom. Which means that the skill set of operating the architecture can vary substantially as you go down the stack. This gives credence to the idea that the lower layers are somehow “different” from the upper layer and should be managed differently.</p>
<p>When we look at the technical stack, how should the lines of ownership run? Should they run horizontally, along components of similar level of abstraction, or should they run vertically, grouping systems generating end-to-end business value?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are running an autonomous, cross functional team (and many many companies claim to do so), does the depth of the stack matter? The very premise of this team is to be able to work at all levels of the stack and in loose alignment with other teams at each level. In such a setup, the idea of a platform team with fixed horizontal charter is meaningless. Every team creates the layers of the platform that it requires, and shares them with others as needed. This keeps a low-overhead alignment process running because a component isn’t created only for reuse, it is created first for use and then gets reused as the need arises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This kind of ownership also solves the problem of orphaned components which everyone critically depends upon but no one team maintains. Open sourcing is a great idea for writing code but a terrible idea for operations. Software MUST have an operational owner – one team that is responsible for ensuring that it is running as it is supposed to and meeting the benchmarks it is supposed to. Autonomous teams operate what they build, and if we can teach them to build platforms, then we don’t need to explicitly create platform teams.</p>
<hr>
<p>But with that said, One of the big arguments against autonomous teams is that they often end up doing a bunch of repeated work. This is obviously suboptimal, so how can we minimize this.</p>
<p><strong>Solving the reuse problem</strong></p>
<p>This problem can be minimized by having <em>all</em> problems solved in a platformized manner such that once invented, all teams can benefit from the systems that emerge. There might be short term problems in aligning around launch dates and such, but in the longer run, all use cases of a certain capability or entity start getting centralized in one place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, this does not mean that the team which built this platform doesn’t own it anymore. Reuse does not mean separating ownership from creation. A well designed platform is designed to keep the platform team out of the client’s decision cycle (external programmability), so if a notification platform is built by the marketing team and adopted by many others, the marketing team can continue to own and operate it – nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>Once a reusable thing finds more than 3 customer (Atwood’s law), then it <strong><em>may</em></strong> be time to consider this a horizontal responsibility and move it to a separate team. I don’t say move it to a general purpose platform team, but to a specific team that can specialize in the domain modelled by the component and can commit to evolving it to the benefit of all its customers. E.g. A notifications system can kick-start a new business domain altogether – a little Twilio in its own right. Or it may be only a shared technical capability like Managed Elasticsearch which can be handled by a team of storage/elasticsearch experts in the storage platform team/ES platform team.</p>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="923" src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-new-domain-is-born-1024x923.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-new-domain-is-born-1024x923.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-new-domain-is-born-300x270.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-new-domain-is-born-768x692.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-new-domain-is-born-1536x1384.jpg 1536w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-new-domain-is-born-1070x964.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-new-domain-is-born.jpg 1638w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>
<p>The above example shows that new teams and domains can be spawned off from every team’s work at either the same level of abstraction if the team originally owns all levels of abstraction in its work (aka a full-stack team). A new domain is a whole new reusable component in a sense. We grow the organization vertically by <a href="https://kislayverma.com/software-architecture/layering-domains-and-microservices-using-api-gateways/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layering components</a>, and the layers are built creating reusable components atop each other. We also grow the organization horizontally by adding whole new problem spaces that need solving, and each of these will in turn new opportunities for deepening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This organic process goes against the idea of a fixed, co-located platform charter. The idea of a “platform team” confuses the idea of ownership and reuse just as it confuses the idea of “depth” of the platform in the stack with domain knowledge. I think it is far better to think in terms of teams in specific domains each developing their own platforms, and moving cross teams and merging as either redundancy or reuse is discovered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To my mind, the only platform teams on day one are the infra team (managing the hardware stuff) and perhaps the authentication/authorization team, and even these I think of business/tech capabilities rather than reuse/depth-in-the-stack driven teams. All other platforms should emerge from inside product teams. Think cellular division rather than divine hand.</p>

<p><strong>If you want to get better at something, it’s important to do that thing.</strong></p>



<p>Sounds almost too obvious, yet we frequently find ways to rationalize inaction. One of the most common excuses is that we don’t know enough to start. We tell ourselves that we’ll start doing after we’ve learned more. Just one more book or course.<sup data-mfn="1">1</sup><span data-mfn="1">Some <a href="https://personalityjunkie.com/12/intp-intj-enneagram-5-types-dont-feel-ready-to-act/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">personality types</a> may be more susceptible to this pitfall.</span></p>



<p>What makes this excuse so insidious is that the <strong>best way to learn is precisely by doing</strong>. To do is to interact with reality. Reality provides feedback in a way that your mind cannot.</p>



<blockquote><p>Experience: that most brutal of teachers. But you learn, my God do you learn.</p><cite>C.S. Lewis</cite></blockquote>



<p>“It was overseasoned,” I said to myself after taking a bite of today’s omelette. Perhaps I could’ve avoided that mistake had I studied more cookbooks. But what do cookbooks tell you? Use “a pinch” of something? What is a pinch? Good cooks will say, “Oh, you just know.” How do you know? <strong>Through doing</strong>.</p>



<p>When we do something (cook an omelette), feedback identifies what we did well (omelette is edible, kitchen didn’t burn down) and what we did poorly (omelette is overseasoned). Improvement occurs when we incorporate reality’s feedback into future actions (use less seasoning, hold everything else constant). Maybe next time, the omelette is too bland. I would then incorporate that feedback into my third attempt. This is known as a feedback loop.</p>



<p>Feedback loops are the reason why consistent doing is the key to improvement. Do thing, see result, incorporate result, see new result, rinse and repeat.</p>



<p>As long as serious injury isn’t at risk, it is never too early to start doing. If taking action is daunting, start small. Even the smallest of actions is infinitely better than no action at all. You can become a better reader by reading, but you won’t improve at the thing you were reading about unless you do it.</p>



<p>A reader pointed out that the C.S. Lewis quote is a misattribution. <a href="https://www.cslewis.com/surprised-by-misquotes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Upon further digging</a>, I discovered that the quote is actually a line in the 1993 British biographical drama Shadowlands. It’s spoken by Anthony Hopkins, who played C.S. Lewis.</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/news/its-time-to-play-cloud-adventure-race-to-cloud-castle">Cloud Adventure: Race To Cloud Castle</a> game in full swing (get your paths in by Sept 4!) now seems like a good time to break down one interesting aspect of the game’s construction: the leaderboard aggregations.</p>



<h3>How the game works</h3>



<p>In “Cloud Adventure”, players compete to find and report paths marked by gems hidden across various cloud services. When you click “Submit Path” on the game page, the following event flow is triggered:</p>



<figure><img src="https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/08/sync2-1024x346.png" alt="" srcset="https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/08/sync2-1024x346.png 1024w, https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/08/sync2-300x101.png 300w, https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/08/sync2-768x259.png 768w, https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/08/sync2-1536x519.png 1536w, https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/08/sync2.png 1653w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>If your path is valid, we store it in a DynamoDB table in the following format:</p>



<figure><img src="https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-11.17.44-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-11.17.44-AM.png 1001w, https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-11.17.44-AM-300x38.png 300w, https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-11.17.44-AM-768x98.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px"></figure>



<p>This works great for storing and retrieving paths. By storing our user identifier in the partition key and our submitted path in the sort key, we can query the user identifier to get all paths associated with this user in one shot — great for checking your progress in the game.</p>



<h3>Adding Aggregations</h3>



<p>But we want to do more than just store and retrieve paths. As you can see on the <a href="https://adventure.acloud.guru/">leaderboard page</a>, we want to ask the following questions about our data:</p>



<ul><li>How many people (“active players”) have submitted at least one valid path to the leaderboard?</li><li>How many people have found X valid paths, where X is any number between 1 and 12?</li><li>How many total paths (with overlap) have been discovered by all players combined?</li></ul>



<p>There’s no simple query you can write against the DynamoDB model laid out above to find the answers to these questions; you’d have to scan the whole table for each and do a bunch of client-side math. Slow and expensive!</p>



<p>Instead, we need to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-gsi-aggregation.html">build some aggregates</a>. And if you’re feeling like this must be much more complex than putting the data in a relational database and writing SUM queries, don’t worry: with a bit of help from AWS SAM, we’ll be up and running in just a few minutes.</p>



<h3>Table layout</h3>



<p>Remember, DynamoDB tables are “schema-on-read”, not “schema-on-write” — you can throw any data into the attributes you want; it’s up to the client to interpret them correctly. This allows us to do something called <strong><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-gsi-overloading.html">index overloading</a>. </strong>We can store our aggregations as <em>additional records in the same DynamoDB table</em>. After all, why configure two tables when we can just as easily use one?</p>



<p>This is why I gave my partition and sort keys generic names (“pk” and “sk”), so I don’t limit myself to thinking of them as “username” or “path” fields.</p>



<figure><img src="https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-11.23.28-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-11.23.28-AM.png 882w, https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-11.23.28-AM-300x111.png 300w, https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-11.23.28-AM-768x283.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px"></figure>



<h3>Setting up streams</h3>



<p>Now all we have to do is keep these aggregates up to date. We could do this by synchronously updating a bunch of aggregation fields in DynamoDB whenever a user reports a new path. But that would quickly start to bog down the user experience.</p>



<p>Instead, we can treat our path updates as events and process them asynchronously, behind the user’s back. Sneaky!</p>



<p>Handily, DynamoDB gives us a cool feature called Streams, which behaves a lot like a direct Kinesis integration with our table. Once we set this up, we can get any changes to table data exported as events for downstream processing. </p>



<figure><img src="https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/08/async2-1024x589.png" alt="" srcset="https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/08/async2-1024x589.png 1024w, https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/08/async2-300x173.png 300w, https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/08/async2-768x442.png 768w, https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/08/async2-1536x884.png 1536w, https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/08/async2-2048x1179.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>(And I do mean “any events”. DynamoDB Streams don’t support filtering. So our handlers are going to have to pick through all the table changes in order to find the ones they care about.)</p>



<p>The good news is that we can define DynamoDB Streams with minimal config in an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/">AWS SAM template</a>. Here is my table resource:</p>



<pre><code>AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31
Description: SAM template for DynamoDB aggregations
Resources:
  ResultsTable:
    Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
    Properties:
      StreamSpecification:
        StreamViewType: NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES
      AttributeDefinitions:
        - AttributeName: "pk"
          AttributeType: "S"
        - AttributeName: "sk"
          AttributeType: "S"
      KeySchema:
        - AttributeName: "pk"
          KeyType: "HASH"
        - AttributeName: "sk"
          KeyType: "RANGE"
      BillingMode: "PAY_PER_REQUEST"</code></pre>



<p>SAM uses the <code>StreamViewType</code> attribute to intuit that we want to wire up a stream to this table. The <code>NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES</code> value means that we want to see both the old and modified data on the stream each time we make a change to the table.</p>



<p>Notice that we are NOT defining any additional secondary indexes on this table — we are going to make our aggregations work using nothing but the main table index!</p>



<p>Now we just need to connect the stream to the Lambda function that will process the aggregations. Under the <code>Events</code> section of our Lambda resource, we’ll add a function trigger of type <code>DynamoDB</code> , wired to the stream we implicitly created on our table. The <code>StartingPosition</code> of <code>TRIM_HORIZON</code> means we always want to start from the oldest unprocessed record in the stream, and the <code>BatchSize</code> means we’ll work with up to ten records at a time.</p>



<pre><code> AggregatorFunction:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
    Properties:
      CodeUri: backend/
      Handler: handler.aggregation_handler
      Runtime: python3.8
      Policies:
        - DynamoDBCrudPolicy:
            TableName: !Ref ResultsTable
      Environment:
        Variables:
          TABLE_NAME: !Ref ResultsTable
      Events:
        DynamoDBEvent:
          Type: DynamoDB
          Properties:
              Stream:
                  !GetAtt ResultsTable.StreamArn
              StartingPosition: TRIM_HORIZON
              BatchSize: 10</code></pre>



<h3>Building the aggregates</h3>



<p>As you can see in the function definition, I chose to write my Lambda in Python 3. You’ll note that I’m using Python’s <code>logger</code> module to write structured output to CloudWatch — very helpful if you are trying to parse through mounds of debug logs! I’ve also chosen to initialize my boto3 resource and table object in global space, outside the function handler, so I only incur the initialization time penalty on cold start.</p>



<pre><code>import os
import logging
import boto3

logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.setLevel(os.environ.get("LOG_LEVEL", "INFO"))

dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
table = dynamodb.Table(os.environ["TABLE_NAME"])

def aggregation_handler(event, context):
    logger.info(event)
    for record in event['Records']:
        if record['eventName'] == "INSERT" and "user_submitted_path" in record["dynamodb"]["NewImage"]:
            #Make sure the user hasn't already reached their 12-path limit
            num_paths = len(get_recorded_paths_for(record["dynamodb"]["Keys"]["pk"]["S"]))
            if num_paths &lt;= 12:
                #Perform Aggregations</code></pre>



<p>Inside the <code>aggregation_handler</code> itself (the code that gets triggered when DynamoDB Streams invokes the function), I’m looping through the set of up to 10 records that DynamoDB will send me.</p>



<p><em>Note: because this is a single-producer system where my own code controls what gets written to the table, I’m not super concerned about malformed events making their way onto the stream. But if I was, this code would need more error handling to deal with unexpected data in the records. Otherwise, the stream will back up as Lambda tries and fails to process the same record set over and over again.</em></p>



<p>Inside the loop, we’ll first need to perform a filtering check on the record, because not every record on the stream is relevant for our aggregations. In our case, we are looking for newly inserted records that contain a <code>user_submitted_path</code> — i.e., a path we need to aggregate into our various metrics.</p>



<p>Assuming this is a relevant record, we will then have to make a single DynamoDB <code>QUERY</code> to retrieve the full set of previously reported paths for this user. It’s important to note that this is the only additional query we will need to make in our aggregation efforts; all other information is contained in the streamed record. The query helper function looks something like this:</p>



<pre><code>def get_recorded_paths_for(user):
    response = table.query(KeyConditionExpression=Key('pk').eq(user))
    logger.info(response)
    paths = response['Items'] if 'Items' in response else []
    return paths</code></pre>



<p>Okay, now that we have our data, we’ll just build the aggregations as follows: </p>



<pre><code>Aggregation #1: update total paths found
                response = table.update_item(
                    Key={
                        'pk': 'AGGREGATES',
                        'sk': 'TOTAL_PATHS_FOUND'
                    },
                    ReturnValues='UPDATED_NEW',
                    UpdateExpression='ADD data_value :d',
                    ExpressionAttributeValues={':d': 1}
                )
                logger.info(response)
                #Aggregation #2: update number of players who have found this number of paths
                response = table.update_item(
                    Key={
                        'pk': 'AGGREGATES',
                        'sk': str(num_paths) + '_PATHS_FOUND'
                    },
                    ReturnValues='UPDATED_NEW',
                    UpdateExpression='ADD data_value :d',
                    ExpressionAttributeValues={':d': 1}
                )
                logger.info(response)
                #Aggregation #3: update total number of players (if necessary)
                if num_paths == 1:
                    response = table.update_item(
                        Key={
                            'pk': 'AGGREGATES',
                            'sk': 'TOTAL_PLAYERS'
                        },
                        ReturnValues='UPDATED_NEW',
                        UpdateExpression='ADD data_value :d',
                        ExpressionAttributeValues={':d': 1}
                    )
                    logger.info(response)</code></pre>



<p>I’m using the <code>ADD</code> action here on my DynamoDB updates, rather than the generally recommended <code>SET</code>, because it initializes records if they do not exist – something that’s always desirable in this case.</p>



<p>And in case you’re wondering, yes, each of these updates triggers a change on the table, which itself places a new record on the stream and triggers this same aggregation function over again! Now you see why it’s so important to place that filter check at the top of the code — otherwise we’d be stuck in an infinite …</p></div></div></div>

		<!-- excerpt start -->
<p>A review of Baumann et.als paper on limitations of the fork system call present in UNIX operating systems.
<!-- excerpt end --></p>

<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/04/fork-hotos19.pdf">Baumann, Andrew, et al. “A fork () in the road.” <em>Proceedings of the Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems</em>. 2019</a>.</p>

<p>This is a paper that only affects a small number of people: those doing OS research and those that directly call <code>fork</code> from their programs. Still, I find it interesting since it points to limitations in the UNIX design. When I learned to program, UNIX was seen as the gold standard. I remember reading an LKML post from Linus Torvalds where he meant that OS development was about the refinement of existing ideas, not so much about inventing new concepts.  But people still do OS research, and the paper describes how having to support <code>fork</code> can be a burden.</p>

<p>The main criticism in the paper is about how <code>fork</code> affects many other parts of the system. It was originally a very simple idea: copy the address space of the parent and let the child redirect file descriptors, reduce permissions or, alter the namespace of the child.  But <code>fork</code> today impacts all other operating system abstractions with which it was once orthogonal. Below are some practical examples of things mentioned in the paper.</p>

<h2 id="buffered-io-and-fork">Buffered I/O and Fork</h2>

<p>What do you think this program will print?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int main(void) {
    printf("Hello World! ");
    pid_t pid = fork();
    return 0;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It prints the output twice, <code>Hello World! Hello World!</code>, since the stdio buffers are flushed both in the parent and in the child. So  in this case <code>fork</code> doesn’t compose, since the calling code needs to explicitly flush I/O before calling <code>fork</code>.</p>

<h2 id="threads-and-fork">Threads and Fork</h2>

<p>This program starts a thread that locks a mutex for 1ms. It then forks a child which tries to lock the same mutex. What do you think it will print and why?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/wait.h&gt;

static pthread_mutex_t thread_mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

static void* worker(void* arg) {
    pthread_detach(pthread_self());

    for (;;) {
      pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;thread_mutex);
      usleep(1000);
      pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;thread_mutex);
    }
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t thread;
    pthread_create(&amp;thread, NULL, worker, 0);

    usleep(1000);
    pid_t pid = fork();

    if (pid == 0) {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;thread_mutex);
        const char buf[] = "lock acquired\n";
        write(fileno(stderr), buf, strlen(buf));
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;thread_mutex);
        exit(0);
    }

    wait3(NULL, WNOHANG, NULL);

    return 0;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On my system, the subprocess always deadlocks before printing the <code>lock acquired</code> message. A child created by <code>fork</code> has only a single thread (a copy of the calling thread). So there’s a good chance that the mutex will be in the locked state when the child starts executing. One common case where this happens is if a thread doing memory allocation and holding a heap lock, while <code>fork </code>is called.</p>

<h2 id="large-address-spaces-and-fork">Large address spaces and Fork</h2>

<p>How long do you think it takes to fork if the parent has 10K VMAs? Here’s a test program from Chromes <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=819228">Issue 819228: Consider using posix_spawn() on Linux</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ ./fork 1 1
149.65us to fork().
$ ./fork 10 
89.63us to fork().
$ ./fork 100 1
576.18us to fork().
$ ./fork 1000 1
2661.38us to fork().
$ ./fork 10000 1
35420.67us to fork().
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So 35ms to <code>fork</code> with 10K VMAs. If I replace the <code>fork</code> call with <code>vfork</code> it takes only 115us! The speed difference is because <code>fork</code> needs to copy the page table entries to the new address space.</p>

<p>To get around these limitations some systems mark memory-mapped regions as not to be forked. Others like Chrome creates  a zygote process that has as little memory allocated as possible to ensure fast process creation times.</p>

<h2 id="alternatives-to-fork">Alternatives to Fork</h2>

<p>You can use <code>vfork</code>  or <code>posix_spawn</code> instead. The <code>vfork</code> function creates a new process but does not copy the parent’s page tables. Instead, it starts the child in the same address space as its parent and starts it  before the parent. The only thing that can be done from there is calling èxec<code>. The </code>posix_spawn<code> API is much more complicated than just calling </code> <code>fork</code>, but as we’ve seen the simplicity comes with a great burden on modern systems.</p>

            <h2>A Bit of Background</h2>
            <p>
                I recently encountered a fun little padding oracle attack as part of a CTF and found surprisingly few articles online outlining the attack. Of the articles I did find, most either discussed specific instances of the attack (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POODLE">POODLE</a>) or described a lengthy sequence of mathematical operations which were difficult to follow. In this post I want to present a different, more visual description of the attack in the hope that some may find it useful and easier to understand.
            </p>

            <h2>Cipher Modes</h2>
            <p>
                Before talking about padding oracles, we need to talk about cipher modes and block ciphers. The cipher we will be using in our examples is the Rijndael block cipher which forms part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">Advanced Encryption Standard</a> (AES). A block cipher is an algorithm which operates on fixed-length groups of bits (blocks). Contrast this with a stream cipher where each bit is encrypted one at a time. As a block cipher is only suitable for a single fixed-length message, additional steps are required to encrypt or decrypt messages longer (or shorter) than one block. A cipher mode algorithm describes how to apply the single-block operation repeatedly to securely encrypt or decrypt a message larger than a single block.
            </p>
            <p>
                Padding oracles are commonly associated with block ciphers operating in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher_block_chaining_(CBC)">Cipher Block Chaining</a> (CBC) mode. In CBC mode each block of plaintext is mixed with the previous block before encryption. This prevents information leakage associated with the simpler <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Electronic_codebook_(ECB)">Electronic Codebook</a> (ECB) mode. In ECB mode each block is encrypted with the same key and so the same plaintext is always encrypted to the same ciphertext. This means patterns present in the plaintext will likely still be present in the ciphertext. We can see this in the images below comparing ECB and CBC modes.

            <h2>AES Encryption</h2>
            <p>
                Now that we understand the different encryption modes we can begin exploring how a message is encrypted and then onto the decryption stage where our padding oracle will enable us to decrypt the message without knowing the key.
            </p>
            <svg id="animation-1" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" viewBox="0 0 600 340"></svg>

        <section>
            <h2>Padding Oracles</h2>
            <p>
                Onto the padding oracle. An oracle is simply a mechanism to determine whether a test has passed or failed. So in our case a padding oracle is a weakness which enables us (the attacker) to determine if a message is successfully padded. The particular padding oracle we will be looking at occurs during decryption. The decryption process for CBC mode ciphers is to decrypt all blocks, validate and remove the padding then return the plaintext. How the server responds based on invalid padding will determine whether or not we can perform the attack.
            </p>
            <p>
                A padding oracle attack exploits the padding validation step of decryption in order to decrypt the message without knowing the key. The attack relies on having a padding oracle which reveals whether or not a message is correctly padded. Typically this will be the decryption server responding with a verbose error message indicating the padding is invalid. However, other channels are also possible. For example a server may take longer to reply if a message is incorrectly padded, as long as it can be inferred whether or not a message is correctly padded the attack can be performed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that we know what we’re looking for in a padding oracle we can walk through the decryption of our message and perform a padding oracle attack.
            </p>
            <svg id="animation-2" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" viewBox="0 0 600 340"></svg>
            
            
            
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Mitigations</h2>
            <p>
                So what can we do to prevent this attack? The obvious fix is to not reveal whether or not a message is correctly padded. However, this is easier said than done. Providing a generic error if a message fails to decrypt will eliminate any obvious padding oracles. But timing-based padding oracles are much harder to detect and prevent. In a timing-based padding oracle, rather than an error message indicating invalid padding a server may take a noticibly different amount of time to process a correctly padded message from an incorrectly padded message. How long it takes the server to respond can then be used to determine if a message is correctly padded or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                A much better approach is to encrypt the message and then append a Message Authentication Code (MAC) to verify the integrity of the ciphertext. The MAC is then validated by the server before any decryption occurs. If the validation fails, it indicates the message has been tampered with. The server can then refuse to continue decrypting the message. This ensures that there is no padding oracle, regardless of implementation details such as timings and error messages.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                Hopefully this has helped explain padding oracles a little better, as well as illustrate how important it is to understand how to correctly implement cryptographic code as one small mistake can very quickly bring it tumbling down. An interesting takeaway is that this technique is not just limited to decryption. Padding oracles can also be exploited to forge valid ciphertext without knowing the key, but I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader. If you ever see a system which assumes that an encrypted value cannot be tampered with (session tokens are good ones), don't forget to check for padding oracles.

      <h2 id="hack-1-googly-eyed-monster">Hack #1: Googly-eyed monster</h2>

<p>Stick googly eyes on your webcam or craft a sticky note monster to trick yourself into making eye contact with your camera.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6ae726b8de026a73296c80f7d4292dfa96952c44/94f31/assets/blog/img/zoom_hacks-main.jpg" alt="Sticky note monster with googly eyes on my webcam"></p>

<h2 id="hack-2-disable-your-self-view">Hack #2: Disable your self-view</h2>

<p>Change your video settings to disable your “self-view”. This keeps your video on for others, but not for yourself.</p>

<p>Part of what makes video conferences exhausting is the unconscious part of your brain continually self-monitoring your own image for appropriateness. This unnaturally raises your self-consciousness because you normally don’t see your own face during in-person socializing; imagine always looking at yourself in a mirror when talking to someone face-to-face. Disabling your self-view helps avoid unnecessarily tiring out your social muscles.</p>

<p>Here are direct links to instructions on how to disable self-view:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Zoom</strong>: <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115001077226-Hiding-or-showing-my-video-on-my-display" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hide my video on my display</a>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Google Meet/Hangouts</strong>: <a href="https://support.google.com/meet/answer/9292748" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turn off self view in a video call</a>. Unfortunately Meet still shows a “preview” video even when self-view is disabled, but you can adblock it.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Webex</strong>: This is not currently possible but you can change your self-view to PiP and <a href="https://help.webex.com/en-us/6895sz/Access-and-Adjust-Self-View-on-Room-and-Desk-Devices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">point the camera away</a> from you. Another option is to cover the image of yourself on your screen with a post-it note.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Skype</strong>: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/all/hide-thumbnail-video-of-myself/467d3a49-8e84-48b4-865c-7a114a7422d2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Not possible</a> but you can cover that part of a screen with a post-it.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Slack</strong>: Also not possible but again a sticky note comes to the rescue.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hack-3-take-calls-in-creative-places">Hack #3: Take calls in creative places</h2>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3b9b5de5e28e3e4e7d97dd827f32ec73b0b86368/c3968/assets/blog/img/zoom_hacks-shower.jpg" alt="A video call where I'm in the shower, but the background looks like a tile wall."></p>

<p>With the right camera angle, you can’t even tell that I’m in the shower. It just looks like I’m seated at a fancy café with marble walls.</p>
<!-- Kramdown -->

<p>If you can, occasionally go to a different room from where you normally take your calls/do your work to attend different video calls. I think environmental cues are important and going to a different room from where you normally “work” will subconsciously convince you that this event is different from others you’ve experienced. This will reduce fatigue hopping from call to call if your entire day is full of video calls, and helps prevent the day from dissolving into an unmemorable blur where you feel like you accomplished nothing.</p>

<p>Take your calls:</p>
<ul>
  <li>on your front porch</li>
  <li>in your hallway</li>
  <li>at a public park</li>
  <li>in your car (not while driving)</li>
  <li>in your basement</li>
  <li>in your shower (please leave clothes on and leave water off)</li>
  <li>any other creative location you can think of</li>
</ul>

<p>Use a virtual background if you don’t like how your attic looks on camera. If your videoconferencing software does not support virtual backgrounds, or it can’t detect your wall, you can buy a vinyl wall sticker to easily change your background to look like <a href="https://amzn.to/32Rkl19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marble</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3juHTQ3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wood</a>, or <a href="https://amzn.to/32Ew8zw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tile</a> (<a href="https://billmei.net/disclosure">affiliate link info</a>).</p>

<p>If you live in a tiny one room apartment, you can move furniture around to create a different “room”. For example, I sometimes push my desk away from the wall and then sit on the opposite side of the desk to take calls facing the other direction.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Nate Munk is a software engineer from Detroit who is turning his hobby of creating voice apps into a business making over $1,000 a month. Hear his journey of how he discovered Alexa Skills and what he went through until successfully finding a niche.</p></div></div><div><div><h4><strong>Name:</strong> Nate Munk</h4><h4><strong>Location:</strong> Detroit, USA</h4><h4><strong>What I Do:</strong> Software Engineer<br></h4><h3>What's your background, how did you get started in voice and what are you currently working on?</h3><p>Right now I'm a software engineer at Ford Motor Company. I got my degree in Information Systems from Brigham Young University and I didn't have a lot of programming experience in school. I focused more on the business process aspect. During my last year at school, I had the opportunity to be in a mobile app competition that the school was hosting, and I asked them if I could make an Alexa skill. That was almost four years ago, and something that I hadn't even really looked into before, but I was interested in learning more about it. So, I created a game called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nate-Munk-Escape-Jurassic-Island/dp/B074CQW8H4">Escape Jurassic Island</a>. I've since redone it a couple of times and it's in Voiceflow now but I originally just coded it out and ended up taking second place in the competition and won a couple thousand bucks which was nice. It was enough of an incentive and made me feel like maybe I could even make a little bit of money doing this while enjoying the experience. That was kind of how I initially got started.</p><figure id="w-node-27d3eb5d7ff6-fd124adf"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ec74e25528af04410124ad1/5ec834a106d25c66260a545d_1588953809273.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Fast forward to today and I have almost 40 skills that are live. A majority of these are white noise skills, and that's where my attention has mostly been recently. I started building a bunch of different games and it was difficult to monetize those, so I started looking at other options and I believe it was in October when I started building some white noise skills.</p><h3>It looks like your Jurassic Island skill is pretty popular. Has that been difficult to monetize too or is there something that you did differently with it that made it easier?</h3><p>That one has been pretty difficult to monetize. I'll get maybe a couple of sales with in-skill purchasing (ISP) every month. It's just a few bucks here and there. I was in the weekly Amazon email newsletter in July or August which helped that skill get pushed out to a ton of people all at once and I was able to make a couple hundred bucks from the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/grow-your-business/rewards">Developer Rewards Program</a> based on the engagement my skill got and I also made a few sales. But since then it's been pretty slow. And then with most of my other game skills I get a fair amount of usage but not a lot of purchases right now.</p><h3>For your white noise skills what goes into making them? Do you record the audio yourself?</h3><p>I've done a mix of recording my own audio just with my mic that I have at home and then spending a lot of time in <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">audacity</a> making some minor tweaks to it. I edit it and generate a really long file that doesn't have anything that sounds bad. It should sound like it's one continuous audio file. And then some audio is just <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/">creative commons zero</a> (CC0) which is free audio that can be used commercially. When using that approach I spend a bit of time searching for what I want, make tweaks to it, and then create the different audio files. Right now I'm hosting a lot of them on<a href="https://soundcloud.com/"> SoundCloud</a> and then some in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">S3</a>. Both allow me to generate URLs to the audio that I can point to in my skills.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ec74e25528af04410124ad1/5ec84915d0fb9b2456a05804_relaxing-sleep-sounds.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>What's been the most challenging part of building skills that you've had to overcome?</h3><p>I'd say this applies more towards the white noise skills, but the changing landscape for monetization was a pretty big hurdle. I created all of my skills and was initially trying to monetize them through usage (<a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/grow-your-business/rewards">Alexa Developer Rewards</a>). I made all of my skills provide longer audio files so they run longer before they need to loop in my free version which was more than what you could get with other skills’ paid versions. I was just trying to build something that was better than existing skills and that was free with the hope it would start to attract enough users for Amazon to pay me for usage. But over the last several months they've been paying out a lot less than before and I'm not sure exactly what the criteria is that goes into that.</p><p>I learned pretty quickly that relying solely on developer rewards wasn't going to be a very good way to monetize my skills. I had to do a pivot where I had these skills that were playing five hour plus audio files while the other guys had four hour files but you're paying $2 a month for that. And so I had to find a way to make my skills enticing enough where I didn't have to change my free version and I could provide enough value on a paid version for people to want to make that jump. That ended up being a big challenge. It’s something that took a little while to figure out, but I started offering 12 hour audio files. With 12 hours it’s basically guaranteed to play through the whole night without having to go in and out and disrupt your sleep. Then I added a new feature that I have on almost all of my white noise skills that will play your chosen white noise sound but then it will transition into a more peaceful sound. So when it's time to wake up it'll be like birds chirping or something that's just nice to wake up to.</p><p>Since getting those two features added for my paid content, I'm getting close to about 3% of people that sign up for a free trial which is pretty good. At least I assume it's pretty good. I've gotten a pretty good number of users. I think I've had maybe 800-900 people total who have signed up for free trials and a number of them drop off, but I’m still retaining a good number of people. So it's been growing each month and I've been able to make more than the previous month fairly significantly.</p><h3>How do you promote your Alexa Skills and help them get discovered? Is there anything that you've found to be helpful In particular?</h3><p>That is probably actually the most difficult part because I have no idea how to really market my skills effectively. I had a little bit of a lucky break with one of my skills because it just organically was getting traffic. It had a good invocation name that people were able to say easily and remember and that started driving a lot of traffic. It ended up being sustained for quite awhile but that particular skill has started to slow down. However, I think the increased traffic and reviews and different things that I obtained helped to elevate my ranking for the skills that came after it.</p><p>So, I haven't done any marketing. I haven't spent any money to try to get my skills out there. I just recently created a website. I threw together a splash page that gives a little bit of information and it has links to my skills and I'm looking at different ways to drive traffic like reaching out to bloggers. But overall, my marketing plan has mostly been relying on a little bit of luck and it's been working okay so far.</p><h3>What's been the most useful resource or tool for you in learning about creating voice apps and making them successful?</h3><p>I like to read articles to stay caught up on new developments and learn from what other people are doing. I think the biggest thing that I've learned, and it's been kind of a frustrating thing to learn, is I just made mistakes over and over again. A lot of them get caught before they're public or released because Amazon catches a lot of them when I try to push out things that are not quite up to snuff but every once in a while it slips through and I hear back from a user. I feel like that's been the best way to learn for me - just getting feedback on things that I could do better. Learning and knowing the best practices going into it helps but I think knowing your user and their expectations of your skills has been the area where I've been able to succeed. Always remember to create something that gives the user what they want and provides the value that they're looking for.</p><blockquote><em>“I think the biggest thing that I've learned, and it's been kind of a frustrating thing to learn, is I just made mistakes over and over again.”</em></blockquote><h3>What are your goals for 2020?</h3><p>I have a pretty extensive spreadsheet of goals around the number of new users, new signups for subscriptions, the amount of money that I want to make, retention, etc. But the underlying factor with those is just seeing a steady increase in the number of people that I am able to reach and the number of users who think it's worth it to upgrade and be willing to pay for my skills. So from a numbers perspective, those are the things that I'm looking for. From a qualitative approach, I love hearing back from my users. Whether it's a review or an email or they just reach out to me and say, “the skill has worked really well. It's helped me to sleep better and it's helped my kid to sleep better.” It's harder to quantify but knowing that the skills that I'm creating are making a difference and making people's lives better..that's something that's impactful. It's hard to get passionate about white noise but that makes it a lot easier to continue focusing on it and to improve the skills that I have as well as work towards creating new ones.</p><blockquote><em>“It's harder to quantify but knowing that the skills that I'm creating are making a difference and making people's lives better...that's something that's impactful.”</em></blockquote><h3>Do you have any advice for someone who's new and just getting started?</h3><p>I would say the biggest thing is - don't be afraid to fail. I've been doing this for about four years and have only really started to monetize my apps well over the last six months. It's something that takes a lot of work. It takes a lot of effort. But when you really put yourself out there and try to do things that are outside of your comfort zone you're probably gonna fail quite a few times before you're successful. That's just part of the process of getting to where you want to be. It was hard for me to push through to get to this point but it's definitely worth it, especially if it's something that you're passionate about.</p><p>The questions that have been posted here on Voice Devs that have been driving community …</p></div></div></div>

<p>A hundred years ago, a person could not imagine to be able to play any musical instrument they want, to create new interactive worlds, or to launch cars into space.
Life was simply not enough.</p>
<p>Then the machines came.
Silicon computations allowed us, mere mortals, prolong our lives virtually and literally.</p>
<p>Music creation software, game development engines, 2D and 3D editors, neural networks, AI and machine learning, motion capturing, navigation, medicine, wearable devices, smartphones…
Thanks to these, a person now can do a lot of things while having more free time during their lifespan.</p>
<p>It all happened because a human learned to communicate with machines with means of programming languages.
Early inventors of the future were brilliant people able to coin fundamentally new concepts which last until today.</p>
<p>But this is the how the humanity evolves: we accumulate knowledge and pack, shortcut it.
We don’t need to keep in head proofs of every mathematical theorem, and we don’t need to fully understand the nature of an axiom.
Instead, we store theorem and axiom statements.
With that in mind, we have more space to solve new problems.</p>
<p>The same applies to programming.
Those brilliant people inevitably become old, as real system programming knowledge fades away.
On the surface, the amount of those who really understand how machines work seems to shrink.</p>

<p>“But I can run a newural network with Python!”, one would argue.
Well, who do you think develops TensorFlow itself?
TensorFlow <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow">isn’t written in Python</a>, kid.</p>
<p>Writing a game in Lua or Ruby is totally possible, as well as creating a messenger or code editor in Electron.
However, Electron, as any mature game engines, are still written in <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron">C++</a>.</p>
<p>Almost any meaningful software which needs to utilize a machine with more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">20%</a> efficiency, is written in a system programming language.</p>
<p>System programming is the foundation of the development of the human civilization.</p>
<p>Regardless of its importance, system programming seems to be less popular than application programming, because it’s known to be harder to both learn and master.
It is definitely easier to spin up a web server, connect it to a database, set up some Stripe integration, drink a smoothie and proudly call yourself an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>But that does not invest in the human civilization’s progress on the Kardashov’s scale.
<mark>The humanity will still depend on system programming in the foreseeable future.</mark>
And we need new, fresh blood there.</p>
<p>In this article, I’ll try to take a peek on the current state of the system programming, find out why it’s not that popular and choose the best system programming language for the Next Big But Fairly-Low-Level Project ™.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-the-right-language">Choosing the Right Language <a href="#choosing-the-right-language">¶</a></h2>
<p>When choosing a serious language for serious system programming, the choice is broad: it’s either C, C++, Rust, or one of the many new LLVM-based projects.</p>
<h3 id="c">C <a href="#c">¶</a></h3>
<p>C is excellent at its simplicity, but bigger projects require higher-level language features, such as <a href="https://twitter.com/jfbastien/status/1289305925199650816">memory control</a>, object hierarchy, lambdas etc.; therefore, C is out of competition here.</p>
<p>Ditto applies to C “replacements”, such as <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Ẕ̴̰̥̔͝i̷̥̣̍̓̉ġ̷̢̪͌̾́</a> and <a href="https://vlang.io/">Patreon-lang</a>.</p>
<h3 id="c%2B%2B">C++ <a href="#c%2B%2B">¶</a></h3>
<p>C++ is the grandfather of higher-level system programming.</p>
<p>It offers powerful features with a grain of Unix epoch practices and a great amount of undefined behaviour.
Funnily enough, an experienced C++ programmer shall aware of not what C++ is, but of what it is not, i.e. undefined behaviour of the language.</p>
<p>That said, developing on C++ is pain, and it is easy to shoot your lower parts off by, say, returning a lambda with a closured local variable.
Of course, it is possible to have a fancy third-party UB checking tool, but such a tool would never be perfect considering the amount of UB in the language itself.</p>
<figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/04da42cb9f4d387184dff020f9e3165db0f6c6b3/4e4e4/public/img/posts/2020-08-16-system-programming-in-2k20/thinking-about-meme.jpg" alt="" width="100%"><figcaption>Relatable AF</figcaption></figure>
<p>Another Unix anachronism C++ inherits is the backwards compatibility with a bitter taste of Postel’s law: “most compilers implement that feature in different ways, let’s put it into the language after a short thought with design averaging from existing implementations!”.
One may argue that backwards compatibility is a good thing, but let me postpone this discussion for a <a href="#backwards-compatibility">later section</a> of this article.</p>
<h3 id="rust%2C-pt.-1">Rust, pt. 1 <a href="#rust%2C-pt.-1">¶</a></h3>
<p>Rust is a fairly young programming language with a reputable mission: empower everyone to build reliable and efficient software.
Let’s deconstruct the statement.</p>
<p>One of the game-changing features of Rust is the separation between safe and unsafe code.
The ability to isolate volatile code worths a lot: if anything goes wrong, then you simply <code>grep</code> your codebase with <code>unsafe</code> filter and voilà – all the dangerous invocations are at your hand sight.
It also allows <em>the</em> implementation to perform crazy optimizations, say, by entirely removing parts of code; and it’s fine because there is no unsafe access to that code.
As a result, focusing on volatile code becomes easier, and nasty bugs are squashed faster.</p>
<p>Otherwise, <em>the</em> Rust compiler would yell at you, pointing at your mistakes in the safe code area.
And those yells are detailed enough, so most of the time you have a clear picture on why you’re wrong and what to do with that.</p>
<p>Compared to C++, Rust compilation process is much friendlier and catches more bugs before you face them in runtime.</p>
<figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8b725e860ee4af6ccc10b35afdeae8392958e28b/1756b/public/img/posts/2020-08-16-system-programming-in-2k20/errors-in-langs.jpg" alt="" title="How different compilers react to user errors" width="100%"><figcaption>I just wanted to sort an array</figcaption></figure>
<p>Another good thing about Rust is macros.
Well, what’s good is the idea of macros; the implementation of macros in Rust is um… questionable.
Nevertheless, macros allow writing code in code with much greater flexibility than with C++ preprocessor and constant expressions.
Nuff said, macros are must-have in modern languages.</p>
<p>The built-in crates system Rust has brings powerful abstractions into the ecosystem.
Those folks enjoying lower-level programming and having enough skills to do so can wrap unsafe, but performant code, into simple, but safe abstractions.
And those who have a need to just make things work, may (comparably) <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/01/21/rust_actix_web_framework_maintainer_quits/">easy adopt those crates</a>.</p>
<hr>
<!-- ![Checkpoint!](../../../public/img/posts/2020-08-16-system-programming-in-2k20/checkpoint.svg =100%x) -->
<p>Rust really does allow to build <em>reliable</em> (no undefined behaviour in-the-wild) and <em>efficient</em> (thanks to the zero-cost philosophy) software to <em>everyone</em> (with powerful abstractions).</p>
<p>But, there are always some “but<sub>t</sub>s”.</p>
<p>First of all, only a few may say Rust has friendly syntax.
In the maniacal pursuit for the absolute memory safety, the language introduces plethora of abstractions such as borrow checker, six string types (hey, we’re making a language here, not a guitar), <code>Mut</code>, <code>Box</code>, <code>Arc</code>, <code>Trait</code>, requiring to do those ubiquitous <code>unwrap()</code>, <code>as_ref()</code> and <code>borrow()</code> (often chained) literally before every access.</p>
<p>Some may call it “hipster thinking”, but those small spikes like mandatory semicolons*, curly brackets wrapping, and otherwise unintuitive design decisions like constantly “screaming code” with ubiquitous bangs (<code>!</code>) and overloaded documentation semantics — they make writing and reading Rust code harder.
Definitely harder than Ruby or, say,
J̸̧̨̹͈̦̏̅͒̈́͂͐̄̾͟͟ͅȃ̡͎̯̟̦͉͂͊̿̈́v̢̡͖͍̻̳̞͌͌̈̋̐͌̆͜a̴͖̱̟̩̹̘̺͊̃̋̇̾̀̀͐̊͐ͅS̶͚̣̥͚͈̥̤͔̾̎̎̿̔͊̋̉̓c̶̡̧̗̻̊̈̋̍̔̂̅̓̚͘͢ŗ̰͖̲̙͖͕̂̏̍͑̊̋ḯ̸̛̤̦̠͈̩̙̯̘̥̖̅́̊̀͑̕͠͠p̸̨̧̨̧̡̛̮̯͖̹͈̉̑̿͛̎̀͌̾͞ț̸̩͕͈̊͐̏̏̕͡ͅ
.</p>
<div>
<p>* In fact, semicolons are not mandatory
<em>everywhere</em>
, which brings even more confusion.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26665471/are-semicolons-optional-in-rust">StackOverflow</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Semicolons are generally not optional, but there are a few situations where they are. Namely after control expressions like <code>for</code>, <code>if/else</code>, <code>match</code>, etc.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Statham">wise man</a> once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The complexity of a language feature is proportional to the number of articles explaining the feature.</p>

<h2>What this Book Covers<a href="#what-this-book-covers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This book covers the building blocks of the most common methods in machine learning. This set of methods is like a toolbox for machine learning engineers. Those entering the field of machine learning should feel comfortable with this toolbox so they have the right tool for a variety of tasks. Each chapter in this book corresponds to a single machine learning method or group of methods. In other words, each chapter focuses on a single tool within the ML toolbox.</p>
<p>In my experience, the best way to become comfortable with these methods is to see them derived from scratch, both in theory and in code. The purpose of this book is to provide those derivations. Each chapter is broken into three sections. The <em>concept</em> sections introduce the methods conceptually and derive their results mathematically. The <em>construction</em> sections show how to construct the methods from scratch using Python. The <em>implementation</em> sections demonstrate how to apply the methods using packages in Python like <code><span>scikit-learn</span></code>, <code><span>statsmodels</span></code>, and <code><span>tensorflow</span></code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-this-book">
<h2>Why this Book<a href="#why-this-book" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are many great books on machine learning written by more knowledgeable authors and covering a broader range of topics. In particular, I would suggest <a href="http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/">An Introduction to Statistical Learning</a>, <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/">Elements of Statistical Learning</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/pattern-recognition-machine-learning/">Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning</a>, all of which are available online for free.</p>
<p>While those books provide a conceptual overview of machine learning and the theory behind its methods, this book focuses on the bare bones of machine learning algorithms. Its main purpose is to provide readers with the ability to construct these algorithms independently. Continuing the toolbox analogy, this book is intended as a user guide: it is not designed to teach users broad practices of the field but rather how each tool works at a micro level.</p>
</div>
<div id="who-this-book-is-for">
<h2>Who this Book is for<a href="#who-this-book-is-for" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This book is for readers looking to learn new machine learning algorithms or understand algorithms at a deeper level. Specifically, it is intended for readers interested in seeing machine learning algorithms derived from start to finish. Seeing these derivations might help a reader previously unfamiliar with common algorithms understand how they work intuitively. Or, seeing these derivations might help a reader experienced in modeling understand how different algorithms create the models they do and the advantages and disadvantages of each one.</p>
<p>This book will be most helpful for those with practice in basic modeling. It does not review best practices—such as feature engineering or balancing response variables—or discuss in depth when certain models are more appropriate than others. Instead, it focuses on the elements of those models.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-readers-should-know">
<h2>What Readers Should Know<a href="#what-readers-should-know" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <em>concept</em> sections of this book primarily require knowledge of calculus, though some require an understanding of probability (think maximum likelihood and Bayes’ Rule) and basic linear algebra (think matrix operations and dot products). The appendix reviews the <a href="https://dafriedman97.github.io/mlbook/content/appendix/methods.html"><span>math</span></a> and <a href="https://dafriedman97.github.io/mlbook/content/appendix/methods.html"><span>probability</span></a>needed to understand this book. The concept sections also reference a few common machine learning <a href="https://dafriedman97.github.io/mlbook/content/appendix/methods.html"><span>methods</span></a>, which are introduced in the appendix as well. The concept sections do not require any knowledge of programming.</p>
<p>The <em>construction</em> and <em>code</em> sections of this book use some basic Python. The construction sections require understanding of the corresponding content sections and familiarity creating functions and classes in Python. The code sections require neither.</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about writing lately. I recently <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/cto-writer">left a career as a startup CTO to write full-time</a>, so when people ask me things like, “Why should software engineers know how to write?” I have a lot of thoughts. Rather than write yet another listicle (<a href="https://www.thegraidenetwork.com/blog-all/2017/10/3/why-math-and-science-students-need-writing">1</a>, <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2019/03/02/the-importance-of-writing">2</a>, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-developers-should-know-how-to-write-dc35aa9b71ab/">3</a>, <a href="https://www.tiny.cloud/blog/developer-blog-writing-social-networks/">4</a>), I am going to boil it down to one simple reason:</p>
<p><strong>You should write to increase your level of influence.</strong></p>
<h2 id="why-influence-matters">Why Influence Matters</h2>
<p>Whether you strive to be promoted within your organization or be fawned over by the coolest tech companies, the fastest path to success is making the right people aware of you. In one of the best essays of career advice for programmers, Patrick McKenzie points out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Most jobs are never available publicly, just like most worthwhile candidates are not available publicly. Information about the position travels at approximately the speed of beer, sometimes lubricated by email.” - <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/">Patrick McKenzie, Don’t Call Yourself a Programmer</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, just being the “best” programmer around isn’t going to get you talked about in a bar (and <a href="https://blog.newrelic.com/technology/good-computer-programmer-criteria/">it’s subjective anyway</a>). Ben McCormick points out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Once somebody hits a minimum threshold of technical skill to hold a job in the industry, about 80% of their ability to succeed in Software Development is determined by their communication and people skills, not their technical abilities.” - <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2019/03/02/the-importance-of-writing">Ben McCormick</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My experience supports Patrick’s and Ben’s assertions, so now the question is, how can you become one of the people whose name comes up before a job is publicly available?</p>
<p><strong>The right people have to know you. You have to have the right kind of influence.</strong></p>
<h2 id="levels-of-writing-influence">Levels of Writing Influence</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“The difference between a tolerable programmer and a great programmer is not how many programming languages they know…It’s whether they can communicate their ideas. By persuading other people, they get leverage.” - <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/01/02/advice-for-computer-science-college-students/">Joel Spolsky</a>, Co-founder of StackOverflow</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you buy my assertion that influence is important in your career as a software developer, the next step is for me to convince you that writing will actually increase your influence. In fact, not all writing will work. The kind of writing you do will make a massive difference on the level and kind of influence you gain.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KwA6AQe.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the different levels of influence you can achieve as a software developer and the kinds of writing you need to do to achieve them.</p>
<h3 id="1-willing-participant">1. Willing Participant</h3>
<p>Participants are not influential. They don’t realize it, but they have very little control over their career and are likely to go through a period of unemployment and grueling job interviews every time they need a new job. The only writing a Willing Participant will do is what’s required of them: they’ll respond to Slack messages and emails; they’ll dutifully enter their progress report every day; they might leave a sticky note on someone’s desk (or the digital equivalent) when they want to have a protracted discussion about an issue.</p>
<p>If this is you, don’t be discouraged. We all start our careers as Willing Participants. With <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/harness-2020-state-of-developer-satisfaction-report-shows-impact-of-coronavirus-on-software-development-301119564.html">most software engineering jobs staying remote for the foreseeable future</a>, the minimum level of writing ability is likely to increase, but just checking the box isn’t going to put your name on the tip of your next boss’ tongue.</p>
<h3 id="2-organizational-teacher">2. Organizational Teacher</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Every time you find yourself following the manual instead of writing the manual, you’re avoiding the anguish and giving in to the resistance.” - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00371V91S/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Seth Godin, Linchpin</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most software engineers live in this zone. Organizational Teachers write documentation, technical specifications, style guides, testing criteria, bug reports, and internal knowledge base articles. While this gives you a little influence over how your team (and possibly some adjacent teams) does its job, it’s unlikely that anyone outside your company will hear about your work.</p>
<p>The good thing about being in this zone is that it’s a safe place to practice. Nobody’s going to berate you for your typos (at least, I hope not), and other stakeholders will review most of your writing before it’s made generally available.</p>
<p>The downside to being an Organizational Teacher is that it’s pretty much table stakes for senior engineers. You’re not going to stand out for it, and you probably won’t get your name attached to it (unless it’s buried in your commit history). Hone your writing skills as an Organizational Teacher, and once you feel more comfortable, move up the ladder.</p>
<h3 id="3-organizational-influencer">3. Organizational Influencer</h3>
<p>As you move into an (official or unofficial) leadership role, you’ll start to do more writing at the Organizational Influencer level. This writing includes setting hiring criteria, documenting tradeoffs between complex technical decisions, creating training materials, and setting budgets. These documents will be seen by people above and below your station and will help get you noticed for future promotions.</p>
<p>Many software developers assume that they <em>should not</em> attempt to contribute this kind of writing unless asked. This is incorrect.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re given a new project, you have a professional obligation to report shortcomings in the design. When you report these issues, don’t just write a Slack message, “This won’t work.” <a href="https://melsatar.blog/2017/09/23/trade-off-analysis-technique-make-the-decision-easier/">Document the tradeoffs</a> between the proposed solution and one that you’ve seen work elsewhere. Most people don’t do this because it’s hard, and that’s why they don’t have much influence.</p>
<p>Organizational Influencers are helping set the direction for at least a small part of the business, and they’ll end up doing more writing than those at the previous two levels. Software developers who make it to this level will be eligible for more internal promotions, interesting lateral moves, and a general increase in respect. Organizational Influencers will also start to gain the confidence to start writing externally.</p>
<h3 id="4-external-teacher">4. External Teacher</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Writing is hard. People spend their entire lives learning how to write effectively. It isn’t something you can fake. It isn’t something you can buy. You have to work at it.
That’s exactly why people who are afraid they can’t write should be blogging. It’s exercise.” - <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/fear-of-writing/">Jeff Atwood</a>, Co-founder of StackOverflow</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the prevalence of <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> and <a href="http://dev.to/">Dev.to</a>, surprisingly few software engineers ever write publicly. External Teachers generally start by writing technical case studies, public documentation, and walkthroughs. This is where software developers can begin to publicly display their knowledge and build a personal brand.</p>
<p>I’ll put a big caveat here and say that writing a few tutorials will not immediately make employers hunt you down. I’ve written dozens of technical tutorials over the years, and only a couple of them led directly to an employment discussion (neither of which worked out). Writing publicly is the first step in building a reputation, but more importantly, it gives you a great resource to point to when an employer asks you about a specific technical experience you’ve had.</p>
<p>The hard part about becoming an External Teacher is that it’s scary, and you’re likely to suck at first. People <a href="https://medium.com/@cinzia.dubois/the-importance-of-doing-things-youre-bad-at-4fcdd4c2fb4b">naturally avoid doing things they’re bad at</a>, but doing scary things is an essential part of gaining influence.</p>
<p>If you overcome the fear of writing publicly and you start to tell people about your writing, you’ll probably be surprised by the encouragement you get. People will root for you when you do something they’re scared to do themselves.</p>
<h3 id="5-external-influencer">5. External Influencer</h3>
<p>So few people achieve the level of External Influencer that just attempting this sort of writing puts you in a tiny, standout class of people. Unlike the External Teacher, who sticks to irrefutable facts and rehashes of existing knowledge, the External Influencer has a strong point of view. They write from deep experience, and their writing influences the decisions that others make.</p>
<p>Some of the External Influencers you’ve probably heard of include <a href="https://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a>, <a href="http://cleancoder.com/products">“Uncle” Bob Martin</a>, and <a href="https://domainlanguage.com/">Eric Evans</a>. When they write something, thousands of programmers listen, and their books have shaped decades of software architecture.</p>
<p>There are degrees to all the influence levels in this model. You don’t have to be Uncle Bob to be an External Influencer; you just need to start applying your technical experience to larger business challenges in a public forum. For example, Eric Evans created Domain-Driven Design to help businesses build better software by making it more closely resemble the underlying domain model. If you’ve spent years solving a particular set of problems, you probably have at least a few issues you could get on a soapbox about. These are likely your platform for becoming an External Influencer.</p>
<p>While it sounds great, acting like an External Influencer is even scarier than being an External Teacher. Not only does your writing have to be factually accurate and coherent, but you’re also opening your ideas to public criticism. Nobody likes to get slammed on the internet, but the upside can be huge if your work is well-received. Do you think Martin Fowler would ever have trouble getting a job if he decided to leave ThoughtWorks? I’m pretty sure he could (literally) write his own job description just about anywhere.</p>
<h2 id="write-above-your-level">Write Above Your Level</h2>
<p>By this point, I hope I’ve convinced you that influence is an important part of advancing your software development career and that writing can help you gain this influence. My final encouragement to engineers who want to become better writers is to push beyond your current level. It will be uncomfortable, but it’s also one of the best ways to take control of your career. <a href="https://twitter.com/karllhughes">Let me know if I can help</a>.</p>

        <blockquote><p>You’ve got a new application underway. You need to map out some kind of testing schedule. Here’s advice from the experts about how to do it.</p></blockquote>
<p>How do you accurately estimate how many QA engineers you need for a project? Like many of you, Karl Becker, a project team lead, was trying to calculate an answer. “We’re a small team without a dedicated QA staff—we basically just passed the QA hat around,” says Becker. “Recently, we hired a dedicated a QA person and we’re trying to figure out if we should hire more.”</p>
<p>It turns out, the most important part of Becker’s question isn’t <em>how many</em> but <em>when</em>. There’s a growing consensus about the need to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-left_testing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shift left</a> – that is, to put QA into the process much earlier.</p>
<p>“It’s an old-school mind-set that you don’t need to spend money on QA resources until the very end of a project,” says Robert Jackson, a gaming industry veteran and VP of Mobile Publishing. “That no longer works. You’ve got to budget QA resources from the <em>beginning</em> of the project and allow enough time for multiple rounds of testing.”</p>
<p>Jackson creates his product development budgets with an 80/20 ratio in mind. “If you’re <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-a-good-qa-director-and-a-great-one/">an experienced manager</a>, you should be able to accurately predict about 80% of what you’ll need before you start development,” he says. “But you’ve also got to plan for surprises, so assume 20% of your plan will change.” To accommodate this, Jackson recommends, “Plan for additional resources at ‘crunch time.’ The last thing you want is to go to upper management and say, ‘I need more resources.’”</p>
<p>Correctly budgeting for additional staff is a function of project complexity. At a bare minimum, you should have two to three full-team QA team members for any project. “At alpha build, you want at least a couple of <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/five-must-have-skills-to-look-for-in-a-qa-tester/">fully-dedicated QA resources</a> to do a complete sweep of the product and to de-bug every issue before beta,” warns Jackson, with a heavy emphasis on <em>at least</em>. Be aware as you budget that you may need to add specialists to your team before release, such as software/hardware compatibility testers and <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-difference-between-load-testing-stress-testing/">load testers</a>.</p>
<p>For a complex project, Jackson suggests you begin with a ballpark figure that you need at least one QA person for every six developers. That’s true especially if the project is going to take over a year to develop and it includes extensive database or back-end communication.</p>
<h3>Start QA staffing early in the schedule</h3>
<p>It is essential that QA is an integral part of development from the beginning, not just a proofreading step at the end. “The more QA is involved, the better your product is,” says Jackson. “Fixing issues in the final two weeks of development just doesn’t work. More often than not, the project will be coming in ‘hot,’ so make sure you plan for additional resources at the end of the development.”</p>
<p>To that end, Jackson strongly recommends assigning a QA lead to attend the very first development meeting and to continue as an integral part of the regular review process. “The earlier in the process you start QA, the more knowledgeable your QA team is. You want them to become as expert on your project as the designers. This way, they’ll know what resources they’ll need at each stage of the development process.”</p>
<p>There is one key requirement for this QA lead, according to Jackson: Don’t pick someone who’s too junior. Instead, he encourages managers to look at this role as an opportunity to grow new leaders. “Find someone who is creative, enthusiastic, and has good communication skills but is also senior enough to assess the landscape of the project—put them in that first developer’s meeting, mentor them, and let them thrive.”</p>
<h3>Quantify needs for upper management</h3>
<p>Obviously, one clue you need to add more QA staff is that they’re so overworked that they threaten to quit – or they do. But before it comes to that, is there a more quantified way to anticipate future needs?</p>
<p>To paraphrase <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9ojK9Q_ARE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em></a>, “The [answer] is more like guidelines than actual rules.” So welcome aboard the Black Pearl, as we attempt to give you some metrics.</p>
<p>First, to reassure you that you’re not alone: Two years ago, the Consortium for IT Software Quality (CISQ) published a 44-page report on <a href="https://www.it-cisq.org/the-cost-of-poor-quality-software-in-the-us-a-2018-report/The-Cost-of-Poor-Quality-Software-in-the-US-2018-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cost of Poor Quality Software</a>. As the report states:</p>
<blockquote><p>“On average, software developers make 100 to 150 errors for every thousand lines of code…. Even if only a small fraction—say 10 percent—of these errors are serious, then a relatively small application of 20,000 lines of code will have roughly 200 serious coding errors.”</p></blockquote>
<p>However, that estimate is based on a textbook written in 1996. There have been <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2898571/basis-for-claim-that-the-number-of-bugs-per-line-of-code-is-constant-regardless" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other estimates</a>, some of which put the error rate down as low as 1/1000. Nevertheless, most of those estimates are also based on work done over a decade ago.</p>
<p>The ideal approach is to look at similar projects in your own company to understand your team’s error rates, which is why it’s important to document results. If no comparable projects exist, discretely ask around. Obviously, there’s a limit to how helpful people are willing to be—you’re not going to call up your biggest competitor and say, “Hey, we’re also working on a dating app.” But if you dig through trade articles and online forums, you can likely fill in some reasonable numbers.</p>
<p>So far we’ve discussed one metric: What’s it going to take to get the product out the door? But <a href="https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/professionals/marc-s-martin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marc S. Martin, a partner at Perkins-Coie</a> suggests an even more important metric to consider: <em>What’s the worst thing your product can do to the end-user?</em></p>
<p>Set a target error rate <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/what-testers-should-know-about-domain-knowledge/">based on the criticality of the product</a>. “A line of code driving a pacemaker is different from keeping your calendar, so a standard can and <em>should</em> vary,” says Martin.</p>
<p>Ask yourself questions like these: If we screw up, can someone die? If we screw up, can someone lose their home? If we screw up, will someone be behind on all their bills and unable to eat? If we screw up, will we trigger a class action lawsuit that will bankrupt the company? These may not be questions you can answer by yourself; they may require discussions with upper management or even your legal counsel.</p>
<p>Once everyone’s signed off on the target error rate, you can create your own algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on similar projects, this project will require <em>~n</em> lines of code.</li>
<li>Based on similar teams, the error rate is likely to be <em>~n</em>/per 1000 lines.</li>
<li>Based on similar projects, our senior QA engineers catch <em>~n</em> errors in an eight-hour workday. (Remember the rate drops if they go into heavy overtime.)</li>
<li>Based on similar projects, our junior QA engineers catch <em>~n</em> errors in an 8-hour workday. (Again, the rate drops if they go into heavy overtime.)</li>
<li>This project can tolerate no more than <em>n</em>% error rate.</li>
<li>This project is budgeted to take no more than <em>~n</em></li>
<li>Therefore, we need <em>at a minimum n</em> senior staff and <em>n</em> junior staff. Ideally, we should have<em> n</em>+.</li>
</ul>
<p>Naturally, there’s going to be a lot of guesstimating. Still, at least it quantifies <em>something</em>, so you can go to senior management and say, “At a rough estimate, based on similar projects, we’re looking at 700 serious errors. You’ve only given me the resources to catch 400 of them before we release. Are you comfortable with that?”</p>
<p>Fight hard for your staff. Writing in <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3130217/the-era-of-nine-digit-defects.html">InfoWorld</a>, Dr. Bill Curtis, CISQ executive director, summed up what’s at stake for upper management: “When losses from IT malfunctions hit 5 or 6 digits, IT managers are at risk. When losses hit 7 or 8 digits, IT and line-of-business executives are at risk. When losses hit 9 digits C-Level jobs are at risk.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Everyone fears legacy systems; it’s like pulling a rogue thread on an old sweater that’s apt to unravel. But the longer you leave legacy software alone, the worse the situation becomes. As <a href="https://www.functionize.com/project/the-true-cost-of-legacy-testing/">this white paper demonstrates</a>, Functionize can help.</p></blockquote>

                    <p><em>Working as a core maintainer for <a href="https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning">PyTorch Lightning</a>, I've grown a strong appreciation for the value of tests in software development. As I've been spinning up a new project at work, I've been spending a fair amount of time thinking about how we should test machine learning systems. A couple weeks ago, one of my coworkers sent me <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/acl20_checklist.pdf">a fascinating paper</a> on the topic which inspired me to dig in, collect my thoughts, and write this blog post.</em> </p><p>In this blog post, we'll cover what testing looks like for traditional software development, why testing machine learning systems can be different, and discuss some strategies for writing effective tests for machine learning systems. We'll also clarify the distinction between the closely related roles of evaluation and testing as part of the model development process. By the end of this blog post, I hope you're convinced of both the extra work required to effectively test machine learning systems and the value of doing such work.</p><h2 id="what-s-different-about-testing-machine-learning-systems">What's different about testing machine learning systems?</h2><p>In traditional software systems, humans write the logic which interacts with data to produce a desired behavior. Our software tests help ensure that this <strong>written logic</strong> aligns with the actual expected behavior.</p><figure><img src="https://www.jeremyjordan.me/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-09-at-4.45.29-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.jeremyjordan.me/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-09-at-4.45.29-PM.png 600w, https://www.jeremyjordan.me/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-09-at-4.45.29-PM.png 1000w, https://www.jeremyjordan.me/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-09-at-4.45.29-PM.png 1600w, https://www.jeremyjordan.me/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-09-at-4.45.29-PM.png 1850w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>However, in machine learning systems, humans provide desired behavior as examples during training and the model optimization process produces the logic of the system. How do we ensure this <strong>learned logic</strong> is going to consistently produce our desired behavior?</p><figure><img src="https://www.jeremyjordan.me/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-09-at-4.47.06-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.jeremyjordan.me/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-09-at-4.47.06-PM.png 600w, https://www.jeremyjordan.me/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-09-at-4.47.06-PM.png 1000w, https://www.jeremyjordan.me/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-09-at-4.47.06-PM.png 1600w, https://www.jeremyjordan.me/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-09-at-4.47.06-PM.png 1850w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Let's start by looking at the best practices for testing traditional software systems and developing high-quality software. </p><p>A typical software testing suite will include:</p><ul><li><strong>unit tests</strong> which operate on atomic pieces of the codebase and can be run quickly during development,</li><li><strong>regression tests</strong> replicate bugs that we've previously encountered and fixed,</li><li><strong>integration tests</strong> which are typically longer-running tests that observe higher-level behaviors that leverage multiple components in the codebase,</li></ul><p>and follow conventions such as:</p><ul><li>don't merge code unless all tests are passing,</li><li>always write tests for newly introduced logic when contributing code,</li><li>when contributing a bug fix, be sure to write a test to capture the bug and prevent future regressions.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.jeremyjordan.me/content/images/2020/08/Group-5-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.jeremyjordan.me/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Group-5-1.jpg 600w, https://www.jeremyjordan.me/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Group-5-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.jeremyjordan.me/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Group-5-1.jpg 1600w, https://www.jeremyjordan.me/content/images/2020/08/Group-5-1.jpg 2348w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A typical workflow for software development.</figcaption></figure><p>When we run our testing suite against the new code, we'll get a report of the specific behaviors that we've written tests around and verify that our code changes don't affect the expected behavior of the system. If a test fails, we'll know which specific behavior is no longer aligned with our expected output. We can also look at this testing report to get an understanding of how extensive our tests are by looking at metrics such as <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage">code coverage</a></strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://www.jeremyjordan.me/content/images/2020/08/Group-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.jeremyjordan.me/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Group-1.png 600w, https://www.jeremyjordan.me/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Group-1.png 1000w, https://www.jeremyjordan.me/content/images/2020/08/Group-1.png 1149w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>An example output from a traditional software testing suite.</figcaption></figure><p>Let's contrast this with a typical workflow for developing machine learning systems. After training a new model, we'll typically produce an evaluation report including:</p><ul><li>performance of an established metric on a validation dataset,</li><li>plots such as precision-recall curves,</li><li>operational statistics such as inference speed,</li><li>examples where the model was most confidently incorrect,</li></ul><p>and follow conventions such as:</p><ul><li>save all of the hyper-parameters used to train the model,</li><li>only promote models which offer an improvement over the existing model (or baseline) when evaluated on the same dataset. </li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.jeremyjordan.me/content/images/2020/08/Group-3-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.jeremyjordan.me/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Group-3-1.png 600w, https://www.jeremyjordan.me/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Group-3-1.png 1000w, https://www.jeremyjordan.me/content/images/2020/08/Group-3-1.png 1174w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A typical workflow for model development.</figcaption></figure><p>When reviewing a new machine learning model, we'll inspect metrics and plots which summarize model performance over a validation dataset. We're able to compare performance between multiple models and make relative judgements, but we're not immediately able to characterize specific model behaviors. For example, figuring out <em>where</em> the model is failing usually requires additional investigative work; one common practice here is to look through a list of the top most egregious model errors on the validation dataset and manually categorize these failure modes.</p><p>Assuming we write behavioral tests for our models (discussed below), there's also the question of whether or not we have enough tests! While traditional software tests have metrics such as the lines of code covered when running tests, this becomes harder to quantify when you shift your application logic from lines of code to parameters of a machine learning model. Do we want to quantify our test coverage with respect to the input data distribution? Or perhaps the possible activations inside the model?</p><p><a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/odena19a/odena19a.pdf">Odena et al</a>. introduce one possible metric for coverage where we track the model logits for all of the test examples and quantify the area covered by radial neighborhoods around these activation vectors. However, my perception is that as an industry we don't have a well-established convention here. In fact, it feels like that testing for machine learning systems is in such early days that this question of test coverage isn't really being asked by many people.</p><h2 id="what-s-the-difference-between-model-testing-and-model-evaluation">What's the difference between model testing and model evaluation?</h2><p>While reporting evaluation metrics is certainly a good practice for quality assurance during model development, I don't think it's sufficient. Without a granular report of specific behaviors, we won't be able to immediately understand the nuance of how behavior may change if we switch over to the new model. Additionally, we won't be able to track (and prevent) behavioral regressions for specific failure modes that had been previously addressed.</p><p>This can be especially dangerous for machine learning systems since often times failures happen silently. For example, you might improve the overall evaluation metric but introduce a regression on a critical subset of data. Or you could unknowingly add a gender bias to the model through the inclusion of a new dataset during training. We need more nuanced reports of model behavior to identify such cases, which is exactly where model testing can help.</p><p>For machine learning systems, we should be running model evaluation and model tests in parallel. </p><ul><li><strong>Model evaluation</strong> covers metrics and plots which summarize performance on a validation or test dataset.</li><li><strong>Model testing</strong> involves explicit checks for behaviors that we expect our model to follow.</li></ul><p>Both of these perspectives are instrumental in building high-quality models. </p><p>In practice, most people are doing a combination of the two where evaluation metrics are calculated automatically and some level of model "testing" is done <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/GwViP/carrying-out-error-analysis">manually through error analysis</a> (i.e. classifying failure modes). Developing model tests for machine learning systems can offer a systematic approach towards error analysis.</p><h2 id="how-do-you-write-model-tests">How do you write model tests?</h2><p>In my opinion, there's two general classes of model tests that we'll want to write.</p><ul><li><strong>Pre-train</strong> <strong>tests</strong> allow us to identify some bugs early on and short-circuit a training job.</li><li><strong>Post-train tests</strong> use the trained model artifact to inspect behaviors for a variety of important scenarios that we define.</li></ul><h3 id="pre-train-tests">Pre-train tests</h3><p>There's some tests that we can run without needing trained parameters. These tests include:</p><ul><li>check the shape of your model output and ensure it aligns with the labels in your dataset</li><li>check the output ranges and ensure it aligns with our expectations (eg. the output of a classification model should be a distribution with class probabilities that sum to 1)</li><li>make sure a single gradient step on a batch of data yields a decrease in your loss</li><li>make <a href="https://greatexpectations.io/">assertions about your datasets</a></li><li>check for label leakage between your training and validation datasets</li></ul><p>The main goal here is to identify some errors early so we can avoid a wasted training job.</p><h3 id="post-train-tests">Post-train tests</h3><p>However, in order for us to be able to understand model behaviors we'll need to test against trained model artifacts. These tests aim to <strong>interrogate the logic learned during training</strong> and provide us with a behavioral report of model performance.</p><blockquote><strong>Paper highlight</strong>: <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/acl20_checklist.pdf">Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList</a></blockquote><p>The authors of the above paper present three different types of model tests that we can use to understand behavioral attributes. </p><p><strong>Invariance Tests</strong></p><p>Invariance tests allow us to describe a set of perturbations we should be able to make to the input <em>without</em> affecting the model's output. We can use these perturbations to produce pairs of input examples (original and perturbed) and <strong>check for consistency</strong> in the model predictions. This is closely related to the concept of data augmentation, where we apply perturbations to inputs during training and preserve the original label. </p><p>For example, imagine running a sentiment analysis model on the following two sentences:</p><ul><li><u>Mark</u> was a great instructor.</li><li><u>Samantha</u> was a great instructor.</li></ul><p>We would expect that simply changing the name of the subject doesn't affect the model predictions. </p><p><strong>Directional Expectation Tests</strong></p><p>Directional expectation tests, on the other hand, allow us to define a set of perturbations to the input which <em>should</em> have a <em>predictable</em> effect on the model output. </p><p>For example, if we had a housing price prediction model we might assert:</p><ul><li>Increasing the number of bathrooms (holding all other features constant) should not cause a drop in price.</li><li>Lowering the square footage of the house (holding all other features constant) should not cause an increase in price.</li></ul><p>Let's consider a scenario where a model fails the second test - taking a random row from our validation dataset and decreasing the feature <code>house_sq_ft</code> yields a higher predicted price than the original label. This is surprising as it doesn't match our intuition, so we decide to look further into it. We realize that, without having a feature for the house's neighborhood/location, our model has learned that smaller units tend to be more expensive; this is due to the fact that smaller units from our dataset are more prevalent in cities where prices are generally higher. In this case, the <em>selection</em> of our dataset has influenced the model's logic in unintended ways - this isn't something …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/>
August 31, 2020 | https://www.ecorax.net/as-above-so-below-2/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ecorax.net/as-above-so-below-2/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>During <a href="https://www.ecorax.net/as-above-so-below-1/">last episode</a>, we went on a tour of the
pleasantly boring world of flash memory, drafted some driver interfaces, and
toyed with the idea of generics at both levels of crate visibility. What's
conspicuously absent is, well, <em>working code.</em> It's one thing to lay down data
structures, and another entirely to weave generics between the raw ones and
zeros of bare metal firmware. Today we'll gaze long into the void*, and,
hopefully, the void* won't gaze back into us.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.ecorax.net/as-above-so-below-1/#what-is-flash-memory">section about flash
memory</a> we
explored, with the help of a dodgy analogy, how it's possible to directly
overwrite a <code>1</code> with a <code>0</code> but not the reverse. This quirk is what makes
writing efficient flash writers a bit tricky. When asked to write over a memory
range, a naive driver would simply erase every sector overlapped by it, then
write back the original data "merged" with the desired bytes. We want our driver
a bit smarter than that; it should first check whether it's possible to write
the bytes directly. In other words, we want to ensure that every <code>1</code> in our
intended write is also a <code>1</code> in the target space.</p>
<pre><code><span>pub trait </span><span>BitSubset {
    </span><span>/// Check that every '1' bit is a '1' on the right hand side.
</span><span>    </span><span>fn </span><span>is_subset_of</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>rhs</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Self</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>bool</span><span>;
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>That looks like a straightforward, simple trait to express the condition we want
to check. Here comes the unnecessary part: We're going to implement it
generically. Let's be honest, we <em>both</em> know we want to implement this for
<code>[u8]</code>. There shouldn't be much use for it other than slices of bytes. However,
doing it this way will help flex our generic muscles and illustrate a couple of
important points.</p>
<pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;T: </span><span>Copy </span><span>+ </span><span>Eq </span><span>+ </span><span>BitOr&lt;Output=T&gt;&gt; BitSubset </span><span>for</span><span> [T] {
    </span><span>fn </span><span>is_subset_of</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>rhs</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Self</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>bool </span><span>{
        </span><span>if </span><span>self.</span><span>len</span><span>() </span><span>&gt;</span><span> rhs.</span><span>len</span><span>() {
            </span><span>false
        </span><span>} </span><span>else </span><span>{
            self.</span><span>iter</span><span>().</span><span>zip</span><span>(rhs.</span><span>iter</span><span>()).</span><span>all</span><span>(|(</span><span>a</span><span>, </span><span>b</span><span>)| (</span><span>*</span><span>a </span><span>| *</span><span>b) </span><span>== *</span><span>b)
        }
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Yes, I feel that dread too. There are enough sigils up there to summon half
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lesser_Key_of_Solomon">Lesser Key of
Solomon</a>. We have
<strong>five</strong> types of brackets (<code>&lt;(|[{</code>) and we're barely getting started.
Fortunately symbols are much like ant invasions—live with them long enough and
you'll stop noticing. They can even be endearing.</p>
<p>When I started playing with Rust generics a few years ago, it often helped me to
approach functions by parts; focusing first on the constraints, moving to
the implementation only when I've painted a clear picture of the elements involved.
I find there's a bit of ritual in deciphering constraints, not unlike the
infamous <a href="http://c-faq.com/decl/spiral.anderson.html">spiral rule</a> for C
declarations. For me, it takes the form of describing them in a
manner of plain English pseudocode. For the above it would look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have <em>something</em> that can be copied and compared.</li>
<li>It can be bitwise or'd with itself.</li>
<li>We are implementing over an array of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more complex lists I'd sing these conditions in my head a few times until
the abstract types coalesce into something more manageable, at which point it
becomes possible to push the sigil soup away and focus on behaviour.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>All</strong> the behaviour of these type parameters is summarized in these
constraints. Nothing is implicit. That's <em>very cool</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, all that's left is a bit of iterator magic and bit wrangling.
<code>self.iter().zip(rhs.iter()).all(Condition)</code> "zips" two iterators together in
pairs, then verifies that every pair satisfies a condition. In our case the
condition is the closure <code>|(a, b)| (*a | *b) == *b</code>. For the condition to hold,
all <code>1</code> bits in element <code>*a</code> must also be <code>1</code> in <code>*b</code>.</p>
<p>We'll use this later to compare, as we anticipated, slices of bytes. What have
we gained from doing it generically?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Even though <code>T: Copy + Eq + BitOr&lt;Output=T&gt;</code> is certainly a lot wordier
than <code>u8</code>, it's also <strong>purer</strong> in some sense, because it more accurately
summarizes what we care about. Weirdly,
the shorter <code>u8</code> carries a lot more extraneous, distracting baggage:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is 8 bits long, which is a hardware detail we don't care about.</li>
<li>It is unsigned, which is a mathematical detail we don't care about.</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, our platonic <code>T</code> is refreshingly simple: only does the things
that the implementation needs. And as such, the implementation <em>will be
correct now and forever after</em>, which leads to the next point:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When our constraints match the requirements of the implementation so tightly,
we can resort to blanket implementations, knowing that future users will opt
into this behaviour automatically if they define a type that matches these
requirements. Crates like the impressively elegant
<a href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy</a> take this idea further, using their prelude to
bring blanket implementations over a wide range of types without exposing the
user to the trait. This leads, I think, to very ergonomic APIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not that we'd have any reason to suspect otherwise, but the
<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5abac4">concrete</a> and
<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/nxMW57">generic</a> versions produce identical assembly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We've increased our sigil count, getting closer to summoning
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimaris">Kimaris</a>, Marquis of Hell, ruler of 20
demonic legions, teacher of grammar, logic and rhetoric. Maybe he'll finally
produce an intuitive definition of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)">monad</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>At <a href="https://www.ecorax.net/as-above-so-below-1/#taking-a-step-back">the end of the last
entry</a>, we sketched out the
constraints on our minimal concept of address and region:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub trait </span><span>Address: Ord + Copy + Add&lt;usize, Output = Self&gt; {}
</span><span>pub trait </span><span>Region&lt;A: Address&gt; {
    </span><span>fn </span><span>contains</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>address</span><span>: A) -&gt; </span><span>bool</span><span>;
}
</span></code></pre>
<p><em>But cuervo</em>, you ask, <em>that's not how it looked like last week. You added an</em>
<code>Add</code> <em>constraint.</em> Okay, hypothetical attentive reader, you got me. I may have
forgotten to copy that as I was curating the code examples. Yes, the
<code>core::ops::Add</code> bound will be necessary, as we'll see in a bit. This gives us
an excuse to sing the generics song, which works just as well for supertrait
definitons:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <code>Address</code> is <em>something</em> that can be sorted and copied. It can be added
together with an offset, yielding another address.</li>
<li>A <code>Region</code> is <em>something</em> that may contain an address.</li>
</ul>
<p>What can we build with this? We know that one of the goals of our flash driver
is to smartly negotiate the different write and erase granularities, so that for
any given buffer write, only the required regions are erased. In order to do
this, there's a requirement we can accurately summarize in this way:</p>
<p><strong>For a buffer of given length, and for a base address in the target memory map,
we need to relate each buffer segment to every region it overlaps with.</strong></p>
<p>Here rendered through the power of ASCII:</p>
<pre><code><span>0    5    10   15   20   25   30   35
-----|ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo|------ : Buffer of length 30 at address 5
----------|====|====|====|====|----------- : Four regions of length 5 at address 10
</span></code></pre>
<p>Given the two inputs above, we need to produce the following four views into the
buffer:</p>
<pre><code><span>
0    5      10      15      20      25      30   35
-----|ooooo [ooooo] [ooooo] [ooooo] [ooooo] ooooo|-----
             view1   view2   view3   view4
</span></code></pre>
<p>Our goal in this section is to <em>define such operation generically</em>, and
<em>implement it generically</em>, in such a way that it will work with
last week's sectors, subsectors and pages from both drivers.</p>
<p>Now, if you're allergic to symbols, be warned: Here be dragons. Henceforth be
dragon turtles, all the way down. We are about to reach <em>ancient Egyptian
shopping in <a href="https://www.ecorax.net/as-above-so-below-2/akihabara.jpeg">Akihabara</a></em> levels of symbol overload. Believe me
that after some time none of them will feel superfluous or overwrought. As
with human language, precise definitions lead to better understanding.</p>
<p>Okay, let's take a deep breath.</p>
<pre><code><span>/// Iterator producing block-region pairs,
/// where each memory block maps to each region
</span><span>pub struct </span><span>OverlapIterator&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>, A, R, I&gt;
where
    A: Address,
    R: Region&lt;A&gt;,
    I: Iterator&lt;Item = R&gt;,
{
    memory: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span><span> [</span><span>u8</span><span>],
    regions: I,
    base_address: A,
}

</span><span>pub trait </span><span>IterableByOverlaps&lt;'a, A, R, I&gt;
where
    A: Address,
    R: Region&lt;A&gt;,
    I: Iterator&lt;Item = R&gt;,
{
    </span><span>fn </span><span>overlaps</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>block</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span><span> [</span><span>u8</span><span>], </span><span>base_address</span><span>: A) -&gt; OverlapIterator&lt;A, R, I&gt;;
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Hmm. Not too bad thus far. We have the tools necessary to break down the <em>where</em>
clause, which is identical for both the struct and the trait. We are dealing
with:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Some</em> address <code>A</code>.</li>
<li><em>Some</em> region <code>R</code> which contains such addresses.</li>
<li><em>Some</em> iterator <code>I</code> that yields such regions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The explicit lifetime, a requisite of all structs containing references, simply
denotes that the <code>memory</code> field is a reference to data stored elsewhere, and
guarantees said data will exist <strong>at least</strong> as long as our struct.</p>
<p>What we've defined above is an iterator struct, and a trait for types that can
be iterated in a certain way. If you come from C, iterators can be a bit of a
mind bender. They <em>feel</em> heavy, but ultimately they're very
simple. I like to think of iterator structs as bookmarks for physical books;
progress trackers with just enough state to find your position in a sequence.</p>
<p>Looking at our iterator struct above, we see we can track our progress through
the inner <code>regions</code> iterator, until we run out of regions. We also have a means
of producing this kind of iterator—the <code>overlaps</code> function in the
<code>IterableByOverlaps</code> trait—so all that's left is to define the <em>rules</em> of
iteration. The implementation I'm going to show you can do with some manual
optimization, and indeed it doesn't look exactly like this in the final
<code>Loadstone</code> code. I went with the slightly more readable option to better
illustrate the points in this article.</p>
<pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>, A, R, I&gt; Iterator </span><span>for </span><span>OverlapIterator&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>, A, R, I&gt;

The vast majority of new ideas, product launches and startups fail. So how do you make sure that yours doesn’t? That your idea is not just another failure, but instead is: ‘The Right It’?</p><p>In the book <a onmouseout="al_link_out()" onmouseover="al_gen_multi(1568555191, {uk : 'A-0062884654',us : 'A-0062884654',de : 'A-0062884654',es : 'A-0062884654',fr : 'A-0062884654',jp : 'A-0062884654',it : 'A-0062884654',ca : 'A-0062884654'}, 'us', 'default');" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062884654?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=6738&amp;tag=unrestricte0c-20&amp;creativeASIN=0062884654&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAJN4DM242BQEL6DFQ">The Right It — Why So Many Ideas Fail and How to Make Sure Yours Succeed</a>, Alberto Savoia covers exactly that. A former director of engineering and Innovation Agitator at Google, Savoia has conducted a lot of research into what makes ideas work. The result is his book, which covers <strong>the processes you should use to determine whether your idea is a winning one — or is another failure</strong>.</p><p>The book is a superb starting point for starting entrepreneurs and anyone who wants to test an idea. So if you’re currently working on an idea for a product or service, and want to test it first before spending tremendous amounts of time and money in making it work, <strong>read a summary and book review of The Right It below</strong>.</p><h2>Highlights of The Right It</h2><p>The Right It starts with the idea that most startups are doomed to fail; something that Sevoia calls the Law of Market Failure. If you can find that one idea that actually works — that isn’t doomed to fail from the start — then that’s The Right It.</p><p>So how do you determine whether your idea is The Right It? By going through 4 different steps:</p><ol><li>Navigating Thoughtland</li><li>Creating hypotheses</li><li>Setting up a Pretotype, and acquiring YODA (Your Own DAta)</li><li>Using The Right It Meter to determine whether your idea is The Right It</li></ol><h3>Navigating Thoughtland</h3><p>Perhaps one of the most important concepts in The Right It is Thoughtland. Thoughtland is the place where only thoughts count.</p><p>At first, as an entrepreneur, you THINK that you have a great idea. And you THINK that your target group will buy your product.</p><p>So to test this, perhaps you run some qualitative research. You send a survey to your parents or even your ideal target group, and you get the results. Perhaps your target group indicated that you have a great idea on your hands. Your product is superb, and they will definitely buy it once you release it.</p><p><strong>The problem with this research, is that we’re all still in Thoughtland</strong>. You’ve shared your product idea — not much more than a collection of thoughts — and people responded to your survey with a collection of their thoughts. But according to Savoia:</p><blockquote><p>You cannot determine if an idea is The Right It just through thinking. Not through your thoughts — not through the thoughts and opinions of others. [Not even] through the thoughts of ‘experts’.</p></blockquote><p>Rather, to truly determine whether your idea is The Right It, you have to get YODA to help you: Your Own Data.</p><p>Instead of using someone else’s market research, opinions, or success in the market, <strong>you can only test whether you have the right it if you gather data yourself. You have to get Your Own DAta</strong>.</p><p>So how do you do get YODA to help out?</p><h3>Hypothesizing and Hypozooming</h3><p>According to Sevoia, the first step is making a clear and specific Market Engagagement Hypothesis or MEH. <strong>The Market Engagement Hypothesis identifies the key belief or assumption about how the market will engage with your product or idea</strong>.</p><p>So how does it work? Well, let’s take an example. Suppose you want to sell socks with different logos of cryptocurrencies: CryptoSocks. Why would people buy from you?</p><p>Perhaps your hypothesis is: If we put cryptocurrency logo’s on socks and make them as colorful as Happy Socks, many people who own cryptocurrencies are willing to buy socks with their favorite cryptocurrency logo on it.</p><p>This sounds pretty good, but it’s not very specific yet. So after creating this initial hypothesis, the next step is to create a so-called <strong>XYZ Hypothesis: At least X% of Y will Z.</strong></p><p>In this case, perhaps we hypothesize that at least 5% of all cryptocurrency owners will want to buy CryptoSocks.</p><p>A third step, is to take this XYZ Hypothesis further and <em>hypozoom</em> (yes, the author is quite a fan of creating his own words). With hypozooming, Sevoia means to say that you create an even more specific and zoomed-in hypothesis that you can test <em><strong>right now</strong></em><em>.</em></p><p>For instance, we could say that at least 5% of cryptocurrency owners in my hometown Utrecht, will want to pay €5 for a pair of CryptoSocks. With this zoomed-in (or <em>hypozoomed</em>) Market Engagement Hypothesis, I can actually start gathering data and find out whether CryptoSocks are a good idea or not.</p><h3>No MVPs, no Prototyping — But Pretotyping</h3><p>So, how do you do this? Well, with a&nbsp;<em>pretotype</em>. Another made-up word, a pretotype is not the same as an MVP or prototype. Rather than being functional (as an MVP often is) or a catch-all concept (as a prototype is), a pretotype is a fake or mocked-up version of your intended product or service.</p><p><strong>The goal of any pretotype is to validate quickly whether it’s worth it to pursue your product or service idea</strong>. So let’s apply that to our CryptoSocks.</p><p>In software development, it is quite common to whip up a landing page for a product without actually selling that product. For instance, I could create an online page for our Cryptosocks, with one ‘buy button’ for everyone’s favorite: Bitcoin socks.</p><p>I would then send an email with the link to the page to all cryptocurrency owners in Utrecht I know — and see how many percent of those (that visit the page) actually press the ‘Buy Now’ button.</p><p>This is an example of a Fake Door pretotype which in software is often called a <em>Smoke Test</em>. Importantly, running this experiment would give me data that I created myself — Your Own Data!</p><p>The next step is to evaluate this data, and finally determine whether CryptoSocks are The Right It. But before we do that, let’s discuss some other examples of Pretotypes.</p><h4>Examples of Pretotypes</h4><p>This Fake Door is just one example of a Pretotype; there are many others. The idea of a Pretotype is always to test your (hypozoomed) hypothesis in a quick-and-dirty way, to validate whether you’re building The Right It.</p><p>Consider for instance these Pretotype Examples:</p><ul><li>The One-Night Stand Pretotype (offer something very briefly – e.g. Airbnb founders renting out an air mattress for the night)</li><li>The Infiltrator Pretotype (place your product in someone else’s sales environment – e.g. leave a kitchen utensil in IKEA and see how many people buy it)</li><li>The Relabel Pretotype (put a different label on an existing product and put it in front of a user – e.g. a fake book cover)</li><li>The Live Demo Pretotype (give users a live-but-fake demo of your product/service)</li><li>The Morsel Pretotype (provide a sample of the full product, e.g. a sample chapter of a book)</li></ul><p>But there are many more such as the Mechanical Turk Pretotype, the Pinocchio Pretotype, the Fake Door Pretotype, the Facade Pretotype, and the YouTube Pretotype.</p><p>On his website, Savoia provides an interesting <a href="https://www.albertosavoia.com/uploads/1/4/0/9/14099067/pretotyping_quick_reference_for_stanford_ms_e_277.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overview of more examples</a>.</p><h3>The Right It (TRI) Meter</h3><p>So with that in mind, let’s move to the last step. After creating the pretotype and running the test, <strong>how do you determine whether your idea is actually something worth investing more time and money in?</strong></p><p>We use the TRI Meter. <strong>The Right It Meter is a tool used to interpret your data as objectively as possible</strong>. Specifically, it consists of different boxes, each with a ‘likelihood of success’ for your idea to beat the Law of Market Failure.</p><p><img src="https://jochemgerritsen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Right-It-Meter.jpg" alt="The Right It Meter" width="300" height="301" srcset="https://jochemgerritsen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Right-It-Meter.jpg 300w, https://jochemgerritsen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Right-It-Meter-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20300%20301'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://jochemgerritsen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Right-It-Meter.jpg 300w, https://jochemgerritsen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Right-It-Meter-150x150.jpg 150w" data-lazy-src="https://jochemgerritsen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Right-It-Meter.jpg"></p><p>Let’s go back to our CryptoSocks. We hypothesized that 5% of cryptocurrency owners in the town of Utrecht, will want to pay €5 for a pair of CryptoSocks. Suppose we created our pretotype and have our data.</p><p>In the end, we find that only 1% of people who landed on our page pressed the buy button. Now we ask ourselves: If only 1% of cryptocurrency owners (in Utrecht) want to buy our socks, how likely is it that our idea is The Right It?&nbsp;On that basis, you point an arrow to the right box in the TRI Meter.</p><p>In the case of CryptoSocks, I think ‘Unlikely’ or a 30% chance is fair.</p><p>But it doesn’t stop here! <strong>You need to run a few experiments to really determine whether your idea is an investment worth making</strong>. Preferably, we tweak our idea a little bit (perhaps we create ‘TechSocks’ rather than CryptoSocks), create a new pretotype, and run a new experiment.</p><p>If all goes well, you can keep running experiments, tweaking and <em>pivoting</em> (in Lean Startup terms) until you’ve added several ideas to the ‘Very Likely’ box. <strong>Then, you truly know that the idea you have is The Right It</strong>.</p><h2>Applying the Lessons of The Right It</h2><p>Considering this summary of the book and all these pretotypes, there’s a lot to take in. So how do you apply the lessons of The Right It?</p><p>Actually, <strong>if you use the above steps, you’ve applied all the major lessons of this book</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>First</strong>, create a Market Engagement Hypothesis, then hypozoom, and create an XYZ hypothesis that is specific and measurable.</li><li><strong>Second</strong>, consider different types of pretotypes, as discussed above.

            <section>
            <div>
                <div><p>“You sound like a 17-year-old teenager looking at the world and feeling insecure about what he wants to do with his life!” my friend Matthias exclaimed to me in a most affectionate tone as I was feebly talking about this and that and mostly about how I couldn’t figure out what I wanted to do or even how I felt.</p>
<p>Time and again I’ve come to find one of my most hated states of all: <b>when I feel unsure and insecure about myself in my own body</b>. It’s most cunning and often affects me over days and sometimes weeks. Mainly because I struggle to name it and to include it in my range of acceptable human experiences and as a part of my existence. So I end up walking around feeling insecure and unsure without being able to recognize it. That’s doubly taxing to my nervous system.</p>
<p>When my friend pointed it out in that phone call, I immediately relaxed and felt a sense of peace. Oh yeah, insecurity! As much as I don’t like that state and have shame, disgust, and anger when it comes up, as well as all kinds of stories and ideas around how it’s not a good thing to feel insecure, something shifted. Naming it was like the beginning of releasing a bondage rope wrapped around my chest and belly.</p>
<p>On top of that comes another layer of shame that through my profession as a coach and with my experience in meditation and other kinds of healing and wellbeing modalities, this shouldn’t happen to me in the way that it does.</p>
<h2><b>The vulnerability of insecurity</b></h2>
<p>There’s been a powerful shift I see many people go through of leaning more into our vulnerability in recent years around different feelings and experiences. Yet, I find that the vulnerability around feeling insecure is a double-whammy:</p>
<ul>
<li>It first requires us to be in touch with our true selves: the experience of being vulnerable</li>
<li>And then to recognize that the thing that is there is a shaky, uneasy, quivery experience of ourselves, which is an extra layer of vulnerable yet again.</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems natural that our brains have built protection around us going into this two-fold level of vulnerability. It already screams “It’s not safe!” from far away. And staying from being in touch with those experiences seems like a safer, easier option. But only on the surface!</p>
<p>As long as we don’t find the courage or the space to go into our experience, it will continue to drive us from the unconscious. Our choice lies in the naming and feeling of it, to be freed from its bonds, not in the choice of having it or not.</p>
<h2><b>The unsure CEO</b></h2>
<p>What I can’t do for myself, I sometimes find a lot easier to support other people with. D’uh! We often teach what we ourselves struggle with and need to learn the most a coach I’ve learned a lot from tells me.</p>
<p>And on a number of occasions I’ve introduced my clients to the concept of “the unsure CEO”. At first, this is deeply terrifying and goes against everything they’ve read or heard about how a CEO should act. And yet, it’s such a striking counter-archetype. Simply imagining what an unsure CEO would look and feel like if she accepted herself can bring a lot of resolution.</p>
<p>Most of my clients that have included the unsure CEO as a part of their persona toolkit have reported that it has brought them ease. Counter to their fears, they haven’t ended up being only the unsure CEO.</p>
<p>If you’re a CEO struggling to ever acknowledge your own self-doubts and wavering feelings of commitment, <b>try on the hat of the unsure CEO</b>. See what it’s like to make that a persona that is allowed to have space in your life and experience of things.</p>
<h2><b>The thing that’s right in front of you</b></h2>
<p>The puzzling experience of feeling unsure is that most of us haven’t learned to identify it as a thing. When we say “I can’t decide if I want to do A or B!” what eludes us that the thing right in front of us is that we can’t decide. That we’re unsure whether A or B is the thing that’s best for us. And that unsureness of ourselves is&nbsp;something and not nothing. Conventionally we’ve just overlooked it and I’d argue it’s something of a collective blind-spot. I know very few people who are comfortable in their unsureness about themselves or a situation.</p>
<p>Once we bring it into our awareness, we’ve gained a massive opportunity to unfold into our aliveness. One that is three-fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>you get to integrate an important human experience into your tool-belt: that of being unsure.</li>
<li>you get to explore and be present to sensations, feelings, and thoughts you’ve previously had running through you on auto-pilot. For me, it’s a shakiness in the belly and a slight headache around the temples. Then there is constant chatter weighing multiple options in my mind and raised shoulders, just to name some parts of it. It’s a unique cocktail of experiences, that if I drop my story around how it’s not a good or bad thing to be feeling it, I can almost get to enjoying and appreciating it.</li>
<li>you get to support others and not feel scared or feel the need to “fix” or “advice them” out of their situation if they themselves are feeling unsure too.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>How to be with being unsure (or any other&nbsp;emotional state)</b></h2>
<p>This, as usual with most of our experiences, is the easy part once we’ve identified what it is that we need to be with that’s right in front of us in the first place.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Notice</b>: When it comes up, my most trusted method is to notice, simply notice. And to begin noticing most pointedly how my body is feeling. That is where I usually find the bulk of the experience is coming from. The thoughts and feelings that accompany the body seem to be something like second-order items, important, but often influenced by my bodily state.</li>
<li><b>Accept</b>: Usually I have to expand my noticing to include also my relationship with what I’m noticing. With the sense of feeling unsure for example, I’ve also felt angry, disgusted, annoyed, and ashamed. Since those are present in relation to feeling unsure, it’ll be hard to let them have space if they are not also noticed and accepted as being present. My experience is that unless I can come to my emotional state with a sense of warm curiosity, through the help of a trusted friend or professional, it’ll be difficult for it to actually expand and have room to flow through me.</li>
<li><b>Follow</b>: Once I’ve noticed something or enough things, there’s usually an opportunity to follow an experience, feeling, or thought. The shakiness in the belly wants to expand into the legs. From the legs, it turns into a tingling in the feet. From there, it becomes a warm sensation of feeling peaceful and at ease.</li>
<li><b>Rest</b>: After a process like this that can take anywhere from 5 minutes to 2 hours, there can be a good point to rest and do something entirely different, not related to what I’ve just felt into. This might be going to the sauna, have some food, go for a walk, spend time with friends or spouses, what have you, you know yourself best around what brings you restful relaxation.</li>
<li><b>Optional: Integration/Analysis</b>: If I’m most present with myself, I steer away from self-analysis for as long as I can. That means putting questions like “Why am I this way?” or “Where did this come from?” to the very end of my exploration. Too often they aren’t helpful when introduced early on, since it leads to little expansion or resolution and just thoughts turning in on themselves more and more, furthering the constriction around what we’re already haven’t spent enough time to just be with, instead of analyzing it. <b>True integration and analysis have the experience of feeling fresh and new, coming from the unfolding of things that happened before.</b> The fresher the insight feels, the more I’d trust it as guidance. The more familiar it feels, the more I might wonder if I’ve truly touched into what’s going on for me.</li>
</ul>
<p>PS: a big thanks to my friend <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Kayavidya.Grinberg.Gruemayer/"><span>Matthias</span></a> for pointing me towards my sense of feeling unsure and sparking this article.</p>

Tomorrow, I start building it.</p>— Sahil Lavingia (@shl) <a href="https://twitter.com/shl/status/54072049395712000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2011</a></blockquote> <p>I thought Gumroad would become a billion-dollar company, with hundreds of employees. It would IPO, and I would work on it until I died. Something like that.</p><p>Needless to say, that didn’t happen.</p><p>Now, it may look like I am in an enviable position, running a profitable, growing, low-maintenance software business serving adoring customers. But for years, I considered myself a failure. At my lowest point, I had to lay off 75 percent of my company, including many of my best friends. I had failed.</p><p>It took me years to realize I was misguided from the outset. I no longer feel shame in the path I took to get to where I am today — but for a long time, I did. This is my journey, from the beginning.</p><h2>A weekend project turned VC-backed startup</h2><p>The idea behind Gumroad was simple: Creators and others should be able to sell their products directly to their audiences with quick, simple links. No need for a storefront.</p><p>I built Gumroad the weekend I thought up the idea, and launched it early Monday morning on Hacker News. The reaction exceeded my grandest aspirations. Over 52,000 people checked it out on the first day.</p><p>Later that year, I left my job as the second employee at Pinterest — before I vested any of my stock — to turn Gumroad into what I thought would become my life’s work.</p><p>Almost immediately, I raised $1.1M from an all-star cast of angel investors and venture capital firms, including Max Levchin, Chris Sacca, Ron Conway, Naval Ravikant, Collaborative Fund, Accel Partners, and First Round Capital. A few months later, in May 2012, we raised $7M more. Mike Abbott from Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers (KPCB), a top-tier VC firm, led the round.</p><p>I was on top of the world. I was just 19, a solo founder, with over $8M in the bank and three employees. The world was starting to take note.</p><p>We grew the team. We stayed focused on our product. The monthly numbers started to climb. And then, at some point, they didn’t.</p><p>To keep the product alive, I laid off 75 percent of my company — including many of my best friends. It really sucked. But I told myself things would be fine: The product would continue to grow and no one far from the company would ever find out.</p><p>Then, TechCrunch got wind of the layoffs and published “Layoffs Hit Gumroad As The E-Commerce Startup Restructures.” All of a sudden, my failure was public. I spent the week ignoring my support network and answering our customers’ concerns, many of whom relied on us to power their businesses. They wanted to know if they should look for alternative products. Some of our favorite, most successful creators left. This hurt, but I don’t blame them for trying to minimize the risk in their own businesses.</p><p>So what exactly went wrong, and when?</p><h2>Failing in style</h2><p>Let’s start with the numbers. This is our monthly processed volume, until the layoffs:</p><p><img src="https://sahillavingia.com/0_z7tBf5i6wH-HbLhU.png"></p><p>It doesn’t look too bad, right? It’s going in the right direction: up.</p><p>But we were venture-funded, which was like playing a game of double-or-nothing. It’s euphoric when things are going your way — and suffocating when they’re not. And we weren’t doubling fast enough to raise the $15M+ Series B (the second major round of funding) we were looking for to grow the team.</p><p>For the type of business we were trying to build, every month of less than 20 percent growth should have been a red flag.</p><p>But at the time, I thought it was okay. We had money in the bank and product-market fit. We would continue to ship product and things would work out. The online creator movement was still nascent; the slow growth wasn’t our fault. It always looked like change was right around the corner.</p><p>But now, I realize: It doesn’t matter whose “fault” it is; we hit a peak in November 2014 and stalled. A lot of creators absolutely loved us, but there weren’t enough of them who needed our specific product offering. Product-market fit is great, but we needed to find a new, larger fit to justify raising more money (and then do it again and again, until acquisition or IPO).</p><p>In January 2015, after our final double-or-nothing hail-mary, our bank balance dipped below 18 months of runway. I told my 20-person team the road ahead would be a tough one. We didn’t have the numbers to raise a Series B, and we would have to work really hard over the next nine months to get even close. To that end, we deprioritized everything except features that would directly move the needle. Many were not core to our business, but we needed to try everything we could to get our monthly processed volume to where it needed to be.</p><p>If we succeeded, we would raise money from a top-tier VC again, hire more people, and pick up the journey where we’d left off. If we didn’t, we would have to drastically downsize the company.</p><p>In those nine months, when the whole team knew we were fighting for our company’s life, not a single person left Gumroad. From “this is gonna be hard,” to “yep, turns out it was,” every single person worked harder than ever.</p><p>We launched a “Small Product Lab” to teach new creators how to grow and sell. We shipped a ton of features, including weekly payouts, payouts to debit cards, payouts to the U.K., Australia, and Canada, various additions to our email features, product recommendations and search, analytics to see how customers are reading/watching/downloading the products they’ve purchased, and add-to-cart functionality. And that was just between August and November.</p><p>Unfortunately, we didn’t hit the numbers we needed.</p><h2>Slim down or shut down?</h2><p>Looking back, I’m glad we didn’t hit those numbers. If we’d doubled down, raised more money, and appeared in the headlines again, there would have been a very real possibility of even more spectacular failure.</p><p>With that off the table, our options were:</p><p>Shut down the business, return the remaining money to investors, and try something new.</p><p>Continue with a slimmed-down version of the company to aim for sustainability.</p><p>Position the company for an acquihire.</p><p>Some of my investors wanted me to shut down the business. They tried to convince me that my time was worth more than trying to keep a small business like Gumroad afloat, and I should try to build another billion-dollar company armed with all of my learnings — and their money.</p><p>I tended to agree with them, to be honest. But I was accountable to our creators, our employees, and our investors — in that order. We helped thousands of creators get paid, every month. About $2,500,000 was going to go into the pockets of creators — for rent checks and mortgages, for student loans and kids’ college funds. And it was only growing! Could I really just turn that faucet off?</p><p>If I sold the company, it would be mostly for our stellar team — and I would no longer be able to control the destiny of the product. There were too many acquisition stories of companies promising exciting journeys and amazing synergies to come — and ending with a deprecated product a year later.</p><p>Selling was certainly tempting. I could say I sold my first company, raise more money, and do this all again with a new idea. But that didn’t sit right with me. We were responsible to our creators first. That’s what I told every new hire and every investor. I didn’t want to become a serial entrepreneur and risk disappointing yet another customer base.</p><p>We decided to become profitable at any cost. The next year was not fun: I shrunk the company from twenty employees to five. We struggled to find a new tenant for our $25,000/month office. We focused all of our remaining resources on launching a premium service.</p><p>In June 2015, a few months before our layoffs, our financials looked like this:</p><ul><li>Revenue: $89,000 for the month</li><li>Gross profit: $17,000</li><li>Operating expenses: $364,000</li><li><strong>Net profit: -$351,000</strong></li></ul><p>A year later, in June 2016, our monthly numbers looked like this:</p><ul><li>Revenue: $176,000 for the month</li><li>Gross profit: $42,000</li><li>Operating expenses: $32,000</li><li><strong>Net profit: +$10,000</strong></li></ul><p>It hurt, but it meant creators would keep getting paid. It also meant that we were in control of our own destiny.</p><h2>From skeleton crew to lifestyle business</h2><p>It got worse from there.</p><p>Gumroad was no longer the venture-funded, fast-growing startup our investors and employees signed up for. As everyone else found other opportunities, the skeleton crew fizzled from five to one.</p><p>I was basically alone. I didn’t have a team, nor an office. And San Francisco was full of startups raising gobs of money, building amazing teams, and shipping great products. Some of my friends became billionaires. Meanwhile, I was running a “measly” lifestyle business. It wasn’t what I wanted to do, but I had to keep the ship from sinking.</p><p>Now, I understand some people would dream to be in that position. But at the time, I just felt trapped. I couldn’t stop, but there was only so much I could do as an army of one.</p><p>For years, my only metric of success was building a billion-dollar company. Now, I realize that was a terrible goal.</p><p>I shut off the rest of the world. I didn’t tell my mom about the layoffs — she had to read the article and tweets herself to find out. My friends were worried, but I assured them I was neither depressed nor suicidal. I left San Francisco for long stretches at a time, thinking that some travel would give me adequate distance. It only made me more lonely.</p><p>Every day, I woke up and took care of all of Gumroad’s support queries. I tried to fix all of the bugs I could. Often, I had to ask for help from former Gumroad engineers. They were all employed by then, but they always found time to help. Once all things Gumroad were taken care of, I tried to go to the gym, and if I had the willpower, work on a side project (a fantasy novel). Most days, I failed.</p><p>To me, happiness is about an expectation of positive change. Every year …</p></div></div>

<p>Yeah, this is one those articles. You see these pop up in your favorite news aggregator when Apple does something stupid. The last wave was with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/butterfly-keyboard-vs-scissor-keyboard/">butterfly switch keyboards</a>. </p>



<p>Why did I make the switch? Because my Mac got really old and where I live, they are damn expensive to buy. I had to find an answer to my “can there be equally pleasing work environment without a Mac?” question before spending bunch of money.</p>



<h2>My Workflow</h2>



<p>My workflow is very basic web developer workflow. I’m a backend developer by day but I do lots of JavaScript/HTML/CSS <a href="https://blog.cemunalan.com.tr/projects/" title="Projects">on my side projects</a>. My main editor is <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PHPStorm</a> for PHP and <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> for other everything else. I use <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> to run projects on my local environment but working with a low-end Mac, it is difficult. I have really gotten used to <a href="https://fork.dev/">Fork</a> and <a href="https://sequelpro.com/">Sequel Pro</a> as my go-to tools when doing development. I use the standard Apple Terminal. That’s about it.</p>



<p>I got the Late 2013 Macbook Pro 13 inch with 4GB RAM back in 2014. It was not impressive when I first got it and it certainly not impressive now. I mean it was not a bad buy. I have been using it for the last 6 years and I can still do some light work on it. Even the battery still holds up for about 3-4 hours after 1200 cycles.</p>

<p>But anything other than light work just does not cut it. Coding in an IDE such as PHPStorm? Docker? Slack, Spotify and bunch of other Electron apps running in the background? You’ll see the computer crumble with continuous swapping. </p>



<p>So last year I have built a Hackintosh from my old desktop. It worked like a treat even with an AMD CPU. The only drawback was that Docker was not working. That’s a known and sort of unsolvable problem. So after a while it was a no-go for me.</p>

<p>So I jumped the ship. I wanted native Docker speed on my local development workflow and installed Ubuntu 20.04. Here is what happened.</p>



<h2>Docker</h2>



<p>Yeah, it is amazing. Running your local web app using Docker on Linux gives you incredible performance. There is no hidden Ubuntu VM in between like in the Docker for Mac. It just works natively. Performance and ease of use is alone a good reason to switch to Ubuntu (or any Linux distro, really). If you are using Docker in your local development setup, you should seriously consider switching to Linux.</p>



<p>Here is an example. A simple PHP request with the Laravel framework may take multiple seconds with Docker for Mac. At my last day time job, I used to get a timeout from the server since PHP does not respond in 30 seconds. Yikes. So iterating, doing multiple refreshes on a page was a very slow process. On my Ubuntu setup same request generally takes around 80-100 ms, as it should be.</p>



<h2>The Keyboard Layout</h2>



<p>I think the MacOS idea of having “Cmd” key for system wide shortcuts and leaving “Ctrl” to do it’s on thing in the Terminal is brilliant. You kinda miss that when you switch to Linux as there is no such distinction. </p>



<p>I do still have a Mac so switching between Ubuntu and a Mac was a struggle as keyboard and shortcuts change dramatically. After some time I have discovered <a href="https://github.com/rbreaves/kinto">Kinto</a>. </p>



<p>It markets itself as “Type in Linux &amp; Windows like it’s a Mac” and I can say that it does it’s job very well.</p>



<p>This is a very noob friendly tool that runs a program on your computer that listens to your keyboard inputs. It also knows which program is active on the screen so it can make decisions based upon that. </p>



<p>So if you are in Firefox pressing “Alt + C” on your keyboard equals to “Ctrl + C”. Just like “Cmd + C” on a Mac. However if you are on a Terminal emulator, pressing “Alt + C” means “Ctrl + Shift + C” which is a copy. You have to press “Ctrl + C” on your keyboard to make it register a “Ctrl +C”. So it’s basically same as using a Mac. </p>



<p>If I didn’t own a Mac, I would suck it up get used to the keyboard mapping but currently this setup makes me very happy.</p>



<h2>Installing apps: Snaps and AppImages</h2>



<p>Snaps are <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/06/02/linux_mint_team_snap/">controversial</a>. Since I’m new to the Linux distros, I just wanted to go to the most streamline way of doings things. I gave the default Ubuntu Software Center and snaps a chance when installing apps. </p>



<p>I would say from a new comer point of view that they are… fine? To my experience programs are extremely easy to install/uninstall. I think that’s very important especially when you are new to an operating system. You try bunch of things, explore programs, install them, remove them after 5 minutes and don’t have to worry about dependencies or configurations left behind. </p>



<p>It keeps the old versions of the programs in disk so you can do a rollback. This saved me big time the other day as Slack’s latest 4.7.0 release started crashing. I had to revert to 4.4.3 and it was… very convenient. Just a simple command to do the roll back.</p>



<p>There are of course some problems. For example they are incredibly slow to boot up. Like opening up a calculator takes multiple seconds. Makes you think you are using a HDD instead of SSD.</p>



<p>I believe due to some sandboxing problems, clicking links on Slack and Skype was not working for me. It simply does not open the links in the default browser. You have to dive into the forums and figure out what the hell is going on.</p>



<p>So there are definitely some problems with them but I also benefited features that are not in “apt-get” quite a lot.</p>



<p>Some of the apps I use are not distributed as snaps but rather as AppImages. Those are quite common especially with Electron apps. These AppImages resemble installing a regular Mac app that you drag and drop to your Applications folder and just click to execute. </p>



<p>On Linux it might not be straightforward as your Desktop environment (Gnome or KDE) may not pick up the icon of the app to show in dock or it might not create a item in applications list (For example for Gnome you should add a desktop item manually). You once again have to learn how to make your app appear in your desktop environment and read some forums. So not as convenient as I hoped it would be.</p>



<h2>Web Development Tools</h2>



<p>I think there is no point arguing whether if there are enough web development tools in Linux. All of the IDE’s released by JetBrains are in Snap Store, ready to be installed with one click. Electron apps are not efficient in terms of resource management however I’m grateful that they exist now that I’m on Linux. Lot of the apps that would normally not see a light of day on Linux are now readily available. </p>



<p>So it was very easy for me to find replacements for my web development tools. </p>



<p>In terms of terminal, I was not expecting anything fancy since I was a Terminal.app user on a Mac. Gnome Terminal does the trick for me.</p>



<p>I was a huge Sequel Pro user. Sequel Pro is a very unique that it basically does not have a replacement in any platform and people keep using it even though it’s very buggy. It literally crashes if you close a tab or a window and yet, multiple people at my last work including me was using it daily. So I was not expecting to find a feature-parity alternative on Linux. </p>



<p>First, I gave CLI tools a go. “mycli” is an <a href="https://github.com/dbcli/mycli">amazing CLI tool for MySQL</a>. It also has a <a href="https://github.com/dbcli/pgcli/">PostgreSQL equivalent called “pgcli”</a>. It features a very solid autocomplete and generally more convenient than using the default MySQL CLI tool. I’m mostly using that for accessing databases.</p>



<p>As a backup, I have been using DataGrip if I want to do things in GUI. It’s very big and feature-full compared to the Sequel Pro but it’s a good backup. You may also want to take a look at <a href="https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/">Beekeeper Studio</a>.</p>



<p>As I have mentioned before <a href="https://fork.dev/">Fork </a>was my daily driver when it comes to git GUIs. Unfortunately there is no Linux version of it. I gave <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/">GitKraken </a>a go but it feels very slow, bloated and you have to create and account to use it… It does not feel like a computer program, but more like a Startup-y SaaS-y thing. Then I found out about <a href="https://www.sublimemerge.com/">Sublime Merge</a> and I was pleasantly surprised that it does a very fine job. User interface is very different to popular git GUIs but it’s fast and reliable. </p>



<h2>bash vs zsh</h2>



<p>I try to keep thigs as default as that makes migrating from one computer to another computer very easy. I tweak very few things in my IDE. Just the default light theme and Vim emulation mode. In terminal, I try to use the default terminal application of the operating system. </p>



<p>One of the major things I was not using in default was my shell. I always used zsh and oh-my-zsh. I have no recollection how I got to use them. I guess they looked cool and oh my zsh made it easy to extend things. This time I wanted to go the other way and decided to stick with bash as that is the default shell for Ubuntu and MacOS. I don’t do shell scripting so zsh’s features around shell scripting goes above my head. </p>



<p>I started by opening up the default .bashrc that comes with Ubuntu. Boy, that thing is <a href="https://gist.github.com/marioBonales/1637696">bloated</a>. I did my reasearch and <a href="https://github.com/raicem/dotfiles/blob/master/.bashrc">deleted most of the things</a> that come with it. </p>



<p>One thing I can’t live without is the git branch on prompt. There is really no need to install “zsh” just to get that. It’s just a one Google search away. As a plus you get to learn a bit of bash scripting, what is a “prompt”, what is PS1 and all that.</p>



<h2>Small Cuts</h2>



<p>Terminal, commonly used apps, development environment… Those are the big points you think about when you migrate from one operating system to the other. I have managed to find my comfortable setup there as I have explained above. </p>



<p>However, there are other types of things that you don’t really think about before making the migration. I refer to them as small cuts. You don’t generally plan for them but they hurt your day to day flow. </p>



<p>Here are some of them.</p>



<p><strong>Preview</strong>: I miss this software everyday. It’s dead simple to highlight stuff on images/screenshots, sign documents, resize photos and lots of other stuff. Losing this app hurts a lot. I’m sure there is a great online editor out there but I have yet to find it.</p>



<p><strong>iCloud</strong>: If you like iCloud and …</p></div></div>

<p>There are plenty of DevOps myths&nbsp;circulating the developers’&nbsp;community. This is no surprise, considering how much excitement the DevOps concept has brought&nbsp;over the recent years.</p>



<p>The DevOps methodology can provide significant positive effects for organizations when implemented properly. It can <strong>lower costs, boost efficiency</strong>, and <strong>make the work of development teams more streamlined</strong>.</p>



<p>However, in order to grasp the strength of this&nbsp;process, it is necessary to recognize what DevOps represents. That’s why, in this article, we address some of the most popular DevOps myths.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Myth 1: DevOps is all about CI/CD&nbsp;</h2>



<p>One of the biggest misconceptions about DevOps is that it’s the same thing as CI/CD. The truth is that continuous integration and delivery are <strong>the key components of DevOps</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>DevOps focuses on the culture and responsibility in a team. It emphasizes the need for everyone on the team to take part in each other’s tasks. This improves <strong>collaboration and communication</strong> in the team.</p>



<p>On the other hand, CI/CD enables this culture with software and tools that emphasize automation. You can see them as <strong>a means to an end</strong>.</p>



<h2>Myth 2: DevOps means NoOps</h2>



<p>NoOps describes the concept where the cloud infrastructure is so automated, that there is no need to manage it.</p>



<p>NoOps is considered as<strong> the next evolution of DevOps</strong> as a development model. Just like DevOps, its goal is to improve software delivery, but by allowing developers to focus on application development instead of infrastructure and maintenance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By using machine learning and artificial intelligence, you can automate the setup, deployment, and monitoring processes, getting closer to NoOps.</p>



<h2>Myth 3: Automation eliminates all bottlenecks&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Automation is one of the biggest benefits that DevOps provides. But <strong>it’s not a silver bullet</strong> that will solve all your problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A continuous delivery process enables teams to roll out new features quickly. And, get the feedback they need really fast. This, of course, means that you have to ensure the product’s quality. Moreover, you have to take care of how well it runs and its performance when scaling. You also need to ensure smooth production deployments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Automating your CI/CD pipelines helps <strong>eliminate the bottlenecks between code commit and deploy.</strong> But, this is just one stage of the software delivery process. Unless developers and testers are in a partnership, you won’t be able to resolve all your problems. It’s likely that you’ll only move any bottlenecks to another stream.</p>



<h2>Myth 4: One-size-fits-all continuous delivery pipeline</h2>



<p>The idea that you can have one process that fits all teams and companies is impossible, contrary to popular belief. Every organization has <strong>different needs and requirements</strong>. Even projects in the same organization need different continuous delivery pipelines.</p>



<p>You can have projects that need only two to three environments. For example, development, test, and production environments with frequent deployments. Another project can require more environments since it has multiple stages in the software delivery cycle.</p>



<p>This is why the continuous delivery pipeline should <strong>represent the release process</strong> that the company is already using.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Myth 5: DevOps is all about tools</h2>



<p>Conversations about DevOps are mostly focused around which tools your company is using. They then turn into philosophical battles about what are the best tools. Instead, we should be <strong>communicating about the bigger picture</strong>, the business value DevOps brings to your company.</p>



<p>DevOps means focusing on <strong>culture, mindset, and how individuals work together.</strong> Only after should you be choosing the right tools for your processes. Teams often look in the large ecosystem of tools trying to find the perfect solution at the beginnings. They build DevOps pipelines for a very long time, that should be redone once completed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:a87265a6-4a4d-4905-97e9-4129ac78563c/Atlassian%20DevOps%20Trends%20Survey%202020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atlassian research</a> showed that the two main factors to implement DevOps successfully are <strong>the right tools and the right people</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>DevOps automation tools like <a href="https://microtica.com/">Microtica</a> allow you to create pipelines and test them in hours.</strong> With these kinds of tools, you can save months of work on pipelines that might not function. </p>



<h2>Myth 6: Software release is the same as in Amazon/Facebook/Google</h2>



<p>Many world-leading companies have adopted DevOps for its benefits and flexibility. Looking at these company’s success stories, we, of course, look up to their achievements. We do this without realizing their context and the steps they made to become that successful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One thing is for sure – these organizations <strong>chose and built the tools and processes that worked best for them at the time</strong>. This doesn’t necessarily mean that we need to follow these organizations. Moreover, what they did won’t magically work for our business as well.</p>



<p>We should learn from them and find new ways to innovate and grow. Explore and find the right processes and tools that define our problem space. What will bring <strong>success to our particular business</strong>? This is what DevOps is all about.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Myth 7: Release all the time</h2>



<p>The idea of frequent releases has companies worried about not releasing their software continuously enough. <em>“Ship often”</em> has become the industry standard. However, this doesn’t specify the time. It may be every two to three weeks, or it may be several times a day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most important thing is that you achieve the<strong> team confidence</strong> that enables you to release new software when required. CD is the <strong>ability to release code from the main branch and feel confident in it</strong>. The idea of DevOps is that your code should be releasable anytime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So remember, continuous delivery doesn’t mean you should release as often as you can but gives you the ability to release <strong>as often as you want.</strong> <em>How often should be up to your company’s decision.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2>Wrapping up</h2>



<p>We hope this&nbsp;article helped you bust some of the most popular DevOps myths that&nbsp;swirl around. Don’t let such misunderstandings hinder the progress of your team. Implementing DevOps can help your company improve productivity and create better products, so don’t miss out on these benefits due to these DevOps myths. </p>

<p>Be honest: how often do you use Stack Overflow, Mozilla Developer Network, or some other online resource? How effective would you be without these resources? I know my strength as developer is in understanding concepts and solving problems, not in memorizing APIs and algorithms. <strong>So why do we test developers on their ability to come up with solutions without help?</strong></p>

<p>If you really want to evaluate candidates on the skills they will use in their job, you have two options.</p>

<h2 id="reducing-the-dependence-on-memorization">Reducing the dependence on memorization</h2>

<p>First, you can test a candidate’s problem solving skills. But if you do so, think about how developers actually solve high-level problems. The goal of this type of problem solving isn’t to end up with working code, but set a direction for the architecture. That’s why this type of interview problem is well-suited for system design interviews.</p>

<p>If you must write code, pick simple algorithms the candidate would actually develop on their own. Make sure APIs and syntax aren’t part of the evaluation. In my experience, candidates often gravitate toward using Java or Python, but make it clear you’ll accept pseudo-code. The structure of the solution is important, not the exact characters on the screen.</p>

<p>Finally, consider participating in <a href="https://hiringfor.tech/2020/03/16/were-in-it-together.html">a back-and-forth with the candidate</a>. After all, most problem solving of this type happens collaboratively.</p>

<h2 id="use-the-internet">Use the internet!</h2>

<p>But all of this, is skirting around the real issue with contrived interview problems: developers don’t really work like this. So, I suggest letting candidates <a href="https://hiringfor.tech/2020/05/04/the-project-interview.html">work on a real-world problem</a>, and <strong>let them have access to the internet</strong>!</p>

<p>“But won’t candidates be able to cheat?!” A developer’s strength is in synthesizing solutions to the problems at hand. This entails mapping those problems to standard patterns they’ve seen, drawing inspiration from multiple sources, then putting it all together to solving the unique problem present at your company. Give candidates access to information, and see how they use it.</p>

<hr>

<p>To effectively evaluate candidates on the skills they’ll need on the job, let them work the same way they would after being hired. This means giving them access to the building blocks they’ll use to solve your company’s problems. After all, what good is it to hire someone who knows a piece of trivia but can’t actually apply it?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-0690890445953831c024"><div><p><em>Trigger warning: authoritarianism, state surveillance, the Holocaust. If you want to avoid these topics, please jump to the last paragraph of this introduction, starting with ‘Enough about the depressing stuff.’</em></p><p>Before we start, I feel like I need to give a bit of background on why I care so deeply about privacy. It’s partly historical. Being Ashkenazi, I learnt from a very young age about the importance of sensitive information, and who you give that information to. My grandfather broke the law by not going to the police station to register himself as a Jew. The Holocaust saw 76,000 Jews deported to death camps from France alone - around 1/4th of the country’s Jewish population at the time. There’s a chance that not being part of the Jewish census saved his life. Lesson: be careful who you give sensitive information to.</p><p>That grandfather and two of his brothers left Paris in the middle of the war, and took a train south with no plan, no luggage, no contact, and no destination other than, well, heading south. They were helped by strangers and survived. Their mother however, along with two other siblings, had a plan. They had a deal with a smuggler to reach unoccupied France. The smuggler informed the Nazis, and all 3 of them died in deportation. Lesson: each person who has information on you represents an additional chance for it to be leaked.</p><p>And yes, we can raise the irony of mentioning my Jewish grandpa to warn you against sharing sensitive information online. There, I just did.&nbsp;</p><p>While this happened in the 1940’s, a data point’s lifespan is drastically different today. It’s possible that you posted something online 10 years ago, and it was fine back then, but 20 years from now you will hope that no one finds it. My message is: the Internet never forgets, cultures change, and retroactive laws exist. People can get screwed over digital data. Let’s take the obvious example: China’s state surveillance has an eye on literally each and every move of its inhabitants, whether physical or digital. The state uses extensive data to allocate social scores, which can have a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-18/china-social-credit-a-model-citizen-in-a-digital-dictatorship/10200278?nw=0" target="_blank">drastic impact</a> on Chinese people’s life, including banning them from purchasing train or plane tickets, providing them with lower Internet speed, and denying them visas and loans. China also makes use of this surveillance system <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/02/asia/xinjiang-china-karakax-document-intl-hnk/" target="_blank">against its Uyghur population</a>, detaining between 1 and 2 million people - the estimates vary - in concentration camps, where prisoners suffer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang_re-education_camps#Testimonies_of_treatment" target="_blank">extensively reported torture, brainwashing and forced labour</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from governmental issues, there’s also the topic of pervasive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFTWM7HV2UI" target="_blank">tracking and ads</a>, championed by Facebook and Google. I’m yet to see the difference between today’s digital advertising and individually-customised mass manipulation. Maybe because there is none. Please try and change my mind if you have any conclusive elements.</p><p>Enough about the depressing stuff. I’ve explained why your privacy matters, and we’re now about to dive into a few security concepts. I wrote this article with <a href="https://twitter.com/lp1eu" target="_blank">lp1</a>, as he knows much more about these concepts than I do. So here’s my first pro tip for you, unrelated to privacy or security: date people you admire. Now, let’s get into the technical aspects.</p><h2>CIA</h2><p>The CIA ‘triad’ is a summary of the main concepts of information security. There are 3 aspects regarding information which are targeted by infosec:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Confidentiality</strong>:<strong> </strong>the assurance that a piece of information can only be observed by authorised third parties.</p></li><li><p><strong>Integrity</strong>:<strong> </strong>the assurance that a piece of information is and stays accurate over time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Availability</strong>: the assurance that a piece of information can be accessed by an authorised user when they need it.</p></li></ul><h2>Encryption: Server-side vs. Client-side</h2><p>Encryption secures data and aims to maintain its confidentiality and integrity.</p><p>We differentiate server-side from client-side encryption. Server-side means that only information stored on said server is encrypted. This means that the company has the encryption key, and therefore can access your communication (yes, including your nudes). However, server-side encryption doesn’t apply to the <strong>transmission </strong>of your communication. The data you share is not necessarily encrypted, only the storage is, which is why you should favour platforms that use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS" target="_blank">https</a>.</p><p>Client-side – or end-to-end – encryption means that the transmission of your information is encrypted, and that <strong>only your device</strong> has the key. If you log in from a different device, you won’t be able to see the exchanges. Since the company <strong>does not have the key</strong>,<strong> </strong>they cannot access your messages. As a result, even if they were to store your exchanges, said exchanges would automatically be encrypted. However, this also means that you won’t be able to recover your messages, should you lose the key.</p><p>In the case of a communication service, this means that the nudes you're sending to <strong>someone you trust</strong> are encrypted from your device to the company's server, as well as from their server to your trusted partner's device. Without encryption however, anyone on your network can see and tamper with all your communications. By 'tamper with', we mean any kind of modification by an unauthorised third-party. Examples include someone changing your password and email address on a platform to take over your account, deleting your private files on a cloud file storage service, replacing software in your online backups with malware, etc.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1598877921511_5282"><div><p>A recent example is the July Twitter hack, during which <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1286088135525318656" target="_blank">hackers managed to read users' messages from Twitter's admin control panel</a>. &nbsp;With end-to-end encrypted DMs, no one at Twitter would have been able to access them.</p><h2>Encryption vs. Hashing</h2><p>A distinction has to be made between two important notions: encryption and hashing. Encrypting information means that you turn it into scrambled text which can be decoded with a key. For instance, it's useful to make sure a communication between two peers cannot be read by an unauthorised person.&nbsp;</p><p>Hashing a piece of data on the other hand means that you turn it into a <strong>unique signature</strong> which <strong>cannot be reversed</strong> into its original readable state. The only way for someone to obtain the original input based on the hashing output, is to try inputs themselves until their output matches. Hashing is not intended as a cypher to decrypt, which is why encryption and hashing serve different purposes and are used in different cases. Hashing is noticeably useful to store passwords, because you avoid storing the actual easy-to-steal-and-reuse passwords. Instead, you compare the hashing output that you store to the hashing output of what a user entered while trying to log in. If you get the same hash that you’ve stored, then the password is correct.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1598877921511_7990"><div><h2>100% secure does not exist</h2><p>Flaws and vulnerabilities can always be found. However, the sturdier your tools, the safer you'll be. And contrary to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djV11Xbc914" target="_blank">what A-ha used to sing</a>, it is better to be safe than sorry.</p><h2>Free vs. Open source</h2><p>Free and open source software are specific philosophies, based on specific values. Free software specifically refers to the notion of users' freedom, which isn't the case in open-source software. As <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html" target="_blank">the GNU website</a> puts it: 'To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”'.</p><p>There are 4 criteria for software to be free:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Freedom 0: The freedom to run the programme as you wish, for any purpose.</p></li><li><p>Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the programme works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. This entails having access to the source code.</p></li><li><p>Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.</p></li><li><p>Freedom 3: The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.</p></li></ul><p>On the other hand, open-source software has a <a href="https://opensource.org/osd" target="_blank">less strict definition</a>, and a different philosophy. You can also see the source code, amongst other things.</p><p>If you want to get into the political aspect of these terminologies, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html" target="_blank">here</a>’s a good explanation.</p><h2>Credential stuffing attack</h2><p>Credential stuffing is a popular attack whose goal is to automatically test a user’s known credentials on multiple platforms on a large scale. Nowadays, it is widely used by malicious intruders because of the online accessibility of billions of credentials gathered from data leaks (<a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/dating-the-ginormous-myspace-breach/" target="_blank">MySpace</a>, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dailymotion-allegedly-hacked-85-million-user-accounts-stolen/" target="_blank">Dailymotion</a>, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-dropbox-hack-is-real/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> to name some of the biggest).</p><p>And there you have it, a roundup of the main security concepts. Feel free to reach out to <a href="https://twitter.com/lp1eu" target="_blank">lp1</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/this2shallgrow" target="_blank">me</a> on Twitter. Part 2 will be available next week, with a list of the privacy and security tools we frequently use and recommend.</p><p>If you’re looking for a UX researcher or UX designer to work in the privacy and security sphere, I’d love to have a chat with you! </p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Building a real-world application requires a lot of work and a lot of skills other than technology if you want to set up something sustainable. Marketing, Sales, Analytics, and even Accounting are skills needed next to the engineering side to build a real-world application. A real-world application involves a product or app that has some users. But the good news is that you can be a user as well. That should be easy, right? But now the problems arise. What should I build that I will use myself and how to create it? This blog article will set some light on this process by showcasing how I deal with several steps to building real-world apps. As a small reference, I built <a href="https://caseconverter.pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">caseconverter.pro</a>, a simple case converter, think of PascalCase to camelCase, and <a href="https://getworkrecognized.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getworkrecognized.com</a>, a Work Achievement Tracker with the functionality to create Brag Documents or Self-Reviews, over the last year. If I was able to create these two apps or products, you can do so too!</p>
<h2 id="finding-a-problem-is-difficult"><a href="#finding-a-problem-is-difficult" aria-label="finding a problem is difficult permalink"></a>Finding a Problem is difficult?</h2>
<p>I have seen many Software Engineers failing with this. I think it is buried in our mentality sometimes. Software Engineers are different from the common population. Some like to focus on the coding part, and others love to focus on the product. Gergely Orosz wrote an excellent article about the <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Product-minded engineer</a> and how they differ from "classical" software engineers. I observed that these Product-minded engineers have an easier way to find product opportunities. But that is just my observation.</p>
<p>So what is my process of finding problems to be solved? That’s quite easy. First of all, I do not actively look for a product opportunity. I just live my normal life. I have a full-time job. And you will see so many problems at any job. Try to observe your current job and see if you do any repetitive tasks. For me, an example was creating the Self-Reviews of myself at work. I could not remember what I did the last six months and needed to look up everything with the funky JIRA search. It did not go so well, to be honest. Consistently tracking your work and tagging the work achievements should work. So I built an app for this.</p>
<p>A secret tip of mine: Check the Google Sheets or Excel tables you have at your work and see if it could be built with an easier-to-use interface like a web application. And if your company has this problem, other companies likely have these problems as well. But this should get figured out later.</p>
<p>Normally, I keep track of these things in a simple Google Keep Note. Just write down the problem in a simple one sentence. Write the ideas down for some time, and you should have at least ten ideas written down to continue. Now it is a question of what to choose. More on this later.</p>
<h3 id="alternative-ways"><a href="#alternative-ways" aria-label="alternative ways permalink"></a>Alternative ways</h3>
<p>There are, of course, many alternative ways on how to find ideas. What I have seen working as well is checking existing applications. For example, you can choose one of the apps in the App or Play Store and check the bad ratings and try to look for something that did not work for the customer. Maybe the product was wrongly targeted, or the functionality is just bad. Figure this out and write down the idea in your backlog of ideas.</p>
<p>Another possible idea-finding practice is to be on the lookout of local startups in other regions or languages. For example, there is a product called <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/thechurchco" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Church Co</a>, which is a website builder for churches. They are on Indiehackers and have quite a huge amount of revenue. That could be applied to local markets like Germany, Austria, Switzerland, or others as well. Just localize the idea and bring it online. Products like these exist in masses already, but it does prohibit you from trying. Another example could be <a href="https://www.xing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xing</a>. It is the german LinkedIn and is even registered on the stock market.</p>

    </span></p>
<p>One of the expectations you should set before this whole process is if you want to build a proper startup or just a side project. You can switch, of course, but the initial affords might be given to different topics depending on which path you choose.</p>
<h3 id="the-business-route"><a href="#the-business-route" aria-label="the business route permalink"></a>The Business Route</h3>
<p>Once you have found a problem, you need to validate it. Everyone loves money, so you need to think about monetization now. Your idea needs to generate money, and that is why you need to validate potential monetization touchpoints. That can be super different for every use case. Most of the products we build these days are subscription-based businesses. But it could be different for anything. To validate this behavior, you can throw a simple landing page together. The landing page should include the simple value propositions to the customers and one call-to-action that lets users enter their email. These emails are golden. You should manually interact with them and ask more about their problems and if they are willing to pay. You will soon figure out if it is worth it to build a product around it or not. Getting initial users on your landing page is simple marketing. You won’t have a huge amount of backlinks. So try to get into communities that might need your tool and have questions regarding this. For example, with the Church Co localized copy, you could join some Facebook groups and make a simple survey to ask churches if they have a website and if they would like more functionalities. Bring them in the end to your landing page and let them enter their email.
By responding to related communities consistently, you will also get credibility in the domain. That is important. You need to build an audience you can sell to later. This process can take time. So do not give up after just a few days. Keep poking and trying. Once you validated that the idea is worth some money, you can start implementing it. The technical details will be described in the next chapter.</p>
<h3 id="the-technical-side-project-route"><a href="#the-technical-side-project-route" aria-label="the technical side project route permalink"></a>The technical Side Project Route</h3>
<p>This route is the route most Software Engineers take. They do not validate their product in the first place and just build it. Maybe they will use it but no one else. That is also a win for sure but might not generate any money. Of course, the projects will look good on the resume. Especially if you have a lot of space, but otherwise it comes down to your mindset on what to focus on. Money or the cause of the application. If the money is an unimportant part for you, then just build. Success might follow if you build consistently and also start to do the Marketing and Sales afterward.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-involved-in-an-app-or-product"><a href="#what-is-involved-in-an-app-or-product" aria-label="what is involved in an app or product permalink"></a>What is involved in an App or Product?</h2>
<p>Normally an app or product consists of different things. All of them have a backend or application code and an interface. The interface can be created in different ways. A CLI or API is also just an interface, but most products have a Web-Frontend or a mobile application. If data is saved a backend is also needed for most use cases, especially databases. Typically a landing page and several other resources regarding marketing and sales are required as well. These are the basic parts that you need to get working initially to have a local development environment and a public presence.
On another note, you might need several other things like domain names, a server, the infrastructure around this, a remote database, an email, and many more things. For example, all social media accounts should be registered with the preferred name of your product app. And a lot of other things that have to be done.
Once you have figured out all components needed to build the app, we can start building the app.</p>
<h2 id="building-the-app"><a href="#building-the-app" aria-label="building the app permalink"></a>Building the App</h2>
<p>The creation of the software is probably the most important step for Software Engineers. If you have an interface, you can have a prototype for your idea. The prototype can vary from a User Interface mockup to even just a simple interview with potential customers with a hand-drawn User Interface. The further you go into the step, the more work is invested, but you will also receive more direct feedback that you can act on. In general, keep things as simple as possible. Software Engineers often try to overcomplicate things, trying to deliver a fully functioning app without validating. Step by step.</p>
<h3 id="find-a-name"><a href="#find-a-name" aria-label="find a name permalink"></a>Find a Name</h3>
<p>A name is important for every product or business. Customers identify with the product and brand of the application. A name will probably help with this. Finding the name is not hard. If you want a simple name just use the combination of the target keyword for your product and append a random animal. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>SurveyAnt</li>
<li>FeedbackFish</li>
<li>BannerBear</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on. There are many more examples of doing it like this.</p>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>One thing that should be checked additionally is the availability of the URL and all relevant social media channels like Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook. There might be many more channels you want to have, but this is a personal decision.</p>
<h3 id="user-interface-design"><a href="#user-interface-design" aria-label="user interface design permalink"></a>User Interface Design</h3>
<p>User Interface design involves a lot of parts. Some Software Engineers are quite good at everything and even know how to design well. I can recommend reading the book <a href="https://refactoringui.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Refactoring UI"</a> that will give you small recipes and patterns to follow on how to create good designs.</p>
<p>The first part where User Interface design gets important is the landing page. Fortunately, the Open Source world delivers some landing page designs that you can copy and change a bit like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cruip/open-react-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/cruip/open-react-template</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/issaafalkattan/React-Landing-Page-Template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/issaafalkattan/React-Landing-Page-Template</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Hermanya/react-landing-page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/Hermanya/react-landing-page</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If these do not fit your style, you can build them yourself. If you need design inspiration, you can also check <a href="https://dribbble.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dribbble</a>. It is an excellent website to get idea inspirations (or copy the designs).</p>
<p>After this is completed, you can start finding the design process of your actual application. The color schema of the app needs to be decided, and several basic components can be defined. The basic components can be used from one of the open-source design systems to give you a headstart. You can find a collection on this repository: <a href="https://github.com/alexpate/awesome-design-systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/alexpate/awesome-design-systems</a></p>

<p>Recently I began writing a post on ways to automate python scripts passively.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> For the purpose of the post I chose cron, an operating system utility that is run as a daemon—a program that runs passively in the background of a computer. If cron and daemon both seem etymologically Greek to you, they did to me as well. Researching whether this was true (it probably is) led me down an interdisciplinary rabbit-hole of computer science history and its relationship to philosophy and economics. This first post is an extended history on origin of time-sharing computers, which I couldn’t stop researching. In future a post, I plan on writing more about the economics of cloud computing. Eventually the article ends with the etymology of the term daemon and its meaning both in and outside of computer science.</p>



<p>In the early 1960s, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> was investing in different projects that could be used to fight the Soviets. The agency, only a few years old, had been founded just four months after Sputnik’s October 1957 launch. Its <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/timeline/creation-of-darpa">express mission</a> was to maintain the US’s technological (military) superiority over other nations. With an initial <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23406949">budget of $400 million dollars</a> (about $3.7 billion in 2020 dollars), the agency had few limits.</p>

<p>One such project that received ARPA funding was the politically named Project MAC (Mathematics and Computation) out of MIT. Established by computer scientists Robert Fano and Fernando José Corbató in 1963, by calling the endeavor Project MAC <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Project-Mac">Fano and Corbató were able to attract researchers from existing labs</a> without anyone’s loyalties (or funding) being questioned.</p>



<p>Project MAC had multiple objectives, but its main focus was Corbató’s previous work on time-sharing systems. Though many strides in computer hardware and software had been made over the previous decade—the invention of the compiler<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, the use of the transistor computer<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>, and the creation of FORTRAN, LISP, and COBOL<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>—there were still struggles. Despite all the progress computing had made in the previous decade, compute-time—actually using the computer—remained cumbersome.</p>

<p>For efficiency, batch-processing was used for computation: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer/Time-sharing-and-minicomputers">decks of punch cards featuring multiple programs were encoded onto magnetic tape</a> and fed by an operator into a central computer for iterative processing. But while a computer read the program, <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/wya/AcademicComputing/text/earlytimesharing.html">its central processor remained idle: a waste of precious compute-time</a>. And, if errors occurred in a program itself, then hours had to be taken to debug it by hand.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> Even when the code was actually fixed, a program still had to be rewritten onto a new magnetic strip and subsequently rescheduled by an operator for computation. So frustrating was this process that <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/punched-cards/2/211/2253">in 1967 students at Stanford took to producing</a> a humorous (if dated) short film about the matter.</p>


<p>In recognizing how burdensome compute times were, Corbató laid out his plans for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090906104446/http://larch-www.lcs.mit.edu:8001/~corbato/sjcc62/">“the improvement of man-machine interaction by a process called time-sharing”</a> in a 1962 paper submitted to the International Federation of Information Processing (IFIP). Like many computer science-related projects of the time, time-sharing was a concept that emerged from military operations. In the late 1950s, the North American Air Defense Command (later known as NORAD) had begun operating a first-of-its-kind network of IBM-manufactured computers connected to near real-time radar data. The Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) air-defense system was unique, not only its capacity to detect Soviet missiles, but also <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~learnest/nets/timesharing.htm">in its ability to programmatically loop through its systems in as little as 2.5 seconds</a>. John McCarthy, a computer scientist from MIT who had seen a prototype of SAGE, was inspired enough to conceptualize a similarly fast system to be used by multiple programmers at once. <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/timesharing/timesharing.html">In a memo sent out to the MIT community, McCarthy outlined how such a shared-system would work</a>. Corbató, picking up the mantle, aimed to make tangible such a system. But, as so often happens with the popular usage of terms in computer science, even trying to communicate what Corbató meant by time-sharing became confusing.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> Corabtó explained the multiple meanings of time-sharing in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090906104446/http://larch-www.lcs.mit.edu:8001/~corbato/sjcc62/">his 1962 paper</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One can mean using different parts of the hardware at the same time for different tasks, or one can mean several persons making use of the computer at the same time. The first meaning, often called multiprogramming, is oriented towards hardware efficiency in the sense of attempting to attain complete utilization of all components. The second meaning of time-sharing, which is meant here, is primarily concerned with the efficiency of persons trying to use a computer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unlike the SAGE system which was a feat of multiprogramming, Corbató aimed to make real the latter definition with Project MAC. And, with the wind at their back and ARPA funding in their pockets, Corbató and his colleagues were able to succeed in this, compiling new commercially viable hardware and software systems such that multiple individuals could seamlesly submit code to a central processor. Users would access a mainframe computer remotely via their very own typewriter console. Constantly running in the background would be a multilevel queuing routine which would schedule program calls by priority: determining whether a submitted program was a foreground process or a background process. Once queued, these programs would then be operated by a Round-Robin algorithm<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> that ran queued programs for set slices of time, in this case approximately .2 seconds, which Corbató estimated was the speed of human reactivity.</p>

<p>An example of the Round-Robin algorithm can be seen in the first chart below. Given a program  that takes  seconds to run, each program is run for a length of time . If <span> p &gt; q</span> then after  seconds  is paused, sent back to the queue with time  left, and set to continue running once it reaches the head of the queue again. This process continues until all programs in the queue have fully completed. The benefits of the Round-Robin algorithm, and why it was used with the advent of time-sharing computers, was the priority response time took in computing, <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/cpu-sched.pdf">where response time is the time difference between when a programmer enters a program into a queue and when it begins to first run.</a> Recall that programmers wanted to start their programs as soon as possible in order to reduce CPU idle time. As can be seen, as the slice of time decreases to the left of the x-axis, the number of iterations—or loops through the queue—increase exponentially on the y-axis. As the length of the time slice increases to the right of the x-axis the number of iterations decrease on the y-axis. This is the case for all three different programs of length 10, 35, and 100 seconds.</p>

<p>Now for a larger example. We will make an extremely simple "messenger". The messenger is a program which allows users to log in on different nodes and send simple messages to each other.</p>
<p>Before we start, let's note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This example will just show the message passing logic no attempt at all has been made to provide a nice graphical user interface - this can of course also be done in LFE - but that's another tutorial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This sort of problem can be solved more easily if you use the facilities in OTP, which will also provide methods for updating code on the fly etc. But again, that's another tutorial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first program we write will contain some inadequacies as regards handling of nodes which disappear, we will correct these in a later version of the program.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will set up the messenger by allowing "clients" to connect to a central server and say who and where they are. I.e. a user won't need to know the name of the Erlang node where another user is located to send a message.</p>
<p>File <code>messenger.lfe</code>:</p>
<pre><code>;;; Message passing utility.
;;; User interface:
;;; (logon name)
;;;     One user at a time can log in from each Erlang node in the
;;;     system messenger: and choose a suitable name. If the name
;;;     is already logged in at another node or if someone else is
;;;     already logged in at the same node, login will be rejected
;;;     with a suitable error message.
;;; (logoff)
;;;     Logs off anybody at at node
;;; (message to-name message)
;;;     sends message to to-name. Error messages if the user of this
;;;     function is not logged on or if to-name is not logged on at
;;;     any node.
;;;
;;; One node in the network of Erlang nodes runs a server which maintains
;;; data about the logged on users. The server is registered as "messenger"
;;; Each node where there is a user logged on runs a client process registered
;;; as "mess-client"
;;;
;;; Protocol between the client processes and the server
;;; ----------------------------------------------------
;;;
;;; To server: (tuple client-pid 'logon user-name)
;;; Reply #(messenger stop user-exists-at-other-node) stops the client
;;; Reply #(messenger logged-on) logon was successful
;;;
;;; To server: (tuple client-pid 'logoff)
;;; Reply: #(messenger logged-off)
;;;
;;; To server: (tuple client-pid 'logoff)
;;; Reply: no reply
;;;
;;; To server: (tuple client-pid 'message-to to-name message) send a message
;;; Reply: #(messenger stop you-are-not-logged-on) stops the client
;;; Reply: #(messenger receiver-not-found) no user with this name logged on

<p>To use this program you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>configure the server_node() function</li>
<li>copy the compiled code (<code>essenger.beam</code> to the directory on each computer where you start Erlang.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following example of use of this program, I have started nodes on four different computers, but if you don't have that many machines available on your network, you could start up several nodes on the same machine.</p>
<p>We start up four Erlang nodes, messenger@super, c1@bilbo, c2@kosken, c3@gollum.</p>
<p>First we start up a the server at messenger@super:</p>
<pre><code>(messenger@super)lfe&gt; (messenger:start-server)
true
</code></pre>
<p>Now Peter logs on at c1@bilbo:</p>
<pre><code>(c1@bilbo)lfe&gt; (messenger:logon 'peter)
true
logged-on
</code></pre>
<p>James logs on at c2@kosken:</p>
<pre><code>(c2@kosken)lfe&gt; (messenger:logon 'james)
true
logged-on
</code></pre>
<p>and Fred logs on at c3@gollum:</p>
<pre><code>(c3@gollum)lfe&gt; (messenger:logon 'fred)
true
logged-on
</code></pre>
<p>Now Peter sends Fred a message:</p>
<pre><code>(c1@bilbo)lfe&gt; (messenger:message 'fred "hello")
ok
sent
</code></pre>
<p>And Fred receives the message and sends a message to Peter and logs off:</p>
<pre><code>Message from peter: "hello"
(c3@gollum)lfe&gt; (messenger:message 'peter "go away, I'm busy")
ok
sent
(c3@gollum)lfe&gt; (messenger:logoff)
logoff
</code></pre>
<p>James now tries to send a message to Fred:</p>
<pre><code>(c2@kosken)lfe&gt; (messenger:message 'fred "peter doesn't like you")
ok
receiver-not-found
</code></pre>
<p>But this fails as Fred has already logged off.</p>
<p>First let's look at some of the new concepts we have introduced.</p>
<p>There are two versions of the <code>server-transfer</code> function, one with four arguments (<code>server-transfer/4</code>) and one with five (<code>server_transfer/5</code>). These are regarded by LFE as two separate functions.</p>
<p>Note how we write the <code>server</code> function so that it calls itself, <code>(server user-list)</code> and thus creates a loop. The Erlang-LFE compiler is "clever" and optimises the code so that this really is a sort of loop and not a proper function call. But this only works if there is no code after the call, otherwise the compiler will expect the call to return and make a proper function call. This would result in the process getting bigger and bigger for every loop.</p>
<p>We use functions in the <code>lists</code> module. This is a very useful module and a study of the manual page is recommended (erl -man lists). <code>(lists:keymember key position lists)</code> looks through a list of tuples and looks at <code>position</code> in each tuple to see if it is the same as <code>key</code>. The first element is position 1. If it finds a tuple where the element at <code>position</code> is the same as <code>key</code>, it returns <code>true</code>, otherwise <code>false</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; (lists:keymember 'a 2 '(#(x y z) #(b b b) #(b a c) #(q r s)))
true
&gt; (lists:keymember 'p 2 '(#(x y z) #(b b b) #(b a c) #(q r s)))
false
</code></pre>
<p><code>lists:keydelete</code> works in the same way but deletes the first tuple found (if any) and returns the remaining list:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; (lists:keymember 'a 2 '(#(x y z) #(b b b) #(b a c) #(q r s)))
(#(x y z) #(b b b) #(q r s))
</code></pre>
<p><code>lists:keyfind</code> is like <code>lists:keymember</code>, but it returns the tuple found or the atom <code>false</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; (lists:keyfind 'a 2 '(#(x y z) #(b b b) #(b a c) #(q r s)))
#(b a c)
&gt; (lists:keyfind 'p 2 '(#(x y z) #(b b b) #(b a c) #(q r s)))
false
</code></pre>

<p> Just yesterday, the book <a href="http://momtestbook.com/">The Mom Test</a> gave me a swift kick in the pants with this quote:</p>



<blockquote><p>For unpleasant tasks, imagine what you would have someone else do if you were delegating it. Then do that.</p><cite>Rob Fitzpatrick, “The Mom Test”</cite></blockquote>



<p>I immediately fell in love with this concept. Let’s dig into it by first looking up the definition of the word “delegate”:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>delegate: </strong><em>verb</em> – entrust (a task or responsibility) to another person, typically one who is less senior than oneself</p><cite>Oxford English Dictionary</cite></blockquote>



<p>That last part is key. If I’m giving a task to someone less senior than me, I lay it out with subtasks and any other info they may need.</p>



<p>This jives well with a favorite philosophy of mine, which is that <em>I should treat future-me as another person</em>. It’s like, when I’m staying at someone else’s house, I’m more likely to pick up after myself and make my bed and generally be super respectful. If I treat future-me as another person, I can trick my brain into doing all those things for myself.</p>



<p>So to delegate something to myself, what I’m really doing is treating future-me as a different, less senior person. I’m <em>tricking my brain into doing some planning</em> for this unpleasant task, which makes it much less unpleasant when I’m actually doing it. I’m being more respectful to future-me.</p>



<p>For example, say I need new tires. Instead of just putting “new tires” on my todo list, I can delegate it (to myself). When I’m delegating to someone less senior, I probably want to split it up into specific subtasks, like:</p>



<ul><li>Call tire shop (867-5309)</li><li>Make an appointment to bring in my car</li><li>Block off my calendar during that time</li></ul>



<p>My favorite todo list app Amazing Marvin calls these types of tasks “tasty tasks”:</p>



<blockquote><p>A tasty task is one that you immediately want to do when you look at it. This happens when it’s super clear what the task entails and you feel confident that you can actually complete the task.</p><cite><a href="https://blog.amazingmarvin.com/three-simple-rules-writing-great-tasks-to-do-list/">Amazing Marvin blog</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>See how “Call tire shop (867-5309)” is a tastier task than just “New tires”? That’s one reason I love this self delegation concept.</p>



<p>The other reason I love it is that it makes me less likely to take lazy shortcuts. If I wouldn’t tolerate those shortcuts from the person I delegate the work to, then I can’t tolerate them from myself either.</p>



<p> So watch me crack the whip on myself! Observe as I put myself to work and don’t take no crap from myself!</p>



<blockquote><p>Anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, alright?</p><cite>Dwight Schrute</cite></blockquote>

<p>Good news on the adoption of <a href="https://www.mailhardener.com/kb/smtp-tls-reporting">SMTP TLS reporting</a>: since the 25th of August 2020, we are seeing SMTP TLS reports being sent by Microsoft!</p>
<p>After Google, Comcast, and SocketLabs, Microsoft is now the fourth major email service that is sending <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8460" target="_blank" rel="external">RFC8460</a> SMTP TLS reports. </p>
<p>The support for SMTP TLS reporting from Microsoft did come as a bit of a surprise to us, as Microsoft is the only major email provider that is not yet sending <a href="https://www.mailhardener.com/kb/dmarc">DMARC</a> reports.
Nonetheless, would we like to thank Microsoft for embracing this standard, and massive congratulations to the developers at Microsoft who made this possible!</p>

<p>We are excited to see the adoption of SMTP TLS reporting growing steadily, as TLS related email issues are hard to monitor. SMTP TLS reporting also paves the way for broad adoption of <a href="https://www.mailhardener.com/kb/mta-sts">MTA-STS</a>.</p>

				<div>
<p>After decades of work, scientists used Chandrayaan 1 and NASA’s LCROSS to finally discover water on the Moon in 2009. In the 10 years since, the next step has been to understand the exact nature of and the amount of water the Moon hosts. This is where NASA’s LRO and <a href="https://jatan.space/chandrayaan-2-is-creating-the-highest-resolution-map-of-the-moon/">ISRO’s Chandrayaan 2 orbiter</a> come in.</p>



<p>For most of the 20th century, scientists argued the Moon’s surface was bone-dry. The 382 kg of rock and soil samples the Apollo missions brought from the Moon to Earth attested to this. When they did find traces of water in the samples, scientists dismissed them as contamination. The Moon has a very thin atmosphere, so any water on its surface is exposed directly to the vacuum of space, and evaporates. And due to the Moon’s low gravity, water vapor quickly escapes into space.</p>



<p>However, there are certain regions on the Moon that haven’t received sunlight for more than a billion years, and where scientists think the water can be. On the lunar poles, the Sun is very close to the local horizon throughout the day so even a small feature, like a rock, can cast very long shadows. Likewise, large craters with terraced edges can easily block sunlight from entering the crater, so sunlight is blocked a full 360°. Such places are eternally dark and are called permanently shadowed regions (PSRs).</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/11556-psrs-nasa-lro.gif?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="338" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Permanently shadowed regions on the lunar south pole, highlighted in blue. <a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4043">Credit: NASA LRO</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>But where could the water have come from?</p>



<p>Scientists know that comets and many types of asteroids contain water. For most of the Solar System’s existence, these objects have been bombarding planets and their moons at a vigorous pace. This is why the Moon is covered in craters, and scientists think the asteroids and comets responsible for them could have deposited water on the Moon. They have proposed that some fraction of this water could have found its way into PSRs, where – like sitting inside a refrigerator – they could’ve been preserved for billions of years.</p>



<p>In 1994, NASA launched the Clementine lunar orbiter. Its <a href="https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1994-004A-09">Bistatic Radar Experiment</a> beamed radio signals straight into the PSRs. The signals bounced off the PSRs and were received by ground stations on Earth. Scientists found the nature of the reflected signals to be consistent with water ice, although they couldn’t be 100% sure.</p>



<p>NASA sent another orbiter in 1998, called the Lunar Prospector, to find out if there was water ice in the PSRs. Its neutron spectrometer found that the number of neutrons in the soil corresponded with the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/14apr_moonwater.html">presence of hydrogen atoms</a>. Could these hydrogen atoms be part of water molecules?</p>



<p>Armed with Clementine and Lunar Prospector data, scientists were almost certain that there was water on the Moon, but they needed to be absolutely sure.</p>



<h3>Water on the Moon indeed</h3>



<p>In 2008, India forayed into planetary exploration with the Chandrayaan 1 lunar orbiter, for which ISRO <a href="https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2006/pdf/1704.pdf">solicited instruments</a> from scientists around the world. NASA pitched and built two of these, named MiniSAR and M3.</p>



<p>The Miniature Synthetic Aperture Radar (Mini-SAR) <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Mini-RF/multimedia/feature_ice_like_deposits.html">also found</a> that the PSRs reflected signals in patterns consistent with water ice, from more than 40 polar craters. But just like with Clementine, the data wasn’t 100% certain.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="1204" src="https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/c2356-mini-sar-finds-water-ice.jpg?resize=1200%2C1204&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Likely water ice on the Moon’s north pole (marked by green circles) found by Chandrayaan 1 instrument Mini-SAR. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Mini-RF/multimedia/feature_ice_like_deposits.html">Credit: NASA</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The Moon Mineralogical Mapper (M3), an infrared spectrometer, would go on to clinch the prize. M3 detected not just water in the PSRs but <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7218">could also differentiate between ice, liquid water and water vapor</a> based on how the surface absorbed infrared light. M3 confirmed that the Moon hosted water once and for all.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="675" src="https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3cc0f-water-ice-moon-map-m3.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Distribution of water ice on the lunar poles mapped by Chandrayaan 1 instrument M3. <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7218">Credit: NASA</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The Chandrayaan 1 orbiter also carried an impact probe – a craft that intentionally crashed near a PSR on the Moon’s south pole. As it descended, its mass spectrometer instrument <a href="http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2010/2430.html">detected water molecules</a> in the thin but persistent lunar atmosphere.</p>



<p>However, ISRO didn’t publish the results until NASA announced that Mini-SAR and M3 had discovered lunar water. ISRO then <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/MIP-detected-water-on-Moon-way-back-in-June-ISRO-Chairman/article16883362.ece">claimed</a> that their instrument had detected water on the Moon first.</p>



<h3>Not that dry</h3>



<p>All this time, scientists had been developing ideas about how the Moon could have water on other parts as well, not just at or near the poles. The Sun emits a constant stream of protons, some of which strike the Moon. Most of these protons are reflected into space but some are absorbed. Scientists thought the oxygen in the soil could interact with the absorbed protons to produce water, and that they should be able to detect the water molecules from orbit.</p>



<p>NASA’s Cassini spacecraft flew by the Moon in 1999, en route to Saturn. Its infrared spectrometer <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/topics/moonmars/features/clark1.html">found water-bearing minerals</a> at most latitudes on the Moon, with a higher concentration at the poles.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/b0d3d-cassini-moon-water.jpg?resize=392%2C295&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="392" height="295" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Detection of water-bearing and hydroxyl-bearing minerals on the Moon by Cassini’s infrared spectrometer. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/topics/moonmars/features/clark1.html">Credit: NASA</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The results were in stark contrast to the bone-dry Apollo samples. One reason could be that most Apollo landing sites were near the equator, so high daytime temperatures at these sites might have evaporated the water. However, they didn’t publish the findings for a decade, until Chandrayaan 1 happened.</p>



<p>The European Space Agency’s instrument onboard Chandrayaan 1, SARA, analyzed protons reflected by the lunar surface. Like Cassini, SARA <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091015091605.htm">found water/hydroxyl groups</a> in the lunar soil. The discovery proved timely for ESA’s BepiColombo mission to study Mercury, which carries two similar instruments for detecting water. Chandrayaan 1’s M3 detected water and hydroxyl molecules almost everywhere on the Moon too.</p>



<p>In addition to water ice in the PSRs and water molecules in the lunar soil, M3 found a third water source, which came as a surprise. M3 had imaged the Bullialdus crater, one of the many large craters that boast central mountains. These mountains contain material excavated from deep within the Moon’s crust.</p>







<p>M3 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130220235318/http://lunarscience.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/38_Klima_NLSI_2012.pdf">found water-bearing minerals</a> in the central mountain but not in the area surrounding it. These traces of water provided informed scientists’ ideas about the Moon’s interior.</p>



<p>Scientists now knew that the lunar soil does hold trace amounts of water even in the non-polar regions. Note that it’s still less water than the driest deserts on Earth. However, the PSRs on the lunar poles host appreciably more water.</p>



<h3>LRO and Chandrayaan 2</h3>



<p>In 2009, NASA launched the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO). It also <a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4043">detected water ice on the lunar poles</a> using both the onboard radar and the <a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4057">neutron spectrometer</a>. LRO has been orbiting the Moon for over 10 years now, longer than any other orbiter. The LRO team has published an extensive <a href="http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/psr">atlas of PSRs</a>, laying the groundwork for future exploration and settlement on the Moon.</p>



<p>Like Chandrayaan 1’s impact probe, LRO carried an impactor too, called LCROSS. In 2009, its upper stage deliberately impacted one of the PSRs on the lunar south pole. The other half of LCROSS followed and studied the plume of moondust the crash kicked up. It was found to <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010Sci...330..463C/abstract">contain 155 kg of water</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>



<p>From this result, scientists estimated all the PSRs together contained <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Mini-RF/multimedia/feature_ice_like_deposits.html">more than 600 billion kg</a> of water ice, equivalent to at least 240,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://jatan.space/chandrayaan-2-is-creating-the-highest-resolution-map-of-the-moon/">Chandrayaan 2 orbiter</a>’s instruments intend to extend our knowledge of water on the Moon. They include an enhanced infrared spectrometer and an upgraded radar, called the DFSAR.</p>



<p>The infrared spectrometer will build a global, high-resolution map of water concentrations in the lunar soil and determine which water-bearing minerals are present. Chandrayaan 2’s long-term observations aim to discern how the water content in the lunar soil changes in response to the lunar environment.</p>



<p>The DFSAR will map the water ice in the PSRs. With twice as much penetration depth and higher resolution, DFSAR will quantify the amount of water trapped in these cold regions, something no one has adequately done yet.</p>



<h3>What’s next?</h3>



<p>The lunar science and exploration communities agree that we can harness water ice on the Moon for future lunar habitats. Using solar power generated by the habitats, we can also split the water ice into hydrogen and oxygen for use as rocket fuel. To that end, Blue Origin, the spaceflight company owned by Jeff Bezos, has <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-announces-new-tipping-point-partnerships-for-moon-and-mars-technologies">snagged a $10 million NASA contract</a> for their lunar lander.</p>



<p>But before we plan habitats at the Moon’s poles, we need to know more about the nature of water ice in these regions. The LRO and the Chandrayaan 2 orbiters are expected to fill these gaps.</p>



<p>ISRO has stated that Chandrayaan 2 will orbit the Moon for seven years and that should be ample time to fully map and quantify water on the lunar surface. However, let’s not forget that Chandrayaan 1 had a design life of two years but failed after only 10 months.</p>



<p>Surface missions that explore PSRs, like NASA’s upcoming <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/new-viper-lunar-rover-to-map-water-ice-on-the-moon">VIPER</a> rover, are the next logical step towards sustainable habitats on the Moon. As we develop technologies that tap into water ice, we can <a href="https://jatan.space/the-moon-as-a-rocket-platform/">settle on not just the Moon but the whole solar system</a>. We should be glad our nearest neighbor has plenty of it; we can’t keep dragging everything out of Earth’s gravitational pull for eternity.</p>

The proposal to introduce secret contracts to mainnet will be made on <strong>September 8th, 2020.</strong> If passed by the community, the secret contracts network upgrade would take place on <strong>September 15th, 2020.</strong></p><p id="108d">This proposed upgrade would make Secret Network<strong> the first layer-one blockchain to enable general purpose private computation across a distributed system of nodes equipped with secure enclaves. </strong>For the first time, developers will be able to build and deploy “secret” smart contracts that can utilize encrypted inputs, outputs, and state. At the same time, we’re building connections to Ethereum, Cosmos Hub, and other networks, intending to bring our capacity for “programmable privacy” to the entire blockchain universe.</p><blockquote><p id="770d"><em>Simply put: </em><strong><em>Secret Network brings privacy to public blockchains.</em></strong></p></blockquote><p id="2a96">Essentially, Secret Contracts enable anyone to use their private data in decentralized applications without revealing the raw data.<strong> Data being used in computations throughout Secret Network simply can’t be public.</strong></p><p id="b1c3">This event is the culmination of years of research and development work.

Applications built on distributed networks enjoy the benefit of being robust, unstoppable, censorship-resistant, and transparent. For this reason, blockchains have been a key piece of the decentralized web vision.</p><p id="3bf0">But all blockchains, and by extension smart contracts deployed on them, have one glaring and near-fatal problem — <em>all data stored on them is public.</em><strong> In that sense, traditional blockchains are worse than anything that came before them.</strong> Instead of trusting a single organization (e.g., Facebook, Google, your bank, etc.) with your data, now you have to trust everyone. For all intents and purposes, data on the blockchain becomes public domain.</p><p id="7661">But what if you could program smart contracts that not only solved for correctness, but also for privacy? What if you could have encrypted inputs and outputs as well as network state, keeping it hidden from all parties, including the nodes executing the smart contract? With these new types of contracts, users and applications can operate in an environment where it’s safe to include sensitive data, which most real-world use cases require. This is the concept of “secret” smart contracts that Secret Network introduces.</p><p id="38b3"><a href="https://blog.scrt.network/programmable-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secret contracts allow for programmable privacy,</a> allowing for arbitrarily complex data privacy controls to be implemented inside applications.

At the time, the network was known as the <em>Enigma Blockchain. </em>The network is based on Tendermint / Cosmos SDK and features a native coin — Secret (SCRT) — used for staking, governance, and network fees. Today, Secret Network has over forty active mainnet validators!</p><p id="7b0e">In May, a proposal was made to <a href="https://blog.scrt.network/introducing-secret-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebrand the network as “Secret Network.”</a> This proposal passed with unanimous approval on May 17th, 2020. The logic behind this naming was simple: with concepts like secret nodes and secret contracts well established in the ecosystem, and with a native coin known as SCRT, it was only natural to align the network’s branding entirely around “Secret.” Plus, since the project was now being supported by many independent entities and not a single development company, the community felt the network’s naming should reflect this fact.</p><p id="ad5f"><a href="https://youtu.be/Jk7kV1ph-FQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">But as we explained in a recent video</a>, there’s a deeper meaning behind the word “secret” — one that is very resonant for our community.</p><blockquote><p id="27f1"><em>A secret is something that you don’t want to share with everyone, but still want to share with people you choose to trust. A secret is something that you want to keep protected — not because it’s something bad, but because it’s something valuable. We call this network “Secret” because it allows developers and users to protect valuable data while still enabling them to share and compute it when, how, and with whomever they choose. </em>Secret Network is where these important concepts of privacy, freedom, and consent coincide.</p></blockquote><p id="5094">In June, we reached another exciting milestone: <a href="https://blog.scrt.network/secret-contracts-update-milestone-3-of-3-is-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the completion of code for secret contracts!</a> This allows CosmWasm smart contracts to run with encryption inside secure enclaves, making the magic of secret contracts possible.</p><p id="8551">With the completion of this code, we launched the <a href="https://blog.scrt.network/announcing-the-secret-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secret Games</a> in July — a series of incentivized testnets designed to test secret contracts in the wild! We split this into two phases: <a href="https://blog.scrt.network/secret-games-update-testnet-phase-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phase 1,</a> an invitation-only testnet capped at fifteen participants, and <a href="https://blog.scrt.network/secret-games-update-incentivized-testnet-phase-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phase 2,</a> open to all participants! Phase 1 brought incredible participation and feedback from many experienced and talented validators, including Staked, Figment, Chorus One, Dokia Capital, Iqlusion, Outlier Ventures, Chainflow, Hashquark, B-Harvest, Mitera BV, and more. Phase 2 has been a huge success, with <a href="https://explorer.pub.testnet.enigma.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 80 validators connecting to the testnet</a>.</p><p id="bc45">These testnets allowed validators not only to get valuable experience supporting Secret Network, but also with deploying and utilizing secret contracts. Participants played “Secret Hold’em,” entered a “Secret Raffle,” and tested out “Secret Tokens” (more on this below).</p><p id="53f3">We’re excited to say that these testnets have not uncovered any critical unaddressed issues, which means we are ready to move to our most critical milestone for secret contracts: <strong>integration with the Secret Network mainnet.</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3512/0*akaE4wZen11cC1C4.png" width="1756" height="1170" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*akaE4wZen11cC1C4.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*akaE4wZen11cC1C4.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*akaE4wZen11cC1C4.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1456/0*akaE4wZen11cC1C4.png 728w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1632/0*akaE4wZen11cC1C4.png 816w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1808/0*akaE4wZen11cC1C4.png 904w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1984/0*akaE4wZen11cC1C4.png 992w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*akaE4wZen11cC1C4.png 1000w" sizes="1000px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*akaE4wZen11cC1C4.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p id="c976">The Enigma development team plans to make an <a href="https://blog.scrt.network/secret-network-governance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on-chain proposal</a> on September 8th, 2020 to upgrade the network to include secret contracts. If this proposal has reached approval after the usual seven day voting period has expired, <strong>secret contracts will be LIVE on Secret Network on September 15th, 2020!</strong></p><p id="3786">With this launch our attention will turn to mass adoption: onboarding new secret contract developers, secret node operators, and community members who are passionate about securing and scaling the nascent decentralized web. With the support of the Secret Foundation and community committees, we will be working to produce more educational materials and documentation that help expand our ecosystem and build more bridges to the rest of the blockchain universe!</p><p id="a446">Excitingly, we will be launching some of the first secret contracts alongside this mainnet upgrade, including “<a href="https://blog.scrt.network/secret-tokens-programmable-privacy-for-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secret tokens.</a>” This is a powerful idea that applies our network’s capability for “<a href="https://blog.scrt.network/programmable-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">programmable privacy</a>” to the world of decentralized finance. <strong>Secret tokens are programmable, privacy-preserving tokens — programmable like ERC20s, but private like zCash. Most importantly,</strong> <strong>secret tokens create network effects for privacy, providing the missing piece for DeFi mass adoption</strong>.</p><p id="ea94">With secret tokens, each DeFi user actually gains more privacy with each additional DeFi service and every dollar worth of additional value locked in the ecosystem, leading to privacy network effects. The reason for this is that the aggregate liquidity across all DeFi applications directly quantifies the level of privacy you obtain (this is also known as the anonymity set). Think about these privacy gains like vaccination: the more people who inoculate themselves by using Secret Network to protect their privacy, the more benefits everyone else in the Secret DeFi ecosystem can gain.</p><p id="46db">Our first implementation of secret tokens allows you to deposit X amount of SCRT (which is not private by itself) and instead obtain X amount of “secretSCRT” — the privacy-preserving Secret Token version of SCRT. The same could be done for any asset in the Cosmos ecosystem utilizing IBC, and in the future could support assets from Ethereum and other ecosystems.</p><p id="ce4b">Learn more <a href="https://blog.scrt.network/secret-tokens-programmable-privacy-for-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>:</p><p id="3093">After the mainnet upgrade, the Enigma development team and the Secret Network ecosystem will be focusing on adding products and functionality that strengthen the position of the Secret Network in supporting the decentralized web. We’ve been actively exploring some key products related to our expansion of the Secret DeFi ecosystem, and there’s already working code on internal testnets. You can expect these to be announced and explored on the Secret Blog in the near future!</p><p id="6f52">You may be wondering whether we expect an explosion of native assets on the Secret Network. While that’s a long-term goal for us, in the short-run, we are focused on building bridges to Ethereum, Cosmos Hub, and other blockchain ecosystems. <strong>One of Secret Network’s primary advantages is its interoperability.</strong> These bridges will allow assets in other ecosystems to be turned into privacy tokens based on the SecretToken standard, allowing us to bring programmable privacy to Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems. This will enable privacy preserving synthetic assets on Secret Network, such as secretETH, secretDAI and secretATOM to be used in DeFi products and utilized with full privacy.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="4912">We now must give a huge thank you to every community member who has been a part of this long and challenging journey to the present …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

Composite lets the client treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly”. This seems over-complicated to me. So, I would not go into tree-leaf kind of jargon. Rather I directly saw you 2 or 3 different ways to implement Composite Design Pattern in Modern C++. But in simple words, the Composite Design Pattern is a Structural Design Pattern with a goal <strong><em>to treat the group of objects in the same manner as a single object</em></strong>.</p><p>By the way, If you haven’t check out my other articles on Structural Design Patterns, then here is the list:</p><ol><li><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.vishalchovatiya.com/adapter-design-pattern-in-modern-cpp/" target="_blank"><span>Adapter</span></a></strong></li><li><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.vishalchovatiya.com/bridge-design-pattern-in-modern-cpp/" target="_blank"><span>Bridge</span></a></strong></li><li><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.vishalchovatiya.com/composite-design-pattern-in-modern-cpp/" target="_blank"><span>Composite</span></a> </strong></li><li><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.vishalchovatiya.com/decorator-design-pattern-in-modern-cpp/" target="_blank"><span>Decorator</span></a> </strong></li><li><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.vishalchovatiya.com/facade-design-pattern-in-modern-cpp/" target="_blank"><span>Facade</span></a></strong></li><li><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.vishalchovatiya.com/flyweight-design-pattern-in-modern-cpp/" target="_blank"><span>Flyweight</span></a> </strong></li><li><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.vishalchovatiya.com/proxy-design-pattern-in-modern-cpp/" target="_blank"><span>Proxy</span></a></strong></li></ol><p>The code snippets you see throughout this series of articles are simplified not sophisticated. So you often see me not using keywords like <code>override</code>, <code>final</code>, <code>public</code>(while inheritance) just to make code compact &amp; consumable(most of the time) in single standard screen size. I also prefer <code>struct</code> instead of <code>class</code> just to save line by not writing “<code>public:</code>” sometimes and also miss <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="virtual destructor (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.vishalchovatiya.com/part-3-all-about-virtual-keyword-in-c-how-virtual-destructor-works/" target="_blank"><span>virtual destructor</span></a>, constructor, <a href="http://www.vishalchovatiya.com/all-about-copy-constructor-in-cpp-with-example/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="copy constructor (opens in a new tab)"><span>copy constructor</span></a>, prefix <code>std::</code>, deleting dynamic memory, intentionally.

Well, we know that objects typically use other objects fields or properties or members through either inheritance or composition.</li><li>For example, in drawing applications, you have a <code>Shape</code>(e.g. <code>Circle</code>) that you can draw on the screen but you can also have a group of <code>Shape</code>s(e.g. <code>vector&lt;Circle&gt;</code>) which inherits from a collection <code>Shape</code>.</li><li>And they have certain common API which you can then call on one or the other without knowing in advance whether you’re working with a single element or with the entire collection.</li></ul><h2><span id="Composite_Design_Pattern_Examples_in_C">Composite Design Pattern Examples in C++</span></h2><ul><li>So if you think about an application such as PowerPoint or any kind of vector drawing application you know that you can draw &amp; drag individual shapes around.</li><li>But you can also group shapes together.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>(Bloomberg) --Germanyâ€™s blame game over Wirecard AGâ€™s collapse is focusing in on the question of why authorities failed to take a harder look at the payments company before it became the countryâ€™s biggest accounting scandal in living memory.</p>

<p>Lawmakers are questioning a top adviser to Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday in Berlin before grilling financial industry watchdogs the following day as the fraud that burned investors engulfs the countryâ€™s political establishment. If the hearings go badly, parliament may start a deeper investigation as the country prepares for the post-Merkel era with an election due next year.</p>

<p>Wirecardâ€™s crash from rising star to national disgrace has undermined the countryâ€™s reputation as a reliable place to do business and delivered a major blow to its fragile base of retail investors. While the government is taking action to prevent a repeat, authorities have struggled to dispel the impression that they were more focused on protecting Wirecard than investigating allegations of wrongdoing.</p>

<p>â€œWirecard had a strong political lobby that reached all the way into the chancellery,â€� Florian Toncar, a member of the opposition Free Democrats, told reporters Monday before the hearing. â€œThere have been such failings at the core of financial supervision that a full parliamentary inquiry will be necessary.â€�</p>

<p>At the heart of the issue is whether German officials knowingly turned a blind eye because of the prospects of establishing a home-grown technology leader. Wirecard boasted that it would revolutionize payments with faster electronic transactions and more services for consumers and companies.</p>

<p>Those ambitions collapsed when it filed for insolvency in June after saying that a quarter of its balance sheet didnâ€™t exist. German prosecutors subsequently said that Wirecardâ€™s 3.2 billion euros (US$3.8 billion) of debt are most likely lost. The scandal has drawn comparisons to FlowTex Technologie GmbH, which caused 1.8 billion euros of damage by selling non-existent drilling systems to leasing companies in the 1990s.</p>

<p>The committee will also address why German anti-money laundering authorities didnâ€™t follow up on notifications involving Wirecard. The countryâ€™s Financial Intelligence Unit told the government earlier this month that itâ€™s re-examining more than 1,000 reports of suspicious activity involving Wirecard since June 2017.</p>

<p><strong>Close Connections</strong></p>

<p>The highlight on the first day of the hearing of parliamentâ€™s finance committee is testimony by Merkelâ€™s chief economic adviser, Lars-Hendrik Roeller, who rarely speaks publicly. He was the point person for the chancelleryâ€™s contact with Wirecard and will certainly be pressed on why Merkel promoted the companyâ€™s efforts to gain a Chinese license during a state visit in September 2019, even as allegations of irregularities swirled.</p>

<p>That support was part of broader efforts to get China to open its financial system and wouldnâ€™t have been provided if the government knew what it does today, Hendrik Hoppenstedt, a state minister in Merkelâ€™s office, told the committee Monday.</p>

<p>The issues surrounding Wirecard are a â€œheavy burdenâ€� for Germany as a financial center and need to be cleared up comprehensively, he said, according to parliamentâ€™s newsletter.</p>

<p>There are also issues relating to Merkelâ€™s interactions with Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg. In preparations for her trip to China, Merkel met with her former defense secretary, who resigned in disgrace in 2011 over plagiarism allegations, and discussed Wirecard. There are also concerns about the role German political insiders may have played in facilitating contacts for Wirecard.</p>

<p>Lawmakers also delved into what officials may have known about Jan Marsalek and his connections. The former Wirecard executive is at large and under the protection of the Russian secret service, Handelsblatt reported.</p>

<p>â€œWe learned that German intelligence services didnâ€™t have any information about Wirecardâ€™s work with international intelligence agencies,â€� Lisa Paus, a member of the opposition Greens party told reporters. â€œIâ€™m surprised how naive they were.â€�</p>

<p>Lawmakers from the parties that make up the government were also critical.</p>

<p>â€œThere are signs of striking failures at the Finance Ministry and the regulator,â€� said Hans Michelbach, a lawmaker from the CSU, the Bavarian sister party of Merkelâ€™s CDU.</p>

<p>Michelbach said Merkelâ€™s conservative bloc will decide whether a deeper investigation is necessary after the second day of hearings. The two parties hold the largest number of seats in parliament.</p>

<p>Senior officials from German financial watchdog BaFin and the Bundesbank will be in the hot seat on Tuesday. The focus then is likely to be on why they decided in 2017 that Wirecard was a technology company rather than a financial firm, allowing most of its operations to escape scrutiny by BaFin, which only directly oversees banks and insurers.</p>

<p><strong>Lacking Oversight</strong></p>

<p>BaFin has sought to head off criticism by saying that reclassifying Wirecard wouldnâ€™t have helped much in unearthing the fraud because it would have still relied on the companyâ€™s audited accounts. Still, lawmakers may ask BaFin President Felix Hufeld why his institutionâ€™s probes of Wirecardâ€™s banking unit failed to point to problems at the wider company.</p>

<p>Hufeld had a rocky time after an earlier hearing in July -- Finance Minister Olaf Scholz and Economy Minister Peter Altmaier were also called to testify -- and will probably be focused on getting the facts across more clearly while defending BaFinâ€™s actions.</p>

<p>The Bundesbank, whose role was largely limited to supporting BaFin in its oversight, was drawn deeper into the scandal with the disclosure this month that former Wirecard Chief Executive Officer Markus Braun met with a senior official at Germanyâ€™s central bank last year. While it isnâ€™t clear what was discussed, the meeting is a reminder of Wirecardâ€™s connections to the countryâ€™s top decision makers.</p>

							<p>Forget regulators. Consumer groups and campaigners who want to see their GDPR complaints wrapped up in a timely manner are increasingly turning to Europe's court system for results.</p>
<p>A nonprofit group is planning to <a href="https://globaldatareview.com/data-privacy/parents-urged-hand-over-details-tiktok-class-action" target="_blank">sue Chinese-owned app TikTok</a> in a Dutch court as EU regulators squabble over who has jurisdiction over the company. Oracle and Salesforce face <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1433676">legal complaints over privacy</a> in the U.K. and the Netherlands. And while the U.K. data regulator has spent more than a year grappling over a planned £99 million fine against hotel chain Marriott, a complainant has now <a href="https://www.martinbryant.net/marriott-data-breach-claim/" target="_blank">sued the company</a> over the same privacy breach.</p>
<p>The shift toward lawsuits hints at growing disappointment with a hydra-headed privacy system that counts dozens of EU regulators, but is still struggling to finalize a single major investigation more than two years after the GDPR came online.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1393749">France's regulator hit Google with a €50 million fine</a> in 2019, the grouping of European privacy watchdogs — which is meant to sign off on major regulatory action — has yet to do so for any major tech company despite dozens of open probes.</p>
<p>Much of the criticism lands on the doorstep of Ireland's Data Protection Commission, which is in charge of overseeing many of the biggest Silicon Valley companies. The watchdog finalized its first cross-border investigation of the GDPR era, targeting Twitter, in May. But the terms of that decision, which have not been made public, have triggered a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1437523">formal dispute between regulators</a>, delaying a final outcome by many more months.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Given the delays, this is certainly worth a go"<em> — Michael Veale, British computer scientist and privacy campaigner</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Fed up with delays, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1430736">consumer groups</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/irish-regulator-mismanaged-facebook-privacy-probe-austrian-campaigner-max-schrems/">privacy campaigners</a> are speaking out — and turning to the court system for speedier resolution of their complaints.</p>
<p>"Data protection law is primarily enforced by regulators, who have investigative powers, but in theory can be enforced directly by citizens in courts. Given the delays, this is certainly worth a go," said British computer scientist and privacy campaigner Michael Veale.</p>
<h3>Taking back control</h3>
<p>Rebecca Rumbul, a U.K. researcher and representative for a data protection claim <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1433676">against tech companies Oracle and Salesforce</a>, pointed to a range of weaknesses among regulators as the reason she decided to bring her complaint to the courts.</p>
<p>“They [regulators] don’t have the resources to investigate an individual complaint and take on a massive organization like Oracle,” she said.</p>
<p>It's not just the promise of a speedier resolution that is pushing complainants to shun regulators. Going to court gives them much more control over a case, as well as the ability to set a legal precedent once a verdict is rendered.</p>
<p>Filing a complaint with EU privacy regulators leads to years of wrangling that can end up with cases being bounced to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Regulators can also decide to settle complaints with the companies directly, cutting out the complainants.</p>
<p>"If you go straight to the court, you skip the first step [of going to a regulator], and you retain control over whether or not you settle," said Veale.</p>
<p>Another enticement is the fact that courts, unlike the regulatory process, offer the promise of compensation for victorious parties.</p>
<p>“Regulatory fines do not provide recompense to individuals who had their data stolen,” said Martin Bryant, who recently launched a data breach claim against the Marriott hotel chain. He added that his claim was meant to "complement" regulatory enforcement and act as a "deterrent."</p>
<h3>Next up: Class actions</h3>
<p>Collective legal claims — called class actions — have historically been far less common in Europe than in the United States, where the threshold for launching them tends to be lower. But that could be changing, including for privacy-focused cases.</p>
<p>“The right to claim immaterial damages in combination with mass action mechanisms may well lead to something very similar to a U.S.-style class action culture in Europe,” said German data protection lawyer Tim Wybitul.</p>
<p>He noted that a German court had recently awarded a claimant €5,000 because their former employer, a private company, allegedly failed to properly respond to an access to data request.</p>
<p>Before 2018, many EU jurisdictions did not allow people to claim compensation for data protection violations that did not harm them financially. The GDPR changed that.</p>
<p>The EU is also finalizing a new law called the Collective Redress Directive, which will boost the ability of consumers to bring data protection claims to court.</p>
<p>"EU collective redress rights may give this already explosive situation an additional boost. But in most countries there already are mechanisms in place to bundle claims for immaterial GDPR damages," Wybitul said.</p>

<p>Data breach class actions have also become<em> de rigueur</em> in the U.K., where a London court last year ruled that a case against Google tracking iPhone users could proceed, overturning a lower court's decision and <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=578002fe-476b-4204-a586-0e16c7f50a9f" target="_blank">potentially widening the scope of claims that can be brought under the GDPR</a>.</p>
<p>An April ruling in an English court <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1330995">also left the door open to companies being held liable for data breaches they aren't directly responsible for.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>Going directly to court opens up a new front in the fight against data protection abusers, but is not necessarily straightforward.</p>
<p>Courts might not yet be savvy enough to deal with technical data protection questions in the same way as regulators. Companies may choose to throw money at claimants in court rather than follow regulator orders to fix underlying issues with their practices.</p>
<p>Launching a court case also doesn't come cheap. Rumbul's case was only made possible by a litigation funder, for instance. And the influx of for-profit companies also raises questions about the motivation behind claims.</p>
<p>Class actions are a big business in the U.S., and according to Wybitul, European consumer lawyers and litigation funders seem to be waking up to the opportunities offered by claiming immaterial damages under the GDPR.</p>

<p><em>This article is part of a series on </em><a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/"><em>managing managers</em></a><em>.</em></p>



<p>When I was writing my <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/book/">book</a>, I referred to “skip-level meetings” in the text. My copyeditor left me a comment: “What are these? You’ve not mentioned them elsewhere.” It seems that I’ve also <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/management-101/performance-reviews/">previously mentioned</a> skip-level meetings <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/managing-through-interfaces/">twice</a> on this website without offering any explanation. I’m sorry about that. It seems that I’ve always assumed that people know what they are. So let’s change that.</p>



<p>Skip-level meetings are typically semi-frequent meetings between staff who have a layer in the org chart separating them. It’s a meeting between someone of a given depth <em>m </em>and another of depth <em>m+2</em>. In more relatable human terms, if you were a manager of managers, then a skip-level meeting might involve you having a meeting with one the individual contributors on your direct report’s team.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/f0MYVq4AmQJZbS2ihEyuyOICvEjGvDeXwq0CP0gIEqv9MWwTJDTW4jChZhVUXPcoqfGv8G48L9YB3tmErDvuM0r_x0VS8AwWncsWP7sA7M1i1E5LU-M5d2QI_A6BnefEA4GMjeay" alt=""></figure>



<p>Don’t worry, I can hear you already: “Another article about <em>more meetings?” </em>Well, yes. But skip-level meetings can pay dividends for you as a manager of managers. They build trust and break down barriers. But before we get into why they’re good, explore the frequency that you should do them, and suggest some example topics of conversation, I’d like to remind you of a particular scene in my favourite television show.</p>



<h2>These are for you, McNulty</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/growth/workplace-politics/">previous article</a> about workplace politics, we highlighted that in particularly old-fashioned workplaces, not going through the proper channels can be problematic. But what do I mean about the proper channels? Well, there is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUYuGNpOk5U">particularly memorable scene in The Wire</a> (warning: <em>extremely</em> strong language) where Jimmy McNulty, in his usual casually reckless way, talks to a judge about previous murder cases that he feels did not get solved properly. This results in the judge speaking to the Deputy, and then the Deputy calling the Major into his office to explain the situation that he knew nothing about. Hence all of the swearing and the punishment of all-night report writing.</p>



<p>The org chart – whether on purpose or not – can create the expectation of knowledge boundaries where the “proper” way of sharing information is to send it up and down the chain, as McNulty probably should have done with Rawls. However, we all know that this can be counter-productive, bureaucratic and just plain annoying. Sometimes it’s just easier to talk to the person you need to talk to, even if that person happens to be your manager’s manager.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So why not just have that happening as a regular arrangement? That’s what skip-level meetings are about. You can, with transparency, probe deeper to build rapport, uncover issues, and help your staff grow.</p>



<h2>Benefits</h2>



<p>There’s a number of benefits for having a culture of skip-level meetings, and those benefits are gained at both ends of the skip-level relationship.</p>



<p>Here are some reasons that skip-level meetings are good for you as a manager of managers:</p>



<ul><li><strong>They build rapport with the people in your org.</strong> Although you <em>could</em> <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/managing-through-interfaces/">manage entirely through the interface</a> of your managers, your impact, output and availability as a leader is greatly increased by building strong relationships with those in their teams as well.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>They show that you’re just another human.</strong> Sometimes people higher up in the org chart become shrouded in mystery: an important person with a fancy job title that they people aren’t allowed to talk to. However, that’s entirely false. You’re there for them as they fundamentally work for you, so you can show them that you’ve got their back and are open to talk.</li><li><strong>They give you additional insight into how your teams are doing.</strong> You don’t have to wait for performance reviews in order to gather a picture of how your teams are doing. By regularly speaking to the staff on those teams, you can build a better picture of how that team functions by looking at it from above and below.</li><li><strong>You get additional insight into how your direct report is performing. </strong>Related to the above, you can gently probe into how they feel about their peers and their manager and whether they and their team are getting the support that they need to succeed.</li><li><strong>They demonstrate that you value everyone, regardless of their position in the org chart. </strong>By making your time – your most precious commodity – available to more people, you show them that you truly value them. You also show that you don’t entertain politics, where information must always filter through the chain of people in the org chart.</li></ul>



<p>There’s also plenty of benefits for the other member of staff:</p>



<ul><li><strong>They open the door for fairness and transparency.</strong> By knowing that their manager’s manager has time for them, they know that their performance and path at the company isn’t only viewed through the lens of their own manager.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>They get an insight into what’s going on in other parts of the department and company.</strong> Being a couple of levels higher in the org chart, you’ll have access to interesting <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/vp-director-what/">operational or strategic</a> information about what’s going on in other teams, forming the bigger picture that they’re part of.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>They get a direct line to give feedback, raise concerns and suggest ideas. </strong>Maybe they’ve got suggestions about people, processes, product and tooling ideas that are beyond the scope of their manager to solve. However, you might be just the right person to pick these up and look into them.</li><li><strong>They demystify what goes on at a leadership level. </strong>They get the opportunity to lift the lid on what happens higher up the org chart by talking to you about what you spend your time on and what’s important. This not only builds rapport, but it gives them an insight into what the <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/management-101/the-two-tracks-of-growth/">management track</a> might hold for them in the future.</li><li><strong>They allow opportunities for more connections. </strong>You may know many more people in the department, so you could make a mentor or mentee connection across different teams, or introduce them to someone that has been working on similar problems before.</li></ul>



<p>So, hopefully I’ve convinced you that they’re a good idea. Now we should think about the practicalities of doing them.</p>



<h2>How often should you hold them?</h2>



<p>If you have many teams reporting into you, then that’s potentially a lot of people in order to arrange skip-level meetings with. If you’re already having weekly one-to-ones with your direct reports, then you could imagine your calendar becoming even more of a mess than it is already.</p>



<p>A way of tackling this conundrum is to list all of the people that are a skip-level away from you and then bucket them into different meeting intervals depending on the relationship that you want to form with them. I don’t recommend having skip-level meetings weekly, since you’ve already got your direct reports to meet with at that frequency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, you can consider the following intervals:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Fortnightly: </strong>A very small percentage of staff should be in this category. Perhaps you have a few superstars that you see growing quickly, or individuals who are at the core of an important initiative for the department that you wish to lend more support to.</li><li><strong>Monthly: </strong>This is a good “normal” cadence. 30 minutes once a month is a good amount of time to check in, catch up and discover what has been going on. Of course, you can always have follow up meetings if anything particularly interesting or worrying arises.</li><li><strong>Quarterly: </strong>Some individuals are less chatty, or may not particularly need or want your time (and you’ll know who these people are based on your initial conversations). Checking in once a quarter makes the arrangement more easy going, and enough time passes since you’ve last met for some topics of conversation to arise.</li><li><strong>Occasionally and/or on request: </strong>And of course, there may be members of your staff that prefer to have as few meetings as possible and may not get huge value from the relationship, and that’s perfectly fine. You can forgo a planned schedule and just let them grab you when they need you, or vice versa.</li></ul>



<p>The intervals that will suit various members of staff with ebb and flow with time, so don’t be afraid to switch it up depending on which projects you have running, or whether particular staff are going through a period of career growth or a difficult time. Be flexible and offer your support where needed, and work with your direct reports to get this information.</p>



<h2>Getting them started</h2>



<p>So, get those skip-level meetings kicked off. Before you start causing panic by booking in meetings without any context, perhaps you could send out something like this, after having let your direct report managers know that you’re going to do it.</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Hey everyone,</em> </p><p><em>I’m going to start doing skip-level meetings. There’s no bad reason for doing this, in fact, it’s very much for good reasons: I want to get to know you all better, understand what you’re working on more clearly, and – where I can – help you succeed.</em></p><p><em>What this means is that I’ll be booking in some semi-regular catch-ups where we can have a chat about whatever you want. It can be as formal or as informal as you like.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Perhaps we could talk about what you’re working on and what I’m working on, or what’s coming up in the future for our teams. We could touch on your career progression, or discuss any concerns that you have about your role or the company</em>. </p><p>Y<em>our manager knows that this is going to be happening, so don’t worry about that. Also, if you’d rather not do it because you feel you have enough meetings already, then that’s totally fine! Just let me know. But do know that you can come and chat to me at any time.</em></p><p><em>Best,</em></p><p><em>A. Manager</em></p></blockquote>



<p>This message is written from the viewpoint of a manager getting them underway. But what if you’re an IC and are interested in getting this kicked off? </p>



<p>I’d suggest you start small: speak to your manager about whether you can set up skip-level meetings with <em>their </em>manager. If they’re unsure as to why, then why not just direct them to this article?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if you’ve been directed to this article because someone would like to do skip-level meetings with you or your manager, what are …</p></div></div></article></div></div>

Late last year, we were faced with the challenge of modernizing our notifications system for end-users by making it fit for both the changing requirements of the industry, and our internal development teams. In this post, I’ll walk you through some of the considerations and learnings we encountered along the way. It will not be a deep dive into the language and its surrounding ecosystem, but instead I’ll offer a glimpse into how we approach language and technology evaluation and adoption.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In its then current state, our notification system was baked into some older parts of our service ecosystem and heavily resisted far-reaching changes. We also felt that utilising more modern, ubiquitous technologies like WebSockets would suit us better and provide our users with a more engaging experience – and well, let’s just say it had a host of other small problems that made it a prime candidate for a rewrite.</p>
<p>Now a rewrite does not require a change in technologies: we could have stuck to the more or less blessed stack of Node.js/Typescript for our back-end, but we realised an opportunity here try something new in a part of the application that is not necessarily on the hot-path.</p>
<p>In other words, we were in a fairly good position to experiment and explore.</p>
<p>We set off on a scoping and requirements gathering exercise, and managed to draw a circle around the features we wanted to build and deliver in due time. One of the themes that kept creeping up from our discoveries was user experience: the look and feel of the whole thing.</p>
<p>Our goal was to provide a slick, real-time experience to our users. There are a couple of technologies currently available that can facilitate this, but WebSockets was the most mature solution for this. The next steps were to track down some language and framework combinations that have significant support for long-running WebSocket connections.</p>
<p>Apart from UX demands, we also set some expectations from an engineering point of view:</p>
<ol>
<li>There need to be strong primitives in the framework - with strong community support - for both building and testing persistent connections, queuing, storage, etc.&nbsp;</li>
<li>If we have to fight the framework, we’re doing it wrong. It should be opinionated enough, <strong>without</strong> getting in the way.</li>
<li>If we can reduce moving parts, we’re doing it right.</li>
</ol>
<p>With these requirements in hand, we opened up the floor for any suggestions and sure enough, one option quite quickly gained traction.</p>
<h3>Why Elixir?</h3>
<p>Elixir is a fairly new language, but it runs on extraordinarily robust and battle-tested concepts and technology, at least by modern-day web development standards. It builds and runs on top of the Erlang VM, doing so — in part — by leveraging Erlang/OTP.</p>
<p>OTP, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Telecom_Platform" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Open Telecom Platform</span></a>, is a collection of tools, libraries and middleware that enable developers to build scalable, robust systems. It is the lower-level ecosystem supporting Erlang – and thus Elixir – development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I consider Elixir to be a niche language, albeit a very mainstream and capable language within that particular niche. It might not be the fastest or most optimized, but it commits to a few core tenets – concurrency, fault tolerance and isolation of errors, persistent connections – and executes on those really well.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we selected Elixir based on a couple of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Developer Experience – Elixir has a reputation for not only being developer-friendly, but having developer experience and productivity at its core</li>
<li>Integrated feedback loop – Coming from Node.js, having the One True Way to run unit and integration tests, and have a very clean way of running these in parallel is refreshing.</li>
<li>Purpose – As mentioned above, our requirement was to support and build upon a system of near-real time communication. Many other technologies do offer some level of library support, but we were hard-pressed to find a better solution than the primitives and higher level constructs provided by Elixir and Phoenix.</li>
<li>Interest – A very enthusiastic engineer within the team took ownership of this project</li>
</ol>
<h3>Our first steps in Elixir</h3>
<p>Once we had settled on Elixir, we were ready to roll our sleeves and&nbsp; actually start building something. This is where the champion steps in – a person who not only shows interest in the topic but is also willing to coach and mentor their peers. In my experience, it’s quite risky to try to adopt something that no one in the team has any experience in.</p>
<p>In true champion spirit, one of our own team members took ownership of building the seed project. While he was busy tinkering away, we purchased some books, found some tutorials, installed the blessed extensions and started learning this shiny new stack. It did not take long for us to have <em>something</em>; it was missing a lot of functionality, but it was just enough to give us a taste of how the language is structured, how the web framework hangs together and how we deploy it.</p>
<p>Now of course, introducing a new stack is not all smooth sailing. It should come as no surprise that the cost of adopting something new comes with a substantial amount of minutiae that need addressing. We had established ways of running services within our infrastructure, and our job now was to slot our Elixir-based service into that infrastructure.</p>
<p>From getting logging to work, having a working Prometheus endpoint, and integrating with our internal authentication mechanisms – let’s just say we had quite a few boxes to tick in order to get everything to play nicely.</p>
<p>But in the end, we have something that works! So let’s talk about some of our key learnings.</p>
<h4>Clusters within clusters —&nbsp;Understand where Kubernetes ends and Erlang/OTP begins</h4>
<p>There are competing, yet complementary philosophies at play here. The application is running on top of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_6Dl0iII9U" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Kubernetes within Smartly</span></a>, which brings with it a whole raft of *stuff* – a scheduler, failure detection, logging integration, load balancers... everything <strong>and</strong> the kitchen sink.</p>
<p>The application itself is running on top of Erlang/OTP, which in turn drags a fair bit of tooling and opinionation into the fray - failure detection, process management, supervision tree(s). You name it, it’s probably there somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Jose Valim</strong>, the creator of Elixir, has written in depth about <a href="http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2019/10/kubernetes-and-the-erlang-vm-orchestration-on-the-large-and-the-small/"><span>how these two runtimes coexist</span></a>, and at large, the technical aspect of his argument is sound. But what we’ve observed is that there are a few challenges with regards to expectations that needed to be overcome.</p>
<h4>Failure escalation — Come to grips with how failure occurs and propagates</h4>
<p>Our main competency within the team is running Node.js applications, and while a lot can be said about Node.js, it is not a complex programming model. There’s a script, you run the script, it blows up or keeps on running. Everything else is yours to manage and control.</p>
<p>Elixir really tries <strong>hard</strong> not to crash the entire underlying process, so it will let parts of the application crash and burn, after which the supervisor will reconstruct processes in your supervision tree based on configuration. Kubernetes does <strong>not</strong> get involved here, so our regular approach of finding out bad things are happening simply does not apply.</p>
<p>This happened recently when a critical part of the application was unable to talk to an underlying database, and instead of the usual symptom – pods crashing and burning left, right and centre, making our alerting system go off like nothing else – we were faced with an application that <em>looked functional</em> <em>on the surface</em>, but was heroically trying to stem the flood of dying processes internally. Needless to say, we added more monitoring and learnt our lesson.</p>
<h4>One is the loneliest number — Account for redundancy in a stateful system</h4>
<p>Traditionally, one of the hardest steps to take when scaling your infrastructure is to go from one to two. When vertical scaling is no longer a viable or preferred option, teams need to look at horizontal scaling instead. In the current landscape of Kubernetes clusters and small, disposable services, horizontally scaling your application has even become the de facto standard.</p>
<p>This puts the onus on us to design a system that can work in a distributed way. For all intents and purposes this would be easy if we were planning to run a simple request-response system, but we’re not: we’re aiming to build a distinct-per-user perpetually connected system. So the one thing we really don’t want to deal with is duplicated websocket connections, or having to duplicate our message handling. In short, all copies of our application need to be able to communicate <strong>with one another</strong> and pass user-bound notifications to the copy of the application that has initially established the WebSocket connection to said user.</p>
<p>Luckily, this is not an unsolved problem. Even more fortunately, a solution is provided within <a href="https://phoenixframework.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Phoenix</span></a> — the de-facto Elixir web application framework - itself. This solution takes the shape of <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_pubsub/Phoenix.PubSub.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Phoenix PubSub</span></a>. At its core, this would allow our applications to communicate with one another. If PubSub is the API by which applications would communicate, it does not by itself provide the means by which information makes it from one application to another. This message transport back-end needs to be provided separately, and take the form of <strong>adapters.</strong></p>
<p>There are two adapters currently available, Redis and PG2. We could have chosen Redis, as we do have some expertise in-house on how to run this at scale. But that would have introduced another moving part to the equation, and we were keen to keep as much as we could contained within the application itself. So that brings us to PG2, a solution that leverages Distributed Erlang in allowing Erlang processes to communicate across servers. In order for us to have this ability, we have to lean on one final component within our toolbox, namely <a href="https://github.com/bitwalker/libcluster" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>libcluster</span></a>. This Erlang clustering …</p></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

				<p>AyeTap is a peer to peer voting service that will make democracy cheaper, more effective and viral. Because democracy today is broken and run by the government, media &amp; lobbyists. Voting today doesn't really improve your school, office, neighborhood or favorite pub because politicians can't change what matters to you, in your space. And online petitions are useless because they are one dimensional. Petitions only tell you how many signed, not how many DIDN'T sign, so you never know what the majority wants because you only see half the picture.</p>
				<p>AyeTap lets people find out what the majority wants ... about anything, because every vote can be validated and traced back to a person in the real world, through a paper (and peer) trial.</p>
				
				<p><strong>We've built AyeTap to give you the power to change your space. Join us and help redefine democracy.</strong></p>

This article will cover few of the common mistakes that we often do while writing HTML. Let's get straight to it.</p>
<h2 id="1-use-of-anchor-elements-lessagreater">1. Use of Anchor Elements: <code>&lt;a&gt;</code></h2>
<p>Anchor elements are used to create a hyperlink to a file or a location of a webpage and should always be used for navigating to a real url. Anchor elements are often misused as fake buttons by setting their <code>href</code> to <code>#</code> to prevent the page from refreshing, then listening for their <code>click</code> events.</p>
<p>When we point <code>href</code> value to <code>#</code>, it breaks the default functionality of a link causing unexpected behavior when opening links in a new tab or window, bookmarking, copying/dragging links, or when JavaScript is loading, errors, or is disabled. They also convey
incorrect semantics to assistive technologies, like screen readers.</p>
<p>If something is supposed to be clickable, it should always be a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code></p>
<p>Using here to add a link is not recommended as it doesn't tell anything about where it's going to navigate. Provide some proper text of where the links point to.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Read more about anchor tag <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp">here</a> ❌</p>
<p>Read more about anchor tag on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp">w3school guide</a> ✅</p>
<h2 id="2-use-of-break-element-lessbrgreater">2. Use of Break element: <code>&lt;br&gt;</code></h2>
<p><code>&lt;br&gt;</code> element is used to break the text in an address or while writing poems specifically. Creating separate paragraphs of text using <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> is not only bad practice, but it is also problematic for people who navigate with the aid of screen reading technology. Screen readers can miss the content between two break elements while still announcing the presence of the tag. This can be frustrating for a person using a screen reader.</p>
<p>Use CSS <code>margin</code> property with <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element to add space instead.</p>
<h2 id="3-use-of-heading-elements-lessh1greater">3. Use of Heading elements: <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>HTML is a semantic language and anything regarding visuals should be done with CSS only. Avoid using heading tags to resize text. Instead, use the CSS <code>font-size</code> property. Headings use size to indicate their relative importance, but CSS is preferred for general-purpose resizing.</li>
<li>Avoid skipping heading levels: always start from <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, next use <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, and so on.</li>
<li>You should only use one <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> per page.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is wrong:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>h1</span>&gt;</span>Heading level 1<span>&lt;/<span>h1</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;<span>h3</span>&gt;</span>Heading level 3<span>&lt;/<span>h3</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;<span>h4</span>&gt;</span>Heading level 4<span>&lt;/<span>h4</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This is appropriate:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>h1</span>&gt;</span>Heading level 1<span>&lt;/<span>h1</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;<span>h2</span>&gt;</span>Heading level 2<span>&lt;/<span>h2</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;<span>h3</span>&gt;</span>Heading level 3<span>&lt;/<span>h3</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<h2 id="4-use-of-paragraph-lesspgreater">4. Use of Paragraph: <code>&lt;p&gt;</code></h2>
<p>Do not use empty <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements to add space between
paragraphs and it is problematic for people who navigate with screen-reading
technology. Screen readers may announce the paragraph's presence, but
not any content contained within it — because there is none.</p>
<p>If extra space is desired, use CSS properties like <code>margin</code> to create the effect.</p>
<h2 id="5-use-of-aside-lessasidegreater">5. Use of Aside: <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></h2>
<p>Aside was introduced with HTML5 and represents content that is not directly connected with the main content. Asides are stand-alone, non-essential as part of an article but when used correctly it can be an extra level of information for your content. Example sidebars or call-out boxes.</p>
<p>Do not use aside to tag the parenthesized test as that is part of the main content. Don’t try to force content into an <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> if it shouldn't be there.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>p</span>&gt;</span>My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer. The weather was nice, and Epcot was amazing! I had a great summer together with my family!<span>&lt;/<span>p</span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;<span>aside</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>h4</span>&gt;</span>Epcot Center<span>&lt;/<span>h4</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>p</span>&gt;</span>Epcot is a theme park at Walt Disney World Resort featuring exciting attractions, international pavilions, award-winning fireworks and seasonal special events.<span>&lt;/<span>p</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>aside</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Writing semantically correct HTML is the responsibility of every developer. I hope you learned something from this article. That's it for now. Take care and stay safe.<br><a target="_blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/iamshadmirza">Shad</a></p>

I was quite physically strong and capable. I do not think the life of the mind is complete —&nbsp;adventure was essential to my happiness. Nutrition and physical activity seem to me necessary underpinnings of full life. Efficiency is extremely important to me and I took a great deal of pride in the facility with which I was able to manage my life on an everyday basis. My goal was to make myself the most complete, beautiful, inspiring, wonderful human being possible. I paid constant attention to the task and it often felt like a very solitary one. I wanted my experience of life to be broad, expansive, profound, and full of triumph. [...] Lofty words and tales of great deeds fire my spirit. I fantasize about great power and influence. I want to be splendid and magnificent. I want to run and jump and fight and laugh and live the most free-spirited, joyous life imaginable. To go all over the world, to the most obscure jungles and landscapes, to work in great cities, to go this way and that. I want to make my person and my life into absolute wonders, spectacular and breathtaking works of art.<p>— <a href="http://www.2arms1head.com/">Clayton Atreus</a>, <a href="http://claytonschwartz.blogspot.com/2008/11/final-words-upon-suicide-reflection-on.html">2008</a> (<a href="https://advrider.com/f/threads/seattle-to-argentina-on-a-klr650.136505/">see also</a>)</p></blockquote><p>That. That right there: the chance and challenge to express your will, to enact it on the world. The freedom and drive to forge a self that <em>matters</em> — to others, but also intrinsically. A self that self-justifies.</p><blockquote>I love because I love without expectation of results or even meaning. I spend time with the people I enjoy having in my world and when they move on, they move on. I act the way I would be proud to act, not to set an example or because I should, but because it pleases me. I like strong people; I will be strong. I like skillful people; I will develop skill. I like people who take care of others; I will protect and defend and if I die doing the job, cool — because I am going to die anyway and nothing will ever have mattered.<p>— <a href="https://amzn.to/3jadcjx"><em>Meditations on Violence</em> by Rory Miller</a></p></blockquote><p>He got the last part wrong. Everything matters, because we feel everything, and thus it matters to us. All of it does — everything that we can know intrigues and excites us, even the endeavor of <em>knowing</em> in the first place. Our ability to imagine, to conceptualize, blows open the possibility space such that we can even <a href="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/impossibility-space/">explore the <em>im</em>possible</a>.</p><p>So, what is the <em>meaning</em> of life, the purpose of all this interminable hustle and bustle?

And as COVID-19 pulls the rug<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/statscan-gdo-1.5703354" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/statscan-gdo-1.5703354" target="_blank">out from under economic growth</a>, some economists are beginning to face up to the fact that a version of MMT has moved from economic conjecture to economic fact.</p>  <h2><strong>Fear of being complicit</strong></h2>  <p>"The problem we have is that MMT is considered so fringe that many economists are even afraid to talk about it for fear of being viewed as complicit," said Frances Donald, global chief economist at Manulife Investment Management in a phone interview.</p>  <p>But she said refusing to address the reality of what governments and central banks around the world are already doing is a mistake.</p>  <p>"Like it or not, elements of MMT are already so embedded in our economy and financial system since COVID-19 developed that burying our heads in the sand isn't going to help us," said Donald.</p>  <p>Certainly a search for economists to discuss MMT shows Donald is something of a rarity in her forthrightness. Many are reluctant to give the theory credibility, saying things like "but you can't keep on borrowing forever."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5704126.1598644174!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/usa-economy-mmt.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5704126.1598644174!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/usa-economy-mmt.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5704126.1598644174!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/usa-economy-mmt.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5704126.1598644174!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/usa-economy-mmt.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5704126.1598644174!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/usa-economy-mmt.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5704126.1598644174!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/usa-economy-mmt.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Stephanie Kelton, an economist and author, is the current U.S. guru of modern monetary theory.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Howard Schneider/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Even the current U.S. guru of the theory, Stephanie Kelton, an economist at Stony Brook University in New York and author of the new best seller <em><u><a href="https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/the-deficit-myth-modern-monetary/9781541736184-item.html?s_campaign=goo-DSA_Books&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw1qL6BRCmARIsADV9Jta56xgYY3SpKT45uT__2PNiAx3JfI85eDDKbNdYFBZB1ibR5Xj_Vi8aAsNaEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank">The Deficit Myth: Modern Monetary Theory and the Birth of the People's Economy</a></u></em>, doesn't claim running up the balance sheet is without consequences.</p>  <p>"Generally I feel that MMT has been misunderstood as the idea that budget deficits don't matter and that you can spend as much as you want," said Donald. Instead, she said, the message is that there are more important things to consider&nbsp;—&nbsp;such as jobs&nbsp;—&nbsp;when contemplating when to run a deficit.</p>  <p>Less a concrete list of policies than a lens through which to view the world, Donald said that it is clear spending too much, even under MMT, will eventually lead to inflation. She said&nbsp;that's something Canada must consider as it borrows from the central bank and spends on growing the economy following shutdowns for COVID-19.</p>  <h2><strong>Still 'just wrong'?</strong></h2>  <p>If central banks really can stimulate inflation with low interest rates and the creation of money by buying up government bonds, it would seem that U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is now on side.</p>  <p>A year and a half ago, Powell called MMT "<u><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/mmt-fed-budget-1.5035451" target="_blank">just wrong</a></u>," saying, "We are going to have to spend less or raise more revenue."</p>  <p>But that was then. This is now. Last week, the Fed chair made headlines by announcing that the central bank would keep interest rates near zero, even as inflation began to rise, with the idea that job creation was the priority.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5704127.1598644378!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/usa-fed.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5704127.1598644378!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/usa-fed.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5704127.1598644378!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/usa-fed.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5704127.1598644378!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/usa-fed.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5704127.1598644378!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/usa-fed.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5704127.1598644378!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/usa-fed.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Last year, U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell scoffed at MMT. Now he seems to be following its precepts.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Yuri Gripas/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Interestingly one of those who seemed reluctant to endorse MMT by name was Scott Aquanno, author of <em><u><a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/bank-of-canada-must-keep-innovating-beyond-pandemic-think-tank-880385421.html" target="_blank">The Bank of Canada and Crisis Management: COVID-19 and Beyond</a></u></em> and a strong supporter of the central bank's bond buying program.</p>  <p>Among his recommendations is the <u><a href="https://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/National%20Office/2020/05/Bank%20of%20Canada%20and%20crisis%20management.pdf" target="_blank">formation of a public bank</a></u> to lend to groups and projects that would be unlikely to get money through normal banking channels in spite of rock bottom interest rates. And as for&nbsp;inflation, he said&nbsp;it remains far, far away.</p>  <p>"I think what you might see, paradoxically, is a situation where the Bank of Canada is essentially printing billions of dollars to fund government debt and deficits but that inflation declines,"&nbsp;Aquanno said in a telephone interview.</p>    <p>If Canada were the only one doing this, the loonie would likely lose value, he said. But as countries around the world all do the same thing, so long as the Canadian central bank doesn't get ahead of the pack, there is little to worry about.</p>  <p>Aquanno, an assistant professor at Ontario Tech University in Oshawa, a city that has watched GM jobs melt away, believes the lack of wage inflation is simply a matter of 40 years where labour lost bargaining power to businesses that have been able to move jobs abroad.</p>  <p>Mark Kamstra, a finance professor at the Schulich School of Business at York University in Toronto, generally takes a more traditional view of economics, but even he sees some of the remedies prescribed by MMT as appropriate for a very unusual malaise.</p>  <h2><strong>Ideological divide </strong></h2>  <p>Certainly the term MMT has been politicized in the United States as its star advocate, Kelton, appeared on stage with left-leaning Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.</p>  <p>While many traditional private sector advocates may dislike the heavy hand of government on the economy, cheap money and government-led investment may be the best option at this point, said Kamstra.</p>  <p>Low interest rates create zombie companies that might otherwise be displaced by more deserving players, said the York University economist. But pushing them out of business now would result in economic collapse and deflation. Like Frances Donald, he is certain this is no time for austerity.</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH |&nbsp;Ottawa expects $343-billion deficit because of pandemic:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><span></span><span>The federal government expects a $343-billion deficit this year and for millions of Canadians to remain out of work because of the COVID-19 pandemic.<!-- --> <!-- -->3:10</span></span></span></p>  <p>Like Aquanno, though for different reasons, he thinks inflation will be hard to generate despite low rates and cash injections in Canada's service-led economy.</p>  <p>"If people had a lot of money they might get their hair cut twice a week instead of once a month," said Kamstra doubtfully.</p>  <p>Injecting money into the economy may increase demand, he said. But this demand would be for goods such as iPhones and cars often&nbsp;made by cheap foreign labour. These products don't face shortages, so there is&nbsp;so little inflationary pressure.</p>    <p>As to governments creating jobs on green projects or infrastructure, in normal times, that could well steal away resources needed in the private sector.&nbsp;But in an economy shattered by COVID-19, that's not a problem right now right, said Kamstra.</p>  <p>"It's a good time for the government to start thinking about how it can safely employ resources to fix problems."</p>  <p>And as we desperately look for ways of digging the economy out of the hole created by the global coronavirus lockdown, that applies whether we decide to call it MMT or something else.</p>  <p><em>Follow Don on Twitter <u><a href="https://twitter.com/don_pittis" target="_blank">@don_pittis</a></u></em></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<p><a title="Bubblewrap Security Headlines podcast" href="https://anchor.fm/firo-solutions/episodes/Security-Headlines-bubblewrap-podcast-special-eitlb9">
<img alt="bubblewrap security headlines podcast sandbox" src="https://blog.firosolutions.com/bubblewrap.png">
</a></p><p>In modern stacks, a large chunk of applications run in container environments<br>
such as docker and systemd-nspawn.  However, these applications are not built for security.<br>
The security community has proven it again and again that privilege escalation attacks<br>
are very serious with attacks such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_COW">Dirty Cow</a> and <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-3135">CVE-2016-3135</a>.</p>

<p>A way to tackle the problems of running applications with a low privilege user without<br>
that application being able to interact with other running applications is to use <em>user namespaces</em>.<br>
Using user namespaces you can hide process id’s to the applications and provide a more sandboxed environment.</p>

<p>Alex wanted to the distribution of multiplatform applications easy
which led him to sandboxing and namespaces, today he<br>
maintains the “chroot on steroids” project <em>bubblewrap</em> which is a sandbox platform for running<br>
sandboxed applications in different namespaces.</p>

<p>Alex is also a long time user of Linux, with 20 years working for Redhat.<br>
He started to code on the commodore 64 and has been a developer ever since. In school he<br>
got introduced to Solaris and jumped deeper and deeper into Linux rabbit hole.</p>

<p>Working on Linux allows Alex to work from home in the suburbs of Stockholm<br>
and work on programs that get used by a global user base.</p>

<p>In this episode, we talk about how it has been to work on sandboxed<br>
desktop applications and how flatpak has grown.</p>

<p>So far there a has been a handful of different CVE’s for bubblewrap
that we talk about.</p>

<p>Flatpak has gotten bigger and bigger and “flathub” has come to see the light
, flathub is a place where all Linux users can get sandboxed desktop
applications.</p>

<p>More and more developers are publishing their apps on flathub, the<br>
Mozilla team has even picked up on it and are currently shipping firefox throw it.</p>

<p>Flathub is running on a stable Rust backend, Alex picked Rust to be the backend as one of his first larger Rust projects.<br>
We of course talk about how Rust is becoming more part of our daily lives<br>
as more and more applications are being ported to it, like librsvg journey from being written in C to now being a rust code base, as well as libraries<br>
being written in Rust.</p>

<p>If you are maintaining an application with a graphical user interface and you target
an audience that is running Linux on the desktop, we recommend<br>
that you get your application on flathub.<br>
Here is a guide on how you can do that:<br>

<p>This podcast was made possible with running zoom with flatpak:</p>

<pre><code>$ flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo   
$ flatpak install flathub us.zoom.Zoom 
$ flatpak run us.zoom.Zoom

</span></p><h2 id="the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition"><a href="#the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition" aria-label="the pragmatic programmer 20th anniversary edition permalink"></a>The Pragmatic Programmer 20th Anniversary Edition</h2><p>The first edition of this book was released in 1999 and has become one of the most important books to read for software developers.</p><p>Last year, 20 years after its initial release, the authors released a new edition of this book, not only including updates of the code examples,
but also integrating the feedback they gathered at this time.</p><p>While the book contains code samples, it's not about teaching you how to code: The authors explain how to improve the <em>process</em> of developing software in a pragmatic way.
It includes plenty of tips that will help you throughout your programming career.</p><p>Some of the traits of pragmatic programmers are their <em>attitude</em> and philosophy of approaching
problems, placing them in its larger context, and taking <em>responsibility</em> for everything that they do.</p><p>I've only read the book 3 years into my career as a software developer, but
I'm sure that I will be able to appreciate the book, even more, when I read it again in a year or so.</p><p>I'd recommend it to all software developers who are serious about improving their skills.
However, while it contains a lot of useful advice, I feel like if you're just starting out with
programming, you might not come to appreciate all the wisdom that the book offers.</p><p>If you want to buy the book, you can get it <a href="https://amzn.to/2D4Nf4K" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here on Amazon</a> (affiliate link).</p><h2 id="favorite-topics"><a href="#favorite-topics" aria-label="favorite topics permalink"></a>Favorite topics</h2><p>The Pragmatic Programmer has a total of 53 topics. As with any non-fiction book, some ideas resonate with the reader and others don't.</p><p>I want to share a short summary of each of my favorite topics here and how I integrated them into my work. These are the topics that I liked the most after reading
the book for the first time, but I'm sure that if I read the book again a few years from now, my takeaways will be different.</p><ul><li><a href="#its-your-life">It's your life</a></li><li><a href="#knowledge-portfolio">Knowledge portfolio</a></li><li><a href="#orthogonality">Orthogonality</a></li><li><a href="#tracer-bullets">Tracer bullets</a></li><li><a href="#the-basic-tools">The basic tools</a></li><li><a href="#dead-programs-tell-no-lies">Dead programs tell no lies</a></li><li><a href="#programming-by-coincidence">Programming by coincidence</a></li><li><a href="#test-to-code">Test to code</a></li><li><a href="#pragmatic-starter-kit">Pragmatic starter kit</a></li></ul><undefined></undefined><h3 id="its-your-life"><a href="#its-your-life" aria-label="its your life permalink"></a>It's your life</h3><p>This topic is at the very beginning of the book and has a motivational vibe to it. Many developers that Dave and Andi have talked to
are frustrated with their jobs or the technology they're working with.</p><p>The authors highlight the fact that software development is one of the best careers to have nowadays since developers usually are well paid, can
work from anywhere in the world, and have a lot of freedom in their jobs.</p><p>If you're not happy with the job you're working right now, you can try to fix it by talking to your boss or find yourself another job easily.</p><p>Given how privileged software developers are, there's no excuse for not living the life you want. If you're proactive
and stay on top of your game, you'll be rewarded with a lot of opportunities by the industry.</p><h3 id="knowledge-portfolio"><a href="#knowledge-portfolio" aria-label="knowledge portfolio permalink"></a>Knowledge portfolio</h3><p>The knowledge portfolio of every developer is like a regular investment portfolio: If you invest in it regularly, you will reap the benefits of
that later on.</p><p>I found this analogy to be the most powerful in this book since I read it at a time where I wasn't developing my programming skills any further
and I felt like I was hitting a glass ceiling. I wasn't investing in my knowledge portfolio and I came to a point where I noticed the results of that.</p><p>Regularly investing in yourself by reading non-fiction books will help you stay curious and
motivated about your profession (they don't have to be all programming related).</p><p>It also helps to discover more things that you don't know, making <em>Unknown</em> Unknowns, <em>Known</em> Unknowns. This idea is not from the book, but I think it is related.</p><p>The more you learn about a certain topic, the more you see the complexity in it and the more you see the little you know about it.
You can read more about this in this <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-knowns-and-unknowns-framework-for-design-thinking-6537787de2c5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Medium post</a>.</p><p>The authors suggest you invest in your portfolio by doing the following things:</p><ul><li>Learn at least one new language every year</li><li>Read a technical book each month</li><li>Read nontechnical books, too</li><li>Take classes</li><li>Participate in local user groups and meetups</li><li>Stay current (by reading news and posts online)</li></ul><p>You don't have to do all of them, but consistently developing yourself with these suggestions will definitely help you expand your portfolio.</p><blockquote><p>To get notified about articles like this one, <a href="https://felixgerschau.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">subscribe to my email newsletter</a>.</p></blockquote><h3 id="orthogonality"><a href="#orthogonality" aria-label="orthogonality permalink"></a>Orthogonality</h3><p>This is a term borrowed from geometry. We probably know this concept under names like <strong>modularity</strong> or <strong>layered systems</strong>. In the end, all of them refer to a system
whose components are loosely coupled, meaning that the components don't have a lot of dependencies.</p><p>In orthogonal systems, it's easy to change one component without the fear of breaking something on the other end. These systems are also easier to test.</p><p>Thinking about orthogonality during the development or design stage of a system can help a lot in making the system easier to work with in the future and prevent bugs.</p><h3 id="tracer-bullets"><a href="#tracer-bullets" aria-label="tracer bullets permalink"></a>Tracer bullets</h3><p>In the shooting scenes of any action movie, you can often see the path of the bullets. Bullets that mark the path they've taken are called <em>tracer bullets</em>.</p><p>Tracer bullets are used in real-world combat as well because they help to aim under difficult environments by providing <strong>immediate feedback under real circumstances</strong>.
They are not supposed to hit the target right away, but the fast feedback allows the gunner to adjust the aim.</p><p>The equivalent in software development is to <strong>get a small part of the system working as soon as possible</strong> and asking for feedback from users and stakeholders.</p><p>Advantages of the tracer bullet approach are:</p><ul><li><p>Early and visible results for your users and sponsors.</p></li><li><p>Developers have a structure to build upon.</p></li><li><p>The project becomes an <strong>integration platform</strong>:</p><p>New changes are integrated into an already working system.</p></li></ul><p>The alternative to the "tracer bullet approach" would be writing each module of the system separately, connecting them in the end together, and test the whole
system at the very end of the project.</p><p>Tracer bullets aren't meant to be prototypes. They're meant to get a stable version of a feature or aspect of the final system that will be the backbone for future developments.</p><p>Just like with the bullets, you won't always hit the target at your first shot. Users or stakeholders might not like the result, but the whole idea of this is to
get this feedback at the beginning of the project rather than at the end.</p><h3 id="the-basic-tools"><a href="#the-basic-tools" aria-label="the basic tools permalink"></a>The basic tools</h3><p>This chapter of the book contains an overview of the tools that every programmer should use. The authors compare programming tools to the tools of a woodworker,
which also inspired the cover of the book.</p><p>Woodworkers use a variety of tools, each of them having its specific purpose. They use tools like rules, drills, clamps, and many more.
The woodworker knows when to use which tools and has mastered how to use it.</p><p>In programming, we have our own tools that we need to get the job done. These tools amplify our talent by increasing productivity.</p><p>In the book, they advise against the usage of a single power tool, an IDE, and encourage you to use the tools that an IDE uses behind the scenes.</p><p>The tools covered in the book fall into the following categories:</p><ul><li>The power of plain text</li><li>Shell games (Unix commands)</li><li>Version control</li><li>Power Editing (Your text editor)</li><li>Debugging</li><li>Engineering daybooks</li></ul><h4 id="dont-rely-on-gui-environments"><a href="#dont-rely-on-gui-environments" aria-label="dont rely on gui environments permalink"></a>Don't rely on GUI environments</h4><p>Unix commands are so powerful because each of them has one single purpose and they can be combined through pipes, which
opens up an infinite amount of possibilities to what you can do with them. It's to the programmer what the workbench is to the woodworker.</p><p>Using the shell allows you to automate things and combine commands in such a flexible way that GUIs can't keep up with.</p><h3 id="dead-programs-tell-no-lies"><a href="#dead-programs-tell-no-lies" aria-label="dead programs tell no lies permalink"></a>Dead programs tell no lies</h3><p><em>A dead program normally does a lot less damage than a crippled one.</em></p><p>The tip of the authors for this topic is to <strong>crash early</strong>.</p><p>Why? Because if you don't, your program will maybe <em>look</em> like it's working correctly but returns slightly wrong results due to the system being in
a wrong state.</p><p>You can avoid this by crashing early and often. This will help you to find the root of the bug faster and it will be more apparent when something is wrong with
the program.</p><p>Wrapping your code in <code>try catch</code> statements might keep the program running, but the subtle bugs that are the result of that are much harder to catch.</p><blockquote><h4 id="data-validation-in-mobx-state-tree"><a href="#data-validation-in-mobx-state-tree" aria-label="data validation in mobx state tree permalink"></a>Data validation in Mobx-State-Tree</h4><p>This is one of the aspects I like about <a href="https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mobx-State-Tree</a>, a frontend state management tool.
It crashes early by validating the data before adding it to the store that contains all the data on the fronted.</p><p>At first, this seemed annoying to me, since the app crashed as soon as the backend returned the wrong data. After giving it a second thought, this approach is
much better than keeping the program running.</p><p>The alternative would be that, after receiving an unexpected null value, for example, the app crashes anyway
because I'm trying to read a property from <code>undefined</code> (JavaScript equivalent to a NullPointerException).</p><p>Having worked with it for nearly 2 years now, I can say that with this helped me on multiple occasions to track down bugs faster than it would've taken me
without validating the data.</p></blockquote><h3 id="programming-by-coincidence"><a href="#programming-by-coincidence" aria-label="programming by coincidence permalink"></a>Programming by coincidence</h3><p><em>Don't assume it, prove it.</em></p><p>Programming by coincidence means that you're making guesses about the functions and interfaces that you're using. It might work for a while, but since you

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kubernetes is an open-source project that “containerizes” workloads and services and manages deployment and configurations. Released by Google in 2015, Kubernetes is now maintained by the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>. Since its release, it has become a worldwide phenomenon. The majority of <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/kubernetes-jumps-in-popularity/">cloud native companies use</a> it, SaaS vendors offer commercial prebuilt versions, and there’s even an annual <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/">convention</a>!<br></p><p>What has made Kubernetes become such a fundamental service? A major factor is its automation capabilities. Kubernetes can automatically make changes to the configuration of deployed containers or even deploy new containers based on metrics it tracks or requests made by engineers. Having Kubernetes handle these processes saves time, eliminates toil, and increases consistency.<br></p><p>If these benefits sound familiar, it might be because they overlap with the philosophies of SRE. But how do you incorporate the automation of Kubernetes into your SRE practices? In this blog post, we’ll explain the Kubernetes Operator—the Kubernetes function at the heart of customized automation—and discuss how it can evolve your SRE solution.</p><h3>What the Kubernetes Operator can do</h3><p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kubernetes-Operators-Automating-Container-Orchestration/dp/1492048046"><em>Kubernetes Operators: Automating the Container Orchestration Platform</em></a>, authors Jason Dobies and Joshua Wood describe an Operator as “an automated Site Reliability Engineer for its application.” Given an SRE’s multifaceted experience and diverse workload, this is a bold statement. So what exactly can the Operator do?</p><h4>Kubernetes Operators complete sophisticated tasks</h4><p>The Operator can complete complex tasks in order to achieve the desired changes in the application’s output. It can automatically handle such tasks as:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Deploying applications</li><li>Updating applications to new versions</li><li>Reconfiguring application settings</li><li>Scaling applications up and down depending on usage</li><li>Failure handling</li><li>Setting up monitoring infrastructure<br></li></ul><p>Without Kubernetes Operators, engineers would need to complete these tasks. Automating them saves time and toil, and makes the procedures and results consistent.<br></p><h4>Kubernetes Operators control custom resources and applications</h4><p>Kubernetes allows you to create and define custom resources based on specific applications. The custom resource is a data object generated by your application containing metrics on the application's state. Imagine you have an application that produces new server instances based on usage. You could define your custom resource to check RAM and disk space for each new instance. You can also define a custom resource as a target that the application is trying to match. The Kubernetes Operator can then control the application to achieve the target custom resource; if the application is spinning up servers that have insufficient RAM or disk space, the Operator can reconfigure the settings to match the desired amount.<br></p><h4>Kubernetes Operators make stateful decisions</h4><p>The Kubernetes Operator is able to modify the configuration and usage of an application based on the application’s output. This is determined by the custom resources defined for that application. Custom resources showing the desired state and custom resources showing the current state form a loop. The Operator observes the current state and then takes actions that will make the application produce the desired state. After the actions are executed, the current state is reevaluated and the loop begins again.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For example, a custom resource could define the desirable state of a new server instance as some amount of load capability based on its physical resources.The Operator would then adjust the configuration until new instances reached these standards.</p><h3>Kubernetes Operators and SRE</h3><p>If you’re using Kubernetes, you’ll find that building and implementing Operators aligns with your SRE goals.</p><h4>Operator monitoring, SLIs, and SLOs</h4><p>When developing the custom resource for your application, you need to choose which signals from the application’s output will be monitored by the resource and which targets the Operator will steer the application toward. This is similar to creating <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/slis-understand-users-needs">SLIs</a> and <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/service-level-objectives-slos-lessons-learned">SLOs</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The process of determining metrics with greatest impact is similar for Operators and SLIs. In the <em>Kubernetes Operators</em> textbook, Dobies and Wood suggest looking first at the “four golden signals” (<a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/monitoring-distributed-systems/">a concept from Google’s SRE book</a>) to determine what the Operator should monitor. These are:</p><ul role="list"><li>Latency</li><li>Traffic</li><li>Errors</li><li>Saturation<br></li></ul><p>Creating Operators for your applications will help you understand what SLIs and SLOs should be set for them. Likewise, setting SLIs and SLOs can help you understand what your Operators should monitor.<br></p><p>You might notice that when servers are overloaded, your customers are unhappy with the application’s availability.<br></p><p>You can set a custom resource to monitor the disk space available. At 5% remaining capacity, your custom resource will spin up new server instances, giving your customers better service. Your SLI will be based on availability and will monitor disk space. Your SLO might dictate that you need to achieve 99.9% availability to keep your customers happy, informing the Operator’s intervention points.</p><h4>Automating SRE application deployment</h4><p>Your SRE practice will involve applications being deployed on a regular basis for each new instance of a service. For example, you may want to deploy a monitoring application every time you implement a new area of system architecture. Kubernetes Operators can expedite and automate this process. For monitoring, the <a href="https://coreos.com/blog/the-prometheus-operator.html">Prometheus Operator</a> is one of the first Operators developed by Kubernetes. It automatically deploys and controls a new instance of the open-source monitoring software <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> onto any targeted clusters.<br></p><p><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/choosing-sre-tools">SRE tools</a> represent an investment in reliability. The time spent implementing them is paid for by the time they save. Creating Operators is a similar investment. By creating Operators, you save time on each deployment. Furthermore, deployments are consistent and reliable. Your SRE practices have less overhead and can scale with your organization.</p><h4>Operators and incident management</h4><p>Operators can be set up to make adjustments to handle failure. If the application’s custom resource varies from the desired result, the Operator will make changes to compensate until the desired state is achieved. The cause of the variation is irrelevant to the Operator. It only operates based on the current and desired states. You will still need to work through an incident retrospective to bubble up contributing factors.<br></p><p>When developing your incident response plan, the behavior of your Operators can be a valuable resource. If you know that the Operator will automatically try to correct the behavior, you can incorporate that into your expectations and procedures. For example, if you have an incident response plan for oversaturated servers, your Operator could spin up new server instances or reconfigure load balancing. Your response plan would take this into account, saving you some troubleshooting steps and allowing you to focus on the originating issue. By combining Operators and <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/runbook-automation-best-practices">automated runbooks</a>, you can minimize the amount of manual escalation and resolve many incidents without human intervention. As automation is another core goal of SRE, this is another way that Kubernetes Operators fit into your reliability strategy.<br></p><p>As you shift your services to a container-based model and Kubernetes becomes more fundamental to your DevOps practices, it’s important to incorporate Operators into your reliability strategy. Operators allow you to extend Kubernetes with custom resources and responses, allowing for more automation and less toil.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If you enjoyed this post, check out these resources:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://www.blameless.com/resources/webinar-modern-metrics">Webinar: Modern Metrics to Understand Operational Health</a></li><li><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/how-to-choose-monitoring-tools">How to Choose Monitoring Tools for DevOps and SRE</a></li><li><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/incident-classification">How to Classify Incidents</a></li></ul></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A couple of threads got me thinking about the limits of <a href="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2020/08/07/thoughts-on-stamp/">STAMP</a>.</p>



<p>The first thread was sparked by a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24114720">link to a Hacker News comment</a>, sent to me be a colleague of mine, <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyThomas">Danny Thomas</a>. This introduced me to a concept I hadn’t of heard of before, a <em>battleshort</em>. There’s even an official definition in a NATO document:</p>



<blockquote><p>The capability to bypass certain safety features in a system to ensure completion of the mission without interruption due to the safety feature</p><cite><a href="http://www.nato.int/structur/ac/310/pdf/aop-38-3.pdf">AOP-38</a>, Allied Ordnance Publication 38, Edition 3,&nbsp;<em>Glossary of terms and definitions concerning the safety and suitability for service of munitions, explosives and related products</em>, April 2002.</cite></blockquote>



<p>The second thread was sparked by a Twitter exchange between a UK Southern Railway train driver and the official UK Southern Railway twitter account:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">People find a way to use the systems they have access to in order to get their work done, in ways never anticipated by the system designers. <a href="https://t.co/D7ll99aeB2">https://t.co/D7ll99aeB2</a></p>— Lorin Hochstein E_TOO_MANY_FAILURE_MODES (@lhochstein) <a href="https://twitter.com/lhochstein/status/1293577818605936642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>This is a great example of <em>exapting</em>, a concept introduced by the paleontologists Stephen Jay Gould and Elisabeth Vrba. Exaptation is a solution to the following problem in evolutionary biology: what good is a partially functional wing? Either an animal can fly or it can’t, and a fully functional wing can’t evolve in a single generation, so how do the initial evolutionary stages of a wing confer advantage on the organism?</p>



<p>The answer is that: while a partially functional wing might be useless for flight, it might still be useful as a fin. And so, if wings evolved from fins, then the appendage may always confer an advantage at each evolutionary stage. The fin is <em>exapted</em> into a wing; it is repurposed to serve a new function. In the Twitter example above, the railway driver repurposed a social media service for communicating with his own organization. </p>



<p>Which brings us back to STAMP. One of the central assumptions of STAMP is that it is possible to construct an accurate enough control model of the system at the design stage to identify all of the hazards and unsafe control actions. You can see this assumption in action in the <a href="http://psas.scripts.mit.edu/home/get_file4.php?name=CAST_handbook.pdf">CAST handbook  </a>(CAST is STAMP’s accident analysis process) in the example questions from page 40 of the handbook  (emphasis mine), which uses counterfactual reasoning to try identify flaws in the original hazard analysis.</p>



<p><em>Did the design account for the possibility of this increased pressure? <strong>If not, why not?</strong> Was this risk assessed at the design stage?</em></p>



<p><em><strong>This seems like a predictable design flaw</strong>. Was the unsafe interaction between the two requirements (preventing liquid from entering the flare and the need to discharge gases to the flare) identified in the design or hazard analysis efforts? If so, why was it not handled in the design or in operational procedures? <strong>If it was not identified, why not?</strong></em></p>



<p><em><strong>Why wasn’t the increasing pressure detected and handled?</strong></em> <em>If there were alerts, why did they not result in effective action to handle the increasing pressure? If there were automatic overpressurization control devices (e.g., relief valves), why were they not effective? <strong>If there were not automatic devices, then why not?</strong> Was it not feasible to provide them?</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Was this type of pressure increase anticipated?</strong> If it was anticipated, then why was it not handled in the design or operational procedures? <strong>If it was not anticipated, why not?</strong></em></p>



<p><em><strong>Was there any way to contain the contents within some controlled area (barrier), at least the catalyst pellets?</strong></em></p>



<p><em><strong>Why was the area around the reactor not isolated during a potentially hazardous operation? Why was there no protection against catalyst pellets flying around?</strong></em></p>



<p>This line of reasoning assumes that all hazards are, in principle, identifiable at the design stage. I think that phenomena like <em>battleshorts </em>and <em>exaptations</em> make this goal unattainable.</p>



<p>Now, in principle, nothing prevents an engineer using STPA (STAMP’s hazard analysis technique) from identifying scenarios that involve <em>battleshorts</em> and <em>exaptations</em>. After all, STPA is an <em>exploratory</em> technique. But I suspect that many of these kinds of adaptations are literally <em><strong>unimaginable</strong></em> to the designers.</p>

<h2 id="setting-the-scene">Setting the scene</h2>
<p>It’s a fresh new day at work, and you want to find the dot product of two arrays (that is, the sum of the product of the pairs of elements). You’re using your favourite language, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_Sharp_(programming_language)">F#</a>. You’re allergic to <code>Seq.zip</code> (maybe you’re terrified of virtual calls or something), and <code>Array.zip</code> just allocates too much memory. Also, you want to make sure you can bail out of the iteration early; what if someone tells you at the last minute that you have to stop if you see the number <code>100</code>?</p>
<p>Cracking your knuckles, the following pours from your fingertips:</p>
<div>
<pre><span>type</span> <span>Index</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span>

<span>let</span> truncatedDotProduct
    <span>(</span>shouldContinue <span>:</span> <span>Index</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>xs <span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>ys <span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span>
    <span>:</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mutable</span> ans <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mutable</span> <span>(</span>i <span>:</span> <span>Index</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span>shouldContinue i xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>])</span> <span>do</span>
        ans <span>&lt;-</span> ans <span>+</span> <span>(</span>xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>*</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>])</span>
    ans
</pre>
</div>
<p>Easy, of course! And then you write the unit tests and discover how truly exquisite the infinite loop is that you have made.</p>
<p>With a gentle sigh of one who has arisen bright and refreshed only to discover the computer in a sullen and recalcitrant mood, you insert the line that makes everything work.</p>
<div>
<pre><span>type</span> <span>Index</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span>

<span>let</span> truncatedDotProduct
    <span>(</span>shouldContinue <span>:</span> <span>Index</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>xs <span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>ys <span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span>
    <span>:</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mutable</span> ans <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mutable</span> <span>(</span>i <span>:</span> <span>Index</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span>shouldContinue i xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>])</span> <span>do</span>
        ans <span>&lt;-</span> ans <span>+</span> <span>(</span>xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>*</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>])</span>
        <span>// How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable</span>

        i <span>&lt;-</span> i <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
    ans
</pre>
</div>
<p>Now the tests pass, and you can stride forward into a glorious day of productivity.</p>
<p>But wouldn’t it have been lovely if this mistake hadn’t happened?</p>
<h2 id="going-loopy">Going loopy</h2>
<p>The mistake was that we introduced a piece of state, but never changed it. A sufficiently advanced compiler can warn us about a variable that is set but never used – but the problem still remains in general. (What if we had printed the iteration variable, and therefore used it? Or what if we had a slightly more complicated computation for which we legitimately performed some mutation to the state in our loop body, but still forgot to do the final increment?)</p>
<p>With a small change to the shape of this function, we can make the bug so obvious that we would never dream of making it.</p>
<div>
<pre><span>type</span> <span>Index</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span>

<span>let</span> truncatedDotProduct
    <span>(</span>shouldContinue <span>:</span> <span>Index</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>xs <span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>ys <span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span>
    <span>:</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>rec</span> go <span>(</span>ans <span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span>i <span>:</span> <span>Index</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
        <span>if</span> shouldContinue i xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>then</span>
            go <span>(</span>ans <span>+</span> <span>(</span>xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>*</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>]))</span> <span>(</span>i <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
        <span>else</span>
            ans

    go <span>0</span> <span>0</span></pre>
</div>
<p>Now we are forced to declare explicitly that the index in the next iteration will be <code>i + 1</code>. Merely omitting this decision is not an option any more, because the compiler will force us to give a second argument to <code>go</code> whenever we invoke it.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, the termination condition of the loop has been tidied up; I would argue that it’s now easier to see that if <code>shouldContinue</code> fails, we return the value we’d got up to <em>before</em> the current index. (Admittedly, that one is more of a matter of taste; maybe you personally find it easier to understand the termination condition of the explicit <code>while</code> loop.)</p>
<p>And in a language like F#, we don’t lose any performance using this approach. A language with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call">tail-call optimisation</a> will optimise away the recursive call into an imperative loop behind the scenes; in fact, the recursive and the imperative code may well boil down to exactly the same machine code. (By contrast, some languages like Python lack tail-call optimisation, so in Python this approach is liable to end in a stack overflow.)</p>
<h2 id="backing-off">Backing off</h2>
<p>For another prime example, consider a famous saying:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>What is less often noted is that one should wait some period of time in between each retry.</p>
<p>Of course, there are libraries which do this for you (<a href="https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly">Polly</a>, for example). But for the sake of argument, let’s say we want to write a simple exponential backoff ourselves. (We’ll mock out the <code>sleep</code> function, to allow us to test the logic more easily; it’ll probably be given as <code>System.Threading.Thread.Sleep</code> at the call site, but nobody wants to be calling <code>Thread.Sleep</code> in a unit test.)</p>

                go newRetries

    go <span>0</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>No need for the sad <code>isDone</code> sentinel here! Since looping was an active choice (an explicit call to <code>go</code>), we were free simply to choose not to loop at any point, and specifically at the point where <code>doThing</code> had returned successfully.</p>
<h2 id="the-barest-essentials">The barest essentials</h2>
<p>Sometimes we don’t even need any state at all!</p>
<div>
<pre><span>open</span> <span>System</span>

<span>let</span> pollInfinitely<span>&lt;</span><span>'</span>a<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>(</span>sleep <span>:</span> <span>TimeSpan</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>unit</span><span>)</span>

    <span>:</span> <span>unit</span>
    <span>=</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>true</span> <span>do</span>
        <span>let</span> values <span>=</span> poll <span>()</span>
        doThings values
        sleep <span>(</span><span>TimeSpan</span>.<span>FromSeconds</span> <span>5</span><span>.)</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>Or, in the shiny new world which is free of <code>while</code>:</p>
<div>
<pre><span>open</span> <span>System</span>

<span>let</span> pollInfinitely<span>&lt;</span><span>'</span>a<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>(</span>sleep <span>:</span> <span>TimeSpan</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>unit</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>poll <span>:</span> <span>unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span>a<span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>doThings <span>:</span> <span>'</span>a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>unit</span><span>)</span>
    <span>:</span> <span>unit</span>
    <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>rec</span> go <span>()</span> <span>=</span>
        <span>let</span> values <span>=</span> poll <span>()</span>
        doThings values
        sleep <span>(</span><span>TimeSpan</span>.<span>FromSeconds</span> <span>5</span><span>.)</span>
        go <span>()</span>

    go <span>()</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>This example looks too simple to be of any use, and maybe indeed it is; and of course in real life there is <code>System.Timers.Timer</code> which solves this problem better. (This is only a toy example.)</p>
<p>But I would argue that once you’re familiar with the general pattern, this is a natural way to express the loop. Moreover, it is extremely extensible: if we decide we don’t actually want to loop forever, it’s trivial to add extra state by inserting it as parameters to <code>go</code>, and the compiler will try its best to help us use it correctly. (By contrast, with the <code>while</code> loop and mutable state, we are on our own: the compiler can’t know what we had in mind for the state.<br>
It will freely let us either modify the state when we didn’t want to, or fail to modify it when we did want to.)</p>
<h2 id="winding-up">Winding up</h2>
<p>Though it may look very odd at first sight, it soon becomes quite natural to think about loops in this recursive way. It allows you to express more of the problem in the type system, helping the compiler to point out when you’ve done things like “adding a new piece of state but forgetting to use it everywhere you wanted it”. It also makes the act of looping into a conscious choice at each stage; if you’ve ever longed for the good old days of <code>goto</code> to break out of loops, this actually gives you back something of that flavour, but much more safe!</p>
<p>Making the loop state immutable makes it easier to reason about the invariants and behaviour of the loop, and helps you write safer programs fast.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><strong>Auckland, New Zealand, August 31, 2020</strong> – Open source software company, <a href="https://www.portainer.io/">Portainer.io</a>, has launched version 2.0 of its platform which includes support for the Kubernetes container orchestrator, for the first time.</p>
<p>In three years, Portainer.io has over half a million regular Docker Swarm users with its 1.X version. It is anticipated the addition of support for Kubernetes will further accelerate growth for the start up.</p>
<p>Portainer makes operating container platforms easy. It provides a simple, click-to-configure interface which removes all of the unnecessary complexity and negates the need for users to learn complex syntax. Portainer users can now deploy and manage notoriously complicated applications on a Kubernetes platform, quickly and easily. Users no longer need to know how to write YAML or understand the Kubernetes CLI or API. In addition to Kube, Portainer continues to operate across all major orchestration systems including Docker Swarm and Azure ACI.</p>
<p>According to Portainer.io CEO and Co-Founder, Neil Cresswell, Portainer CE 2.0 is a hugely important release for Portainer; “It takes the company back to its true open source roots as Portainer CE 2.0 no longer includes ‘Extensions’, Portainer’s previously paid-for features,” he explains.</p>
<p>“While the addition of Kubernetes embraces our ability to support the full breadth of the container management community. Portainer CE 2.0 also lays the foundational platform for Portainer Business, Portainer’s soon to be released premium service for business customers.”</p>
<p>Last month Portainer attracted an initial<a href="https://www.portainer.io/2020/08/portainer-io-closes-us1-2-million-seed-financing/"> seed funding round</a> of US$1.2 million to fast-track its growth plans.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>Compared to a few years ago, there’s no doubt that open source vendors can be financially successful. Red Hat paved the way. In the last quarter before the IBM acquisition, Red Hat achieved a $3.7B annualized revenue run rate<sup>[1]</sup>. <strong>That’s incredible.</strong> Despite Red Hat’s success, the overwhelming majority of today’s open source vendors are not following Red Hat’s footsteps. For good reasons, most companies follow an open core model (selling proprietary software that extends the functionality of the “open core” aka the open source project). It provides more flexibility and allows for better monetization in most cases.</p><p>When I reflect on the many conversations I had with technical startup founders over the last year, I see another sea change happening: <strong>It’s less about the open source movements' ideals and philosophical beliefs.</strong> What matters to this new “class” of founders is whether using open source makes their company more successful or not. Some of them push it to an extreme and see it as their primary differentiator. “<em>We are like x, but open source</em>”. I don’t believe this theme will last for long but might provide an edge in certain markets for a short period of time. The approach can be powerful if paired with another unique differentiator (e.g., Mattermost = Slack but self-managed/on-premise + open source).</p><p>Some people believe that open source software will take over the world. I disagree. <strong>Open source doesn’t necessarily result in better products.</strong> More importantly, most non-developers<sup>[2]</sup> don’t care about open source. It’s irrelevant to their purchase decisions. It’s not driving consumer behavior. The reason is straightforward. If you don’t have the desire or skills to download and run an open source project, there’s no advantage over a comparable product that’s free. There is one caveat to this. Developers can bring non-developer products into a company if they play an important role in adopting these products (e.g., Stripe as a payment provider).</p><p>If you consider building a B2B company that serves a technical audience, open source might be a powerful tool for you. Most likely, you will pick open core<sup>[3]</sup> as a monetization strategy. <strong>Open core has a “built-in conflict” between the open source project, the community, and the commercial vendor.</strong> By definition, if you extend the “open core” with proprietary functionality (so that you can monetize), you hold functionality from the open source project. Managing this conflict is crucial for the success of your company. It will help tremendously if you derive what goes into open source vs. what’s proprietary from first principles.</p><figure><img src="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Open-Source-vs.-Proprietary-v2---Cut.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Open-Source-vs.-Proprietary-v2---Cut.jpg 600w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/Open-Source-vs.-Proprietary-v2---Cut.jpg 1000w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/Open-Source-vs.-Proprietary-v2---Cut.jpg 1600w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Open-Source-vs.-Proprietary-v2---Cut.jpg 2206w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>There’s one important question you should ask yourself for every new capability:</p><p><strong>Who is the primary user of this feature?</strong></p><p>If the user/beneficiary of a feature is the <strong>developer</strong>, it should always go into 	open source. The better your open source project is, the more adoption you will see. In case there are multiple, competitive projects in a given problem space, it will also help you differentiate and win<sup>[4]</sup>. All of that results in a larger addressable market for you. As an open source vendor, you are constrained by the adoption of your open source project. Assuming you hold back those developer features, and try to monetize them, you will not generate a lot of revenue. The money is somewhere else (manager, executive). If you want to monetize the developer adoption, offer a SaaS product.</p><p>If the user/beneficiary of a feature is the <strong>manager</strong>, you can most likely keep the capability proprietary. The most important exception to this rule is if engineering managers are the primary users of the product (e.g., a tool that helps the manager manage). Another way to think about this is the following: Within an organizational hierarchy, you monetize the top (exec/manager) and contribute the bottom capabilities (practitioner/manager) to open source.</p><p>If the user/beneficiary of a feature is an <strong>executive</strong>, you keep the capability proprietary.</p><p><strong>There are two reasons for this framework.</strong></p><p>The obvious one is the monetization potential of a given capability. Executives can spend more money ($$$), than managers ($$), who can spend more than practitioners ($). You lose very little by not monetizing the persona with the least monetization potential. In return, you are more likely to get a lot of bottom-up adoption, making selling to executives/managers easier. Additionally, offering a SaaS product allows you to monetize the practitioner segment at least partially.</p><p>The second reason is less obvious but equally critical. Executives won’t contribute to your open source project. Managers will do it rarely. If they need a specific capability, they won’t open a PR towards your open source project. In some cases, they might ask an engineer in their organization to build it for them, but that’s the exception, and rarely the case if you offer the capability for a reasonable price. Developers are the opposite. If they miss a capability, they will be inclined to contribute. This is fantastic and exactly what you want because it increases the value of your open source project. Most important, rejecting a PR from a developer for a developer feature (because you want to monetize it) will inadvertently create conflict. Other developers will be less inclined to contribute, causing your open source project to suffer. You won’t have a thriving and growing community.</p><p><strong>Open Core is a terrific business model if you manage the inherent conflict about what to open-source and what to keep proprietary well.</strong></p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Open Core - Monetize Through First Principles<a href="https://t.co/mWOab4nYbD">https://t.co/mWOab4nYbD</a></p>— Moritz Plassnig (@moritzplassnig) <a href="https://twitter.com/moritzplassnig/status/1299876092745052161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 30, 2020</a></blockquote>

<![CDATA[Show HN: Editor Blending Markdown, Blocks and Wysiwyg]]>
            </title>

August 31, 2020 | https://papyrs.com/block-wiki-markdown-editor/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://papyrs.com/block-wiki-markdown-editor/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>
<p>
Many Markdown editors render a preview of the result but don't allow visual editing, which makes it difficult to edit
visual elements like tables. Block-based editors on the other hand, great
for creating pages with many different types of content, don't support editing with Markdown (or if they do, limited
to adding some markup within a single block, instead of actually editing the doc).
</p>
<p>For our <a href="https://papyrs.com/">wiki/knowledge base app</a>, we've been working on a new editor. Our aim was to have one simple editor
which would work for sharing pretty much anything, from visual pages
with interactive elements to mostly-textual documentation &amp; tech specs. The idea was it should be just as pleasant
to use for an engineer writing a technical document, HR building a form or internal comms posting news.</p>
<p>Putting it all together, some observations for the editor we wanted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Familiar to non-technical people (WYSIWYG, drag&amp;drop).
</li><li>Markdown as an option is great for portability/importing, copy-pasting, writing (large) text docs.
</li><li>Widgets to add and edit rich elements (polls, embeds, forms, tasks, and so on).
</li><li>When working in a team, some people will prefer WYSIWYG, some a markup language. People need to be able to switch between the two.
</li></ul>
<p>Some examples of what combining all these elements look like:</p>
<h3>Easy table editing</h3>
<p>The editor supports some Markdown extensions such as tables and checklists from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>.
These are also available as widgets in our visual editor, and by just switching between Markdown and visual editing,
we can easily do things like manipulate tables, add rows, delete columns, and so on.</p>

<source src="https://papyrs.com/site_media/images/v3/editor/markdown-editor-table.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<h3>Quick task list editing</h3>
<p>Plain text is great for importing, copy-pasting and so on. In this example we have a list of tasks as a text document, which
we can simply copy-paste. Switching to visual mode brings the plain text to live as it were, making it easy to perform actions
on like reordering tasks, completing subtasks or dragging a set of tasks between different task lists.</p>

<source src="https://papyrs.com/site_media/images/v3/editor/editor-checklist-markdown-blocks.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<h3>Re-ordering with drag&amp;drop</h3>
<p>When switching from Markdown to visual editing, the editor will automatically convert a Markdown document back into widgets (blocks) and vice versa.
This way we can switch between the two whenever an action is more convenient in either visual mode or Markdown, such as dragging around some
content.</p>

<source src="https://papyrs.com/site_media/images/v3/editor/editor-blocks-markdown-drag.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<h3>Putting it all together</h3>
<p>
The example below shows a bit of everything: using drag&amp;drop, keyboard shortcuts (command palette), adding
interactive widgets (poll/calendar), editing the layout.. and still having the option to use Markdown. 🦄</p>
<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" poster="https://papyrs.com/site_media/images/v3/main-movie-poster.jpg">

</video>
<h3>Some more examples</h3>
<p>
If you want to see some more screenshots, check out the <a href="https://papyrs.com/#use-case-examples">example gallery</a>.
We've also built <a href="https://papyrs.com/docsv2/" target="_blank">our own product docs</a> (such as Papyrs' API documentation) in the editor.

<p>If you think this is useful or want to give it a spin, sign up to <a href="https://papyrs.com/try/">create a Papyrs site</a>.
It contains a bunch of example pages so you can dive in and give the editor a go. It's a free trial but we have a free plan for personal use.</p>

<h2 id="course-content">Course content</h2>
<p>The course is two-fold.</p>
<p>On the one hand it introduces functional programming: Immutable data, algebraic datatypes, pattern matching, recursion, functions as first-class values, proper tail calls, type-directed programming and functional programming patterns.</p>
<p>On the other hand it introduces 'Property-based testing' (QuickCheck) (next generation automated testing) expressed within the functional programming context: Generators, properties, shrinking, statistics of generators, type-directed testing, testing of imperative code while touching upon a number of more general testing concepts as debugging, unit-testing, corner cases, blackbox and whitebox testing and fuzzing.</p>
<p>Finally the course covers a number of real-world case studies of property-based testing, e.g., an automated test of the AUTOSAR specification for Volvo.</p>
<h2 id="practicalities">Practicalities</h2>
<p>The course consists of a mix of lectures and practical exercises, held in weekly 4-hour sessions.</p>
<p>Lectures: Mondays 12:15-16:00 in <a href="https://clients.mapsindoors.com/sdu/573f26e4bc1f571b08094312/details/563cb924423b7d0540c9a4a6">room U82</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the last year or so, Yale’s DHLab has undertaken a series of experiments organized around analysis of visual culture. Some of those experiments have involved <a href="https://douglasduhaime.com/posts/identifying-similar-images-with-tensorflow.html">identifying similar images</a> and visualizing patterns uncovered in this process. In this post, I wanted to discuss how we used the amazing Three.js library to build a WebGL-powered <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/lab-apps/pix-plot/index.html">visualization</a> that can display tens of thousands of images in an interactive 3D environment [click to enter]:</p>

</a></p>

<p>If you’re interested in creating something similar, feel free to check out the <a href="https://github.com/YaleDHLab/pix-plot">full code</a>.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-with-threejs">Getting Started with Three.js</h2>

<p>Three.js is a JavaScript library that generates lower-level code for WebGL, the standard API for 3D rendering in a web browser. Using Three.js, one can build complex 3D environments that would take much more code to build in raw WebGL. For a quick sample of the projects others have built with the library, check out the <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js homepage</a>.</p>

<p>To get started with Three.js, one needs to provide a bit of boilerplate code with the three essential elements of a Three.js page:</p>

<p><strong>scene</strong>: The scene contains all objects to be rendered:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Create the scene and a camera to view it</span>
<span>var</span> <span>scene</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Scene</span><span>();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>camera</strong>: The camera determines the position from which viewers see the scene:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Specify the portion of the scene visiable at any time (in degrees)</span>
<span>var</span> <span>fieldOfView</span> <span>=</span> <span>75</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Specify the camera's aspect ratio</span>
<span>var</span> <span>aspectRatio</span> <span>=</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>innerWidth</span> <span>/</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>innerHeight</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Specify the near and far clipping planes. Only objects</span>
<span>// between those planes will be rendered in the scene</span>
<span>// (these values help control the number of items rendered</span>
<span>// at any given time)</span>
<span>var</span> <span>nearPlane</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.1</span><span>;</span>
<span>var</span> <span>farPlane</span> <span>=</span> <span>1000</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Use the values specified above to create a camera</span>
<span>var</span> <span>camera</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>PerspectiveCamera</span><span>(</span>
  <span>fieldOfView</span><span>,</span> <span>aspectRatio</span><span>,</span> <span>nearPlane</span><span>,</span> <span>farPlane</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>// Finally, set the camera's position in the z-dimension</span>
<span>camera</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>z</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>renderer</strong>: The renderer renders the scene to a canvas element on an HTML page:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Create the canvas with a renderer and tell the</span>
<span>// renderer to clean up jagged aliased lines</span>
<span>var</span> <span>renderer</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>WebGLRenderer</span><span>({</span><span>antialias</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>});</span>

<span>// Specify the size of the canvas</span>
<span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>setSize</span><span>(</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>innerWidth</span><span>,</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>innerHeight</span> <span>);</span>

<span>// Add the canvas to the DOM</span>
<span>document</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>.</span><span>appendChild</span><span>(</span> <span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>domElement</span> <span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The code above creates the scene, adds a camera, and renders the canvas to the DOM. Now all we need to do is add some objects to the scene.</p>

<p>Each item rendered in a Three.js scene has a <strong>geometry</strong> and a <strong>material</strong>. Geometries use vertices (points) and faces (polygons described by vertices) to define the shape of an object, and materials use textures and colors to define the appearance of that shape. A geometry and a material can be combined into a <strong>mesh</strong>, which is a fully composed object ready to be added to a scene.</p>

<p>The example below uses the high-level <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/geometries/BoxGeometry">BoxGeometry</a>, which comes with pre-built vertices and faces:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Create a cube with width, height, and depth set to 1</span>
<span>var</span> <span>geometry</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>BoxGeometry</span><span>(</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span> <span>);</span>

<span>// Use a simple material with a specified hex color</span>
<span>var</span> <span>material</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>MeshBasicMaterial</span><span>({</span> <span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>0xffff00</span> <span>});</span>

<span>// Combine the geometry and material into a mesh</span>
<span>var</span> <span>cube</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Mesh</span><span>(</span> <span>geometry</span><span>,</span> <span>material</span> <span>);</span>

<span>// Add the mesh to the scene</span>
<span>scene</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span> <span>cube</span> <span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Finally, to render the scene on the page, one must call the <code>render()</code> method, passing in the scene and the camera as arguments:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span> <span>scene</span><span>,</span> <span>camera</span> <span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Combining the snippets above gives the following result:</p>

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="WXdYpx" data-default-tab="result" data-user="duhaime" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="The Simplest Three.js Scene">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime/pen/WXdYpx/">The Simplest Three.js Scene</a> by Douglas Duhaime (<a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime">@duhaime</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<p>This is great, but the scene is static. To add some <strong>animation</strong> to the scene, one can periodically update the cube’s rotation property, then rerender the scene. To do so, one can replace the <code>renderer.render()</code> line above with a render loop that calls itself recursively. Here is a standard render loop in Three.js:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function</span> <span>animate</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span> <span>animate</span> <span>);</span>
  <span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span> <span>scene</span><span>,</span> <span>camera</span> <span>);</span>

  <span>// Rotate the object a bit each animation frame</span>
  <span>cube</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span>
  <span>cube</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>.</span><span>z</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>animate</span><span>();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Adding this block at the bottom of the script makes the cube slowly rotate:</p>

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="vWpvNL" data-default-tab="result" data-user="duhaime" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Animating the Cube">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime/pen/vWpvNL/">Animating the Cube</a> by Douglas Duhaime (<a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime">@duhaime</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<p>Adding <strong>lights</strong> to the scene can make it easier to differentiate the faces of the cube. To add lights to the scene above, we’ll first want to change the cube’s material, because as the documentation says the <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/materials/MeshBasicMaterial">MeshBasicMaterial</a> is not affected by lights. Let’s replace the material defined above with a <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/materials/MeshPhongMaterial">MeshPhongMaterial</a>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>var</span> <span>material</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>MeshPhongMaterial</span><span>({</span><span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>0xffff00</span><span>})</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Next let’s point a light at the cube so that different faces of the cube catch different amounts of light:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Add a point light with #fff color, .7 intensity, and 0 distance</span>
<span>var</span> <span>light</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>PointLight</span><span>(</span><span>0xffffff</span><span>,</span> <span>.</span><span>7</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Specify the light's position in the x, y, and z dimensions</span>
<span>light</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>100</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Add the light to the scene</span>
<span>scene</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>light</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Voila!</p>

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="mqparr" data-default-tab="result" data-user="duhaime" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Lighting the Cube">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime/pen/mqparr/">Lighting the Cube</a> by Douglas Duhaime (<a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime">@duhaime</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<h2 id="adding-images-to-a-scene">Adding Images to a Scene</h2>

<p>The snippets above give a quick overview of the core elements of a Three.js scene. The following section will build upon those ideas to create a TSNE map of images.</p>

<p>To build an image viewer, we’ll need to load some image files into some Three.js materials. We can do so by using the <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/loaders/TextureLoader">TextureLoader</a>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Create a texture loader so we can load the image file</span>
<span>var</span> <span>loader</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>TextureLoader</span><span>();</span>

<span>// Specify the path to an image</span>
<span>var</span> <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>'https://s3.amazonaws.com/duhaime/blog/tsne-webgl/assets/cat.jpg'</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Load an image file into a MeshLambert material</span>
<span>var</span> <span>material</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>MeshLambertMaterial</span><span>({</span>
  <span>map</span><span>:</span> <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span>
<span>});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now that the material is ready, the remaining steps are to generate a geometry from the image, combine the material and geoemtry into a mesh, and add the mesh to the scene, just like the cube example above. Because images are two-dimensional planes, we can use a simple <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/geometries/PlaneGeometry">PlaneGeometry</a> for this object’s geometry:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// create a plane geometry for the image with a width of 10</span>
<span>// and a height that preserves the image's aspect ratio</span>
<span>var</span> <span>geometry</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>PlaneGeometry</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>*</span><span>.</span><span>75</span><span>);</span>

<span>// combine the image geometry and material into a mesh</span>

<p>It’s worth noting that one can swap out the PlanarGeometry for other geometries and Three.js will automatically wrap the material over the new geometry. The example below, for instance, swaps the PlanarGeometry for a more interesting Icosahedron geometry, and rotates the icosahedron inside the render loop:</p>

<h2 id="building-custom-geometries">Building Custom Geometries</h2>

<p>The examples above use a few different geometries built into Three.js. Those geometries are based on the fundamental <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/core/Geometry">THREE.Geometry</a> class, which is a primitive geometry one can use to create custom geometries. THREE.Geometry is lower-level than the prebuilt geometries used above, but it gives performance gains that make it worth the effort.</p>

<p>Let’s create a custom geometry by calling the THREE.Geometry constructor, which takes no arguments:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>var</span> <span>geometry</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Geometry</span><span>();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This geometry object doesn’t do much yet, because it doesn’t have any vertices with which to ariculate a shape. Let’s add four vertices to the geometry, one for each corner of the image. Each vertex takes three arguments, which define the vertex’s x, y, and z positions respectively:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// identify the image width and height</span>
<span>var</span> <span>imageSize</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>7.5</span><span>};</span>

<span>// identify the x, y, z coords where the image should be placed</span>

<span>var</span> <span>coords</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>-</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>-</span><span>3.75</span><span>,</span> <span>z</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>};</span>

<span>// add one vertex for each image corner in this order:</span>

    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>z</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now that the vertices are in place, we need to add some faces to the geometry. The code below will model an image as two triangle faces, as triangles are performant primitives in the WebGL world. The first triangle will combine the lower-left, lower-right, and upper-right vertices of the image, and the second will triangulate the lower-left, upper-right, and upper-left vertices of the image:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// add the first face (the lower-right triangle)</span>
<span>var</span> <span>faceOne</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Face3</span><span>(</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>4</span><span>,</span>

  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>2</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>// add the second face (the upper-left triangle)</span>
<span>var</span> <span>faceTwo</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Face3</span><span>(</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>4</span><span>,</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>2</span><span>,</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>1</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>// add those faces to the geometry</span>
<span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>faces</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>faceOne</span><span>,</span> <span>faceTwo</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Awesome, we now have a geometry with four vertices that describe the corners of the image, and two faces that describe the lower-right and upper-left-hand triangles of the image. The next step is to describe which portions of the cat image should appear in each of the faces of the geometry. To do so, one …</p></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Grover’s algorithm is a quantum computing algorithm invented to search from <strong>unstructured</strong> database using less than $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries. Comparing to $O(N)$ which is the best asymptotical complexity that a classical search algorithm could achieve for unstructured database, Grover’s algorithm is significantly better.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss Grover’s algorithm and its caveats in details.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>From the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Simon-Algorithm/">property of Hadamard operator</a>, we have already known that</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We denote it using $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$ for our convenience.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \mathbf{s} \rangle &amp;= H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The following equation would be useful for this article.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | - I &amp;= 2 \Big( H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \Big) \otimes_{\text{outer}} \Big( H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \Big) - I \\
&amp;= 2 \Big( H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \Big) \Big( H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \Big)^{\dagger} - I \\
&amp;= 2 H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle | \mathbf{0} \rangle^{\dagger}  H^{\otimes {n} \dagger} - I \\
&amp;= 2 H^{\otimes {n}} \big(| \mathbf{0} \rangle \langle \mathbf{0} |\big)  H^{\otimes {n}} - I \\
&amp;= 2 H^{\otimes {n}} \big(| \mathbf{0} \rangle \langle \mathbf{0} |\big)  H^{\otimes {n}} - H^{\otimes {n}} I H^{\otimes {n}} \\
&amp;= H^{\otimes {n}} \big(2 | \mathbf{0} \rangle \langle \mathbf{0} | - I \big) H^{\otimes {n}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $| \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} |$ is the outer product of $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$ and $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$ and the $\otimes_{\text{outer}}$ is the outer product. Note that outer product $\otimes_{\text{outer}}$ is a little bit different from Kronecker product which we have used $\otimes$ to denote in the previous articles.</p>



<p>Let’s check what $| \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} |$ is.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | &amp;= \bigg( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \bigg) \otimes_{\text{outer}} \bigg( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \bigg) \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } \sum_{ \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes_{\text{outer}} | \mathbf{y} \rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } \sum_{ \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \langle \mathbf{y} | \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    1 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \\
    1 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
    1 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}_{2^n \times 2^n} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} J_{2^n \times 2^n} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $J$ is the unit matrix.</p>



<p>We further define matrix $A$</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
A &amp;= | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} J_{2^n \times 2^n} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We would like to further show that matrix $2A - I$ is unitary.</p>



<p>It is trivial to see that $A^{\dagger} = A$, therefore, $(2A - I)^{\dagger} = 2A - I$. Because</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
(2A - I)^{\dagger} (2A - I) &amp;= (2A - I) (2A - I)^{\dagger} \\
&amp;= (2A - I)^2 \\
&amp;= 4A^2 - 4A + I \\
&amp;= \frac{4}{2^{2n}} 2^n J_{2^n \times 2^n} - \frac{4}{2^n} J_{2^n \times 2^n} + I \\
&amp;= 0 + I \\
&amp;= I \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof that $2A - I$ is unitary.</p>



<p>In addition, $2A - I$ is actually an reflection matrix that could reflect the vector $| \mathbf{x} \rangle$ about $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \mathbf{x}^{\prime} \rangle&amp;= (2A - I) | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= (2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | - I) | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= 2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | | \mathbf{x} \rangle - | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= 2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle ( \langle \mathbf{s} | | \mathbf{x} \rangle ) - | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= 2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s}, \mathbf{x} \rangle - | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= 2 \langle \mathbf{s}, \mathbf{x} \rangle | \mathbf{s} \rangle - | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Typically, given a normalized unit vector $\mathbf{n}$, and a vector $\mathbf{x}$, the reflected vector of vector $\mathbf{x}$ about $\mathbf{n}$ is</p><p>

\[\mathbf{x}^{\prime} = 2 \langle \mathbf{n}, \mathbf{x} \rangle \mathbf{n} - \mathbf{x}\]

</p><p>This is high-school math. If the reader forgot how to understand this, please refer to the blog post <a href="http://paulbourke.net/geometry/reflected/">“Calculating the Reflected Ray”</a>.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof that $2A - I$ is a reflection matrix about $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$.</p>

<h3 id="identity-search-problem">Identity Search Problem</h3>

<p>Suppose we have an array of items $\{v_0, v_1, \cdots, v_{n-1}\}$, and we would like to find a target item $v_g$ to find from the array. Using a classical algorithm, we have to go through the entire array, that is we retrieve items one by one from the array and compare them against the target item. The asymptotic complexity for the worst case and the average case are both $O(n)$.</p>



<p>It seems that $O(n)$ is the best we could do for a search problem using a classical algorithm. How could we know where is target item is in the array without going through the entire array? However, using a quantum algorithm, we would be able to complete a search in $O(\sqrt{n})$. In the next sections, we would see how we could achieve this.</p>



<p>Suppose all the items are distinct and there is only one item matching the query, the search problem could be modeled using a given function $f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$, and we are assured that there exits exactly one binary string $\mathbf{x}^\ast$, such that</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
f(\mathbf{x}) &amp;= 
    \begin{cases}
      1 &amp; \text{when $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}^\ast$}\\
      0 &amp; \text{when $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast$}\\
    \end{cases} 
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The search problem is converted to find $\mathbf{x}^\ast$.</p>

<h3 id="grovers-algorithm">Grover’s Algorithm</h3>

<h4 id="quantum-oracle-circuit">Quantum Oracle Circuit</h4>

<p>The following quantum oracle circuit is used for phase inversion in the Grover’s algorithm.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-08-22-Grover-Algorithm/oracle.png">
    <figcaption>Quantum Oracle Circuit</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>This quantum oracle circuit has been well discussed in my previous article on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>. We have known that</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
|\varphi_2\rangle &amp;= (-1)^{f(\mathbf{x})} |\mathbf{x}\rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>If the top input qubits to $U_f$ is an equal superposition, i.e.,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \mathbf{s} \rangle &amp;= H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>what will the top output qubits be?</p>



<p>Because we have assumed that there is only one $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}^\ast$, such that $f(\mathbf{x}) = 1$, and for $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast$ we have $f(\mathbf{x}) = 0$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
|\varphi_2\rangle &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \Bigg( \sum_{\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast}^{} (-1)^{0} |\mathbf{x}\rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \Bigg) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} (-1)^{1} |\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \Bigg( \sum_{\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast}^{} |\mathbf{x}\rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \Bigg) - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} |\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \\
&amp;= \Bigg( \sum_{\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast}^{} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} |\mathbf{x}\rangle - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} |\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle \Bigg) \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This means that for the top output qubits, although we have equal probability to observe each of the base qubit states, the phase amplitude of the base qubit $|\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle$ is different from all the others! That is also to say, the phase of the top input qubits is 
$\big[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \big]$, but the phase of the output qubits becomes $\big[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}},\cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \big]$.</p>

<h4 id="phase-diffusion-circuit">Phase Diffusion Circuit</h4>

<p>Now, in order to find $| \mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle$, the strategy becomes straightforward. We just have to find out the base qubits state whose phase amplitude is different from others. The question is, how to find it?</p>



<p>Let’s do some dummy trials. If we send the top output qubits to another identical quantum oracle circuit, the phase will go back to $\big[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \big]$. The readers could verify this on you own. This means we have gone back to the origin. We should probably do something differently.</p>



<p>What Grover found was actually very smart. The average of the phase amplitudes $\big[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}},\cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \big]$ is a value only a little bit smaller than $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}$, because the majority of the phase amplitudes are $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}$, and only one phase amplitude corresponding to $|\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle$, which we denote as $\alpha_{\mathbf{x}^{\ast}}$, is $-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}$. If we could <em>inverse the phase amplitude about the mean</em>, the absolute value of $\alpha_{\mathbf{x}^{\ast}}$ will become the largest among all the phase amplitudes.</p>



<p>Specifically, at time step $t$, suppose the phase amplitude for each base qubits state $|\mathbf{x} \rangle$ is $\alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t}$. The average of the phase amplitudes $\mu_t$ is</p><p>

\[\mu_t = \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{\mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n}^{} \alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t}\]

</p><p>After the <em>inversion about the mean</em>, the phase amplitudes would become</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t}^{\prime} &amp;= (\mu_t - \alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t}) + \mu_t \\
&amp;= 2\mu_t - \alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t} \\
\end{align}\]

            <p>As I have mentioned in other posts on this blog (and surely many would agree here), I strongly believe that a great start for designing a program is figuring out good representations for the real world problem one tries to solve, <em>i.e.</em> defining appropriate types.
One helpful technique for that is what one could call <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Julia/comments/ijln21/blog_sum_types_in_julia_and_rust/g3f1gtn/"><em>optionality</em></a> .<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
Interestingly, it is expressed completely differently in different programming languages which I would like to briefly demonstrate in this article using Rust and Julia as examples.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong>
Julia and Rust are my favourite programming languages and they are particularly suited to demonstrate my point.
That should not stop you from reading if you use neither of these languages, though!
First, both have a rather intuitive syntax and the code shown here is really basic, so you should be able to follow along.
Second, you can probably substitute your inheritance-using language for Julia (<em>e.g.</em> Java) or your tagged-union-using language for Rust (<em>e.g.</em> Haskell).
Even if not, you might learn something anyway!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>
<p>Suppose, you are creating an intergalactic game where players can inhabit three different star systems: Our sun (the <em>solarians</em>), the polar star (the <em>polarians</em>) and Alpha Centauri (the <em>centaurians</em>).
An obvious first step would be to define types for each of these three classes:</p>
<p>In Julia:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>struct</span> Solarian <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Polarian <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Centaurian <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>and in Rust (I will stick to this order if not stated otherwise):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>Solarian</span>;
<span>struct</span> <span>Polarian</span>;
<span>struct</span> <span>Centaurian</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>(You would add some fields to those structs, of course, but that’s not the point here.)</p>
<p>Now, let’s say you need to store the player value in another object like a game state:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>struct</span> GameState
    daytime<span>::</span><span>UInt</span>
    player<span>::???</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>GameState</span> {
    daytime: <span>u64</span>,
    player: <span>???</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>What type would you use for <code>player</code> in each case?
And what about</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>function</span> homestar(player<span>::???</span>)<span>::</span>String
    <span>...</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(player: <span>???</span>) -&gt; <span>String</span> {
    ...
}
</code></pre></div><p>These are the questions we’re here for.</p>
<h2 id="strategy-1-inheritance--subtyping">Strategy 1: Inheritance / subtyping</h2>
<h3 id="julia">Julia</h3>
<p>This is very straightforward in Julia.
Define</p>
<p>and make the structs from above subtypes of that:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>struct</span> Solarian <span>&lt;:</span> Player <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Polarian <span>&lt;:</span> Player <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Centaurian <span>&lt;:</span> Player <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Dynamic dispatch then allows you to write:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia">homestar(player<span>::</span>Solarian) <span>=</span> <span>"sun"</span>
homestar(player<span>::</span>Polarian) <span>=</span> <span>"polar star"</span>
homestar(player<span>::</span>Centaurian) <span>=</span> <span>"Alpha Centauri"</span>
homestar(player<span>::</span>Player) <span>=</span> <span>"unknown"</span> <span># or `error("Unknown player class")`</span>
</code></pre></div><h3 id="rust">Rust</h3>
<p>Rust does not have subtyping but you can define relations between types via <em>traits</em> (similar to interfaces in other languages).
So, we can try</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>trait</span> Player {
    <span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; <span>String</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>and then</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl</span> Player <span>for</span> Solarian {
    <span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; <span>String</span> {
        <span>String</span>::from(<span>"sun"</span>)
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>But what about the <code>GameState</code> struct?
We can make use of <em>trait objects</em>, about which we only know that they implement a certain trait.
We especially don’t know the object’s size so we need to reference to it.
If you’re familiar with Rust, you know that this either means using a “normal” reference (<code>&amp;</code> or <code>&amp;mut</code>) and dealing with life time annotations (not my favourite, to be honest) or using a <code>Box</code>ed value.
If you’re not familiar with that, it doesn’t really matter here anyway.
<code>GameState</code> could look like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>GameState</span> {
    daytime: <span>u64</span>,
    player: <span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span>dyn Player<span>&gt;</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>This works, but does restrict us in what we can do with the <code>Player</code> trait, as it needs to be <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety"><em>object safe</em></a>.
For example, greeting another player of an arbitrary class</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>trait</span> Player {
    <span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; <span>String</span>;
    <span>fn</span> <span>greet</span><span>&lt;</span>T: <span>Player</span><span>&gt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self, other: <span>&amp;</span><span>T</span>);
}
</code></pre></div><p>would not work anymore.</p>
<p>This would be easy in Julia, though:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia">greet(self<span>::</span>Polarian, other<span>::</span>Player) <span>=</span> println(<span>"Hi!"</span>)
greet(self<span>::</span>Polarian, other<span>::</span>Solarian) <span>=</span> println(<span>"Your star doesn't even consist of three separate stars? Pathetic!"</span>)
</code></pre></div><h2 id="strategy-1b-constrained-generics">Strategy 1b: Constrained generics</h2>
<p>Both Julia and Rust offer defining generic types with type parameters.
Additionally, one can put constraints on those parameters.
This allows us to do a smiliar thing as in strategy 1 but without hiding the concrete player type in the <code>GameState</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>abstract type</span> Player <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Solarian <span>&lt;:</span> Player <span>end</span>

<span>struct</span> GameState{P <span>&lt;:</span> Player}
    daytime<span>::</span><span>UInt</span>
    player<span>::</span>P
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>or</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>trait</span> Player { ... }
<span>struct</span> <span>Solarian</span>;
<span>impl</span> Player <span>for</span> Solarian { ... }

<span>struct</span> <span>GameState</span><span>&lt;</span>P: <span>Player</span><span>&gt;</span> {
    daytime: <span>u64</span>,
    player: <span>P</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>This approach can be considered more performant in general, as the compiler can emit code for concrete types (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-01-syntax.html#performance-of-code-using-generics"><em>monomorphisation</em></a>) instead of carrying around a clumsy super type that keeps track of subtypes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table">virtual method tables</a>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>However, there is a major concern with this approach: <strong>abstraction leaking</strong>.
Users of the <code>GameState</code> struct now have to decide what concrete type to choose for the parameter <code>P</code>, very strictly so in Rust, not so much in Julia.
This can be okay, but often enough <code>GameState</code> is the right place to deal with that question and really should hide that detail.</p>
<p>So as a rule of thumb: Consider generics for this problem “deep down” in your code but don’t miss the abstraction level where it needs to be kept inside.</p>
<h2 id="strategy-2-enumerations">Strategy 2: Enumerations</h2>
<p>So far, the approaches were not really satisfying for Rust.
But enumerations come to the rescue!
Enumerations (or enums) are types that consist of a concrete and explicit list of possible values (so called <em>variants</em>).</p>
<h3 id="rust-1">Rust</h3>
<p>In Rust, those values can even have their own data which is perfect for our situation:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>enum</span> <span>PlayerClass</span> {
    Sol(Solarian),
    Pol(Polarian),
    Cent(Centaurian)
}

<span>struct</span> <span>GameState</span> {
    daytime: <span>u64</span>,
    player: <span>PlayerClass</span>
}

<span>impl</span> PlayerClass {
    <span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; <span>String</span> {
        <span>use</span> PlayerClass::<span>*</span>;
        <span>match</span> self {
            Sol(_) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>String</span>::from(<span>"sun"</span>),
            ...
        }
    }

    <span>fn</span> <span>greet</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self, other: <span>&amp;</span><span>PlayerClass</span>) {
        <span>use</span> PlayerClass::<span>*</span>;
        <span>match</span> (self, other) {
            (Cent(_), Pol(_)) <span>=&gt;</span> println<span>!</span>(<span>"Hello, fellow three-star-systemer!"</span>),
            ...
        };
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>This indeed solves all our previous problems and is hence the go-to pattern for this situation.</p>
<h3 id="julia-1">Julia</h3>
<p>Julia does technically have enums, but not really.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia">@enum PlayerClass Sol Pol Cent
</code></pre></div><p>exists and it will give you a type <code>PlayerClass</code> with exactly these three possible values but enums are not a first class citizen.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
But that’s not even relevant for us, more importantly, enum variants in Julia are <em>not</em> able to carry additional data with them!
So all the information in the fields of the <code>Solarian</code>, <code>Polarian</code>, and <code>Centaurian</code> struct can not be build into the <code>PlayerClass</code> enum.
There is no way to sensibly implement</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>function</span> takedamage!(player<span>::</span>PlayerClass)
    <span>...</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>whereas it is trivial in Rust:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl</span> PlayerClass {
    <span>fn</span> <span>takedamage</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> self) {
        <span>match</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> self {
            PlayerClass::Sol(solarian) <span>=&gt;</span> solarian.health <span>-=</span> <span>42</span>,
            ...
        };
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>assuming the struct <code>Solarian</code> has a field <code>health: u64</code>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>You might have guessed it by now, but the general advice is:
<strong>Use subtyping in Julia and enums in Rust.</strong>
One caveat though: Enums can not be extended from the “outside”.
If you plan to let users of your library add new type variants, you will have to use some kind of trait approach.</p>
<p>If you are somewhat familiar with Rust or Julia then a large part of this article is probably very obvious to you.
“Of course I use subtyping, that’s what everybody <em>loves</em> Julia for!” or “Of course I use enums, they’re one of <em>the</em> key features of Rust!” you might say.</p>
<p>However, I find it quite surprising that these two – seemingly rather different – patterns can be used in the same situation.
If you are (without loss of generality) a Julia developer, being aware of the corresponding pattern in Rust might help you design appropriate types faster, should you ever get into that situation; and vice versa.</p>

<p>30 Aug 2020</p>

<p>The decentralized nature of the Internet and the ability to self-host content has always been appealing to me.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m really interested in taking problems and re-working them so that they can be solved without an obvious single point of failure instead of requiring a single central coordinating actor. This can be accomplished using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer</a> networking â€” instead of connecting to a single server, one would connect with multiple other peers on their network. Coincidentally, I also enjoy collecting data. Thus, the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent">BitTorrent protocol</a></strong> is particularly interesting to me. For this post, I thought I would walk through a conceptual example to help de-mystify how the protocol works.</p>

<p>Upfront warning: there will be a decent amount of hand-waving around the actual networking component of the protocol, since I believe it would just bog down this post (and, realistically, Iâ€™d make a fool of myself).</p>

<h3 id="setting-the-scene">Setting the Scene</h3>

<p>We just finished running an event. Awesome. Maybe it was a conference, an unconference, or somewhere in the middle. It went well and weâ€™re feeling real proud of ourselves. This was also the first year we had talk transcripts as well as a professional photographer. We want to share this content with our organizers! Thereâ€™s one issue thoughâ€¦ the organizers are located all over the world!</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s plenty of options here â€” you could share a SomeCorpCloudServiceâ„¢ Folderâ€¦ maybe run an FTP serverâ€¦ what about physically mailing USB sticks to everyone? All very plausible options. But youâ€™re hesitating. That sounds like a lot of work for you, whether it be paying money for the storage, making sure a device stays plugged in 24/7, or licking tons of envelopes.</p>

<p>What if there was a way your organizers could help forward along the content to other organizers? Maybe some kind of organizer-to-organizer protocolâ€¦ ðŸ¤”</p>

<h3 id="a-first-attempt">A First Attempt</h3>

<p>Letâ€™s think of what we have here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A pre-defined list of files we want to share.</li>
  <li>A list of clients (ie. organizers, IP addressesâ€¦ basically the same thing) we want to share these files with. This is called a <strong>swarm</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>So we develop a simple application. The application will keep track of which files youâ€™ve already downloaded and which ones youâ€™re missing. Itâ€™ll connect you to the swarm and open up individual connections to each person. This might be the entire swarm, or it could be just a few people.</p>

<p>These connections then support the following operations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We can announce to the entire swarm which files we have already downloaded. We would do this when we first connect to the swarm, when others connect to the swarm, or when our set of downloaded files changes.</li>
  <li>We can connect to a specific client to send or receive a file.</li>
</ol>

<p>The process of sharing works by having a client <em>A</em> check which files it is missing, waiting for another client (<em>B</em>) to announce it has the file, and then communicating with client <em>B</em> to receive the file. Then client <em>A</em> would announce that it now has this file for anyone else who might need it. This lets content propagate through our swarm without always needing to get the files from the same person! That way we are not stuck content-less just because client <em>B</em> decided to go to bed early.</p>

<p>But there seems to be a problem here. Someone needs to provide the content initially, otherwise everyone will just be constantly announcing that they have no files. This is called the <strong>initial seed</strong>.</p>

<p>How would this work in practice? Suppose we have four clients involved and we need to share <code>IMG_3051.jpg</code>. Initially thereâ€™s only three clients in the swarm and none of them have the image. But in the shadows there lurks a mythical fourth client who has yet to connect and who has the image.</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene1.svg" alt="Image showing a swarm of three clients missing the file, with a disconnected fourth client possessing the file" width="300px"></p>

<p>When the client connects, it tells everyone which files it has.</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene2.svg" alt="The fourth client joins the swarm announcing it has the image file." width="300px"></p>

<p>And now things start moving! One of our clients has a fast internet connection, hears this message, realizes â€œhey I need that!â€� and asks for the file. The send completes!</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene3.svg" alt="A send occurs for the file and now a second client has the file." width="300px"></p>

<p>Now that it has the file, this client decides to re-announce what it has.</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene4.svg" alt="Two clients are now announcing they have the file." width="300px"></p>

<p>Time continues flowing. Our remaining clients have now heard both announcements and can receive the file from either client. The <strong>initial seed</strong> could now leave without leaving clients to dry.</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene5.svg" alt="Everyone now has the files, with sends being issued from each client." width="300px"></p>

<p>With this application, we can now share our content peer-to-peer without needing to remain connected the entire time! Others can take up part of the sharing work.</p>

<h3 id="big-files-slow-connections">Big Files, Slow Connections</h3>

<p>The application is working well! Our organizers are slowly getting all of the generated media. Key word being <em>slowly</em>. Youâ€™ve gotten a few reports now that users will occasionally get stuck waiting ages for some of the larger files (RAW images are quite large after all). Not everyone in our swarm has fast internet connections, so the experience can be sub-optimal if you end up requesting a small file from a fast client and a large file from a slow client.</p>

<p>Your first guess here might be to always prioritize selecting the fastest client in the swarm. That sounds reasonableâ€¦ until they get bombarded with requests. Their home connection slows to a crawl. Eventually, they figure out that Netflix is streaming at awful quality due to the application and decide to close it â€” right as someone had downloaded exactly 99% of the image, leaving them unhappy.</p>

<p>A light bulb goes off in your head: <strong>why not split up our files into smaller pieces</strong>? This kills two birds with one stone! It minimizes the impact of slow connectionsâ€¦ downloading 100Kb from a slow connection is less painful than trying to download 100Mb. It also helps avoid re-downloading! If you are on a slow internet connection and already have 99% of a file downloaded and the connection drops all you need to do is download the missing piece instead of re-downloading the entire file.</p>

<p>So itâ€™s time to tweak our application â€” version 2.0.</p>

<p>Your application now conceptually splits up each file into <strong>pieces</strong>. Each piece has the same size. The protocol now uses the following operations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We can tell the entire swarm which <strong>pieces</strong> we have already downloaded.</li>
  <li>We can send/receive a <strong>piece</strong> for a given connection.</li>
</ol>

<p>Picking the piece size actually has an important trade off. As piece size decreases, there are more announces and more file send/receive connections. If your piece size is too low (or too high!), the protocol loses efficiency.</p>

<h3 id="growing-the-swarm">Growing the Swarm</h3>

<p>Initially, we embedded a list of possible clients in our application. This isnâ€™t the most practical: IP addresses change, organizing teams grow, people want to download the file from multiple devices, etc.</p>

<p>We could develop a centralized <strong>tracker</strong> of peers. This service is responsible for tracking the IP addresses of swarm members, and for providing that list to clients. Our application would register with the tracker on startup and query for available peers. The tracker could periodically send out updates as the swarm changes to keep clients up to date.</p>

<p>This seems less than ideal given our initial goal of offloading as much work as possible and not needing to host anything. Feeling inspired from the peer-to-peer nature of the protocol up to this point, you might get curious and wonder if thereâ€™s a way to exchange swarm information peer-to-peer as well. In the real world, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">distributed hash tables</a> are generally used to accomplish this (eg. the BitTorrent protocol uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia">Kademlia</a> system). These approaches all generally require some clients which are always online to bootstrap the search for swarm members, but it provides a way to de-centralize and distribute this work.</p>

<h3 id="do-you-trust-me">Do You Trust Me?</h3>

<p>Up till this point, weâ€™ve trusted all the members of our swarm to send the same files as the <strong>initial seed</strong>. But what if a malicious organizer decides to modify one of the images to make a meme and spreads it masquerading as the original? Alternatively, what if someoneâ€™s connection is flaky and weâ€™re not quite sure we got the right bytes for the image?</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve discussed a similar problem in the past when <a href="https://dominic.cr/2020/05/26/merkle_trees/">Verifying Data with Merkle Trees</a>. The core of solving that problem involved using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum">checksum function</a> on our data and sharing the checksum so that others could verify they had the data we intended.</p>

<p>So we decide to try <strong>embedding a checksum with each file piece</strong> in our application alongside our file piece information. Our application can then verify that any piece received from another client matches the checksum! We can now add untrusted members to the swarm without worrying that they might tamper our file data!</p>

<h3 id="what-about-next-year">What About Next Year?</h3>

<p>Weâ€™ve now established a good conceptual protocol for sharing this type of content. But one part of it is still impractical: so much information is baked directly into the application! Organizers really like the application and would like to use it for other events.</p>

<p>The information we needed to coordinate this dance of file-sharing includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The list of file pieces and their checksums.</li>
  <li>Any information we need to find other swarm members. As an example, this could be the URL for our tracker!</li>
</ul>

<p>If we were to put this information in a file and modify our application to accept these files, we could now re-use the protocol arbitrarily! This means our application could download and share multiple sources at once.</p>

<p>It turns out that this is exactly what a <code>.torrent</code> file contains (along with other data). These files are encoded using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bencode">Bencode</a> format in order to allow flexibility and offer some size reduction. Everything youâ€™ve read in this post is actually used in the BitTorrent protocol: the process itself, file pieces, checksumming, and trackers (or trackerless via distributed hash tables). Our application is the equivalent to a BitTorrent client!</p>

<p><strong>Well done - we over-engineered a simple file-sharing problem and built BitTorrent from scratch.</strong> ðŸŽ‰</p>

<h3 id="aside-encouraging-good-behavior">Aside: Encouraging Good Behavior</h3>

<p>We didnâ€™t really cover a) how to select which clients we interact with and b) how to select which file pieces to get first, but these are both …</p></article></div></div>

<p>Minutes before Nitthin Chandran was set to present his startup to a powerful group of foreign investors, the power went out in his apartment in Bangalore. The timing couldn’t have been worse: power outages are par for the course in the city, where Chandran was presenting remotely via Zoom, but there was life-changing money on the line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chandran, the founder of <a href="https://www.medpiper.com/">MedPiper Technologies</a>, was pitching his Indian hospital-staffing startup for this year’s Demo Day. The two-day event is the culmination of Silicon Valley’s most well-known startup accelerator program, Y Combinator; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/these-are-the-top-y-combinator-companies-of-all-time-based-on-valuation/">notable program graduates</a> include Airbnb, Stripe, and DoorDash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The stakes were high, so Chandran came prepared: his Y Combinator–appointed mentor had advised him to upgrade his internet speed and<strong> </strong>make ready multiple backup options for situations just like this one. Saved by a spare dongle he’d bought on sale at his local market, Chandran delivered his one-minute pitch to an unseen audience of high-powered investors and thousands of viewers, all from his apartment in Bangalore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In spite of the blackout, Chandran kept his cool: “We practiced maybe 100 times before Demo Day.”</p>



<p>For the first time in its 15-year history, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/y-combinator-officially-shifts-its-next-accelerator-class-to-fully-remote-format/">Y Combinator went fully remote</a> with its famed startup accelerator program. With the coronavirus pandemic making travel and in-person meetings nearly impossible, everything from workshops to the all-important Demo Day went online. The remote experience may have flattened the in-person interactions that drive some of the tech industry’s biggest deals. But founders from non-Western markets say that attending Y Combinator remotely didn’t hinder their success — in fact, it helped. Internet connectivity issues aside, foreign founders say the first fully remote Y Combinator has put these companies on a more equal footing with their American counterparts.</p>

<p>In pre-pandemic times, founders accepted to Y Combinator were flown to San Francisco, where they spent three months developing their startups <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2019/02/12/y-combinator-demo-days-2019-san-francisco.html">before presenting to funders at Demo Day</a>. For non-American founders with operations outside the United States, this often meant spending a full financial quarter away from their teams and home markets to attend workshops and networking events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You talk to other international founders, and they’re like, Oh yeah, I spent most of YC on a plane,” said Iain Usiri, a Tanzanian founder whose startup <a href="https://www.ramani.io/">Ramani</a> presented at last week’s Demo Day. By going remote, “The biggest logistical problem is solved,” he said. “You’re on par with a U.S. founder who is in his home market.”</p>



<p>Under normal circumstances, Usiri might’ve fretted over his outfit choice or physical gestures on Demo Day. “Personally, I do well on a stage,” he said. But this time, he and other founders in his class invested in backup internet, high-quality microphones, and new lighting, to ensure their Zoom presentations go as smoothly as possible. A remote presentation has its own anxieties: Usiri said he was so paranoid about power outages in his home in Tanzania, he had nightmares about it leading up to Demo Day. Nicolás López, co-founder of Justo, <a href="https://www.getjusto.com/">a Chilean food-delivery startup</a>, said he worried about competing with social media notifications and emails that might be popping up on investors’ screens during their demo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But logging onto Y Combinator from the comfort of their home markets meant founders could maintain their startups while benefiting from Y Combinator’s coveted mentorships. “Between when we applied for Y Combinator in March and today, we grew our team from 10 to 95,” said López. “I don’t think we would have been able to do that if we had been in Palo Alto for the past three months.”</p>



<p>In Bangalore, MedPiper’s Chandran, who is building a database of verified doctors and nurses in India, was able to take in-person meetings during the period. He said he signed up to 40,000 medical professionals during his time with Y Combinator. “We don’t think we would have done even 60 to 70% of the sales which we were able to close [had we been away],” Chandran told <em>Rest of World.</em> “All these sales were done in person, walking into hospitals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paradoxically, the remote nature of this year’s Y Combinator meant more face time between founders and partners. “I was asking for office hours all the time, sometimes three meetings a week with partners,” Arthur Alvarenga, founder of Brazilian startup <a href="https://chatpay.com.br/">ChatPay</a> said. “Everyone was very available, and with Zoom, things moved faster. You could get on a call faster than going to campus to meet with them if we were in person.”</p>

<p>Crucially, the pandemic has forced investors to consider any and all investments remotely; it’s leveled the playing field. Alvarenga, based in Brazil, might’ve missed out on chances for in-person meetings. But on Zoom, he’s just as remote as a founder in Boston. Both current and former non-Western Y Combinator participants said that funders are now more willing to take meetings and close deals over Zoom, where they once might have required an in-person meeting. Foreign founders in this batch of Demo Day presenters said they walked away from the event with more than 100 interested investors — far more than they could muster in their local markets.</p>



<p>Thomas Hellman, professor of entrepreneurship and innovation at Oxford’s Saïd Business School, said that the remote nature of today’s business environment has changed investor behavior, perhaps to the benefit of non-American founders.<strong> </strong>“Investors who said they would never invest unless they met a person have now written checks to entrepreneurs without meeting them,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But a willingness to close deals over Zoom hasn’t changed some of the inherent challenges in raising money as a foreign startup. U.S.-based companies still constitute the majority of the Y Combinator batch: 39 of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/here-are-the-98-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2020-demo-day-1/">197 startups participated</a> from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Hellman said that, in lieu of organic meetings and face-to-face interactions, venture capital firms are likely to rely on their own referral networks, which he said are essentially frozen during the pandemic. “The biggest thing to look out for is how networks are going to retrench,” he said. “That could lead to more privileged entrepreneurs having access to capital.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite a more remote-friendly environment, Hellmann said foreign startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/22/foreign-startup-founders-face-unique-struggles-to-break-funding-barrier/">still face higher barriers to raising funds</a>. Local companies may still have an advantage, even if it’s a smaller one. “Just because Zoom is making this more democratized, it doesn’t change the fact that some investors are just not going to understand your market or want to invest outside the United States,” said Alvarenga. “And that’s a root problem.”</p>



<p>But for the half a dozen founders from this summer’s batch of presenters who spoke with <em>Rest of World, </em>internet outages and Zoom presentations were minor inconveniences compared to their otherwise positive Y Combinator experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The real value of YC is the network,” said Alvarenga. “The more quality people you put in, the better the network becomes.”</p>

        <b><time datetime="2020-08-20 23:14:10+0200">2020-08-20 23:14:10 +0200</time></b>
        <p>This is going to be a rather long post, and I cannot add sources for everything right away. I may add sources at any time 
without a notice (my edit policy still applies for other kinds of edits nevertheless). Note that for some things I might 
never be able to provide sources as these are simply things I heard about in public chatrooms.</p>
<p>As you may know, I am in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#os-security:fantasycookie17.onederfultech.com">OS Security room on Matrix</a>, 
in which various operating systems are discussed frequently regarding their security. The thing is, it is not that simple, 
as many that have reached widespread use today are much less secure than you would expect (while others which are also widely 
used are <em>more</em> secure than you might think, if not as secure as expected), and those that are secure basically always have 
some other kinds of drawbacks that are not directly related to security, but may be a dealbreaker nevertheless. I will mainly 
focus on desktop and mobile operating systems here, as servers have a very different quantity and quality of attack surface, 
and security should rather be provided by the often well-written, less complex server software, and isolation is done through 
hypervisors anyway, most of the time, as things like clipboard and file sharing are not that important.</p>
<h2>Some basic terms</h2>
<p>It might occur to you that you are not familiar with some of the terms used here. However, I do not know how I could be 
better at explaining them than Wikipedia is (doing so nevertheless seems redundant), so I decided to just link their 
respective pages for you here. (Note: I would normally not explain many of these if they were used in a shorter blogpost 
without all the others, however, the sheer amount of terminology made me deem it appropriate to explain all of them.)</p>

<li>Verified boot: I will actually explain this one myself, because Wikipedia did not appear to have a good definition. Verified boot allows the boot firmware to prevent bootloaders and kernels that do not have a valid cryptographic signature that corresponds to some specified public key to be loaded. These are then supposed to verify the userland, effectively preventing persistent exploits. Now, there has been some criticism, because many devices only allow particular keys, however, good implementations allow you to unlock them, specify your own keys, and then relock them, meaning user freedom is not impacted by this.</li>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">Virtual Machine (VM)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Linux (or GNU/Linux)</h2>
<p>I do not even know where to start here. Linux distros offer easy to use, fast and versatile OSes, however, the security is 
very lacking.</p>
<h3>Sandboxing</h3>
<p>Linux systems by default have no sandboxing of applications at all, meaning a compromise of one app easily leads to full 
system compromise. Now, there are two "solutions" to this: The app distribution systems Snap and Flatpak. Flatpak, however, 
<a href="https://flatkill.org/">has some quite severe issues with its sandbox</a>, and while I cannot state similar things about Snap, I 
have been told it was not much better, and it has its own set of issues, such as only allowing a single, proprietary app store.</p>
<h3>General hardening and memory safety</h3>
<p>The Linux kernel does not incorporate modern hardening techniques such as CFI, it is a monolithic kernel (which makes 
applying the principle of least privilege basically impossible), it is written in non-memory safe languages (mainly C), and 
the situation for desktop programs does not look that much better.</p>
<h3>GUI stack</h3>
<p><ins>Update: I meant the most commonly used GUI stack. Of course, there is no "default", since GNOME, as well as Wayland 
compositors and Lomiri, default to Wayland or Mir, respectively.</ins></p>
<p>The default GUI stack is X11, which has been said to be rather insecure, even by the developers themselves, as it allows any 
program to view and manipulate input and output from any other program. While Wayland is said to be more secure, <a href="https://github.com/Aishou/wayland-keylogger">keylogging 
through <code>/proc</code> is still possible</a>.</p>
<p><ins>Update: The mentioned exploit does not use <code>/proc</code>.</ins></p>
<h3>But I always thought Linux was super safe and had almost no bugs?</h3>
<p>The kernel alone contains million lines of code. <a href="https://syzkaller.appspot.com/upstream">Syzbot, a bot used for testing Linux and other kernels finds plenty bugs 
every month, and many of them are not fixed</a>.</p>
<h3>Hardened Linux distros</h3>
<p><ins>Update: As mentioned above, the Wayland keylogger relies on the <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> environment variable, meaning properly 
sandboxed applications may not be able to exploit it. However, the issues with the kernel (which does the majority of the 
sandboxing itself through the namespaces feature), as well as the applications themselves remain.</ins></p>
<p>Actually hardened Linux distros like <a href="https://whonix.org/">Whonix</a> or <a href="https://clip-os.org/en/">CLIP OS</a> do provide better 
security, however they come or will come with restrictions like restricted root or not being able to make files executable 
that were not installed by the package manager, or running any app outside of a restrictive sandbox, due to their use of 
restrictive MAC policies. I also consider it likely that none of them can fix the architectural issues with the kernel and 
GUI stacks, as well as the fact most Linux programs are not designed to be run in a sandbox.</p>
<h2>Android</h2>
<p>Android is a Linux-based OS by Google that greatly improves on the security of the latter. All apps run in sandboxes confined 
from each other, it has strong SELinux policies, and several devices feature a full verified boot implementation, in the case of the 
Google Pixel line, it is especially good, as it is possible to use custom keys, as well as both unlocking and relocking the 
bootloader. Memory safe languages like Java and Kotlin are commonplace. It also partially fixes the issue with Linux being a 
monolithic kernel, as it often uses stub drivers in the kernel that actually rely on userspace drivers. Nevertheless, one 
should not overlook issues such as the way it has become a closed ecosystem, with many devices being non-repairable, the use 
of a a very specific, apparently hard to port API (as the fact the Anbox compatibility layer for Linux does not work that 
great shows), and the reliance of many apps on proprietary Google services (though, to be fair, this is less common in apps 
that are free and open source software). Another issue is that neither the apps nor the GUI are really desktop friendly; they 
remain focused on the use on small touchscreens. For security, GrapheneOS, which is based on Android, should be considered.</p>
<h2>ChromiumOS</h2>
<p>ChromiumOS is another OS by Google, based on Linux. Like Android, it uses SELinux policies, and offers isolation of 
desktop apps from the main operating system. However, there is one glaring issue with this: The central elemenet of the system, 
prominently featured in the name, and perhaps the one program with the largest attack surface; the web browser, is only 
isolated by its own sandbox as well as said SELinux policies, and not by the stronger isolation that their own KVM-based 
emulator crosvm offers, which is written in Rust and can thus be considered memory safe. It is also one of the worst 
operating systems for privacy due to <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/login">the way how login is handled</a>.</p>
<h2>BSD</h2>
<p>FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, HardenedBSD and so on all promise secure operating systems. While they are probably not as bad as 
Linux, especially on servers, their security is still lacking, and they have no proper desktop security model at all, mainly 
because they use X11 for a GUI stack, and browsers that have sandboxes elsewhere are not sandboxed here. They still use 
memory unsafe languages and monolithic kernels. <a href="https://isopenbsdsecu.re/">Here</a> is some more information on OpenBSD 
specifically, which, while having improved security for various programs, and utilizing quite a bit more hardening than Linux, 
is not actually as secure as it claims, due to aforementioned issues.
<ins> Update: NetBSD runs some drivers in user space by using a special "rump kernel", which should make them more portable. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbsd#Virtualization">Source</a></ins></p>
<h2>MacOS and iOS</h2>
<p>These are partially open source operating systems by Apple. They both have (locked-down) verified boot implementations, and 
both employ a certain degree of sandboxing for apps. There is not much to say, they are rather good, but the only devices where 
they properly run is Apple ones, which are known for rather bad value and low repairability. The security model, while okay, 
is not too interesting to be honest. Privacy-wise, they are fine if telemetry is disabled, especially considering the fact 
that both the Safari web browser and the sandbox try to minimize tracking that can be conducted by websites and apps, 
respectively.</p>
<h2>Windows</h2>
<p>The main reasons I see this operating system being liked by the security community include the Hyper-V hypervisor, which 
<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-05089-3_51">apparently is supposed to be formally verified</a>, as well as 
Windows Defender Application Guard (WDAG), which is supposed to run the Microsoft Edge browser and other applications in a 
specialized VM. Microsoft store apps are also sandboxed, however they are… well, mostly stereotypical apps, and less actual, 
common desktop software. Issues with this one include it is slow, cannot be properly used with a GUI (not that you would want 
to anyway, given how much the Windows command line sucks compared to the one on POSIX/UNIX systems), highly targeted, proprietary, 
costs a lot of money if obtained legally, especially if you want the better versions with more security features and such, and 
is a privacy nightmare out of the box, some of which cannot be disabled in the non-Enterprise/Education versions.</p>
<h2>Qubes OS</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes OS</a> is actually one of my favorites, and it is what I used to write this post. It has a 
great desktop security model based on isolating different programs into different VMs, good hardware compatibility due to the 
use of a Linux kernel for drivers, and allows you to run instances of the …</p></article></div></div>

									♦ <a href="https://petersmagnusson.org/2009/09/15/why-are-there-5280-feet-in-a-mile/#comments">10 Comments</a>							</p>

			<p>The original Roman mile was 1000 paces (<em>milia passuum</em>), or 5000 feet. The modern mile was defined as 5280 feet under Queen Elizabeth at the end of the 16th century in order to reconcile multiple discordant measurement systems already in wide use. In particular, it was convenient to make it an even multiple of the sides of an acre, which since early medieval times was a rectangle 660 feet long and 66 feet wide. 660 divides neatly into 5280, eight ways, allowing a square mile (640 acres or a “section”) to be conveniently quartered three times over: into quarter sections (160 acres), sixteenth sections (40 acres), and finally the 10 acre squares (660 by 660 feet) that remain at the base of all US land surveys to this day.</p>

<p><em>Background: Many years ago, I became curious as to why, exactly, there are 5280 feet in a mile. The explanations I found online at the time weren’t very convincing. At the time I tried to make some fixes to parts of the puzzle in Wikipedia, but they frequently rejected as OR (original research). Eventually I wrote this article, since revised and updated several times. Since then, my “version” of things will occasionally drift to the #1 spot on Google or Bing, or both, when answering the specific question “why are there 5280 feet in a mile”. More often some SEO-optimized version will slip ahead, though it seems this article is holding steady in the top 3 or 4 at least. So hopefully pretty much everybody who cares about the details will find this. If you have any comments or questions (or corrections), please add to the comment section, I do (eventually) read all comments.<br>
</em></p>
<p><em>I have yet to find an answer to the question that’s as thorough and complete as this one is. But I must caution that this article isn’t really up to academic standards and contains a non-trivial amount of speculation. Caveat Emptor, what follows is my theory of how the mile ended up with 5280 feet.</em></p>
<p>The conventional wisdom on this topic goes something like this: the mile was originally 5000 feet. It was changed to 5280 feet in Elizabethan times around the year 1600 (some point to 1592 and some to 1593) to accommodate the furlong, which was 660 feet. It was easier to fix the mile rather than the furlong for various reasons, hence, eight furlongs and 5280 feet in a mile.</p>
<p>That’s the standard story. It’ll be fleshed out with bells and whistles, including odd theories about horses etc, but that’s about it.</p>
<p>The problem with these versions is that they don’t explain why this collision between furlong and mile occurred around 1600, and not centuries before. It implies, therefore, that people suddenly woke up and realized, hey, wait a second, if there’s 660 feet in a furlong … and eight furlongs in a mile … but 5000 feet in a mile …. wait a second !?!</p>
<p>It somewhat implies that four-digit multiplication was invented ca 1600. Like a lot of rear-view-mirror takes on history, the “explanation” boils down to: “before time X people were stupid about topic Y, and at time Z they wizened up.”</p>
<p>Failing to find a good write-up of the origins, I’ve pieced together my own theory over the years. And it’s a fun one because the answer (or rather, hypothesis) is simply this: the number 5280 arises out of a collision between organized religion, the military, and taxation. Three powerful historical forces, to be sure, so the fourth pillar to modern society (rationality) obviously has to be the one to compromise!</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more: naked Greeks are involved, and Jesus, and Vikings. In that order.</p>
<p>Our story starts with the “original” mile, the Roman one (though there is indication the measurement is older still). The Romans were both practical and militant. Their mile was 1000 paces – a pace being a double step (left foot, right foot) by a soldier in full battle gear. That was a “<em>passus</em>“, and a mile was a “<em>milia passuum</em>“, hence the word “mile” (for “thousand”, as in the word <em>millennium)</em>.</p>
<p>If you are a runner or a hiker, you’ll know that we still remember this information in our convention of relating pedometers to miles: about 2000 steps to a mile. But we have forgotten that it’s not a “trick”, it’s the whole point. Language use changes back and forth over time, and today we’re more likely to use the word “step” rather than “pace”, hence, we can think of a mile as being defined as 2000 steps.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Romans had another convention, that you’ve probably heard of, which was to place stones next to their roads to mark the distance from Rome. Called “<em>milliarium</em>“, these stone obelisks were first erected along the Via Appia, where milestones dating as far back as the second century BC still survive. Naturally, quite a large number of these stones survived along roads throughout Europe, providing a natural reference point, explaining why their particular measure of a “foot” survives with high accuracy. The central stone in Rome, from which the phrase “all roads lead to Rome” derives, wasn’t erected until some two centuries later in 20 BC, but is since lost.</p>
<p>It’s worth injecting that the popular notion that Roman roads all had measures of the distance from Rome is a myth: only central Italy and a few exceptions were marked from central Rome, all other roads were measured from the nearest local significant center. The US’ attempt to replicate this myth with the Zero Mile marker in Washington, DC, in 1792 would have a similar destiny, influencing only measurements nearby. Instead a similar variation (measuring from something local and significant) lives on in the mile markers of the interstate highway system, where the numbering typically starts at either the southern or the western state line and increasing as you drive in the other direction.</p>
<p>Curiously, we know very little of the details of how the Roman army used the mile as a practical tool – not a single significant military treatise has survived from Roman times. The that has, the <em>Epitoma rei militaris,</em> is unfortunately not considered authoritative. Thus its claims cannot be checked against any other contemporary sources, which is particularly irksome since some of them appear highly dubious – such as stating that the army marched 20 miles in 5 summer hours at regular pace and 24 miles at double pace.</p>
<p>You can experiment yourself to realize that the miles per hour measure is practical for a human: casual walking is 2 mph, an easy walk is 3, swift walking is 4. The available number of hours in a day is similarly small, thus making the mental arithmetic simple.</p>
<p>Hence, 5000 feet to the mile, a general measure that survived throughout Europe as roadside reminders of the might of Rome.</p>
<p>Now, switching tracks, about the furlong. It means “a furrow long” (long as a furrow) and is a practical measure in an agrarian society: it is (approximately) the distance an oxen can plow without resting. That distance was standardized to be 40 “rods”, where a rod (or “pole”) is today defined as 5.5 yards (16.5 feet), though it was probably originally 20 feet (we’ll get back to all this).</p>
<p>An “acre” (which means “field”) was 40 rods long and 4 rods wide (4 rods was also called a “chain”, more on that below). An acre was thus the surface area that one man and a team of oxen could till in one day. It was long and narrow because of the development of the heavy plough around the end of the 10th century, which turned the soil over, revolutionizing agriculture in northern Europe where the clay-heavy soil (vs sandier south European soil) went from being a handicap to an asset, in fact contributing significantly to the eventual inversion of economic power in Europe from the south to the north.</p>
<p>At this point, if you’re paying close attention, you’ll see that not only do we have the decimal (base 10) concept in the “mile” (one thousand paces), but also in the acre: the proportions of the sides are exactly 10:1. That’s because “acre” dates back to “10 square chains”, or an area that’s one “chain” wide and ten long. A “chain” in turn is four rods. The word “chain” comes from how this convenient measurement tool was constructed. Organic materials (wood, rope) have obvious problems in retaining precise dimensions, despite efforts to wax or otherwise treat them. A marked improvement therefore came from carrying a set of thin metal rods, that eventually would be “chained” together. Most surveying in the United States was done in the 1700s and 1800s using a standardized 100-link chain of 66 feet in total length.</p>
<p>But this was a more modern innovation. Going much further back in history it seems likely the basic approach was instead to carry a long, thin, metal “rod” that was 16 feet long, seems likely to me that they were in parts. This is still today a common surveying tool – search Amazon for “surveyor rod” and you’ll find the modern version, now made of telescoping aluminum and generally 16 feet long. We’ll get back to why it was 16 feet (and not 10 or 20), and how it later on became 16.5.</p>
<p>This tradition of the furlong (ten chains) took root in England between the fall of Rome and the Norman conquest of 1066, along the aforementioned adoption of heavy ploughs. With the Normans came the re-introduction of the Roman definition of the foot as 12 inches. A reference foot was thusly carved into one of the pier bases of the new nave in St Paul’s cathedral in London in 1104 (by the son of a banker, interestingly enough).</p>
<p>The Saxon tradition of measuring land had been established in terms of rods, and as we alluded above, probably based on 20 “natural” feet – i.e. not Roman standard feet but “real” 9.8-inch feet. The number 20, of course, was the common “decimal” system prior to the invention of shoes (at which point you can’t see your toes). Also, the technique of counting to 20 with one hand may have been prevalent. Vestiges of base-20 remain, notably for our story, in Danish and French. For example, in French you say “soixante-dix” for 70 and in Danish you say …</p></div></div>

<p>Zero To Production focuses on the challenges of <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-05-24-zero-to-production-0-foreword/">writing Cloud-native applications with Rust</a>.<br>
Zero To Production is built around the idea of <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-06-21-zero-to-production-2-learn-by-building-an-email-newsletter/">problem-based learning</a>: choose a problem you want to solve, let the problem drive the introduction of new concepts and techniques.<br>
Our problem is <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-06-21-zero-to-production-2-learn-by-building-an-email-newsletter/"><em>building an email newsletter</em></a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the first part of <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-08-09-zero-to-production-3-how-to-bootstrap-a-new-rust-web-api-from-scratch/">Chapter 3</a> we covered a fair amount of ground - we set out to implement a <code>/health_check</code> endpoint and that gave us the opportunity to learn more about the fundamentals of our web framework, <a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/"><code>actix-web</code></a>, as well as the basics of (integration) testing for Rust APIs.</p>

<p>It is now time to capitalise on what we learned to finally fulfill the <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-06-21-zero-to-production-2-learn-by-building-an-email-newsletter/">first user story of our email newsletter project</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a blog visitor,<br>
I want to subscribe to the newsletter,<br>
So that I can receive email updates when new content is published on the blog.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We expect our blog visitors to input their email address in a form embedded on a web page.<br>
The form will trigger a <code>POST</code> <code>/subscribtions</code> call to our backend API that will actually process the information, store it and send back a response.</p>

<p>We will have to dig into:</p>

<ul>
<li>how to read data collected in a HTML form in <code>actix-web</code> (i.e. how do I parse the request body of a <code>POST</code>?);<br></li>
<li>what libraries are available to work with a PostgreSQL database in Rust (<code>diesel</code> vs <code>sqlx</code> vs <code>tokio-postgres</code>);<br></li>
<li>how to setup and manage migrations for our database;<br></li>
<li>how to get our hands on a database connection in our API request handlers;<br></li>
<li>how to test for side-effects (a.k.a. stored data) in our integration tests;<br></li>
<li>how to avoid weird interactions between tests when working with a database.</li>
</ul>

<p>If all goes well, we should be able to demo the subscription page at the end of the article.<br>
Let’s get started!</p>

<h2 id="2-1-refining-our-requirements">2.1. Refining Our Requirements</h2>

<p>What information should we collect from a visitor in order to enroll them as a subscriber of our email newsletter?</p>

<p>Well, we certainly need their email addresses (it is an <em>email</em> newsletter after all).<br>
What else?</p>

<p>This would usually spark a conversation among the engineers on the team as well as the product manager in your typical business setup. In this case, we are both the technical leads and the product owners so we get to call the shots!</p>

<p>Speaking from personal experience, people generally use throwaway or masked emails when subscribing to newsletters (or, at least, most of you did when <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/subscribe/">subscribing to Zero To Production</a>!).<br>
It would thus be nice to collect a <code>name</code> that we could use for our email greetings (the infamous <code>Hey {{subscriber.name}}!</code>) as well as to spot mutuals or people we know in the list of subscribers.<br>
We are not cops, we have no interest in the <code>name</code> field being <em>authentic</em> - we will let people input whatever they feel like using as their identifier in our newsletter system: <a href="https://xkcd.com/979/"><code>DenverCoder9</code></a>, we welcome you.</p>

<p>It is settled then: we want an email address and a name for all new subscribers.</p>

<p>Given that the data is collected via a HTML form, it will be passed to our backend API in the body of a <code>POST</code> request. How is the body going to be encoded?<br>
There are a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST">few options available</a> when using HTML forms: <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> is the most suitable to our usecase.<br>
Quoting MDN web docs, with <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code></p>

<blockquote>
<p>the keys and values [in our form] are encoded in key-value tuples separated by ‘&amp;‘, with a ‘=’ between the key and the value. Non-alphanumeric characters in both keys and values are percent encoded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example: if the name is <code>Le Guin</code> and the email is <code>ursula_le_guin@gmail.com</code> the <code>POST</code> request body should be <code>name=le%20guin&amp;email=ursula_le_guin%40gmail.com</code> (spaces are replaced by <code>%20</code> while <code>@</code> becomes <code>%40</code> - a reference conversion table can be found <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.ASP">here</a>).</p>

<p>To summarise:</p>

<ul>
<li>if a valid pair of name and email is supplied using the <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> format the backend should return a <code>200 OK</code>;<br></li>
<li>if either name or email are missing the backend should return a <code>400 BAD REQUEST</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-2-capturing-our-requirements-as-tests">2.2. Capturing Our Requirements As Tests</h2>

<p>Now that we understand better what needs to happen, let’s encode our expectations in a couple of integration tests.</p>

<p>Let’s add the new tests to the existing <a href="https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/zero-to-production/blob/master/chapter03-0/tests/health_check.rs"><code>tests/health_check.rs</code> file</a> - we will re-organise our test suite folder structure afterwards.</p>

<p><code>subscribe_returns_a_400_when_data_is_missing</code> is an example of <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/TableDrivenTests"><em>table-driven test</em></a> also known as <em>parametrised test</em>.<br>
It is particularly helpful when dealing with bad inputs - instead of duplicating test logic several times we can simply run the same assertion against a collection of known invalid bodies that we expect to fail in the same way.<br>
With parametrised tests it is important to have good error messages on failures: <code>assertion failed on line XYZ</code> is not great if you cannot tell which specific input is broken! On the flip side, that parametrised test is covering a lot of ground so it makes sense to invest a bit more time in generating a nice failure message.<br>
Test frameworks in other languages sometimes have native support for this testing style (e.g. <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/parametrize.html">parametrised tests in <code>pytest</code></a> or <a href="https://andrewlock.net/creating-parameterised-tests-in-xunit-with-inlinedata-classdata-and-memberdata/"><code>InlineData</code> in xUnit for C#</a>) - there are a few crates in the Rust ecosystem that extend the basic test framework with similar features, but unfortunately they do not interop very well with the <code>#[actix_rt::test]</code> macro that we need to write asynchronous tests idiomatically (see <a href="https://github.com/la10736/rstest/issues/85"><code>rstest</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/frondeus/test-case/issues/36"><code>test-case</code></a>).</p>

<p>As expected, all our new tests are failing.<br>
You can immediately spot a limitation of “roll-your-own” parametrised tests: as soon as one test case fails, the execution stops and we do not know the outcome for the following tests cases.</p>

<p>Let’s get started on the implementation.</p>

<h2 id="2-3-parsing-form-data-from-a-post-request">2.3. Parsing Form Data From A <code>POST</code> Request</h2>

<p>All tests are failing because the application returns a <code>404 NOT FOUND</code> for <code>POST</code> requests hitting <code>/subscriptions</code>. Legitimate behaviour: we do not have a handler registered for that path.<br>
Let’s fix it by adding a matching route to our <code>App</code> in <code>src/lib.rs</code>:</p>

<h2>Begin With: Why Do You Need To Build Software?</h2>



<p>There are a many reasons why an organization needs to build and deliver software. Some examples might be:</p>



<ul><li>Grow integrated strategic partnerships</li><li>Improve internal proprietary processes</li><li>Quality assurance and business intelligence</li><li>Build products and tools that customers will use directly</li></ul>



<p>Taking the time to understand the “why” can help you determine how to structure a delivery team and establish long term plans. In many cases an organization may find it has multiple answers to the “why” and this could be a good indicator that a team for each might be a good idea.</p>



<h2>Create Aligned Work Streams vs Functional Groups</h2>



<p><br>Before we can dive into the 4 components that make a delivery team successful, we need to address team structure. For years many organizations structured software development teams by the “how” instead of “why”.&nbsp; For example –&nbsp; QA experts and engineers were divided into groups. I’m sure some of the thought process was to build competency within an organization. Unless you are offering those services directly to customers – your goals shouldn’t be building a stellar “QA” or “Engineering” team. You want a high performing “delivery” teams that just happen to be composed of individuals in these roles. Consider objective first, software creation second. Think diversity of perspectives – putting people with different skill-sets and roles together for a common goal will cultivate continuous improvement.</p>



<h2>The 4 Components</h2>



<p>I’m going to attempt to describe each component and then give examples of ways a team can implement each one. Understand that every organization and workstream may be different – so not all may apply.</p>



<h2><br>Build</h2>



<div><p>Build is traditionally measured by how well your organization can produce technology that can scale, can be maintained cost effectively, and functions consistently.&nbsp; In addition to these considerations I would also include flexibility. A build team that understands how to work iteratively – applying the correct level of technology &amp; effort to deliver what is necessary is key.&nbsp;The ability to produce quality software in a predictable way is the result of multiple aligned efforts.</p><p><strong>Application Portfolio Management &amp; Support:</strong>&nbsp; In order to continue building you have to consider what has been built already. One mistake many organizations make is creating dedicated support teams that are not aligned with a work stream. The result is a disenfranchised team and a pile of technology that eats up resources. A team that doesn’t manage its portfolio will also run into serious tech debt issues – ultimately impacting its ability to deliver. <em>Further Reading: </em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://spaces.at.internet2.edu/display/itana/TIME+Models" target="_blank">&nbsp;(TIME) Tolerate | Invest | Maintain | Eliminate</a></p></div>



<p><strong>DevOps:</strong> In my mind the greatest contributor to effective delivery is the ability to ship code safely and effortlessly. Thinking back to days when I had to deal with 45 minute builds, complex manual deployment processes, and terrifying testing procedures – this is an easy one in my book. I also believe this is an enabler for organizations with on-prem technology that want to get to the cloud. <em>Further Reading: </em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2019.pdf" target="_blank">State Of DevOps (Google)</a></p>



<p><strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> This requires a role that specializes in regression and user acceptance testing. Some of this can also be automated but nothing replaces an individual with domain knowledge that can find bugs. The level of QA necessary for a work stream is dependent on the level of acceptable risk. Ex – financial or healthcare processing will need more QA that a startup still looking for product market fit. <em>Further Reading: </em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing_tactics" target="_blank">Software Testing Tactics</a></p>



<p><strong>Software Development: </strong>An obvious component of build – a good development team is critical to executing.&nbsp; Software craftsmanship concepts such as TDD and SOLID are game changers when attempting to deliver high quality software quickly.&nbsp; <em>Further Reading:</em> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID" target="_blank">SOLID</a><strong> | </strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank">TDD</a></p>



<h2>Learn</h2>



<p>You must inform your build effort, otherwise you will produce technology that is of little value (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://7samurai.dev/2020/08/24/how-to-deliver-meaningful-software/" data-type="post" data-id="20" target="_blank">meaningless</a>). You do this by growing the collective knowledge of the team. It’s important to understand that one person or one role isn’t solely responsible for this on well functioning teams. Every member should have the freedom to contribute. <strong><p>User Experience Research:</p></strong> This role is an absolute must for product focused work streams.&nbsp; Creation of user personas, qualitative &amp; quantitative research, and structured user interviews are all important if an organization wishes to build products that provide real value. This role also places a high emphasis on creating value by understanding the behaviors and needs of users. <em>Further Reading:</em> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.allaboutux.org/ux-definitions" target="_blank">User Experience Definitions&nbsp;</a></p>



<p><strong>Business Analysis:</strong> While UX focuses on users, BA roles tend to focus on business and process.&nbsp; The type of work stream again determines the importance of this role on the team. Business analysts also tend to retain and build domain knowledge. This can be critical as well if your work stream is heavy on complex business processes. Practices such as process mapping and requirements gathering are extremely valuable when dealing with complex workflows and business needs. <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/27641/five-whys-technique.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5 Whys </a><strong>&nbsp;| </strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MoSCoW</a></p>



<p><br><strong>Technical Analysis &amp; Design:</strong> Commonly misunderstood or ignored this role is a must have on teams that maintain and enhance large systems or a large number of applications. Sometimes domain knowledge lives within code and the only way to re-discover requires a deep dive into the code.&nbsp; In most cases this needs to be an experienced developer who can translate code into requirements (or at minimum technical specifications). Some organizations attempt to avoid this by producing large volumes of documentation – in many cases it’s not a viable solution.&nbsp; <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/not-everything-needs-to-be-a-user-story-using-fdd-features" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Using FDD Features</a></p>



<h2>Promote</h2>



<p>Once you build something you need to ensure that its value is understood by stakeholders and users. I consider this effort one of the 4 pillars because without it you don’t receive feedback or traction. Unused software is meaningless software – even if it “could” offer value. There is strong overlap in this area with general sales and marketing but this is outside the scope of “software delivery”.</p>



<div><p><strong>Demos</strong>: One way you can promote internally is via “Demo Days”. Showing new functionality to stakeholders and team members creates conversations which generates internal feedback loops. This ensures that everyone understands the value. Also, this also offers an opportunity to team members who wish to build communication and speaking skills. <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="https://dev.acquia.com/blog/how-to-give-a-great-agilescrum-sprint-demo/09/08/2018/19771" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Give a Great Agile/Scrum Sprint Demo</a></p><p><strong>Roadmaps</strong>:&nbsp; Communicating the direction of the team to the organization is important. Hopefully it can provide a source of excitement and inspiration for the entire organization. A well communicated roadmap in conjunction with a good company culture should result in aligned efforts and a shared vision.&nbsp; <em>Further Reading:</em>&nbsp; <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HReut5aIndOczY3sD6JQhowRIrmp44RcvjnT28mzfBM/edit#slide=id.g23c0d64254_0_16" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department Of Product: Roadmaps</a><br><strong><br>Customer Experience</strong>: Ensuring that customers can easily understand and utilize features the team has created – in conjunction with the offering as a whole ensures that engagement can scale as the product becomes more complex (and/or integrated).&nbsp; I consider this “promotion” because creating a good customer experience is a form of promoting the underlying value provided by the platform.&nbsp; <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-vs-cx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">User Experience vs. Customer Experience</a></p></div>



<h2>Core</h2>



<p>Now we get to the really fun part. Putting it all together. While the other 3 components can vary based on organizational structure and work stream needs – these items are non-negotiable if you wish to successfully deliver meaningful software.</p>



<p><strong>Ownership:&nbsp;</strong> Without strategic direction a team is very likely to focus on small items that don’t line up with larger objectives (although I do think it’s possible for teams to become aligned – a topic for another time). Decision makers need to be responsible for collecting information from all 3 components, weave in considerations from leadership, and set a course. Among the many decisions to be made lies the most critical – platform and feature prioritization.&nbsp; <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="http://agilemodeling.com/essays/productOwner.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Stakeholder Proxy for Agile Teams</a></p>



<p><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong>&nbsp; A team that wants to deliver meaningful software must strive to be better on both a team and individual level. The only way this works however is if the team defines and measures continuous improvement goals on its own. An autonomous team that has the freedom to test (and fail) in an effort to improve will produce consistently better results long term. <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="https://retromat.org/en/?id=43-133-10-73-60" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RetroMat</a></p>



<p><strong>Work Agreements:</strong> Informed by continuous improvement, this can include work visualization, code quality practices, ceremonies, definition of done, and other “contracts” among team members. The importance of mutually agreed upon expectations is it removes frustration from the day to day. A good example of this is user stories. A great format for collecting requirements and managing the work – but the real value is its ability to transfer knowledge among multiple team members and roles in a well understood format. Add the ability to visualize priority and progress and the team finds itself aligned. Also keep in mind, while the agreements may be rigid in  definition your continuous improvement efforts should allow for them to change easily when necessary. <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="https://tech.gsa.gov/guides/Agile_Meetings_Goals_and_Benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Agile Meetings – Goals and Benefits </a>| <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/kanban-vs-scrum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanban vs. Scrum</a></p>

<p>Below is a look at the past 30+ years of San Francisco Bay Area real estate boom and bust cycles. Financial-market cycles have been around for hundreds of years, all the way back to the Dutch tulip mania of the 1600’s. While future cycles will vary in their details, the causes, effects and trend lines are often quite similar. Looking at cycles gives us more context to how the market works over time and where it may be going — much more than dwelling in the immediacy of the present with excitable pronouncements of “The market’s crashing and won’t recover in our lifetimes!” or “The market’s crazy hot and the only place it can go is up!”</p>
<p>Note: Most of these charts generally apply to higher-priced Bay Area housing markets, such as those found in much of San Francisco, Marin, Central Contra Costa (Lamorinda &amp; Diablo Valley) and San Mateo Counties. (Different market price segments had bubbles, crashes – or adjustments – and recoveries of differing magnitudes in the last cycle, which is addressed at the end of this report.)</p>
<p><u>Regardless of how recent cycles have played out, it is vital to understand how extremely difficult it is to predict, with any accuracy, when different parts of a cycle will begin or end.</u>&nbsp;Boom times can go on much longer than expected, or get second winds; recessions or crashes can appear with startling suddenness. It should also be noted that all of the major down cycles in the Bay Area in recent decades have been tied to national or international economic factors, i.e. our cycles aren’t simply local events, separated from the rest of the state or country. However, it is true that local factors sometime exacerbate a downturn (the earthquake of 1989; our greater exposure to the dotcom bubble), or supercharge a recovery (the Bay Area high-tech boom of recent years).</p>

Whatever the phase of the cycle, up or down, while it is going on people think it will last forever. Going up, it’s never going to stop! And then every time the market goes down, the consensus becomes that real estate will not recover for decades (or even “in our lifetimes”). But the economy mends, the population grows, people start families, inflation builds up over the years, and repressed demand of those who want to own their own homes builds up. In the early eighties, mid-nineties and in 2012, after about 4 years of a recessionary housing market, this repressed demand jumped back in (or “explodes” might be a good description) and prices started to rise again. (The dotcom bubble adjustment caused no lasting recession in home values.)</p>
<p>It’s not unusual for a big surge in values to occur in the first couple of years after a recovery begins, often quickly exceeding the previous peak value.</p>
<p>All bubbles are ultimately based on irrational exuberance and/or criminal behavior, whether exemplified by junk bonds, Savings &amp; Loan frauds, dotcom stock hysteria, “Dow 30,000” insanity, “the end of the business cycle” nonsense, gorging on unsustainable debt, runaway greed (without any corresponding desire to produce anything of value), predatory lending, or dishonest financial engineering.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that the most recent subprime-financing/ loan-fraud bubble was truly abnormal in its scale, and its crash was much greater than other “market adjustments” going back many decades. The pre-2008 bubble was fueled by tens of millions of buyers purchasing (or owners refinancing) homes with loans that they clearly&nbsp;<em>couldn’t afford</em>&nbsp;right from the get go: Liar loans, deceptive teaser rates, promises of non-stop appreciation, and the abysmal decline in underwriting standards. (Since lenders were simply selling the loans, they didn’t care about qualifying buyers anymore.) Sometimes there was no actual investment in the properties being bought, i.e. no down payment, 100%+ loans. Many lenders and mortgage brokers clearly engaged in criminally predatory behavior, convincing people to overload themselves with unsustainable, impossible-to-pay-back levels of debt. (Sadly, something similar has been going on in recent years with college loans.)</p>
<p>The market adjustments of the early 1990’s and that subsequent to the dotcom bubble saw declines in home values in the range of 10% to 11%, which is of a&nbsp;<em>completely different scale</em>&nbsp;from the recent 2008 – 2011 crash and decline, when values plunged by up to 60% around the state and country, depending on area and price segment. The previous crash of a similar magnitude was during the Great Depression of the 1930’s.</p>
<p><u>This is important context when contemplating the next adjustment</u>: It doesn’t have to be a devastating crash. It can be more like some air being let out of an over-pressurized tire instead of a blowout on the highway at high speed. As of early-2017, it appears that the SF economy and housing market have cooled to some degree after 4 years of feverish appreciation. But the change varies by segment: The affordable house segment remains quite hot; more expensive house prices have generally plateaued; the condo market has cooled much more and seen price declines, and the luxury condo market has cooled the most. The condo market has been affected by the surge of new-construction condos hitting the market recently. We will have to wait and see the scale and speed of any further adjustment, but so far, we don’t see local or macro-economic conditions for a 2008-like crash. Adjustment, yes; devastating crash, no.

<center><strong><u>This Recovery vs. Previous Recoveries</u></strong></center><center></center><p><img src="https://www.janepoppelreiterrealestate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/30-years-of-san-francisco-bay-area-real-estate-cycles-1.jpg" alt="" width="835" height="625" srcset="https://www.janepoppelreiterrealestate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/30-years-of-san-francisco-bay-area-real-estate-cycles-1.jpg 835w, http://paragon.intersectmg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2-300x225.jpg 300w, http://paragon.intersectmg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2-768x575.jpg 768w, http://paragon.intersectmg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2-401x300.jpg 401w" sizes="(max-width: 835px) 100vw, 835px"></p>
<p>The light blue columns in the above chart graph the home-value appreciation that occurred in the&nbsp;<u>first three years</u>&nbsp;of each recovery – our latest rebound has been somewhat quicker than other recoveries, probably due to 1) the depth of the previous market decline, and 2) the huge, high-tech employment, population and wealth boom that has played out in San Francisco and nearby counties. The gray columns chart the appreciation of past recoveries from the beginning to&nbsp;<em>peak value</em>&nbsp;for each cycle (except for the latest cycle, for which the peak has not yet been defined), and the red bars delineate the percentage declines from those peaks, pursuant to the market adjustments that occurred. As always, note that market appreciation and depreciation rates can vary widely by county, community and neighborhood.</p>
<p>Over the past 30+ years, the period between a recovery beginning and a bubble popping (or a lesser adjustment occurring) has run 5 to 7 years. We are currently about 5 years into the current recovery, which started in early 2012 (in San Francisco; later in outlying Bay Area counties). Periods of market recession/doldrums following the popping of a bubble have typically lasted about 3-4 years. (The 2001 dotcom bubble/ 9-11 crisis drop being the exception.) Generally speaking, within about 2-3 years of a new recovery commencing, previous peak values (i.e. those at the height of the previous bubble) are re-attained — among other reasons, there is the recapture of inflation during the doldrums years. In this current recovery, those homes hit hardest by the subprime loan crisis — typically housing at the lowest end of the price scale in the less affluent neighborhoods, which experienced by far the biggest bubble and biggest crash — are appreciating quickly now, but taking longer to re-attain peak values. However, communities with higher priced homes — such as in San Francisco, Marin, San Mateo and Central Contra Costa Counties (Diablo Valley &amp; Lamorinda) — have surged well past their previous peaks.</p>
<p>This does not mean that these recently recurring time periods necessarily reflect some natural law in housing market cycles, or that they can be relied upon to predict the future. Real estate markets can be affected by a bewildering number of local, national and international economic, political and even natural-event factors that are exceedingly difficult or even impossible to predict with any accuracy.</p>
<p>In the 2 charts below tracking the S&amp;P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for the 5-County San Francisco Metro Area, the data points refer to home values as a percentage of those in January 2000. January 2000 equals 100 on the trend line: 66 means prices were 66% of those in January 2000; 175 signifies prices 75% higher.</p>
