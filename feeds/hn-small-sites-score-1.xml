<p>One of my little pet projects is a neurology book for psychologists, coaches and the like. What most people in these fields imagine about the brain is somewhere between perplexing, preposterous and potentially poisonous. (Seriously, I could tell you stories…) So I kind of wanted to write something like this for them.</p>
<p>Now I do consider it a tall order for me – I have some knowledge of neurology, but actually writing a SENSIBLE, understandable guidebook to neurology, with some practical applications too, that’s a challenge. (Senseless guidebooks to neurology are a dime a dozen, of course. In fact, I’ve walled in at least two people in one library, using only senseless pop-neurology books and as far I can tell, the rotting skeletons still haven’t been found. But then again the rotting corpse smell really doesn’t stand out much in most libraries I’ve been to, so I shouldn’t be surprised.)</p>
<p><a href="http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920.jpg"><img src="http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920.jpg 1920w, http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920-768x512.jpg 768w, http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920-1080x720.jpg 1080w, http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920-610x407.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a></p>
<p>But back to my main point. The great thing about trying to write a book like that, even attempting to prepare for doing it at one point in the future, when you know enough, is finding all the lovely little holes in how you’re telling the story to yourself. The teeny-tiny little jumps in understanding, the „lies-to-children”, the simplifications.</p>

<p>And one of these, for me, was how neurons get to connect.</p>

<p>And when I asked around, it turned out I wasn’t the only one missing this little bit.</p>

<p>I mean, yeah, we all know Hebb. „Neurons that fire together, wire together”, the neurology mantra in flesh. I can just imagine NeuroZen masters, walking around meditating neurologists, „fiiiiiiiiireeee toooooogeeeether” instead of „ommmm” going around.</p>

<p>That’s how neurons connect. When two fire at once, their connection becomes stronger. The synapse gains long term potentiation/LTP, by both an increase in the neurotransmitters produced, and an increase in the postsynaptic receptors for the neurotransmitters. Short-term it happens through utilizing some of the additional AMPA receptors available near to the synaptic membrane in the postsynaptic cell, long term by changes in protein synthesis and gene expression, in order to ensure a larger number of receptors. So far so good, in one way or another pretty much anyone who understands anything about neurology understands this bit. It might be more or less simplistic, you might have the AMPA receptors memorized or not, but you get the gist of it.&nbsp;(Although this begs the question: does Dale’s principle means that the increase in presynaptic neurotransmitter production influence not just this single synapse, but also the concentration of neurotransmitters in all synaptic connections of the presynaptic neuron? Or perhaps does a reverse mechanism happen, with other connections of the presynaptic neuron being stripped bare of their neurotransmitters? Something I need to check! )</p>

<p>Now here’s the kicker: how do neurons that AREN’T already connected connect? How does their “fire/wire” rule go?</p>

<p>I mean, that still applies, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>Actually, it doesn’t apply in the original Hebb’s law, since that required the neurons to be connected already and a couple of other things as well. But still, the general principle is how we tend to explain things like associative learning, conditioning, etc. The direct wording of Hebb’s law can’t apply there, because then we’d need every neural network to be connected to every other neural network at once, and that’d be a mess that wouldn’t really work all that well. But the general principle seems to apply.</p>

<p>And when I started asking around, no one could tell me how exactly.</p>

<p>How does a neuron know to extend new axonal or dendric connections towards another neuron, so that they might actually form a synapse between the two? Because this has to happen somehow, and this has to happen in a fairly structured way. If it didn’t happen, if we were only left to the remains of the synaptic pruning we got since birth, then our neural networks would become pretty much immovable after were what, twelve? I mean yeah, I’ve met these people, and so have you, but they’re in the small minority… well, large minority… well, OK, a small majority. But even so, there are quite a few people who aren’t that way. And if the neural growth was haphazard, then we’d get a far more random jumble of associations, then the fairly clean ones we tend to get in any conditioning/associative learning experiences.</p>

<p>So I knew there must be some kind of system for neurons to detect other neurons it should be „aiming for” in their development.</p>

<p>And – this was about two or three years ago as of writing this – no one I asked could tell me what it was. I’ve reached out to a lot of people I’ve considered very competent in the field, including some of my old Uni professors, and no one could direct me. Nor could I find the answer in any of the textbooks I’ve referred to.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the answer is fairly recent, as articles about it only started to appear in the 2000s. Since it took me some time to find it back then, I figured I’d make this article to share it now, making the whole thing easier to find for others.</p>

<p>We’ve known from about 1890 that the endings of both the axon and the dendrites are covered in something known as a growth cone. Like the tip of the branch, this is the part where the cell can further develop and extend, either in original growth, in regeneration, or as a reaction to some factors (including a decrease in overall electric activity which causes a form of synaptic scaling – hence explaining the „devouring” of unused neural pathways of amputated body parts by nearby active structures). But how do the growth cones know how exactly to grow? The brain is a complex three-dimensional web of interconnected neurons, so „hitting” the right point is definitely too hard if the neurons just kept on growing until they hit anything at all.</p>

<p>Now, the synaptic scaling process is still a piece of the answer – even if a neuron forms a new synaptic connection with a different neuron, if the target neuron already has too many connections, it will tend to remove the weakest ones, and this includes the most recent ones. The scaling goes both ways after all – it goes for more synapses when it starts with too few, but for less, if it starts with too many.</p>

<p>But synaptic scaling is not everything. As it turns out, the tips of the growth cone constantly produce structures called filopodia, and these react to specific chemical attractants and repellents. These chemicals are produced by both cells at the target area, and by so-called guidepost cells along the way. There are suggestions that the system for such targeting is fairly robust, especially in early development (and its limitations in later life might explain why spinal cord injuries and the like are so hard to fix).</p>

<p>(There is one other process for directing cells, the growth along the radial glia, but since it mainly refers to embryonic development, it’s really not all that interesting for us in this topic.)</p>

<p>Now, the more perceptive of you will already have noticed that while what I’ve given is AN answer, it is not THE answer to the question I’ve originally asked. Or at least, not necessarily.</p>

<p>It might be possible, that the interaction of the three systems:<br>– a pre-set network of attractor/repellent chemical pathways for guiding axon/dendrite growth,<br>– the synaptic scaling mechanism of homeostatic plasticity, which limits the max connections and promotes new connections if existing neural excitability falls below what is the baseline for the network,<br>– and the good old Hebbian mechanism for strengthening existing neural connections,<br>is in fact enough. That the interplay of these systems does answer our basic question, and simple enough rules result in sufficient flexibility to explain what is observed.</p>

<p>But, obviously, the process might be a bit more complicated. There isn’t that much literature about it, unfortunately, so what I’m doing here is more of an (un)educated guess, but since guidepost cells tend to be neurons which have yet to develop an axon – but already have dendrites and can receive signals, a slightly more complex – but better targeted – system can be imagined, where guidepost cells would be a part of a wider neural network, the stimulation of which „calls forth” further cells to build connections. This, in my understanding (Again, limited, so don’t take my word for it. I mean it.) would be a more effective explanation of how we can rapidly learn to connect fairly new information, even across huge (neurologically-scaled) swaths of neural space. A strongly agitated system produces a stronger „call for connections”, hence mediating the faster development of new and broader associations.</p>

<p>So there you have it, a quick summary of one part of neural connectivity I’ve yet to see described in a textbook about the brain, but which really should be given out there, along with the classic Hebbian principle. Hope it’s useful 🙂</p>

<p>Two years ago, on June 4th of 2018, Microsoft announced its acquisition of GitHub, unicorn darling of the developer tools startup ecosystem, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-has-acquired-github-for-7-5b-in-microsoft-stock/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">for $7.5B in stock</a>. The announcement unearthed a wide range of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17221527" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">opinions and pontifications</a>, ranging from “GitHub is doomed” to “Microsoft is smart”, with many predictions about GitHub’s future. Some thought Microsoft’s growing investments in its cloud offering, Azure, might help GitHub. Could an investment by Microsoft improve GitHub’s reliability or harden them against outages like <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/github-ddos-memcached/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DDOSes</a>? Have any of these predictions come true?</p>



<p>We set out to analyze one angle of the GitHub acquisition: Has GitHub become more reliable since its acquisition by Microsoft? Our service, <a href="https://statusgator.com/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">StatusGator</a>, monitors more than 700 status pages of cloud providers and SaaS companies large and small. We aggregate and normalize status page data and make it available to our subscribers however they need: in notifications by email, Slack, Teams, or webhook, and in a <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2020/01/24/how-to-save-precious-minutes-during-incident-response/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">unified status dashboard</a> for all service dependencies.</p>

<p>For more than 5 years, we have analyzed the <a href="https://www.githubstatus.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GitHub status page</a> constantly. Every 5 minutes, StatusGator takes a screenshot and <a href="https://statusgator.com/services/github" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">collects relevant data</a> about their service status. That means we are uniquely positioned to offer analysis of the downtime that GitHub themselves announce via their status page.</p>



<p>What does the data tell us? In the two years since the acquisition announcement, GitHub has reported a 41% increase in status page incidents. Furthermore, there has been a 97% increase in incident minutes, compared to the two years prior to the announcement. Does this actually point to a decrease in reliability? We can’t say. This could simply mean GitHub has increased its transparency, publishing to their status page more frequently.</p>



<h2>Incident Counts</h2>



<p>We calculated an incident count in the 24 months preceding the announcement and the 24 months after. We <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2019/12/26/under-the-hood-inside-a-status-page-aggregator/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">classify status pages</a> into four states: <em>up</em>, <em>warn</em>, and <em>down</em>, and <em>maintenance</em>. GitHub does not expose scheduled maintenance on their status page. For these calculations we consider an incident to be any change in status between <em>up</em> and <em>warn</em> or <em>down</em>.</p>



<p>Before the acquisition, there were 89 incidents published on the GitHub status page. After, there were 126 incidents. A 41% increase:</p>

<p>In the graph below, we’ve charted the incident counts by month. The left side shows the 24 months before and the right side shows the 24 months after:</p>



<figure><img src="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-1024x533.png" alt="Graph showing GitHub incidents by month, before and after their acquisition by Microsoft." srcset="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-1024x533.png 1024w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-300x156.png 300w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-768x400.png 768w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-1536x799.png 1536w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-720x375.png 720w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-580x302.png 580w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-320x167.png 320w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<h2>Incident Minutes</h2>



<p>We calculated incident minutes by subtracting the start and end time of time of incidents. Although not 100% realtime, StatusGator checks frequently: every 5 minutes, so status page changes are detected quickly. We counted time where the page was not in an overall <em>up</em> state.</p>



<p>In the 24 months prior to the acquisition announcement, there were 6,110 minutes of downtime. During the 24 months after, there were 12,074 minutes of downtime, a 97% increase:</p>

<h2>Status Page Evolution</h2>



<p>During these four years, GitHub has made enormous improvements in their status page information granularity and design. In December 2018, they switched from a home grown status page to one operated by Atlassian’s StatusPage service, <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2019/03/11/2019-statusgator-status-page-awards/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">the most popular status page provider</a>. In doing so, they added numerous <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2019/11/22/component-status-filtering-is-here/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">individual component statuses</a>. Here’s what GitHub’s status page looked like before their switch to Atlassian StatusPage:</p>

<figure><img src="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-status-page-old.png" alt="GitHub status page showing only a single status across all GitHub services." srcset="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-status-page-old.png 645w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-status-page-old-300x187.png 300w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-status-page-old-580x361.png 580w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-status-page-old-320x199.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px"><figcaption>GitHub status page showing only a single status across all GitHub services.</figcaption></figure>



<p>When they switched to their new status page format, GitHub took a huge step towards increased accountability and transparency by detailing the following individual service components:</p>



<ul><li>Git Operations</li><li>API Requests</li><li>Issues, PRs, Dashboard, Projects</li><li>Notifications</li><li>Gists</li><li>GitHub Pages</li></ul>



<p>Overtime, they have expanded and refined their component statuses. They also started showing historical data right on their status page. As you can see in their newest and most detailed status page format, it shows the following service component statuses:</p>



<ul><li>Git Operations</li><li>API Requests</li><li>Webhooks</li><li>Issues, PRs, Projects</li><li>GitHub Actions</li><li>GitHub Packages</li><li>GitHub Pages</li></ul>



<h3>GitHub’s New Status Page</h3>



<figure><img src="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-944x1024.png" alt="GitHub status page showing detailed statuses of each of the major components of their service." srcset="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-944x1024.png 944w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-277x300.png 277w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-768x833.png 768w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-720x781.png 720w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-580x629.png 580w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-320x347.png 320w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 944px) 100vw, 944px"><figcaption>GitHub status page showing detailed statuses of each of the major components of their service.</figcaption></figure>



<p>They also moved their status page to a dedicated domain, <a href="https://www.githubstatus.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">githubstatus.com</a>, <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2020/04/21/your-status-page-deserves-its-own-domain/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">which follows a best practice we recommend</a> to anyone who hosts a status page. All of this additional transparency, details, and historical data is a commendable effort to relay the most up-to-date information about the status of all GitHub systems. More providers of critical cloud infrastructure should emulate what GitHub has done. <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2019/12/07/your-status-page-is-useless-if-you-dont-use-it/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">Your status page is useless if you don’t use it.</a></p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>What can we conclude from all of this data? Objectively, we can conclude that GitHub has published to their status page more frequently in the two years after their acquisition announcement. They have posted more incidents of disruption and downtime. Those incidents have been longer in duration. According to the data they provided, GitHub has been down more since the acquisition by Microsoft. </p>



<p>But that could be all a part of coordinated effort to be more transparent about their service status, an effort that should be applauded.</p>



<p>Our goal at StatusGator is not to shame anyone for disruptions and outages. Everyone experiences unexpected downtime. We simply strive to make status page data available and accessible in more useful ways. From Slack and <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2020/04/03/status-page-monitoring-in-microsoft-teams/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">Microsoft Teams</a>, to <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2020/04/30/status-page-webhooks-new-and-improved/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">webhooks</a>, an API, and more. StatusGator aggregates status page data and empowers you to keep your team informed. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Coronavirus and the lockdowns it forced has probably sped up the transition to working from home in many jobs by at least a decade. Workers who previously spend time sitting in cubicles or offices found out they could have just as well worked from home. Millions started looking for software that would help them do that. </p>
<p>Enter Zoom, a somewhat popular video-conferencing program made all the way back in 2011. It was already fairly popular before the pandemic, but this year it’s popularity has exploded. The daily average user numbers went from around 10 million in December to over 300 million in April. </p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p>Zoom became the go-to choice for many mainly because it’s really easy to use and free (well at least the basic version is) The usually highlighted advantages of Zoom are:</p>
<ul>
<li>simple and easy to use interface</li>
<li>good audio and video quality</li>
<li>smooth and easy to set up conference calls even for large groups up to 100 people</li>
<li>compatibility with various systems: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS</li>
<li>ability to share slides and content</li>
<li>scheduling conferences via a calendar that can be shared with others</li>
<li>virtual backgrounds</li>
</ul>

<p>Zoom also helped itself by making the program free to use for K-12 schools in the US since early March, just as the lockdowns were starting. It also received a lot of free publicity from famous users, even the UK government used it to host sessions.</p>
<h2>The Bad</h2>
<p>Well, it’s not all as rosy as it sounds. Zoom has been involved in some controversies that have become more and more apparent as it gained popularity. The main point of criticism has been lackluster security. </p>
<ul>
<li>In 2019 Apple was forced to remove Zoom from Macs after it turned out a security flaw could let websites hijack users’ cameras. Although the company quickly addressed this with fixes and a lengthy blog post, it wasn’t a good look.</li>
<li>Zoom has no end-to-end encryption, despite some advertising materials claiming otherwise. It stores all the keys involved in user data encryption in its own cloud infrastructure. Which means it can access user data at will.</li>
<li>Zoom calls have random generated IDs consisting between 9 and 11 digits and these can apparently be brute-forced or even randomly guessed which means hackers can get into meetings.</li>
</ul>

<p>The flaws were pretty notorious and led to a phenomenon called <em>zoom bombing</em> where pranksters would join meetings to broadcast inappropriate content. It got so bad the FBI had to officially warn schools.</p>
<h2>The Ugly</h2>
<p>Remember that thing about Zoom having access to user data? Well, it turns out that’s not an accident.</p>
<ul>
<li>This month Zoom admitted to closing three meetings commemorating the Tiananmen Square crackdown and suspended the accounts of activists who organized them. This led to teachers voicing concerns about how they’re supposed to cover such topics in classes hosted on the platform.</li>
<li>In April the New York Times found out Zoom’s data mining feature was automatically sending user’s names and emails to LinkedIn allowing participants to access other users’ profile data.</li>
<li>In March Motherboard found out Zoom’s iOS app was automatically sending device analytics to Facebook without informing the user and did it even if the user did not have a Facebook account. There was no mention of this in the privacy policy either.</li>
</ul>

<p>So far this has led to a couple of lawsuits, an inquiry by the Federal Trade Commission and outright bans from some tech companies and the UK’s ministry of defense. Not good news for the company to put it mildly. Yet despite all that Zoom is still hugely popular and looks like it will stay that way despite its flaws. To be fair it’s not like it’s main competitors like Microsoft Teams and Google Hangouts don’t have any either, so pick your poison.</p></div><p>The GraphQL Editor is a supportive tool for both advanced GraphQL users as well as those taking their first steps with GraphQL APIs.

<![CDATA[Experimenting with Error Handling via Generics in Go]]>
            </title>

June 29, 2020 | https://deedlefake.com/experimenting-with-error-handling-via-generics-in-go.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://deedlefake.com/experimenting-with-error-handling-via-generics-in-go.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On June 16th, an article was published to the Go blog detailing <a href="https://blog.golang.org/generics-next-step">the next steps for generics in Go</a>. Of particular interest in this case was that along with another updated draft design, this one came along with <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/refs/heads/dev.go2go/README.go2go.md">a tool that allowed users to actually write and use generic code in Go</a>.</p>

<p>So with a request to experiment, experiment I did. I tried a few little things, such an implementation of iterators, but then decided to play around with error handling, and I quickly realized that generics alone may be the beginnings of the solution to the error handling problem that so many people have been clamoring for.</p>

<p>Before I get to error handling and what I did, let’s take a quick look at a slightly simpler case: Secondary boolean returns. In Go, the convention for a function that might not return a value is to have the function return a boolean as a secondary return that indicates whether or not the first value makes any sense. For example, in the <code>os</code> package, there is a function that does just that: <code>func LookupEnv(name string) (string, bool)</code>. This function is a more powerful version of <code>os.Getenv()</code>. Both get the value of an environment variable, but <code>os.Getenv()</code> simply returns an empty string if the variable isn’t set at all, leaving no way to distinguish between an empty variable and an unset variable.</p>

<p>Taking a page out of Rust’s playbook, I decided to try implementing a wrapper for optional values that could provide some convenient common functionality. First, a container for the information and a few simple methods:</p>
<pre><span>type</span> <span>Optional</span>(<span>type</span> T) <span>struct</span> {
	v T
	ok <span>bool</span>
}

<span>func</span> (o <span>Optional</span>(T)) <span>Or</span>(v T) <span>Optional</span>(T) {
	<span>if</span> o.ok {
		<span>return</span> o
	}

	<span>return</span> <span>Optional</span>(T){v: v, ok: <span>true</span>}
}

<span>func</span> (o <span>Optional</span>(T)) <span>Get</span>() (T, <span>bool</span>) {
	<span>return</span> o.v, o.ok
}

<span>func</span> (o <span>Optional</span>(T)) <span>Must</span>() T {
	<span>if</span> !o.ok {
		panic(<span>"no value"</span>)
	}
	<span>return</span> o.v
}
</pre>
<p>It’s fairly simple to imagine how this might work, but how do you translate from existing functions following that convention to this new system? If I did, for example,</p>
<pre>v, ok := os.<span>LookupEnv</span>(<span>"DATABASE_URL"</span>)
v = <span>Optional</span>(<span>string</span>){v: v, ok: ok}.<span>Or</span>(DefaultDatabaseURL).<span>Must</span>()
</pre>
<p>then I haven’t exactly gained a whole lot. I even have to manually specify the type of the value now.</p>

<p>The key is a shortcut in Go that allows a call to a function with multiple returns to be passed directly to a call to a function with multiple arguments of the same types in the same order. Given this, a function that can be created such as the following:</p>
<pre><span>func</span> <span>Option</span>(<span>type</span> T)(v T, ok <span>bool</span>) <span>Optional</span>(T) {
	<span>return</span> <span>Optional</span>(T){v: v, ok: ok}
}
</pre>
<p>Now usage is very easy:</p>
<pre><span>// Functions do inference of arguments, so this version doesn't
</span><span></span><span>// require a manual type to be specified.
</span><span></span>
v := <span>Option</span>(os.<span>LookupEnv</span>(<span>"DATABASE_URL"</span>)).
	<span>Or</span>(DefaultDatabaseURL).
	<span>Must</span>()
</pre>
<p>This is significantly cleaner, in my opinion, then a manual check of the boolean return. For one thing, it doesn’t clutter up the local namespace with booleans, something that can get quite awkward to deal with if calls are nested into several <code>if</code>s, or if multiple calls need to be done before any of the checks are. For another thing, it avoids the subtleties of shadowing from using <code>:=</code> with multiple assignments. And thirdly, it avoids the problems of trying to assign to a struct field or slice index with <code>:=</code>, which is simply not allowed.</p>

<p>From here, a basic error handling pattern can be established pretty easily, but before getting to that, I’m going to put together an example function that I’ll be attempting to clean up with some error handling wrappers:</p>
<pre><span>func</span> <span>Authenticate</span>(ctx context.Context, db *ent.Client, email <span>string</span>, password []<span>byte</span>) (user *ent.User, err <span>error</span>) {
	user, err = db.User.<span>Query</span>().
		<span>Where</span>(user.<span>Email</span>(email)).
		<span>Only</span>(ctx)
	<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
		<span>return</span> <span>nil</span>, fmt.<span>Errorf</span>(<span>"get user: %w"</span>, err)
	}

	dbpass, err := base64.StdEncoding.<span>DecodeString</span>(user.Password)
	<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
		<span>return</span> <span>nil</span>, fmt.<span>Errorf</span>(<span>"decode password: %w"</span>, err)
	}

	err = bcrypt.<span>CompareHashAndPassword</span>(dbpass, password)
	<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
		<span>return</span> <span>nil</span>, fmt.<span>Errorf</span>(<span>"check password: %w"</span>, err)
	}

	<span>return</span> user, <span>nil</span>
}
</pre>
<p>This function is a theoretical implementation of user authentication in, for example, an API backend. You don’t need to know how <a href="https://entgo.io/">ent</a> works to understand what I’m going to do here; you just need to recognize how the standard error convention is being used here.</p>

<p>Now that that’s out of the way, here’s the beginnings of the error handling code:</p>
<pre><span>type</span> <span>Error</span>(<span>type</span> T) <span>struct</span> {
	v T
	err <span>error</span>
}

<span>func</span> <span>Try</span>(<span>type</span> T)(v T, err <span>error</span>) <span>Error</span>(T) {
	<span>return</span> <span>Error</span>(T){v: v, err: err}
}

<span>func</span> (e <span>Error</span>(T)) <span>Get</span>() (T, <span>error</span>) {
	<span>return</span> e.v, e.err
}

<span>func</span> (e <span>Error</span>(T)) <span>Must</span>() T {
	<span>if</span> e.err != <span>nil</span> {
		panic(e.err)
	}
	<span>return</span> e.v
}

<span>func</span> (e <span>Error</span>(T)) <span>Err</span>() <span>error</span> {
	<span>return</span> e.err
}
</pre>
<p>Now, unlike for <code>Optional</code>, an <code>Or()</code> method doesn’t necessarily make as much sense, as there are two values to deal with. More importantly, the user will probably want to do something specific based on what the error value is if there is one. To that end:</p>
<pre><span>type</span> <span>ModFunc</span>(<span>type</span> T) <span>func</span>(T, <span>error</span>) (T, <span>error</span>)

<span>func</span> (e <span>Error</span>(T)) <span>Mod</span>(f ModFunc) <span>Error</span>(T) {
	<span>return</span> <span>Try</span>(<span>f</span>(e.<span>Get</span>()))
}
</pre>
<p>While this might be generally useful for a number of different ways of handling errors, there is one very common operation that can also be provided to the user:</p>
<pre><span>// Not the most general, perhaps, but fine for the demonstation. Also,
</span><span></span><span>// unfortunately, int its intended use the type will have to be
</span><span></span><span>// specified manually because of shortcomings in the type inference as
</span><span></span><span>// currently implemented.
</span><span></span><span>func</span> <span>Wrap</span>(<span>type</span> T)(str <span>string</span>) <span>ModFunc</span>(T) {
	<span>return</span> <span>func</span>(v T, err <span>error</span>) (T, <span>error</span>) {

			<span>return</span> v, err
		}
		<span>return</span> v, fmt.<span>Errorf</span>(str + <span>": %w"</span>, err)
	}
}
</pre>
<p>Now that these features have been added, let’s take a quick look at how it’s affected the working example:</p>
<pre><span>func</span> <span>Authenticate</span>(ctx context.Context, db *ent.Client, email <span>string</span>, password []<span>byte</span>) (user *ent.User, err <span>error</span>) {
	user, err = db.User.<span>Query</span>().
		<span>Where</span>(user.<span>Email</span>(email)).
		<span>Only</span>(ctx)
	user, err = <span>Try</span>(user, err).
		<span>Mod</span>(<span>Wrap</span>(*ent.User)(<span>"get user"</span>)).
		<span>Get</span>()
	<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
		<span>return</span> <span>nil</span>, err
	}

	dbpass, err := <span>Try</span>(base64.StdEncoding.<span>DecodeString</span>(user.Password)).
		<span>Mod</span>(<span>Wrap</span>([]<span>byte</span>)(<span>"decode password"</span>)).
		<span>Get</span>()
	<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
		<span>return</span> <span>nil</span>, err
	}

	err = bcrypt.<span>CompareHashAndPassword</span>(dbpass, password)
	<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
		<span>return</span> <span>nil</span>, fmt.<span>Errorf</span>(<span>"check password: %w"</span>, err)
	}

	<span>return</span> user, <span>nil</span>
}
</pre>
<p>Hmmm… Hasn’t helped much, huh? There are still <code>err</code> variables and <code>err != nil</code> checks all over the place. In fact, I might even go so far as to say that it’s gotten worse.</p>

<p>Don’t worry. I’m not quite done yet.</p>

<p>First of all, let’s take care of that call to <code>CompareAndHashPassword()</code> at the end. Unlike the others, this one doesn’t return a value, just an error. Thanks to the way Go’s type system works, this is surprisingly straightforward, only requiring a single new function:</p>
<pre><span>func</span> <span>Do</span>(err <span>error</span>) <span>Error</span>(<span>struct</span>{}) {
	<span>return</span> <span>Error</span>(<span>struct</span>{}){err: err}
}
</pre>
<p>That call can now be changed to</p>
<pre>err = <span>Do</span>(bcrypt.<span>CompareHashAndPassword</span>(dbpass, password)).
	<span>Mod</span>(<span>Wrap</span>(<span>struct</span>{})(<span>"check password"</span>)).
	<span>Err</span>()
<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
	<span>return</span> <span>nil</span>, err
}
</pre>
<p>Alright, time to finally remove all of those manual checks. This is going to require a new type, a couple of modifications to an existing method, and two new functions. First of all, the type and the modification:</p>
<pre><span>type</span> perror <span>struct</span> {
	err <span>error</span>
}

<span>func</span> (err perror) <span>Unwrap</span>() <span>error</span> {
	<span>return</span> err.err
}

<span>func</span> (err perror) <span>Error</span>() <span>string</span> {
	<span>return</span> err.err.<span>Error</span>()
}

<span>func</span> (e <span>Error</span>(T)) <span>Must</span>() T {
	<span>if</span> e.err != <span>nil</span> {
		panic(perror{e.err})
	}
	<span>return</span> e.v
}
</pre>
<p>Now, when a function panics, before control leaves the function all of the deferred function calls are run as though a normal return was happening. Inside of those functions, a special built-in function, <code>recover()</code>, will cause the panicking to stop and will return the value, as an <code>interface{}</code>, that was passed to <code>panic()</code> in the first place. Combining this with the new <code>perror</code> type, it becomes fairly easy to write a function to catch errors that were caused by a call to <code>Must()</code> and <em>only</em> errors that were caused by that call:</p>
<pre><span>type</span> CatchFunc <span>func</span>(err <span>error</span>)

<span>func</span> <span>Catch</span>(f CatchFunc) {
	<span>switch</span> r := recover().(<span>type</span>) {
	<span>case</span> <span>nil</span>:
		<span>return</span>

	<span>case</span> perror:
		<span>f</span>(r)

	<span>default</span>:
		panic(r)
	}
}
</pre>
<p>And to avoid repetition:</p>
<pre><span>func</span> <span>Return</span>(rerr *<span>error</span>) CatchFunc {
	<span>return</span> <span>func</span>(err <span>error</span>) {
		<span>if</span> *rerr != <span>nil</span> {
			<span>return</span>
		}
		*rerr = err
	}
}
</pre>
<p>And back to the working example:</p>
<pre><span>func</span> <span>Authenticate</span>(ctx context.Context, db *ent.Client, email <span>string</span>, password []<span>byte</span>) (_ *ent.User, err <span>error</span>) {
	<span>defer</span> <span>Catch</span>(<span>Return</span>(&amp;err))

	user, err := db.User.<span>Query</span>().
		<span>Where</span>(user.<span>Email</span>(email)).
		<span>Only</span>(ctx)
	user = <span>Try</span>(user, err).
		<span>Mod</span>(<span>Wrap</span>(*ent.User)(<span>"get user"</span>)).
		<span>Must</span>()

	dbpass := <span>Try</span>(base64.StdEncoding.<span>DecodeString</span>(user.Password)).
		<span>Mod</span>(<span>Wrap</span>([]<span>byte</span>)(<span>"decode password"</span>)).
		<span>Must</span>()

	<span>Do</span>(bcrypt.<span>CompareHashAndPassword</span>(dbpass, password)).
		<span>Mod</span>(<span>Wrap</span>(<span>struct</span>{})(<span>"check password"</span>)).
		<span>Must</span>()

	<span>return</span> user, <span>nil</span>
}
</pre>
<p>I don’t know about you, but that looks a <em>lot</em> cleaner to me, even with the insufficient type inference for the calls to <code>Wrap()</code>.</p>

<p>So will generics fix the error handling ‘problem’? Maybe. It’s hard to tell at this point. But it will definitely be a step closer to that problem being solved.</p>

    <p><img src="https://gorillapdf.com/blog/10-facts-about-pdf-infographic/10-facts-about-pdf.png" title="Ten facts about PDF"></p><p>We love lists and hope you love them too! Today we have a list of <strong>10 facts about <a href="https://gorillapdf.com/blog/what-does-pdf-stand-for/" title="PDF File Format">PDF file format</a></strong>. </p>
<p>The list is complemented with a colorful infographic and we hope you’ll like it.</p>
<p>Certainly, there are so many facts about one of the most popular file formats on the planet, but Gorilla only counts to 10.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 10 interesting facts about PDF.</p>
<h2>10 PDF Facts</h2>
<ol>
<li>PDF is an invention of Adobe Systems. It was created in the early 1990s and officially presented in January 1993 at the Windows and OS|2 Conference.</li>
<li>PDF is independent of software and hardware, and can be accessed from every device. PDFs retain their original formatting no matter from which device they are accessed.</li>
<li>The initial project was called The Camelot Project. Later renamed to Carousel.</li>
<li>PDF Files can be optimized for the web. You can add a web friendly filename, define a good title and meta description, add headings to structure your PDF, insert links, include it on a website as a normal page and optimize the PDF file in size.</li>
<li>Acrobat Reader initial cost was $50.</li>
<li>PDF is the most popular file extension on the web. See yourself and try the filetype: operator in Google Search to limit results to a specific file type. For example, filetype:pdf hardware will result with PDF files with the term "hardware" in them. Try the same for several filetypes and compare the number of results.</li>
<li>One of the first early adopters of PDF were the US tax authorities. The service distributed tax forms as PDF files.</li>
<li>PDF supports security. You can add different levels of security and password protect your PDF files.</li>
<li>PDF is ISO standardized 15 years after invention (1993-2008). In 2008, PDF 1.7 (and beyond) by Adobe Systems became ISO 32000:1:2008 standard. A new version was published in July 2017, which is the ISO 32000-2:2017 PDF specification.</li>
<li>PDF can contain links, buttons, form fields, audio, video and business logic.</li>
</ol>

<p>After publishing the URU Key project people keep asking me to make it open source. I have tried to organize sources in a more readable way but I still think that plain C and ESP IDF are too difficult for the broad audience. And, unfortunately, the biometrics part is covered by NDA and can not be published.</p>
<p>Therefore I am starting a new project to address these and other issues.</p>
<h2 id="size-and-form-factor">Size and form factor</h2>
<p>A few months ago I have finalized the <a href="https://en.ovcharov.me/2020/04/06/uru-key-final-hardware-design/">URU Key hardware design</a> and started working on housing for it. Yes, it is very small and lightweight but carrying it around is a kind of a problem. The device is too fragile to be worn on the keyring and a bit thick to put in the pocket. The necklace is not my style.</p>

<p>However, my wallet is always with me. The PCB sized as a standard credit card should perfectly fit there. The power source becomes a problem, that’s true. But, wait, is it difficult to find a charger or power bank with Micro USB nowadays?</p>
<figure>

<p>The name <strong>URU Card</strong> makes a lot of sense for this project, isn’t it?</p>
<h2 id="user-interface">User interface</h2>
<p>As on one hand, I can not use biometrics for open source project and on other hand, I do not want to omit the authentication completely leaving the device insecure there is a need for some form of user verification. Simple touch keyboard and OLED screen should allow people to enter pin code or password.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/421c686c17665f43cfbb25fd3059190a055e4ae5/b0f7c/uploads/resized/uru-card-2-w800.jpg" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/421c686c17665f43cfbb25fd3059190a055e4ae5/b0f7c/uploads/resized/uru-card-2-w800.jpg" data-srcset="/uploads%2Fresized%2Furu-card-2-w150.jpg 150w, /uploads%2Fresized%2Furu-card-2-w300.jpg 300w, /uploads%2Fresized%2Furu-card-2-w600.jpg 600w, /uploads%2Fresized%2Furu-card-2-w800.jpg 800w, /uploads%2F2020%2F06%2F29%2Furu-card-2.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 150px, (max-width: 380px) 300px, (max-width: 680px) 600px, (max-width: 880px) 800px, 1200px" alt="URU Card - touch keyboard and OLED screen" title="URU Card - touch keyboard and OLED screen" srcset="https://en.ovcharov.me/uploads%2Fresized%2Furu-card-2-w150.jpg 150w, https://en.ovcharov.me/uploads%2Fresized%2Furu-card-2-w300.jpg 300w, https://en.ovcharov.me/uploads%2Fresized%2Furu-card-2-w600.jpg 600w, https://en.ovcharov.me/uploads%2Fresized%2Furu-card-2-w800.jpg 800w, https://en.ovcharov.me/uploads%2F2020%2F06%2F29%2Furu-card-2.jpg 1200w"><figcaption>URU Card - touch keyboard and OLED screen</figcaption></figure>
<p>The keyboard should be implemented with the <strong>MPR121</strong> I2C touch-sensor controller, and the screen is a widely available <strong>OLED</strong> screen with the <strong>SSD1306</strong> controller. The screen is placed in the special cut in the PCB keeping the device thickness below 2 millimetres.</p>
<h2 id="framework-for-the-development">Framework for the development</h2>
<p>Fortunately, the <strong>Arduino</strong> framework is ported to the <strong>ESP32</strong> platform. There are hundreds of libraries for almost every use case and this factor should significantly simplify the project. There are libraries for <strong>ATECC508A</strong>, <strong>MPR121</strong> and <strong>SSD1306</strong> already. All that is needed is to wire everything together.</p>
<p>However, the Arduino IDE will be hardly usable for a project complex like this one. I am going to use Visual Studio Code + <strong>PlatformIO</strong> for the development and recommend others to do the same.</p>
<h2 id="the-current-state-of-the-project">The current state of the project</h2>
<p>At the moment the working <strong>BLE server</strong> with <strong>FIDO2</strong> endpoints is implemented. The device is “visible” and the computer connects to it in order to perform an authentication procedure. However, the commands are not implemented yet - it’s going to be the next step.</p>

<p>There is a PCB design as well and you can try to build the device, but do it on your own risk - it’s in a very early stage now.</p>
<h2 id="joining-the-project">Joining the project</h2>
<p>Sweetest part. The project is free to join for everyone. The minimal requirement is just an ESP32 development board like the one below.</p>

            <p>“I’m trying to go down a bottomless pit. I’ll never make it till the end.”</p>
<p>That’s what I thought when I tried to create my own video game. I was young, beautiful, and I was struggling to use <code>for</code> loops and <code>arrays</code> at the same time.
There was so much to learn!</p>
<p>Fortunately, I found the strength to continue. More and more, the concepts behind programming began to make sense. From there, learning wasn’t a chore anymore, but an intrepid journey. Going through a book about C and trying to create my own adventure on MS-DOS was a crazy Indiana Jone’s-like discovery I’ll never forget.</p>
<p>My first video game wasn’t great, but it was mine. It was <em>my</em> creation. Yet, what I remember today, with a tear in my left eye, is not the result, but the learning process itself. It was these “Aha!” moments which brought me the most joy!</p>
<p>I love learning. For a long, long time. That’s why I tried, through the years, to make my learning gradually more effective and efficient.</p>
<p>Learning is essential for developers. We need to learn about the new breakthroughs, discoveries, and changes in the industry.</p>
<p>We need to learn about our history, to know what’s really new, what’s not, and what to do with it, <em>in what context</em>.</p>
<p>We need to learn about the business domain of the company we’re working with.</p>
<p>We need to learn how to better communicates with our teammates.</p>
<p>We need to learn about what our customers really want.</p>
<p>The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>As you might have guessed, this article will brush over the wide subject of learning, as a developer. We’ll try to answer these questions together:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s learning?</li>
<li>Why do we learn? Should learning serve a goal?</li>
<li>How to avoid ineffective learning methods, procrastination, and distractions?</li>
<li>Should we have a mentor or learn by ourselves?</li>
<li>Is practice only makes perfect?</li>
<li>How to test ourselves to avoid the illusion of competence?</li>
<li>Are feedback important? What kind of feedback can you get? What feedback should you be interested in?</li>
</ul>
<p>Ready to dive? Good. Take your machete and let’s go together through the Deep Jungle of Knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="whats-learning">What’s learning?</h2>
<p>Sometimes, we can be very surprised of the meaning of common words. Especially if we never question their definitions.</p>
<p>For example, I’m always surprised to hear people saying that learning is only a question of memory. It’s not wrong, but it’s incomplete.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/learning">oxford dictionary</a>, learning means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The acquisition of knowledge or skills through study, experience, or being taught.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gives us clues about how to learn (study, experience, or being taught), but not really about the meaning of “acquisition of knowledge”.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the definition of <a href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/knowledge">knowledge</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facts, information, and skills acquired through experience or education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can already see, thanks to these definitions, two main foundations for learning:</p>
<ol>
<li>Understanding</li>
<li>Remembering (acquisition)</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll add a third one:</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Transfer</li>
</ol>
<p>Transfer is applying the knowledge from the learning context to another context. For example, it could be applying the programming knowledge your learned at school to the side project you always dreamt to build.</p>
<p>Transfer is not a necessity for learning. After all, you can understand and remember something without ever using what you learned.</p>
<p>However, most of the time, we learn in hope to apply the knowledge acquired. That’s why it’s still a major component of our learning experiences.</p>
<h2 id="why-learning">Why Learning?</h2>

    <img src="https://thevaluable.dev/images/2020/learning_developer/learn-good.jpg" alt="There is only good in learning">
</picture>



<h3 id="enriching-your-life">Enriching Your Life</h3>
<p>Learning will enrich your life in multiple ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your opinions will evolve.</li>
<li>Your vision on the world will change.</li>
<li>You’ll feel strong connections with people who share your interests, creating passionate and mind-binding conversations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning can open doors in your professional life:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can help you climbing the corporate ladder.</li>
<li>It can help you to negotiate a better salary. After all, we are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker">knowledge workers</a>: our worth is <em>partly</em> our knowledge.</li>
<li>It will create opportunities for <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/guide-debate-software-developer-skill/">healthy debates with your fellow colleagues</a>.</li>
<li>Your CTO might call you <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/software-developer-titles-junior-senior/">“Rockstar” or “Ninja”</a> too, you lucky pit of knowledge!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="learning-with-or-without-goals">Learning With or Without Goals?</h3>
<p>When you try to learn something, it’s useful to have concrete goals you want to achieve with the knowledge acquired. These goals could be a good occasion to <em>transfer</em> your knowledge.</p>
<p>For example, you want to learn programming because you always dreamt to create a revolutionary video game, where you can break bricks with a ball. Maybe you want to learn what’s the <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/dry-principle-cost-benefit-example/">DRY principle</a>, to finally refactor your favorite legacy application.</p>
<p>Without meaningful goals, it will be difficult to be motivated in the long run. Learning is not easy. Understanding can be a daunting task (depending of what you learn), remembering even more so, and transfer is maybe the worst of all.</p>
<p>It takes time, too. That’s why being able to reach concrete goals with your new skills and knowledge can be very satisfying. It will give you the needed motivation to continue on your learning path.</p>
<p>It’s even more true when you try to learn complex topics. Your motivation is something you should try to assess and even measure along the way, to see if you need to boost it by making (and finishing) something important to you.</p>
<p>It’s always possible to learn for the sake of learning. Heck, I do it quite a lot myself. Yet, you need to have a good confidence on your motivation, and you need to be aware of the benefits of the learning journey itself.</p>
<p>If you have difficulties to find concrete ideas and goals where you can transfer your new knowledge, I wrote a whole article about techniques <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/generate-programming-side-project-ideas/">to generate project ideas</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-deep-do-you-want-to-go">How Deep Do You Want to Go?</h2>

    <img src="https://thevaluable.dev/images/2020/learning_developer/experts.jpg" alt="Being an expert is not necessarily your goal">
</picture>



<p>Now that you have your goals, you need to decide <em>how much</em> you want to learn.</p>
<p>After all, you don’t need to be an expert in everything.</p>
<p>Moreover, knowledge acquisition is not like buying a new table for your living room. You need some maintenance not to forget the knowledge and skills acquired.</p>
<p>It means that you need to constantly refresh your knowledge and skills, for everything you want to be an expert at. It takes time, energy, and require, again, a lot of motivation.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say that your life’s dream is to write a PHP script to rename automatically thousands of your holidays pictures. You don’t need to be a PHP evangelist to answer your needs. Trying to understand superficially how PHP works to accomplish what you want might be enough.</p>
<p>Superficial learning works well if you don’t have any goal, too. You can read about programming paradigms for example, by pure curiosity, to have a global overview of all of them. You can still dive deeper if you wish later.</p>
<p>Beyond the superficial, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition">Dreyfus model of competence</a> can help you deciding how competent you want to become:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Novice</strong> - Shallow understanding, or no understanding at all.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Beginner</strong> - Can make things works, often rely on following a series of steps.</li>
<li><strong>Competent</strong> - Can spot the roots of problems (background understanding), know all the rules and can select a rule depending of the situation. Still make many mistakes.</li>
<li><strong>Proficient</strong> - Very conscious about performance, know perfectly what approaches to take in what situation.</li>
<li><strong>Expert</strong> - Intuition very well developed, apply his skills without thoughts, performances look magical.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1nzADdV6zk">Choose your destiny</a>, depending on your needs!</p>

</picture>



<p>Let’s see now how you should prepare yourself before learning anything.</p>
<p>The following advice won’t change your life from one day to another. You need to work on it, actively seeking to apply these advice, day after day. The rewards are, however, huge. I promise.</p>
<h3 id="the-mistakes-to-avoid">The Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
<p>Let’s go back years in your past, when you were young, innocent, and not a caffeine junky yet.</p>
<p>You’re at school. The teacher is speaking about whatever subject he wants you to learn. His tone is monotonous, he doesn’t believe in what he’s saying, you think about what you’ll eat at lunch.</p>
<p>You’re bored.</p>
<p>The seconds feel like minutes. Minutes feel like hours. You can’t do anything, except waiting. Will it ever end? Will you feel joy again? Is it the end of time?</p>
<p>Finally, against all odds, the course end. The teacher ask you to learn a new chapter of your book. He will test you next time.</p>
<p>At home, you read again and again the learning material. You have difficulties to concentrate, but you’re a serious boy (or girl), so you push yourself through. After five reading, you judge yourself good enough to pass the next test.</p>
<p>You close your book, satisfied with yourself, and switch on the TV, because Youtube might not exist yet.</p>
<p>What I just described is the worst way to learn something. <em>Passively</em> listening to somebody, then <em>passively</em> going through some learning materials might teach you something, but very, very slowly. You don’t need to be in a class for that: just switch on Youtube and consume <em>passively</em> any video on programming.</p>
<p>When you close your book after your passive learning, you think you learned something. Yet, when you’ll pass your test, you’ll understand that you really didn’t.</p>
<p>This is called <strong>illusion of competence</strong>: we have often the <em>impression</em> we learned something, even if we didn’t.</p>
<p>You should spend most of your time <em>actively learning</em>. You need to be an actor in your own learning, not only consuming it like you would consume Netflix.</p>
<p>I would compare active learning as playing a video game. Yes, I was a video game junky.</p>
<p>When you play, you’re actively doing something. Consequently, I’m sure you can remember many more video games than what you read in your last books.</p>
<p>This is due to two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Video games are fun. You can make your learning experience fun, too. More you’ll learn what you love, more you’ll like the process of learning.</li>
<li>Playing is an active endeavor, not a passive one.</li>
</ol>
<p>That being said, before actively learning, you need first …</p></section></article></div></div>

		<p>It's been quite a while now that I'm relying on self-learning for my education. As I became a better learner, I tackled broader and more complex topics on my own.</p><p>At first, it was just specific books or guides that people referred me to. Usually, it was a part of following a path designed by either my teachers, lecturers, parents, or professional acquaintances. I would then use that resource and continue with the original learning path.</p><p>When I started approaching entire subjects on my own, I needed to design the learning paths myself. I discovered that it's a hard and tedious job mapping topics.</p><p>It included understanding what the broader topic is about, laying out the different subtopics, and getting an idea of which one to learn first, which next, and on. Next, I needed to find the best resources to learn from.</p><p>With the rise of online learning, I was able to deepen my understanding in many new areas. I gained access to many new courses, books, teachers, podcasts, YouTube videos, guides, and more. It was a blessing and a curse.</p><p>I enjoyed the abundance of available books, courses, podcasts, YouTube series, large and small learning platforms, and many more websites wanting to educate us. However, it was a blessing and a curse, since eventually, I needed to choose something from the variety.</p><p>Let's take a look at the google result page for the term "learn javascript":</p><figure><img src="https://blog.jiruto.com/content/images/2020/06/xCleanShot-2020-06-28-at-11.52.59,402x-1.png.pagespeed.ic.YN9LKTphkG.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.jiruto.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/CleanShot-2020-06-28-at-11.52.59@2x-1.png 600w, https://blog.jiruto.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/CleanShot-2020-06-28-at-11.52.59@2x-1.png 1000w, https://blog.jiruto.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/xCleanShot-2020-06-28-at-11.52.59,402x-1.png.pagespeed.ic.rhznren1dl.png 1600w, https://blog.jiruto.com/content/images/size/w1748/2020/06/CleanShot-2020-06-28-at-11.52.59@2x-1.png 1748w"><figcaption>The first half of the results page for "learning javascript"</figcaption></figure><p>3.2 Billion results. Half of the first page is occupied by ads, and then start the massive list of learning resources. Videos, articles, courses, and so much more. It's easy to get lost or overwhelmed by the amount of information.</p><p>Two important things I learned, searching for excellent resources, are:</p><ol><li>Staying on the first google page is not enough.</li><li>The best resources hide in forum posts and blog articles.</li></ol><p>Scanning blogs and forums takes time, but I did it anyway because I didn't want to waste time on outdated or inferior learning resources. Too often, I felt I missed something, that I didn't do a proper outlining of the field. That I was supposed to learn something before, and that's why the difficulties right now. I call it the "I don't know what I don't know" syndrome.</p><p>Trying to take on a whole field, such a Mathematics, or CS (my main fields), became a much harder task. It became a job on its own. It introduces so much overhead with syllabus and curriculum design, ordering of topics and their subtopics, and then finding learning resources for them all.</p><hr><p>To summarize, my pains learning online are:</p><ol><li>Mapping topics</li><li>Creating a syllabus</li><li>Finding good learning resources</li><li>Ordering and organizing the resources</li></ol><p>As stated above, the best solutions often come from blogs and forums, or in other words, from the community. So social learning already happens, but it's unorganized and unmaintained.</p><p>A new forum or blog post must be created to reflect any changes:</p><ol><li>A learning resource becomes outdated</li><li>Better ones are created</li><li>More effective learning methods are introduced</li></ol><p>It's hard to scale this system up. More people now rely on e-learning, and for more complex topics as well. Its importance and demand rise, and there's a need for a structured system.</p><p>The pains and the reasons above are why I started <a href="https://jiruto.com/">Jiruto</a>: to facilitate social learning and help e-learning scale up. To design a space for all our learning needs: find resources, talk about the process, get updates on our fields of interest, and more.</p><p>The "social" in "social learning" indicates we rely on the community: The people who've already been through this path. Other learners who take it with us. Professionals on the bleeding-edge frontline, forming and adding to the field itself.</p><p>As a learner, you can browse the created paths, look for one that fits your needs. The follow it. If it's</p><p>It's only together that we'll be able to realize that goal.

                <p>A program is not a very fast pencil.</p>
<p>Software operates on different plane when compared to pen-and-paper business. It is the duty of software developer to avoid the trap of aligning software with principles of a traditional business.</p>
<p>In this article, we will describe how the fast pencil fallacy becomes reality in a common software development project. After that, we will explain how that fallacy can be avoided.</p>
<h2>Understanding the Problem</h2>
<p>To better understand how brand-new software inadvertently becomes a fast pencil, we need to understand the process of delivering software. It all begins with the customer, probably feeling lost in the process of defining requirements – desires if you will – specifying what the future product should and should not do.</p>
<p>The customer is running a business, in a way which has remained the same for a hundred years maybe. They are using very primitive tools, quite different from the tools we use in software development. They are accustomed to using a pencil.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codinghelmet.com/articles/the-fast-pencil-fallacy-in-software-development/img/image1.png" alt="image1.png"></p><p>And what they ask a software developer to do, is to come up with a nice and square software to enhance the way their business is run. And indeed, developer comes up with a piece of software, which is meant to replace that traditional pen-and-paper business. That is the moment when magic happens in its least desired form, because the customer, no matter how hard they tried, will never be able to see the difference between the two, the pencil and the software.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codinghelmet.com/articles/the-fast-pencil-fallacy-in-software-development/img/image2.png" alt="image2.png"></p><p>They will normally see the program as a very fast pencil. They will invariantly look at the program as a fast replacement for their traditional business. And that is the problem. Modern software development practices based on accepting customer’s requirements and implementing them to the point where any distinction between software and a pencil disappears is the root cause of bad software design.</p>
<p>If you try to oversee software development today, you will see programs of all kinds working exactly the same as the pen-and-paper business they are addressing, with only one tiny distinction, and that is that software is automated to a degree. That is precisely why customers will keep seeing software as their very fast pencil.</p>
<p>Do you want to develop that? No, you don’t! But what will you do instead? How will you respond to customer’s requirements? To answer these questions, we need to return to place where it all begins: To the bare business.</p>
<p>Spoiler ahead. When developing software, we will not regard customer as the source of truth. Not everything your customer will tell is correct. We will now look at software development from a different perspective.</p>
<h2>Avoiding the Fallacy</h2>
<p>To understand how software should be developed, we will once again start from the customer, who is utterly lost with so many thoughts in their head. They have a business, that’s the fact. But that is not relevant to software development, because nobody wants to have a business. People want to have a vacation, not a business. Something else they have is of our interest instead, which remains to be discovered.</p>
<p>In software development, voyage begins with understanding that customer, who owns the business, has something else of importance. That will probably be the element you have never met in your programming life. They, customers, have the problem. They have something that is hurting them, or hurting their own customers.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codinghelmet.com/articles/the-fast-pencil-fallacy-in-software-development/img/image3.png" alt="image3.png"></p><p>Their entire business is built around methods of addressing that problem. That is the whole point of businesses, and the reason why it was said above that nobody wants to have a business. Customers want to solve the problem for their own customers and to make money by being successful at it.</p>
<p>Where does the software fit into this picture, then? Software comes as a representation of a solution to the problem. You would move the problem away from the customer and put software in between. That makes software a layer of abstraction between the user and the problem.</p>
<p>At this point, we are switching to term user, not customer anymore. Basically, user is the one who is using software, and customer is the one who is paying for the software to be developed. This definition may not cover all angles, but it will be sufficient to understand the explanations that follow.</p>
<p>When put that way, users will use the software, and software will abstract away that pointy thing below which is hurting them. The rule of the game is to remove the problem from user’s view, and to replace it with an abstract representation of the problem, so that software can act as an automated solution to the problem instance.</p>
<p>Finally, there comes the question of avoiding the fast pencil fallacy. You will avoid it best if you understand that software itself is of no interest to the user. What is of interest, however, is the way the user will send commands to software. That is how user is controlling the abstraction of the problem. You will need to think about how to best implement commands, then.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codinghelmet.com/articles/the-fast-pencil-fallacy-in-software-development/img/image4.png" alt="image4.png"></p><p>Software will ultimately produce one tiny item, and that is the only thing your user will ever care about. That is the output, the product of applying software.</p>
<p>In effect, the user will only be concerned with giving commands to software and collecting the result. And even those commands will be of little concern, with that result of applying software remaining the only thing that is useful to the user. Software is not important. Problem is not important. Output is the only thing that counts.</p>
<p>Software developer will effectively switch to thinking how to let somebody apply the program to produce output. In that way, all that lies below a very thin line under the user interface becomes the developer’s own problem, rather than being the customer’s problem. The customer will see none of the elements below the surface and they will forever remain the software developer’s domain of business.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codinghelmet.com/articles/the-fast-pencil-fallacy-in-software-development/img/image5.png" alt="image5.png"></p><h2>Software as a Useful Tool</h2>
<p>From a broader perspective, to develop a working software means to develop the inner parts in such way that outer parts, the user interface, can operate and let the user produce the desired output.</p>
<p>All business processes remain the duty of the software to perform. Software will not expect the user to navigate through processes and effectively run them manually. Instead, software will expect the user to fill in the required information so that the processes can be executed on their own.</p>
<p>If you were successful doing that, your software will not be a very fast pencil. It will turn the tables and do the right thing (whatever that is) to solve the problem for the user.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this article, we have shed light on one of the most prominent issues in software development – the problem of understanding what customer needs, as opposed to accepting what the customer is asking for.</p>
<p>When we scratch under the surface, we find great uncertainty in customers’ views, which comes from misunderstanding the role of software, and the working principles of machines if you like.</p>
<p>Customers need guidance to the realm of software. Developers need to interview customers to understand the problem the business is solving, not just the current working principles of the business itself.</p>
<p>Once understanding of the problem is established, the duty of software developer is to produce abstract model of the problem and implement processes upon it. The result should be the software product, which is performing business processes in fully automated fashion, so that the user doesn’t have to perform them manually.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>This is a (very late) reply to Patrick McKenzie's "<a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/">Don't Call Yourself A Programmer, And Other Career Advice</a>". I find much of his advice very sensible, and it might be very helpful to someone in the beginning of their career – assuming they can act upon it (and I really don't know whether my 20-year-old self could actually use the advice to improve his negotiation skills, for example).</p>
<p>A few things in the article I disagree with, however. Here I'll mostly focus on those few things, recommending you to read the original article so that you don't miss the rest of it.</p>
<p>"Disagree" is not necessarily the right word – a more precise way to put it would be "it's different in my experience". Which is to be expected because both of us are speaking based on our own careers, which have been rather different. Patrick McKenzie is a small business owner running <a href="http://www.bingocardcreator.com/">Bingo Card Creator</a> and a successful consultant. I'm a lead chip architect at a billion-dollar company. Both of us have thus traveled some distance away from "purely programming" (whatever that means), but in rather different directions.</p>
<p><strong>What company are you going to work for?<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Patrick McKenzie says 90% of the jobs involve things like implementing an internal travel expense reporting form, rather than a product shipped to external customers. He advises you to get used to the idea, even though such software is "soul-crushingly boring" as he puts it.</p>
<p>How bad is it, and is it really 90% of the jobs? Spolsky <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/12/04.html">thinks</a> it's maybe 80% – and that it's bad enough to "drain the life out of you". He goes on to elaborate why it "sucks to be an in-house programmer":</p>
<ul>
<li>There's rarely a business reason to improve in-house software past the point of "barely good enough". "Forget any pride of craftsmanship – you're going to churn out embarrassing junk".</li>
<li>At software companies, what you do is more directly related to the way the company makes money, so you're more likely to be respected. "A programmer is never going to rise to become CEO of Viacom, but you might well rise to become CEO of a tech company." "…no matter how critical it was for Viacom to get this internet thing  right, when it came time to assign people to desks, the in-house  programmers were stuck with 3 people per cubicle in a dark part of the  office".</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that McKenzie and Spolsky are in almost complete agreement over these points. But then Spolsky says you should be gunning for a position in a software company – the environment where creatures of your kind naturally thrive. Conversely, McKenzie explains how to prosper as a programmer outside software companies – <em>moving in the opposite direction of where things go by default</em> (being stuck in a dark part of the office while they're trying to outsource your job.)</p>
<p>So the question is which path you prefer. "Not so fast", you say: one of these jobs is way easier to land – 80-90% of the chances are you're not getting inside a software company – so it's not just a question of preference.</p>
<p>Here I disagree: even if only 10-20% of programmers work in software companies (where are the stats?..), and even if they're "the best" (according to what metric?), McKenzie himself says in that same article:</p>
<blockquote><p>You radically overestimate the average skill of the competition because of the crowd you hang around with:&nbsp; Many people already successfully employed as senior engineers cannot actually implement FizzBuzz.</p></blockquote>
<p>But if competition is relatively unskilled on average, you probably can land a job in the 10-20% of the sector that you want – as did most people who graduated around the time I did. So I rather firmly believe that it's a matter of choice: do you <em>want</em> to work on in-house software or one-off businessy projects of that kind, or do you prefer a software company?</p>
<p>Let's proceed to McKenzie's advice to in-house programmers – which should in itself help one make that choice.</p>
<p><strong>How to call yourself<br>
</strong></p>
<p>One such advice is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Don't call yourself a programmer. “Programmer” sounds like “anomalously high-cost peon who types some mumbo-jumbo into some other mumbo-jumbo.” Instead, describe yourself by what you have accomplished for previous employers vis-a-vis increasing revenues or reducing costs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sure – an in-house programmer is likely doing some type of expensive mumbo-jumbo in the eyes of his non-technical MBA-wielding manager.</p>
<p>To me, however, a programmer is who I'm looking for, while a resume full of revenue increases and cost reductions sounds like an "anomalously high-cost parasite who types some mumbo-jumbo into Excel and PowerPoint, claiming credit for others' work".</p>
<p>McKenzie says a software company looks at this just like a company hiring internal programmers, essentially. His example is "the guy who wrote the backend billing code that 97% of Google’s revenue passes through – he’s now an angel investor". The guy apparently got rich by being near a "profit center" rather than through his unusual skills.</p>
<p>The thing is, in this case I believe he's talking about <a href="http://www.flownet.com/ron/">Ron Garret</a>, the PhD from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Do you think they hired him because he described his work at the JPL in terms of revenues and costs? (BTW he didn't like working on the billing code, bought his stock options and quit, instead of choosing a career at the company's biggest "profit center".)</p>
<p>Did any unusual skills go into the billing code? Ron Garret <a href="http://www.flownet.com/ron/xooglers.html">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I did end up writing the credit card billing and accounting system, which is a nontrivial thing to get right. Fortunately for me, just before coming to Google I had taken some time to study computer security and cryptography, so I was actually well prepared for that particular task. …I designed the billing system to be secure against even a dishonest employee with root access (which is not such an easy thing to do). I have no idea if they are still using my system, but if they are then I'd feel pretty confident that my credit card number was not going to get stolen.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds to me that his technical knowledge and programming ability was the bulk of his contribution, whereas deep thoughts such as realizing that there will be some "cost reduction" due to not having credit card numbers stolen is not something an employer needs to hire anyone for.</p>
<p>So if I ever send out a resume as a chip architect, I will focus on my technical role in transitioning from fixed-function hardware accelerators to programmable processors, more than the manpower this saved and the business we won as a result (which I think were real outcomes of our work, but which is rather hard to quantify – as these things often are unless you're a business-friendly-sounding liar.)</p>
<p>Incidentally, I'm not sure <em>when </em>I'll send out that resume, which brings us to the next point.</p>
<p><strong>On job hopping, backstabbing, and the lack thereof </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Co-workers and bosses are not usually your friends: You will spend a lot of time with co-workers.&nbsp; You may eventually become close friends with some of them, but in general, you will move on in three years…</p>
<p>&lt;your boss will&gt; attempt to do things that none of your actual friends would ever do,  like try to talk you down several thousand dollars in salary or  guilt-trip you into spending more time with the company when you could  be spending time with your actual friends. &nbsp;You will have other  coworkers who — affably and ethically — will suggest things which go  against your interests…</p></blockquote>
<p>There is a certain internal consistency to a view that your coworkers are not your friends, because you will move on in 3 years. In fact, it's a bit circular. They aren't your friends – because you'll move on. And why will you move on? Well, I dunno, maybe for a 10% salary increase. What's there to lose? Relationships with coworkers? But coworkers aren't your friends!</p>
<p>Again, I don't disagree, but rather offer an alternative view, equally internally consistent. I have stayed at one job for more than a decade, in large part because I'm rather attached to the people I work with. To be sure, I got raises, and I was ready to quit over employment terms – but it'd take much more than 10%.</p>
<p>Isn't it just a quantitative difference in preferences – a 10% raise not being fundamentally different than, say, 100%? Well, sufficiently large quantitative changes add up to qualitative changes, as Marxian dialectics or some other Soviet philosophy thingie that my parents sometimes quote taught us. What's going on is that both approaches can lead to career advancement, but they do so very differently.</p>
<p>If you're willing to change jobs over a small raise, you'll be changing them frequently. You won't get attached to people, or to the work you're doing together. You will be very good at finding jobs and you will know what's generally going on in the industry and what's in demand. You will <em>not </em>know that many things specific to any of your employers. <em>You and your employer will become very useful to each other fairly quickly, but you'll also be somewhat expendable for each other.</em></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can keep a job as long as it's a fun environment, requiring a significant raise once in a while. Your relationships with people combined with your long-term outlook can let you do things together that you otherwise couldn't plan or execute, and learn things you wouldn't have learned.</p>
<p>Much of my knowledge about chip design comes from ASIC hackers I worked with, and their willingness to develop their biggest ideas together with me came from trust that necessarily took time to build. It takes time to learn that none of you is in the habit of "suggesting things going against the other's interest", or pulling other unfriendly shenanigans.</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you stay at one place for a long while, then your worth to the employer grows to the point where you can get the significant raise that you'd quit over without actually quitting. Your worth can also grow well above what employers are willing to pay to experienced new hires, so there's no longer a point in switching jobs. This is somewhat analogous to becoming a consultant after having switched a …</p></div></div>

    <p>Ubuntu LTS is always lagging behind in newer releases of software, for stability reason, though it’s not always true, because one of the most stable Linux distribution Red Hat has reported kernel security issues which was already fixed 17 months prior. Anyway, to have software updated, Snap is a good choice and preinstalled in all recent Ubuntu releases, and I loved it before I knew how exactly it works.</p>

<p>Snap is a sandbox environment for software, where program is bundled by the developer all together into a single platform independent package, which can run in all systems with <code>snapd</code> installed. Then many problems occur, generally performance related, snap daemon constantly causes high resource usage and slow down my system, and whenever I shutdown or reboot the system, snap always block there to stop something for minutes.</p>

<p>Another serious problem for me is input method engine, because the Snap sandbox isolates the program with host so that it can’t access the host environment. I use fcitx a lot, so when I run VS Code from snap, I was not able to input Chinese, until then I searched around and realized how does snap work. And I even found another sandbox Flatpak, gave it a try but unfortunately fcitx didn’t work neither. So I removed all those sandboxes.</p>

<p>The first step is reboot your system, because without that snap may block you from removing packages. Then do a <code>snap list</code> to get all the packages installed, and remove them.</p>

<p><img src="https://vec.io/images/2020/06/29/snap-list.png" alt="snap"></p>

<p>Looks scary, huh? Yes they have <code>core</code> installed, and you may also have <code>gnome-3-34</code> or <code>gtk-common-themes</code>, all seems something you should not remove, otherwise they would break your system. However I did remove all of them with <code>sudo snap remove core18</code> and blah blah.</p>

<p>After all of them removed, I purged the snapd package by <code>sudo apt purge snapd</code> and made a system reboot.</p>

<p>All good, and shutdown is never stuck.</p>

    </span></p><h2 id="background"><a href="#background" aria-label="background permalink"></a>Background</h2><p>While working on a big project where multiple teams merge their feature branches frequently into a <span title="Click to find out more">release Git branch</span>, developers often run into situations where they find that some of their work have been either removed, modified or affected by someone else's work accidentally. It can happen in smaller teams as well. Two features could have been working perfectly fine until they got merged together and broke something. That's a highly possible case. There are many other cases which could cause such hard to understand and subtle bugs which even continuous integration (CI) systems running the entire test suite of our projects couldn't catch.</p><p>We are not going to discuss how such subtle bugs can get into our release branch because that's just a wild territory out there. Instead, we can definitely discuss about how to find a commit that deviated an expected outcome of a certain feature. The deviation could be any behaviour of our code that we can measure distinctively — either good or bad in general.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Examples of deviations</th><th>Measurement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A commit that introduced a bug or a regression</td><td><code>Good</code> or <code>Bad</code></td></tr><tr><td>A commit that changed the code style</td><td><code>New</code> or <code>Old</code></td></tr><tr><td>A commit caused a benchmark's performance</td><td><code>Fast</code> or <code>Slow</code></td></tr><tr><td>A commit that fixed a bug</td><td><code>Fixed</code> or <code>Broken</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Finding the exact point where it changed the course of our code base in terms of either of such deviations could be difficult to trace down and involves a lot of efforts if we have to do it manually.</p><h2 id="a-common-problem"><a href="#a-common-problem" aria-label="a common problem permalink"></a>A common problem</h2><p>Let's assume an example.</p><p>We are looking for a commit that broke something in our shipment feature which was working perfectly fine until the last release. We had tagged that release commit with <code>v12.1.0-rc4</code>. We also have a few tests in our test suite that can help us identify whether that commit is good or bad. Then just recently, some teams merged their feature branches that introduced about close to hundred of commits into our release branch. That's a normal practice in our project assuming we have a bunch of teams working on different feature branches constantly. Then suddenly our CI service reports a red build for the tests run on the latest release branch. CI marked that build as failed since it found that the tests related to the shipment feature were failing. That's very unfortunate and all teams are worried now. But why everyone has to worry? Because everyone have to start with the code in the release branch as the base code and build features atop meaning they would get same test failures in their feature branches, too and won't be able to merge that without a succsessful build on CI. Such a cascaded effect slows down the overall progress and morale of the teams, right?!</p><div>

  </div></div><p>Because we are the team responisble for the shipment feature, we need to fix those failing tests in the release branch. But everyone in our team is pretty sure that it's not our fault because the overall shipment feature was working until we released <code>v12.1.0-rc4</code>. But anyway we need to triage and fix it, right? So we start with the <code>HEAD</code> commit in the latest release branch. We confirm that the shipment feature breaks on it by running our test suite. Then we keep checking out to each of the previous commits in the Git history until we find a commit where our test suite passes. In a worst case scenario, that succsessful commit could be the one which is tagged with <code>v12.1.0-rc4</code> — meaning we have to checkout to about hundred commits one-by-one to find a good commit. The commit made just after that <strong>good commit</strong> in the commit history tree is what we can refer a <strong>bad commit</strong>.</p><p>If we take such a route, we would end up spending unimaginable hours (or days) chasing down a bad commit. That's definitely not an ideal solution.</p><h2 id="a-bunch-of-solutions"><a href="#a-bunch-of-solutions" aria-label="a bunch of solutions permalink"></a>A bunch of solutions!</h2><p>So what options do we have?</p><ul><li><strong>Option 1</strong>: We can equally divide the commits between a well known good commit and a bad commit among the team members and manually checkout to each commit accordingly to reduce the overall efforts. This excercise suits that popular saying, <em>work as a team!</em></li><li><strong>Option 2</strong>: <code>The Nerd John</code> in our team has a clever idea to implement a fancy tool that would utilize a  binary search algorithm that automatically keeps dividing the commits equally by running the test suite until it finds a commit which was the first bad commit in the commit history. We all know, John's so nerdy!</li><li><strong>Option 3</strong>: Use a readymade tool <code>git bisect</code> which comes built-in with <code>git</code> that <code>The Nerd John</code> could have been end up building — but only in its half-baked form.</li></ul><h2 id="git-bisect-a-good-solution"><a href="#git-bisect-a-good-solution" aria-label="git bisect a good solution permalink"></a>git bisect: a good solution</h2><p>The <code>git bisect</code> command uses an efficient binary search algorithm to help us find a commit that we are looking for. It requires us to specify a bad commit and at least a good commit (can specify many good commits though to further narrow down the search). It then keeps <strong><span title="Click to find out more">bisecting</span></strong> the commits between the specified bad and good commits until it finds the first commit in the commit history that caused the <span title="Click to find out more">deviation</span>.</p><p>The <code>git bisect</code> command can run in either manual (interactive) mode or in a fully automated mode. Before each iteration, bisect needs to know whether the given commit is a bad commit or a good commit.</p><div>

    <div>

      
      <p><time datetime="2020-06-27 00:00:00 +0000">27 Jun 2020</time></p><p>Having your application produce the right amount and quality of logs will help you debug faster, optimize better and keep your data safe and secure. I was always fascinated with logging and tried to figure out the best ways to log and create telemetry for my applications.</p>

<p>Having the opportunity to work with multiple startups, I came into close contact with all of Node.js’ major logging packages. Lately, I had the luck to work with highly security aware businesses, for whom security is an existential threat. When tasked with the challenge of creating secure applications for them, I knew without hesitation that I had to create a new library to meet all the new requirements that were at play.</p>

<p>I want to introduce you to <a href="https://github.com/thanpolas/logality">Logality</a>, a versatile and powerful logger for Node.js.</p>

<p><img src="https://thanpol.as/assets/blogimg/planning.jpg" alt="Logging Flow"></p>

<h2 id="the-logging-requirements">The Logging Requirements</h2>

<p>These are the logging requirements that were on the drawing board when Logality was first implemented. I could find some of them in some packages, but not all of them in one package:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#a-common-logging-schema"><strong>Complete Flexibility on Properties</strong></a>. In order for my organization to have a common logging schema, it is required of the logging library to allow the definition of properties from scratch. A lot of the packages make those decisions for you leaving you with no options to normalize the logging schema. The most common example for this is the date field, you can find it as <code>dt</code>, <code>date</code>, <code>timestamp</code> or any other variance, without any option to change the name.</li>
  <li><a href="#serializers-of-data-objects"><strong>Serializers of Data Objects</strong></a>. As <a href="https://github.com/thanpolas/logality">Logality</a> is primarily a JSON logger, dealing with data is the most common operation. Being able to serialize known data structures is key in this case. Just drop your user data object to logality and the built-in or your custom serializer will make sure to transform the object so only what you want will be logged.</li>
  <li><a href="#custom-output-and-pretty-print"><strong>Support Custom Outputs</strong></a>. Logality’s Default output is JSON but the library should not limit you as to the kind of output you want, for instance print human readable logs while on development. Custom outputs also allow you to filter log messages so you can suppress dynamically certain types or log levels of messages.</li>
  <li><a href="#logging-metadata"><strong>Logging Metadata</strong></a>. Have the logger automatically log the location of the file that the log originated from. As well as other useful system information (OS version, runtime info, etc).</li>
  <li><a href="#the-power-of-middleware"><strong>Middleware Support</strong></a>. Supporting middleware is a very powerful way to transform and augment each one of your log messages. The options that this feature opens up are endless.</li>
  <li><a href="#linking-multiple-logality-instances"><strong>Logging for Libraries</strong></a>. All open source contributors must have faced this challenge at least once: How do I output logs from my library? This is no easy task, Logality provides an eloquent and powerful solution to this problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>With these requirements in place, <a href="https://github.com/thanpolas/logality">Logality</a> was created on May 18, 2018. Ever since then the library has been iteratively improving and bug fixed. Today, the current Version is 3.0.0, which was released on April of 2020. In the following sections, we will go through a more detailed analysis of the features and powerful capabilities of Logality.</p>

<h2 id="a-common-logging-schema">A Common Logging Schema</h2>

<p>The more standardized your log messages are, the easier it will be to query, parse and subsequently analyze them. Consequently, your log messages need to have a schema. As we all know, the most ubiquitous format for text based serialization today, is JSON.</p>

<p>Logality is a JSON logger that provides an initial recommendation of a logging schema but allows you to define your own schemas down to the last property.</p>

<p>This is a very important feature. When you are trying to have a common logging schema across multiple operating systems, platforms and programming languages, it is essential that your tooling allows you to be flexible and versatile.</p>

<p>Schema mutation in Logality happens through <a href="#the-power-of-middleware">Middleware</a> and <a href="#serializers-of-data-objects">Serializers</a>, both of which we touch on below.</p>



<p>Logality will take care of all your metadata needs so you won’t need to log any additional information. In particular, Logality will automatically resolve and log for you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The location of the file where the log originated from.</li>
  <li>The hostname of the machine that runs the application.</li>
  <li>The process id.</li>
  <li>The process name.</li>
</ul>

<p>A simple <code>log.info('hello world')</code> log will produce the following log message (expanded):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"severity"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>6</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"level"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"info"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"dt"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2018-05-18T16:25:57.815Z"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"message"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"hello world"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"event"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{},</span><span>

</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>With the use of <a href="#the-power-of-middleware">Middleware</a> you can create and attach your own metadata on each one of your log messages.</p>

<h2 id="serializers-of-data-objects">Serializers of Data Objects</h2>

<p>As standardization of logging data is a primary requirement for Logality, serializers were introduced to solve the problem of consistently logging known data objects.</p>

<p>Let’s take for example the User Data Object (UDO) and the action of logging in, you could log the event as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>log</span><span>.</span><span>info</span><span>(</span><span>`User </span><span>${</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>email</span><span>}</span><span> logged in`</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But that is not a JSON log message, that is a string log message and it is not easily query-able. Let’s try this again with Logality’s JSON logging feature:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>log</span><span>.</span><span>info</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>User logged in</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>user</span><span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we passed the UDO to logality, however, Logality has no instruction of what portions of the UDO we want logged and here is where serializers come in. Serializers are simple functions that take the objects that you pass as input and output the properties that you want to have logged.</p>

<p>This way, you standardize how your models are logged across your infrastructure and protect your system from logging sensitive fields like a user’s password or unnecessary information like meta data of a product.</p>

<h2 id="the-power-of-middleware">The Power of Middleware</h2>

<p>Logality introduces middleware which allows you to manipulate and mutate the logging messages as you see fit:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>logality</span><span>.</span><span>use</span><span>((</span><span>context</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Remove user data object from logging</span>
    <span>delete</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>user</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// Add debugging flag on all messages</span>
    <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>debug</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With Middleware, you can create powerful data flows, augmenting log messages as they come in with rich metadata information collected from the environment and runtime.</p>

<p>You can also have conditional transformations of the data that pass through logality for absolute control over the data flows and your compliance requirements.</p>

<h2 id="linking-multiple-logality-instances">Linking Multiple Logality Instances</h2>

<p>As an open source contributor, one of the biggest problems I have been challenged with is how to log on open source libraries. If you want to have logging on your library you are challenged with quite a few problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide an option to turn off logging.</li>
  <li>Provide a way to filter the logging level.</li>
  <li>How do you format the logs according to your downstream application’s standards?</li>
  <li>Should you log to stdout, an event or a function?</li>
</ul>

<p>These are very challenging problems, to the point where no practical solution exists. Until today that is, as Logality introduces piping. You can pipe one Logality instance into another and have all the middleware functions handle the piped logality’s log messages. When Logality is piped, the log messages get passed as pure data objects so that the downstream consuming function can properly parse and manipulate them.</p>

<p>This is huge as it enables your application to granularly control how much information is logged from the libraries you are using. And at the same time have your third-party libraries log in the exact same format-schema that your entire infrastructure is logging. Isn’t that great?</p>

<p>Piping happens simply by providing the child Logality instance to the parent’s <code>pipe()</code> method:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>thirdPartyLibrary</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>thirdparty</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

<span>/* ... */</span>

<span>applicationLogality</span><span>.</span><span>pipe</span><span>(</span><span>thirdPartyLibrary</span><span>.</span><span>logality</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="custom-output-and-pretty-print">Custom Output and Pretty Print</h2>

<p>Finally, after all the processing the log message has gone through, you can control how the final serialization and output is handled. By default Logality will JSON serialize and output to stdout but you may have other plans.</p>

<p>This operation also enables you to filter certain log messages based on your custom criteria. This is particularly useful when managing multiple log streams from various upstreams (third-party libraries) that are piping their logs to your main application Logality logger.</p>

<p>Logality also offers a built-in pretty print functionality that, as the word suggests, will print the log messages in a human readable format, with nice colors, emojis and all. This is particularly useful when you are developing the application and don’t want to see JSON serialized log messages.</p>

<h3 id="outline-of-logalitys-lifecycle-and-piping">Outline of Logality’s Lifecycle and Piping</h3>

<p><img src="https://thanpol.as/assets/blogimg/logality-lifecycle-outline.svg" alt="Logality Lifecycle Outline"></p>

<h2 id="synchronous-or-asynchronous">Synchronous or Asynchronous?</h2>

<p>With a flick of a switch you can have Logality become asynchronous and reveal its Promise API. When in async mode, Logality’s Middleware and Custom Output functions will be able to handle a promise and allow you to capture log messages en-route.</p>

<p>Say you want to push all log messages to a queue, or for any reason, you want to store some, or all, of the log messages into your database. By enabling async mode on Logality you can easily and safely perform those tasks:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Security middleware for logality, store the log message</span>
<span>// in our database as well and send it to our queue for</span>
<span>// further processing and alerting</span>
<span>logality</span><span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span><span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>context</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>context</span><span>.</span><span>security</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>await</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>store</span><span>(</span><span>context</span><span>);</span>
        <span>await</span> <span>queue</span><span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span><span>context</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>});</span>

<span>/* ... */</span>

<span>// login failed, log it</span>
<span>await</span> <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>warn</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Login Failed</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>security</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you rightfully observed, when async mode is enabled Logality’s logging is, well, async, and thus returns a promise that needs to be resolved. Therefore, that is why you see the <code>await</code> before the <code>log.warn()</code> invocation.</p>

<p>Personally, my use case for using async mode and secondary data stores <a href="https://srop.co/" title="SROP The Secure Drop">at SROP</a> was for auditing log trails. When an audit log event occurred, …</p></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		    
<p>Before moving to the suburbs, I had been living in NYC for 12+ years, so my skills with a set of tools aren’t extensive. There are lots of problems I could <em>eventually</em> fix with significant time and money invested into projects, as I do like my projects to tinker with, but I don’t have infinite resources to do all the things. That’s why I’ve got a handyman I call up, as everyone should.</p>



<p>My handyman is Roger, a now semi-retired civil engineer and MIT grad. His visits entwine a blessing of knowledge around an otherwise potentially disastrous event – roof tiles flying off, an oven subtly leaking gas, or what has become an annual occurrence where some form of plumbing threatens to flood my house. I take a crack at it and when my pridefulness is eclipsed by the existential threat of my living space facing certain doom, I give him a call.</p>



<p>“And you’d think this would all be standardized, but it’s not! It’s like cmon, why can’t you just get this all straight!?” he laughs as he rips apart my sink. He pulls out a pair of pump pliers and sets to work as another faucet piece pops off. I solemnly nod, taking in how to deconstruct/reconstruct the bathroom should the need arise again. It will, naturally. My house seems to break down every other week.</p>



<p>His approach to home repair tickles those same parts of my brain as does software engineering. A lack of standardization? I get that. He remarks how houses don’t come with an owner’s manual. Wouldn’t it be nice if companies did too. Shouldn’t I know <em>everything</em> about the place? I live here, after all. Yet here I am, the resident (if you can excuse the pun) expert, deferring to his expertise.</p>



<p>“Just make sure you cover the drain when taking out the screws. You know how I know to do that? Because I’ve dropped them down there enough times”. He knows how to approach problems because, as he says, he’s seen the same six or eight versions of it before. He hasn’t honed his skills on work perfectly crafted from the start, but from seeing the gaps evolve from imperfect planning. Remarking on sealing the corners of the tub, he notes the walls shifting as joints meet and separate through varying temperature changes. A seemingly static house itself is constantly in flux, much like our working environments.</p>



<p>Then he stands up straight and waves at me a hereto unknown part of my sink. “You know what this is?” I naturally answer in the negative. “Neither do I. Time to go see my guy at the plumbing store. <em>He’s</em> the guy who’s seen everything and done everything, the XK-587 or whatever here. Doesn’t matter what I bring in, he knows exactly what to do.”</p>



<p>My expert has <em>his own expert</em> when he doesn’t know something. The guy who’s “seen and done it all” still has someone he rings up, because that’s what experts do, sourcing from upstream and relaying that information back down to another node on the graph. If I’m lucky, I’ll retain enough information to use or maybe even pass along to someone else.</p>



<p>Which brings us back to software engineering. We’re always so surprised when the expert manages to jump to the right config, flip a switch, and set the machine back in order. We assume it’s innate talent, some magic imbued that resides only within them and goes no further. I’m deeply appreciative of expertise, but we hold too many folks up on pedestals, when in truth they have their own gurus who they rely upon. They remember their screws dropped down the drain and ask their authority in plumbing, combined into charting a best path forward.</p>



<p>A few thoughts and questions arise from all of this:</p>



<ul><li>How do we go about observing the near infinite number of changes around us, filtering down to what we’ll need “someday”?</li><li>If experts have their own experts, we as professionals need to develop a system of interconnected people capable of adapting to the unknown failures we experience in both a local and global focus. Machines need people and people need people.</li><li>That interconnected network then, in its collaboration, needs to have self awareness of what skills need to be honed and how we go about distributing that skill. The shared knowledge isn’t just how to fix but meta information about that ability.</li><li>We talk often of avoiding as many failures as we can, but which are the failures we’re ok with <em>and how are we seeking them out?</em> Put another way, we need to experience a few screws dropped down the drain to learn but developing an understanding of which pain points we can reasonably withstand takes experience as well.</li><li>Where does the balance lie in letting our non-experts take over to return the system to a stable state, potentially educating the next batch of specialists? We emphasize the importance of learning from incidents as experiences after the fact, but generally regard the chance to educate during an incident as “too costly”.</li><li>How are we making continual efforts to prepare for these failures – to be ready to resolve them, to retain information during, and perhaps most importantly pass that information along afterwards? Relying solely upon experts with no additional knowledge sharing is itself a brittleness that exists within a system.</li></ul>



<p>Eventually, Roger returns from talking with his expert and immediately passes to me a replacement part. Sure enough, the gears inside don’t show the same wear and tear. My bathroom is still in pieces, but they’re all there and I’ve seen enough to finish up. “Until next time!” he knowingly laughs. Because of course there will be another disaster. Here’s hoping I’ll be a little more prepared for it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Cross-compiling self-contained Java desktop application launchers.</p><h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2><p>Java’s promise of <em>write once, run anywhere</em> still resonates with me, perhaps because I cut my teeth on JDK 1.0.2b. It was amazing to write cross-platform networking applications without concern for variations in POSIX implementations, or having to worry about nuances between C compilers, or even needing to grok <code>htons</code>. Someone else could wrestle with <code>#ifdef</code>s, shielding others by high-level, standard abstractions. Although Smalltalk had concocted platform-independence punch in 1983, it wasn’t until 1996 that Java’s virtual machine (VM) and subsequent OEM distributions made drinking the mantra of cross-platform development an easy reality.</p><p>Strategically—and selfishly—Microsoft smote that future with a sledgehammer: it moved to <em>embrace and extend</em> Java to achieve vendor lock-in, splintering the platform.</p><p>Developers can no longer rely on systems having a Java VM available. This implies that end-users must download (and install) two independent programs: a suitable VM and a Java archive. It also means that developers now have choices ahead of them that were once bygone worries. Choices that burden end-users and developers alike. Asking people to download a VM for their operating system and CPU architecture is a barrier to product adoption. What’s worse is that some VMs now support “full” Java while others don’t support JavaFX modules at all.</p><p>We’ll address that last point later.</p><p>In late 2019, <a href="https://github.com/kevinrushforth">Kevin Rushforth</a>, of Oracle’s Java Team, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZGW9AalZLN4?t=504">presented</a> a solution to the packaging problem: <code>jpackage</code> and <code>jlink</code>. During the presentation he listed some of the tooling’s shortcomings, which include:</p><ul><li>No cross-platform deployment</li><li>No cross-compilation (must run on MacOS to produce <code>.dmg</code>)</li></ul><p>Let’s not mince words: Java developers could once build applications on their preferred operating system and deploy anywhere; now, they must build installers for every individual platform they intend to target on those very systems.</p><p>Was that the <em>punch-line</em> to a two-decade lead up?</p><p>Requiring developers to have at least two commercial operating systems (Windows, MacOS X), even if emulated inside of a virtualized container—as opposed to using physical hardware—for a platform-independent programming language is an ironic barrier to entry. <em>Especially</em> for people bereft of bankroll.</p><p>Yes, those tools—alongside modules—help produce minimal executables. Who cares? What they don’t do is make it possible to create a set of native, standalone launcher binaries from a single build machine. Let’s fix that by pouring over the big splashes of how to cross-compile application launchers for Java on one build machine. We’ll use Linux because it’s free.</p><h2 id="software-requirements">Software Requirements</h2><p>You will need:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/dgiagio/warp">Warp Packer</a>, a tool for building native application launchers</li><li><a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, a source code management tool</li><li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">wget</a>, a tool for fetching files</li><li><a href="https://gradle.org/">gradle</a> version 6.4.1, a build system</li><li><a href="https://dave.autonoma.ca/blog/2020/06/29/write-once-build-anywhere/build-template">build-template</a>, my own starter shell script (MIT licensed)</li></ul><p>Install <code>git</code> and <code>wget</code> using the package manager for your Linux distro.</p><h3 id="install-warp-packer">Install Warp Packer</h3><p>The installation instructions for Warp Packer are a bit buried. Install the software on a Linux system as follows (change the version number to suit):</p><pre><code>mkdir -p $HOME/bin
cd $HOME/bin
wget -O warp-packer \
  https://github.com/dgiagio/warp/releases/download/v0.3.0/linux-x64.warp-packer
chmod +x warp-packer</code></pre><p>If needed, include <code>$HOME/bin</code> in the <code>PATH</code> environment variable by adding the following line to <code>$HOME/.bashrc</code>:</p><pre><code>export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/bin"</code></pre><p>Apply the new environment settings by opening a new terminal or <code>source</code>’ing the <code>.bashrc</code> file directly.</p><p>Warp Packer is installed.</p><h3 id="install-build-template">Install Build Template</h3><p>Copy, move, or download <code>build-template</code> into <code>$HOME/bin</code>.</p><p>The build template is installed.</p><h2 id="javafx">JavaFX</h2><p>Before we get into building a Java application, a little more history is warranted. Originally, the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) came bundled with Java, for the same reasons that having a bundled networking API was useful. The AWT lacked aesthetic, both in appearance and as a library. Swing, the AWT’s successor, made strides to address both, but fell short. JavaFX, which was also initially bundled with Java (versions 8 to 10), is a modern graphical user interface (GUI) library for developing desktop applications, as well as a superb replacement for Swing.</p><p>It has been argued that JavaFX should never have been bundled with Java. Nevertheless, the decision to un-bundle JavaFX from Java 11 onwards has led to Java projects that will be stuck with old Java versions for years to come—possibly leading to their abandonment—because it takes <em>a lot</em> of effort to migrate a build process to support these new, un-bundled Java Development Kits (JDKs).</p><p>Part of that effort entails re-bundling JavaFX. There are a few ways this can be accomplished:</p><ul><li>Create a single <em><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/11947093/59087">überjar</a></em> that contains native libraries for all intended platform targets.</li><li>Create separate <em>überjars</em>, with each JAR containing native libraries specific to its target platform.</li></ul><p>It’s almost a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobson%27s_choice">Hobson’s choice</a> because we have to create launcher binaries for each target platform anyway. Meaning bundling all of the target platform libraries into each native launcher is wasteful; however, bundling them in a single JAR file for those who have a Java VM installed already may be somewhat useful.</p><p>Java has introduced the concept of modules, looking to simplify the build process. Sometimes, though, modules cannot be included because of outdated dependencies. Problems can arise when running <code>jlink</code> against old dependencies. Compounding the issue is when the projects have been sundowned or have long release schedules. Nevertheless, for our purposes, we’ll want to download a version of OpenJDK that supports JavaFX.</p><p>With that background in mind, let’s go cross-compile some binaries.</p><h2 id="java-application">Java Application</h2><p>We’ll create native application launchers for <a href="https://github.com/DaveJarvis/scrivenvar/">Scrivenvar</a>, a JavaFX-based text editor that I’ve been developing.</p><p>Dive in by cloning the latest version as follows:</p><pre><code>mkdir -p $HOME/dev
cd $HOME/dev
git clone https://github.com/DaveJarvis/scrivenvar.git
cd scrivenvar</code></pre><p>The application is downloaded.</p><h2 id="build-scripts">Build Scripts</h2><p>Let’s review the scripts that help build the application, which include:</p><ul><li><code>build.gradle</code> — builds application Java Archive (JAR) files</li><li><code>installer</code> — builds native, standalone binaries</li></ul><p>Separating the <code>installer</code> script’s responsibilities from <code>build.gradle</code> is not necessary, technically. When running third-party executables (e.g., <code>warp-packer</code>), my first inclination is to use a shell script, rather than gradle’s <code>exec</code>.</p><p>The <code>installer</code> script invokes <code>gradle</code> when requested.</p><h2 id="gradle-script">Gradle Script</h2><p>Open up <code>build.gradle</code> to review a few pertinent code blocks.</p><h3 id="target-operating-system">Target Operating System</h3><p>The first snippet determines what native JavaFX libraries (i.e., target platform code) to include within the JAR file:</p><pre><code>String[] os = ["win", "mac", "linux"]

if (project.hasProperty('targetOs')) {
  if ("windows".equals(targetOs)) {
    os = ["win"]
  }
  else {
    os = [targetOs]
  }
}</code></pre><p>Unless instructed otherwise, the build script will create a JAR file that includes JavaFX binaries for Windows, Linux, and MacOS embedded. We can target a specific platform by using the <code>-P</code> command line option when building, such as:</p><pre><code>gradle clean build jar -PtargetOs=linux</code></pre><p>There’s a catch here in that <code>win</code> and <code>windows</code> are different names. The <code>installer</code> script needs to use <code>windows</code> because that’s part of the JDK file name being downloaded. Arguably, we could move that logic into the <code>installer</code> script, but the point is that the JDK filename and JavaFX refer to Windows using different terminology. The difference must be captured somwhere.</p><h3 id="javafx-dependencies">JavaFX Dependencies</h3><p>The second snippet tells the build system to include JavaFX for a given set of operating systems, as follows:</p><pre><code>def fx = ['controls', 'graphics', 'fxml', 'swing']

fx.each { fxitem -&gt;
  os.each { ositem -&gt;
    runtimeOnly "org.openjfx:javafx-${fxitem}:${javafx.version}:${ositem}"
  }
}</code></pre><p>The application uses JavaFX controls, graphics, fxml, and notice that it also lists a JavaFX-Swing integration. Using <code>.each</code> is a tidy way of not having to maintain a list of JavaFX-specific imports for each operating system, should either or both need to change.</p><h3 id="javafx-exclusions">JavaFX Exclusions</h3><p>Of lesser importance are exclude groups:</p><pre><code>implementation('de.jensd:fontawesomefx-fontawesome:4.7.0-11') {
  exclude group: 'org.openjfx'
}</code></pre><p>Without excluding JavaFX from certain JavaFX-related dependencies, the build will fail. Unfortunately, the build fails in such a way that the developer must investigate what package caused the conflict. Ideally, the build failure would pinpoint any collisions for the developer.</p><h3 id="run-application">Run Application</h3><p>The last point of note are the following lines:</p><pre><code>applicationDefaultJvmArgs = [
    "--add-opens=javafx.controls/javafx.scene.control=ALL-UNNAMED",
    "--add-opens=javafx.controls/javafx.scene.control.skin=ALL-UNNAMED",
    "--add-opens=javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.css=ALL-UNNAMED",
]</code></pre><p>These lines address permissions issues encountered when running the application using gradle, such as:</p><pre><code>gradle clean build run</code></pre><p>Now that we understand how this build script works, let’s move on to the <code>installer</code> shell script.</p><h2 id="installer-script">Installer Script</h2><p>Looking at the big picture, the <code>installer</code> script performs the following steps to create a native launcher binary:</p><ol type="1"><li>Configure platform-specific parameters for extraction.</li><li>Rebuild the <em>überjar</em> for the target platform.</li><li>Clean out the distribution directory for a fresh build.</li><li>Extract the target JDK into the distribution directory.</li><li>Create a platform-dependent launch script to run the application.</li><li>Copy the <em>überjar</em> into the distribution directory.</li><li>Wrap the distribution into a standalone binary.</li></ol><p>These high-level steps can be found in the <code>execute()</code> function.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look at how the script works.</p><h3 id="build-template">Build Template</h3><p>The <code>build-template</code> script is described in depth in the first three parts of my Typesetting Markdown series. We reuse the script here because it simplifies writing user-friendly shell scripts.</p><p>Downloading and extracting a requisite JDK is pivotal. JDKs can be downloaded from a few places, but most of them have …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">  <p>When casting from YouTube to a Chromecast, sometimes the audio playback will <a href="https://support.google.com/chromecast/thread/13807879?hl=en">skip</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/17251626?hl=en">stutter</a>. This issue is independent of the quality of the video, the FPS, or the internet connection. Trying to watch certain videos will reliably cause playback issues on the Chromecast.</p> <p>According to <a href="https://support.google.com/chromecast/thread/13807879">this thread</a>, the playback issue only appeared in the latest and final firmware update for the Chromecast. Successful playback of the videos was possible in the past, and casting the downloaded YouTube videos eliminates the problem entirely. The problem exists solely when casting certain videos using the YouTube app.</p>  <p>Given that the problem only occurs with the YouTube app, you can download a video and cast it via <a href="https://github.com/xat/castnow"><code>castnow</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/skorokithakis/catt"><code>catt</code></a>, skipping the YouTube app entirely.</p> <p>You could do something like:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>

<span>export </span><span>url</span><span>=</span><span>"https://youtu.be/Kas0tIxDvrg"</span>

<span>function </span>cast<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>url</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>
    
    <span>filename</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>youtube-dl <span>--get-filename</span> <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    youtube-dl <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span>
    
    <span># wait a bit to download the file</span>
    castnow <span>"</span><span>$filename</span><span>"</span>
    <span>rm</span> <span>"</span><span>$filename</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>

cast <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>But having to skip using the YouTube app to cast is already a clunky solution, and downloading every video before playing them is an even worse user experience. Instant playback and ephemeral streams are what make for a pleasant video streaming experience in 2020, and this solution implements neither of them</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md">Since <code>youtube-dl</code> allows us to output to <code>stdout</code></a>, if we can hook its <code>stdout</code> to a casting app, we could emulate the instant playback and ephemeral videos we expect because we don’t have to wait for an entire file to download.</p> <p>Unfortunately, <code>castnow</code> and <code>catt</code> won’t cast from <code>stdin</code>. You’re expected to pass it file locations to cast from.</p> <p>This is where one of my favorite shell features really shines: <a href="https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/process-sub.html">process substitution</a>.</p> <p>With process substitution, Bash gives us a convenient way to make ephemeral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_pipe">anonymous pipes</a>. This method is both efficient and concurrent, making this primitive an apt choice to build a solution to the problem at hand. A process reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)">pipe</a> blocks until the pipe is opened by another process for writing. A process writing to the pipe will suspend until the pipe’s buffer is read by another process. The anonymous pipe will automatically remove itself, and when it is manually removed, its dependent processes will be terminated.</p> <p>When using process substitution, a process’ <code>stdout</code> is hooked up to an anonymous pipe. That pipe can be accessed from a file descriptor, and the location of the pipe is given to the calling process.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> &lt;<span>(</span><span>echo</span> <span>"Content sent to pipe"</span><span>)</span>
/dev/fd/63

<span>$ </span><span>cat</span> &lt;<span>(</span><span>echo</span> <span>"Content sent to pipe"</span><span>)</span>
Content sent to pipe
</code></pre></div></div> <p>In the example above, the <code>&lt;(command)</code> syntax is how we invoke process substitution in Bash. The output of <code>command</code> is written to an anonymous pipe, and the calling process is given the location of the file descriptor to access that pipe.</p> <p>Using that example, we can take advantage of process substitution:</p> <div><div><pre><code>vlc &lt;<span>(</span>youtube-dl <span>-q</span> <span>-o</span> - <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The command above will play the YouTube video locally with <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html">VLC</a>, and illustrates that process substitution can work for our use case.</p> <p>However, when we try to use <code>castnow</code>, we can’t cast from the pipe:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>castnow &lt;<span>(</span>youtube-dl <span>-q</span> <span>-o</span> - <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
Error: Load failed
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Nor can we cast with <code>catt</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>catt cast &lt;<span>(</span>youtube-dl <span>-q</span> <span>-o</span> - <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
Error: The chosen file does not exist.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We know we can use VLC locally, and VLC also lets you cast to a Chromecast using its IP address.</p> <p>Let’s try that again using VLC:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>function </span>cast_vlc<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>path</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>

    <span># get the ip address for chromecast.lan host</span>
    <span>ip</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>dig +short chromecast.lan | <span>tail</span> <span>-n</span> 1<span>)</span>

    vlc <span>-I</span> ncurses <span>\</span>
      <span>--sout</span> <span>'#chromecast'</span> <span>\</span>
      <span>--sout-chromecast-ip</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$ip</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
      <span>--demux-filter</span><span>=</span>demux_chromecast <span>\</span>
      <span>"</span><span>$path</span><span>"</span> &lt; /dev/tty
<span>}</span>

cast_vlc &lt;<span>(</span>youtube-dl <span>-q</span> <span>-o</span> - <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>That works.</p> <p>As an aside, we hook VLC’s <code>stdin</code> to <code>/dev/tty</code> so that we can use the ncurses interface even if we invoke the function from a script.</p> <p>Let’s look at the <a href="https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Modules/ncurses/">ncurses interface</a>.</p> <div> <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d0822203c304db88f3cbec618e94a3d9f55cd269/c5939/assets/imgs/converted/vlc-fs8.webp" loading="lazy"> </p> </div> <p>It only displays the file descriptor, and very little about the video itself. I’m not a fan of that.</p>  <p>Instead of using anonymous pipes, we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_pipe">named pipes</a>. Named pipes are like anonymous pipes, except they are not anonymous (they have a name) nor are they ephemeral. Named pipes still give us the efficiency and concurrency benefits that anonymous pipes give us, but Bash lacks the syntactic sugar it has for process substitution when it comes to named pipes.</p> <p>This is how we create named pipes, write to them, read from them and remove them.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>mkfifo </span>ourpipe
<span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"Content in pipe"</span> <span>&gt;</span> ourpipe &amp;
<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>ourpipe
Content <span>in </span>pipe
<span>$ </span><span>rm </span>ourpipe
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Not as pretty as <code>&lt;(command)</code>, but it gets the job done.</p> <p>We can give a named pipe the same name as our YouTube video, and that way, the VLC interface will show the name of what we’re watching.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>function </span>cast_ytdl<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>url</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>

  <span># create a temporary named pipe</span>
  <span># why? because vlc will show the file descriptor path if we just use process substitution</span>
  <span>filename</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>youtube-dl <span>--get-filename</span> <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>path</span><span>=</span><span>"/tmp/</span><span>$filename</span><span>"</span>
  <span>mkfifo</span> <span>"</span><span>$path</span><span>"</span>

  <span># download in background, push to named pipe</span>
  youtube-dl <span>-q</span> <span>-o</span> - <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>"</span><span>$path</span><span>"</span> &amp;
  <span>pid</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$!</span><span>"</span>

  <span># cleanup process and named pipe</span>
  <span>kill</span> <span>-9</span> <span>"</span><span>$pid</span><span>"</span> &amp;&gt; /dev/null
<span>}</span>

cast_ytdl <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This works, too.</p> <p>We need to manually create a named pipe with <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/mkfifo"><code>mkfifo</code></a>, redirect <code>youtube-dl</code>’s <code>stdout</code> to the named pipe while running the process in the background, and then cleanup the process after casting from it via VLC, otherwise it might linger in the background. Each of those tasks would have been handled for us automatically using process substitution.</p> <p>But it does look a bit better:</p> <div> <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/25d68fb2085191adb26bb931e9bb31c638e5a634/f664c/assets/imgs/converted/vlc3-fs8.webp" loading="lazy"> </p> </div>  <p>Pipes, anonymous pipes and named pipes are also known by another name because of the way they behave: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)#Pipes">FIFOs</a>, or <strong>f</strong>irst <strong>i</strong>n, <strong>f</strong>irst <strong>o</strong>ut. What’s written to the pipe is read from the pipe in first in, first out order. This behavior maps well to video streaming.</p> <p>While you can interact with anonymous and named pipes like you would a file, the interface isn’t 1:1 with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_file_types#Regular_file">standard file</a>. You cannot <code>seek()</code> forward or backward in pipe, you can just read the next forward values. For our use case, that means we cannot skip forward or backward in our streaming videos. We can only play, pause or stop the video.</p> <p>That’s not a problem for me, however it’s something that can be mitigated if it’s a problem for you. The first solution I can think of would be to write to a temporary file via <code>youtube-dl</code> and read from it. Or <a href="https://alexdelorenzo.dev/programming/2019/04/14/buffer">perhaps a temporary spooled file can act as a buffer for the pipe</a>, such that you can <code>seek()</code> through the buffer, but the buffer itself is ephemeral unlike a normal file.</p> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-537">
				<!-- .entry-header -->

				<div>
			<p>I belong to a group of faculty and staff who’ve historically met over lunch to discuss teaching and technology. Last week, after three months of meeting on Zoom, we decided to meet in person in a classroom on campus to see what it’s like.<span id="more-537"></span></p>
<p>Four of us met in a third-floor classroom measuring 28’x24′ with a nominal capacity of 28 students. We all wore masks, and at my husband’s suggestion I brought the Stick of Social Distancing (marked at 6′ and 2m).</p>
<p>First I reflect on “the good, the bad, and the ugly,” which I’ve interpreted as what went well (or better than expected), what practical or pedagogical problems arose, and where we had difficulty following safety guidelines. Then I share some recommendations based on these observations. Finally, I conclude with a photo essay documenting our experiment.</p>
<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We were able to arrange the desks to implement the official adjusted room capacity of 15 students plus the instructor. I assumed that would mean staggered rows of desks facing forward, but it also worked to put 12 seats around the edge of the room and 4 in the middle, which were far enough apart to face either in (for a fishbowl discussion) or out (for small group discussions).</li>
<li>We had no problems hearing each each other – although we never did try to have two pairwise conversations in parallel.</li>
<li>We felt more comfortable wearing masks after 75 minutes than we thought we would.</li>
<li>It was nice to spend some time in the physical presence of a few of my closest colleagues. I didn’t feel the anxiety during this experiment that I thought I might.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Arriving at the classroom was uncomfortable. After walking up two flights of stairs, our masks were quite moist and sticky.</li>
<li>While there is space for 15 students plus the instructor, there is no space for the instructor to move in the discussion configuration. Perhaps the instructor would be able to use the chalkboard if the desks were in rows facing forward. We didn’t test that.</li>
<li>With 4 groups of 4 students, there is nowhere in the classroom for the instructor to be at all.</li>
<li>Three desks were in pretty uncomfortable positions – one in the corner right by the door, and two with the instructor’s podium between them so they could not see each other. (It would be very tempting to scoot forward to gain a sightline and end up too close together.)</li>
<li>We found that it took a conscious effort to speak at a normal volume rather than projecting. We worried about losing our voices during a full day of classes and other meetings with students. ETA: I normally teach with a cup of water in my hand. And as Emma reminded me, drinking while wearing a mask requires taking the mask off, so no drinking while teaching.</li>
<li>At the end of our meeting, one colleague said I had talked over her several times. While I pointed out I have always had a bad habit of interrupting when excited, she attributed it to not being able to see each other’s faces under the masks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Ugly</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While we’ve typically had 8-9 folks at Zoom meetings, only 4 made it to this meeting on campus. People had different reasons for not coming. It was just as well for this meeting – Walla Walla County is still in Phase 2, which allows meetings of up to 5 people. But it makes me wonder even more about whether it’s going to be realistic to expect most students to come to an in-person class, especially if they have the option to participate online or substitute other activities.</li>
<li>In particular, one colleague who did not join us reported by email that she may have been exposed to COVID-19 and is self-quarantining.</li>
<li>Navigating the hallways and stairs too and from the classroom was a bit nerve-wracking, even with very few people in the building.</li>
<li>Without the Stick of Social Distancing, we might have spaced some of the desks too closely. As it is, I’m concerned that we measured on-center and not edge-to-edge.</li>
<li>Once our conversation got animated, the four of us easily took up the entire room. We definitely got too close to each other after some of us got out of our seats to use the chalkboard.</li>
<li>One of us had a poorly fitting mask that slipped down her nose over the course of our meeting. This might be the thing that made me the most nervous.</li>
<li>After getting home, I cleaned my book and phone, took a shower, and started a load of laundry. That might have been unnecessary, but I felt a lot better after the shower.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To meet in person, we need one-way signs for halls and stairways, floor marks for safe configurations of classrooms with moveable furniture (maybe different-colored tape for different configurations), and hand sanitizer at the door of every classroom.</li>
<li>To meet in person, we need to trust each others’ masks. Students, faculty, and staff should all be provided with several masks (to allow washing) of a design known to be effective.</li>
<li>Everyone, but especially instructors, may need to arrive to class earlier than usual to have extra time to clean their hands, get in place, and cool down. ETA: We also need scheduled breaks to drink water in a place/situation where we can take our masks off. Those who normally teach with a mug of coffee may need to schedule time for advance caffeination.</li>
<li>Instructors need to think carefully about how our usual active learning techniques will adapt to social distancing,&nbsp;<em>in the particular classrooms we are teaching in</em>. In particular, seating the students may not be enough. If the instructor or the students need space to move around, you need a <em>much</em> bigger classroom or many fewer students.</li>
<li>Collaborative work on paper is not an option when you are 6 feet apart. Students need to use chalkboards, whiteboards, or digital tools such as Google Docs.</li>
<li>In collaborative chalkboard work, each person should keep their own chalk during the session. We need to figure out how to stay distanced while moving – possibly by marking boxes on the floor and instituting rules for taking turns writing on the board.</li>
<li>Similarly, instructors should make explicit rules for requesting, taking, and ceding the floor, e.g., by raising and lowering hands. (A talking stick is not an option, for reasons that should be obvious.)</li>
<li>Instructors need to have plans for accommodating unplanned absences due to self-quarantine. While we always have unplanned absences due to illness and personal emergencies, there are going to be a lot more than usual due to requirements to get tested and/or self-quarantine for suspected exposure as well as symptoms. Moreover, vulnerable students who have chosen to return to campus may be <em>much</em> more cautious about attending class while they are feeling ill or during an outbreak. (It goes without saying that we also need plans to move our classes entirely online, even if they start in person.)</li>
<li>Like health care workers, instructors may want to institute a sanitary protocol for returning home after a day with students, especially if they have vulnerable family members.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://media0.giphy.com/media/dCcLQ5TLFANMj0p3Uh/giphy.gif" alt="Press F to pay respects"></p>
<p>For a year or so I have owned a nice fake-vintage radio/bluetooth speaker that originally caught my eye for sale in a FedEx office. The front has a quite nice VFD-style LED to show the status, a volume knob and four hard buttons. It has Bluetooth, USB, AUX and FM input. The radio and bluetooth was not bad, but there was nothing to be impressed about. It was definitely not "smart."</p>
<p>I decided to hack it to make it a bit smarter: to do AirPlay and be a smart alarm clock and whatever else I could think of. Since it was inexpensive, I had nothing to lose and everything to win. I thought putting a Raspberry Pi 0 or something in it would be nice.</p>
<p>My original plan was to somehow figure out how to hijack all the external components and control them to make the front and back of the radio as neat-looking as possible. At least I hoped to hijack the speaker, the volume knob, and the buttons. The problem I foresaw was that those components are often not documented and there was little chance that I could get a datasheet for them. I was very worried that I might have to give up the fake-VFD LED screen.</p>
<p>It turns out that I had to spend a year hacking it on and off. Here goes.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/fake-radio-hack/fedex-sale.jpg" alt="FedEx sale"></p>
<p>First, I gutted the radio and saw that it has a main PCB with the LED panel directly soldered to it.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/fake-radio-hack/radio-disassembled.jpg" alt="Disassembled radio"></p>
<p>The chip on the PCB isn't something I recognized. Luckily, the knob and the hard buttons are on a separate breakout board and are connected to the mainboard via a connector.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/fake-radio-hack/main-pcb.jpg" alt="Main PCB"></p>
<h2 id="the-speaker">The speaker</h2>
<p>The speaker is also easy to deal with, as it is completely ordinary. It only required me to desolder it from the mainboard. As the Pi 0 has no built-in soundcard, I had to get a separate sound card for it.</p>
<h3 id="audio-injector-zero">Audio Injector Zero</h3>
<p>Initially, I used the Audio Injector Zero that I have no use for normally. To save space, I decided to permanently sandwich the Audio Injector to the Pi 0. I also had to buy a cheap amp for it, as the sound card can't directly drive the speaker.</p>
<p>One little issue was that the sound card produces stereo input, and the amp is also stereo, but I only have one speaker. I needed to mix both channels left and right to that speaker somehow. To that end, I am sure a Linux guru could make it work with configuring the sound card in software. However, I am not extremely well-versed with how ALSA or Pulse Audio works. I just wired both channels left and right of the amp to one channel input of the amp to mix the channels. For power, the amp needs 5V input, so I siphoned the two power pins from the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>I was surprised when the amp produced a very annoying hum. The hum was extremely noticeable when the Pi is under load. I don't know exactly why this happens, but I spent way too much time on this with no significant improvement. Ultimately, I decided it's the cheap amp that was giving me a hard time, because it was way too noisy. I know the Audio Injector itself was okay because the headphones output was clean.</p>
<h3 id="google-aiy-voice-hat">Google AIY voice hat</h3>
<p>After giving up on the Audio Injector Zero + Amp solution, I tried a different route: Drive the speaker directly with the Google AIY voice bonnet hat. Because the Google AIY sound card doesn't provide an easy way to set up on a plain raspbian, I just got their distro and started from there.</p>
<p>The speaker was hum-free after switching to the Google AIY soundcard. The tradeoff was that the Google Voice Bonnet V2 sound card made the stack quite a bit thicker. It has a female row of pins soldered on it, so I couldn't solder it directly on top of the Pi Zero.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/fake-radio-hack/sound-cards.jpg" alt="Sound cards"></p>

<p>The front panel of the radio has two sets of elements: A knob of some sort to control the volume and four hard buttons. It has four wires hanging out of it. After I inspected the traces on the PCB, it was apparent that there is one common ground. The three other pins are for the buttons and the knob. All of the buttons are connected to a single pin, and the volume knob is connected to the other two.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/fake-radio-hack/buttons-knob.jpg" alt="Buttons and knobs"></p>
<p>As a software person, I didn't know what the knob is called. <a href="http://dbindner.freeshell.org/">Dr. Don Bindner</a> suggested that the button might be a rotary encoder, and that turned out to be true. It seemed <a href="http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Articles/Rotary-encoder-circuit.php">trivial enough to read the knob</a>.</p>
<p>The buttons are more interesting. After poking around with a multimeter, it turned out that the buttons were tactile but each of them is connected in series to a different resistor. Then they all connect out to the same pin. The software in the chip scans the pin and figures out what button was pressed by sampling from an Analog-to-Digital (ADC) Converter reading. As the Pi has no ADC, we need something else that has an ADC to figure out what the button was pressed. Of course, I could as well hijack the tactile buttons and not have to deal with the ADC stuff but that seemed too aesthetically unpleasant for me.</p>
<p>I decided to pull out anArduino Pro Micro clone that I bought from China years ago. My reasoning for using the Pro Micro:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Arduino Pro Micro is super cheap: $2 cheap.</li>
<li>Even if I could add an ADC to the Pi, I need to continuously read the ADC from the Pi. That is a pain in the neck. I can't guarantee the timings on the Pi without going to a lot of care.</li>
<li>The Pro Micro can emulate a keyboard over USB, so the Pi can use triggerhappy to catch it.</li>
</ol>
<p>So with that, I made my arduino sketch and it worked out. I wanted to emulate the Winamp-style buttons ZXCV for multimedia keys and UD for volume up/down. Later on, I was quite annoyed with it because the keyboard dumps the keystrokes to the terminal, and <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/very-odd-bug-found-in-jailbreaking-process-20081109/">it could be bad</a>. I decided to implement the keys as multimedia keys. Unfortunately, you need a HID library to implement multimedia keys. Luckily, there is a library called <a href="https://github.com/NicoHood/HID">HID-Project</a> to achieve exactly what I wanted. After some tweakings for debounce, I could get the volume knob and the buttons to work exactly as I expected:</p>

<p>I could test the Arduino implementation right on my development computer with <code>xev</code> so that was really nice.</p>
<h2 id="the-fake-vfd-led-screen">The fake VFD LED screen</h2>
<p>The screen was the part that I had the most doubt about being able to control, because I have never worked with such a device before. Before trying to reverse-engineer it, I tried to look up similar 7-segment LED screens online hoping to find something similar. Those screens often have more than 8 pins (1 for the ground, 7 for each segment, and some more to select the digit. This one is nothing like that: It has only 7 pins. I wanted to give it up and just buy another screen that has a datasheet to save myself from trouble but I couldn't find anything that would fit into the original cutout for the screen. So I had to bite the bullet and hack the LED screen (I had nothing better to do in the craziness of the pandemic).</p>
<h3 id="general-workings">General workings</h3>
<p>There was no giveaway from the PCB what the ground pin for the display might be. I only had a multimeter in hand so what I did was set it to the diode tester mode. Then I probed pairs of pins to see what lights up. As luck would have it, I found out that each pair of pins lit up a different segment on the screen. So there was no common ground at all! I drew the screen and noted what pin pair light up each segment (excuse my nasty draft paper):</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/fake-radio-hack/matrix-draft.jpg" alt="Draft Matrix"></p>
<p>First, I was really annoyed because the screen is yet another custom device I had to reverse engineer. Then, it really impressed me that this screen is quite well designed for such a cheap device. There were exactly 42 segments on this LED screen! The number of different segments is exactly the maximum number of permutations between any 2 pins: P(7,2) = 42. After some more digging, I found out that this wiring scheme is called <a href="https://hackaday.com/tag/charlieplexing/">Charlieplexing</a>. So each LED segment has a voltage drop of 1.860V, and my Arduino is 5V. I assumed a 20mA current and used a LED calculator and to figure out that I need to connect a 150K resistor to the LED. Because of the charlieplexing setup, I actually need half of that resistance for each pin (it will be apparent as you read on), so I soldered a 68K resistor to each pin.</p>
<h3 id="control-the-led-screen-programmatically">Control the LED screen programmatically</h3>
<p>The question then became how to control this LED screen programmatically. It was clear to me I can't possibly draw every segment by toggling the pins on and off in one whole sweep. Then I realized that I need to think of the LED screen like an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r38nVmxBfvM">analog TV screen</a>. Thus, each of the pins can be thought of as a horizontal scanline – except they are not on the same “line”! This might be quite obvious to those who have dealt with CRTs in the past (which I have not), but it might be hard to imagine for those who grew up with LCDs.</p>
<p>Let's say I want to draw the screen with segment 17, 18, and 11 lit up. That means I have to do two sweeps. First, pull pin 1 to GND and pull pin 2 to V_LED to light up segment 18. Then, pull pin 4 to GND and pull pin 1 and 7 to V_LED to light up segment 17 and 11 at once. Do it fast enough, and my eyes won't be able to tell we are flashing them!</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Perhaps more than any other development, finance was ushered into the
modern era with the development of the <em>Capital Asset Pricing Model</em>
(CAPM) by William Sharpe in the early 60s. Though commonly criticized as
too simple and reductionist, the model is still used today as an easy
way to determine a stock's exposure to the market:</p>



<p>$\beta_i$ was originally formulated as
$\frac{\text{Cov}(r_m,r_i)}{\text{Var}(r_m)}$, but it is more commonly
calculated by taking the slope of a linear regression between the asset
and the market. $r_m$ is the expected market return, $r_f$ is the
expected risk-free rate, and $r_i$ is the expected return of the asset.</p>

<p>Perhaps the model is so popular because the interpretation of $\beta$ is
so concrete and easy to understand: a stock's $\beta$ is simply a
multiplier on the market's return. Stocks with high betas are more
volatile than the market, and those with smaller betas less so. In
tumultuous times, investors try and cut their volatility by rotating
into low beta stocks; while in bull markets, investors clamor to those
with the highest betas.</p>

<p>There's been a problem with CAPM, and indeed, the very concept of beta,
for a long time now: it's called the low beta anomaly. Academics
noticed that there was systematic discrepancies between high and low
beta stocks: it seemed like higher beta stocks were under performing and
low beta stocks were outperforming. Consider the <em>Security Market Line</em>
(SML):</p>

<p><img src="https://cryptm.org/assets/sml.png" alt="Security Market Line"></p>

<p>According to CAPM, the returns of low beta stocks were supposed to
linearly scaled by their beta exposure, likewise with higher beta
stocks. Instead, it was noticed that there was an unexpected curve:</p>

<p><img src="https://cryptm.org/assets/lba.png" alt="Low beta anomaly"></p>

<p>As we can see, high volatility (and thus, high beta) portfolios are
returning significantly less than what is expected, thus throwing a
wrench into the very concept of beta. After seeing the chart, a natural
question is: can we exploit this mispricing while not being exposed to
the market? In this post, we'll look into whether it's possible to
profit off of this effect and also discuss the potential structural and
behavioral reasons for this anomaly.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-approach">A Simple Approach</h2>

<p>Of course, the simplest way to try and capture the excess return of the
anomaly is to construct a portfolio of low beta equities and call it a
day. But what if we don't want to be exposed to the market, even to the
degree that low beta equities are? Like most answers in finance, the
answer is a market neutral long/short portfolio!</p>

<p>For this strategy, we'll be using the Quantopian <em>Q1500US</em> universe,
which consists of the 1500 most liquid US equities on any given day. We
then construct our low beta factor as such:</p>



<p>This will give us large positive values for stocks that have low beta,
and small negative values for those that have high beta. Before we rank
and z-score, in order to calculate the beta for each equity, we find the
slope of a simple linear regression over a 252 day rolling window. We
then use these factor values as the weights of our long/short portfolio.
Let's look at the total long/short return of our simple strategy
between 2003-01-01 and 2020-01-01:</p>

<p><img src="https://cryptm.org/assets/betacum.png" alt="Cumulative return"></p>

<p>Well… this isn't good! Why are we losing money? Does this mean that
the low beta anomaly isn't actually true? Digging into the numbers a
little more, it turns out that the total portfolio beta for this
strategy is actually negative, -38% to be exact. This means that even
though we are market neutral, we have a negative exposure to the market:
when the market goes up, our portfolio loses money, and vice versa.
Since the market goes up most of the time, this isn't a great property
to have. Ideally, we want to have zero beta exposure, not negative
exposure. Let's look at the skew of the distribution of betas over
time:</p>

<p><img src="https://cryptm.org/assets/skew.png" alt="Skew over time"></p>

<p>In order for our market neutral portfolio to have zero beta, we would
need the skew of the betas to be zero, like for a standard normal
distribution. To make this a little more concrete, let's look at a
histogram for a single time period of stock betas:</p>

<p><img src="https://cryptm.org/assets/hist.png" alt="Histogram"></p>

<p>Now, the problem becomes evident: even though we are market neutral, we
end up taking on negative beta exposure because the distribution of the
beta of stocks has a long left-side tail. Almost no stocks actually have
negative beta exposure, while many have high beta exposures! This means
that when longing and shorting in equal proportion, we end up with a
large negative beta since our long positions don't have a low enough
beta in order to cancel out our high beta short positions.</p>

<h2 id="fixing-the-problem">Fixing the Problem</h2>

<p>So, how do we proceed? We need to find some way to adjust the weights of
our portfolio so that we end up with zero beta exposure. Fortunately,
calculating the beta exposure is relatively straightforward. Given a
column vector of weights:</p>



<p>And a vector of beta exposures:</p>



<p>We can easily find the beta of portfolio:</p>



<p>Traditionally, we would solve this equation by using an optimizer with a
constraint that $\beta_p =0$. But because we only have one factor, we
can find an analytical solution. What we want to do is to try and solve
for a $\beta_p$ of zero. To do this, we first need to rewrite the
equation in terms of the weights that are positive (the low beta side)
and those that are negative (the high beta side):</p>





<p>Likewise, we split up the betas as well:</p>





<p>Where:</p>



<p>Now, our equation becomes:</p>



<p>Where the $\alpha$ vectors contain the positive weights and the $\beta$
vectors, the negative weights. We want to scale up the negative weights
(make them larger, though still negative), so we introduce a scaling
factor, $\lambda$, and set $\beta_p=0$:</p>



<p>We now solve for $\lambda$:</p>



<p>Assuming a leverage ratio of one, i.e:</p>



<p>We can calculate the net long exposure, using $\lambda$ as a parameter:</p>



<p>Below is the graph of net long exposure over time:</p>

<p><img src="https://cryptm.org/assets/ne.png" alt="Net long exposure"></p>

<p>And the cumulative return:</p>

<p><img src="https://cryptm.org/assets/betacum2.png" alt="Cumulative return"></p>

<p>Wow, Looks a lot better! Ignoring the Great Recession, the return stream
seems very solid, with limited volatility. Below is a table of some
additional strategy information:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Metric</th>
      <th>Value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Beta</td>
      <td>1.8%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ann. Ret</td>
      <td>4.0%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ann. Vol</td>
      <td>4.6%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ret/Vol</td>
      <td>0.84</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>With a beta of only 1.8%, it's clear that our method for reducing beta
exposure works quite well. Still, it's surprising that a net long
exposure of such magnitude can still be taken with little to no
correlation to the market. Evidently, there is indeed an excess return
associated with low-beta equities, and quite a large one, at that.</p>

<h2 id="explanation">Explanation</h2>

<p>Many academics have tried to explain the structural and behavioral
reasons for the low beta anomaly. The most common explanation put forth
is that due to leverage constraints and borrowing costs, investors seek
out high beta securities in order to achieve a higher natural return. If
high leverage ratios were available to all investors, one might expect
that this mispricing of high beta stocks might go away, as the beta of
any given stock would become less important.</p>

<p>Another possible explanation is that the conflict of interest between
money managers and clients creates an incentive for fund managers to
take excess risk through high beta equities. In good times, managers
collect a performance fee and a management fee while in bad times, only
a management fee. This asymmetric payoff incentives managers to try and
score a big "win," while limited liability prevents managers from ever
losing money on losses.</p>

<p>A third explanation is that high volatility (and thus high beta) stocks
receive more attention from the financial community as they are simply
more interesting to discuss. This interest and attention encourages
increased buying, thus pushing down the expected return of said stocks.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this post we have shown that there is indeed a significant abnormal
return associated with low beta stocks. This abnormal return can not
only be captured with a long only (and beta exposed) portfolio, but also
a beta neutral one. Despite the less than stellar risk-adjusted return
of the strategy, perhaps the Sharpe ratio can be improved by controlling
sector and style risks in addition to beta exposure. Perhaps one could
also overlay the low beta factor on top of an existing factor strategy
in order to reduce volatility and boost the risk-adjusted return.</p>

<p>That's all for now, and thanks for reading! If you're interested in
the code and want to play around with it, check it out

        <p>Local economies around the U.S. have continued to change quickly and dramatically – states and cities are slowly reopening, unemployment rates are starting to decline from the recent all-time high, COVID-19 cases are increasing in some states while decreasing in others, and communities are responding to the social unrest and George Floyd protests with city-wide curfews having impacted many businesses that were just able to reopen.</p>
        <p>Yelp last reported on the state of the local economy in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/yea-q1-2020.html">our quarterly Yelp Economic Average report on April 28</a>, showing how much consumer activity in major swathes of Main Street had dropped off in just a couple of weeks in March. Now as states start to reopen and the nation responds to anti-Black racism and police brutality, a new set of challenges lay ahead for local economies.</p>

      <h2>Some Businesses Slowly Reopen, While Many Permanently Close</h2>
        <p>As of June 15, there were nearly 140,000 total business closures on Yelp since March 1. In April we reported more than 175,000 business closures, indicating that more than 20% of businesses closed in April have reopened. Las Vegas, NV, endured the highest number of closures relative to the number of businesses in the city (1,921 total closures), while Los Angeles, CA, had the largest total number of closures (11,774 total closures).</p>

        <p>Of all business closures on Yelp since March 1, 41% are permanent closures. Our data shows the largest spikes of permanent closures occurred in March, followed by May and June, indicating that the businesses that were already struggling had to permanently close right away and the businesses that were trying to hold on, but unable to weather the COVID-19 storm, were forced to shutter in recent months.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Retail and Restaurant Businesses Continue Innovating Amid High Closure Rates</h2>
        <p>While many business sectors have struggled during COVID-19 there are a few industries that have endured especially high closure rates. Among those with the highest rate of business closures are shopping and retail (27,663 closed businesses), restaurants (23,981 closed businesses), beauty (15,348 closed businesses) and fitness (5,589 closed businesses).</p>
        <p>Retail was by far the hardest hit, experiencing the highest number of total closures, with the average daily rate continuing to increase since March. Of all closures on Yelp since March 1, 20% are for retail businesses and 35% of closed retail businesses are indicated as permanent on Yelp.</p>
        <p>In March, Restaurants had the highest number of business closures, compared to other industries, and have continued to close at high rates. Of the businesses that closed, 17% are restaurants, and 53% of those restaurant closures are indicated as permanent on Yelp. Restaurants run on thin margins and can sometimes take months or even years to break even, resulting in this higher rate of permanent closures.</p>

        <p>With many retail businesses shifting to curbside pickup, we’ve seen consumer interest spike in obtaining their goods in this way with a 20% increase in searches for curbside pickup. In the beauty industry we’ve seen hair stylists offering video hair cutting tutorials, estheticians offering virtual consultations, and small shops shifting their focus to ecommerce. Fitness in particular has seen a significant shift in their business model with gyms and studios offering virtual classes and personal trainers offering one-on-one virtual training sessions.

      <h2>The Desire to Support Black-Owned Businesses Continues to Grow</h2>
        <p>As acknowledgement of anti-Black racism and police brutality become more wide-spread across the nation people are continuing to look for ways to support the Black community. Since May 25, we’ve seen a 1785% relative increase in searches for Black-owned businesses, compared to the three weeks prior. Review mentions of “Black-owned” (and related terms) also skyrocketed, up 426%, as people look to support and surface these businesses to the community.</p>
        <p>D.C. had the highest number of Black-owned searches, accounting for nearly 1% of all searches on Yelp, followed by Minnesota, Maryland, Michigan and Georgia. In fact, every state has shown an increase in searches for Black-owned businesses. Looking at metros, Ann Arbor, MI has the highest increase in searches for Black-owned, up 105X (accounting for 3% of all searches), followed by Denver (up 27X), Minneapolis (up 23X) and Baltimore (up 19X).</p>

      <h2>The Recovering Economy May Look Different Than the Old Economy</h2>
        <p>While some normal activity is starting to bounce back, due to the many changes impacting local economies — state rules, consumer behavior, and social unrest — many of the consumer interest shifts we saw in March and April started to rebound in May, with dramatic shifts in June.</p>
        <p>Outdoor activities that became popular at the height of the pandemic as people were finding ways to stay active while social distancing – such as mountain biking (down 40%), lakes (down 34%), golf (down 33%) and hiking (down 28%) – have dropped in consumer interest since May 1 relative to other active activities. People are starting to feel more comfortable participating in indoor activities, with increased consumer interest for escape games (up 182%), Go Karts (up 147%), axe throwing (up 113%), gyms (up 81%), bowling (up 63%) and yoga (42%). That said, in some instances people are still finding ways to stay outdoors while social distancing with an increased interest in mini golf (up 132%), amusement parks (up 28%) and horseback riding (up 21%).</p>
        <p>The previous spike in community supported agriculture and grocery has started to dip (down 54% and 26%, respectively) as people start heading back into restaurants. In fact, Yelp’s diners seated data shows significantly more people are dining-in at restaurants. During the peak of the pandemic, the number of diners seated across Yelp Reservations and Waitlist dropped essentially to zero. In early June, we've seen diners seated come back substantially – now down 57% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Restaurants that cater to group dining are among those making a comeback – fondue (up 123%), tapas bars (up 98%), hot pot (up 49%) and surprisingly, even buffets (up 17%) – as foods that gained increased interest through takeout and delivery have started to fall – pizza (down 28%), chinese (down 26%), fast food (down 18%). That said, takeout and delivery has continued to sustain interest on Yelp, still up 148% based on consumer interest relative to pre-pandemic levels, indicating this could be a trend that’s here to stay.</p>
        <p>People are also headed back into malls with outlet stores, shopping centers and thrift stores all up (up 84%, 81%, 72%, respectively), as well as hosting or attending formal events with increased interest in bridal (up 70%) and formal wear (up 102%). The previous increase in cannabis dispensaries, head shops and tobacco shops has declined (down 40%, 35% and 32%, respectively). There have also been significant shifts in consumer interest for health and wellness businesses with an increased interest in saunas (up 75%), reflexology (up 69%) and dentists (up 28%), while skilled nursing (down 46%) and hospitals (down 37%) decline.</p>

<div>
<h2 id="Contrarian-view-on-mutable-default-arguments.">Contrarian view on mutable default arguments.<a href="#Contrarian-view-on-mutable-default-arguments.">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>The use of <a href="https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/gotchas/#mutable-default-arguments">mutable defaults</a> is probably the most infamous Python gotcha.  Default values are evaluated at definition time, which means mutating them will be persistent across multiple calls.  Many articles on this topic even use the same <code>append</code> example.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<p>And the solution is invariably to use <code>None</code> instead, and convert as needed.</p>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<div>
<p>There is another solution to the problem of mutating a default value: don't do that.  More specifically, the problem isn't using mutables as defaults; the problem is actually mutating them.</p>
<p>If the input from the caller is being mutated, then the caller doesn't need it returned because the caller already has a reference.  This distinction is explicitly encouraged in Python, e.g., <code>list.sort</code> vs. <code>sorted</code>.  But it follows that if the input doesn't need to be returned, then there's no point in the input being optional.  How would the caller know the difference?</p>
<p>The reason why examples like the fluent <code>append</code> seem so contrived is because they are. No one actually wants a function named <code>append</code> to take one argument.  The realistic fix would be:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<div>
<p>Sure, there are rare occassions where a parameter is mutable but optional, such as a recursive algorithm that's implicitly passing around its own cache.  But this author would wager that given any real-world code that's been bitten by this gotcha there is:</p>
<ul>
<li>a ~90% chance the function would have a related bug if defaults were evaluated at runtime</li>
<li>a ~95% chance the function has a poor interface</li>
</ul>
<p>What harm does this advice do?  Well, it's caused an over-reaction resulting in using <code>None</code> as the only default, even for immutables.  It's so prevalent that it appears many beginners believe using <code>None</code> is the one and only way of making an argument optional.</p>
<p>Besides immutable types, there are also cases where mutation is irrelevant.  Consider the following example adapted from a popular project.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<p>Notice that the correctness of this code relies on the member list being newly created in either case.  What could possible go wrong with:</p>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<p>Or better yet, why not support the more liberal interface.</p>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<div>
<p>The point is that there are at least 4 solutions to this problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>use mutable defaults, but don't mutate them</li>
<li>use immutable substitute defaults with a compatible interface</li>
<li>use <code>None</code> for mutables, and matching types for immutables</li>
<li>use <code>None</code> for all defaults</li>
</ol>
<p>Only #1 is even remotely controversial, yet somehow the status quo has landed on #4.  Besides being needlessly verbose, it has another pitfall.  Python doesn't natively support detecting where the argument was actually passed; a sentinel default is required for that.  The implementation detail is leaking through the interface, indicating to the caller that <code>None</code> is an acceptable argument to pass <em>explicitly</em>.  As if the type hint was <code>Optional[List]</code>, even though that's not the intention.  Factor in using <code>**kwargs</code> - which clearly doesn't want data padded with nulls - and actual code breakage can result.</p>
<p>Presumably the disdain for option #1 is because it might <em>encourage</em> the gotcha.  But it's disingenous to just let that go unsaid.  The implementer is responsible for writing correct code, and the caller sees the right interface.  The speculation is that beginners will read code which uses mutable defaults but doesn't mutate them, and follow the former pattern but not the latter.</p>
<p>As a community, let's at least push towards option #3.  Using empty strings and zeros as defaults is all upside.</p>

</div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The finance world is quickly entering the mainstream —</p><p>Every month a notable company goes public. Every week a hot startup raises millions of dollars. And every day moms, pops, and teens check on their stocks. </p><p>Whether a company builds rocket engines or mobile apps, they tell their story using the same language —&nbsp;financial statements. Here's how they work.</p><p>Let's say you run a subscription t-shirt business.</p><p>It's going well — you have happy customers and healthy profit. You're thinking of buying your own factory to make more t-shirts, more quickly, and more cheaply.</p><p>There's just one problem — you can't afford a factory.</p><p>So, you ask the bank for a loan. Your company is profitable and the factory will pay for itself in 3 years, so you know you'll be able to pay it back. But while you know this, the bank doesn't — you'll need to convince them. The bank, however, doesn't know anything about the subscription clothing business.</p><p>To get on the same page, you need a shared language for talking about your business.</p><p><h4 id="heading-1">Double-entry Bookkeeping: The birth of accounting</h4></p><p>Double-entry bookkeeping was the first formalism in finance. The Middle East had it in the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40697986" target="_blank">first century AD</a>, Korea independently got it in the <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/issn/1598-2661" target="_blank">11th century</a>, and by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627232023/http://130.74.92.202:82/record=b1000778" target="_blank">1500s</a>, it had been well-documented across Europe.</p><p>It's a simple concept designed to reduce errors when documenting transactions: every entry to an "account" requires an equal and opposite entry to another "account".</p><p>If you bought some cotton to turn into t-shirts, you might record the transaction like this:</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-371c827e421c-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefde0379b53032713cde77_bookkeeping.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>When you spend $100 on cotton, your "Cash" account gets debited (loses) $100, and your "Materials" account gets credited (gains) $100. The underlying principle is that <em>you can't create something out of nothing</em>.</p><p>This might seem contrived, but with more and more transactions, it can help you spot errors. Since every entry has an equal and opposite entry, the sum of all the debits should always equal the sum of all the credits. If not, you know you made a mistake, and you can look back through your transactions to find it.</p><p>A list of transactions is pretty interesting — it tells a very detailed story about what your company's been up to. Certainly enough to answer the bank's questions when you ask for loan.</p><p>But just as the bank doesn't have time to learn about subscription t-shirts businesses, they don't have time to go through thousands of transactions. To understand what's going on, they need a shorter summary.</p><p><h4 id="heading-2">Financial Statement #1: The Balance Sheet</h4></p><p>If you went through all your transactions and worked out the net value of each account, you'd be able to see things like</p><ul role="list"><li>How much cash you have in the bank</li><li>The total value of the cotton in your inventory</li><li>How much money you owe to your cotton suppliers</li></ul><p>This will give you a snapshot of the current state of your company, split up into "everything you own" (<strong>Assets</strong>) and "everything you owe" (<strong>Liabilities</strong>) — a <strong>Balance Sheet</strong>. These generally won't be equal — ideally your assets will be worth more than your liabilities.</p><p>The difference between the assets and the liabilities is what you, the owner of the company, can rightfully stake a claim to. Crudely, if you sold all your assets today and used that money to pay off all your debts, you'd be left with a pile of cash all to yourself.</p><p>This idea is usually expressed by the "accounting equation":</p><p><strong>Assets - Liabilities = Shareholders Equity</strong></p><p>This is where the "balance" comes in: both sides of the equation are equal. Note that this equation is actually a definition — it asserts that the value of the <strong>Shareholders Equity</strong> is the difference between <strong>Assets</strong> and <strong>Liabilities</strong>. This is the same equation that underpins double-entry bookkeeping.</p><p>Here's what your balance sheet might look like:</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-89b5b437bd58-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefde1a11602b68a068a079_balance-sheet.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>The bank will be interested in seeing this before giving you a loan. It's a quick 'n' dirty way for them to understand the big picture:</p><ul role="list"><li>The orders of magnitude involved — does this company operate in the thousands, millions, or billions?</li><li>An estimate for how much the company is "worth", based on the shareholders equity</li><li>An indication of company health — is the company drowning in debt?</li></ul><p>Financiers often calculate metrics based on the balance sheet, to further summarise the information and to compare numbers across companies.</p><p>The <strong>Debt/Equity Ratio</strong> is a big one, telling you how much a company relies on borrowing money. If it's too high then the company might be too dependent on loans, but if it's too low, this might indicate an inefficiency, since borrowing money to spend on growth can be quicker than earning it the hard way.</p><p>So — the balance sheet summarises a lot about your company, in a way that the bank can understand.</p><p>Unfortunately, it doesn't answer a crucial question — "Do you make money?"</p><p><h4 id="heading-3">Financial Statement #2: The Income Statement (P&amp;L)</h4></p><p>The balance sheet is a snapshot of a single point in time. To understand whether a company makes money, you need see how things change over a period of time (e.g. every month).</p><p>The first thing you need to know is how much money you receive — your <strong>Revenue</strong>. You don't keep all of it — there are costs and expenses along the way — so you need to subtract these. The final number you end up with is your <strong>Profit</strong> — the money you've made at the end of the day.</p><p>Here's how you might do the calculation:</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-a4e76259fbb4-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefe0c6c8f0be2b6743533b_p%26l.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>You start at Revenue (the top line), subtract your costs, and end up at Profit (the "bottom line" — get it?). This is a simple <strong>Profit &amp; Loss (P&amp;L)</strong>, or <strong>Income Statement</strong>. Most companies make one every month, to keep an eye on things. </p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-fec0fade16bf-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefe17879b5309ce33ce18b_35274025-14536291245349646_origin.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>With a P&amp;L, you and the bank can understand what's going in and out of your business. If your P&amp;L consistently shows a profit, then the bank will be happy, and so will you.</p><p>In theory, this is very simple. But in practice, each P&amp;L item has hidden nuances to address.</p><p>Let's take just the top line — what does <strong>Revenue</strong> actually mean?</p><p><strong>What is revenue?</strong></p><p>When you started selling shirts, it was a simpler time — you bought them in bulk from China and sold them at the local market.</p><p>Revenue, too, was simple — it was the cold hard cash in your hand.</p><p>But things changed. You started taking bulk orders from shops, who pay you 1 month after you deliver the shirts. And when you went online, your customers started paying you for 12 month subscriptions, all in one go.</p><p>It turns out that if you keep thinking of revenue as "cash in your hand", then things get a little weird —</p><ul role="list"><li>When you get a bulk order, your expenses shoot up. But since you don't get paid until next month, your profit goes way down this month.</li><li>When someone buys a 12-month subscription, your revenue spikes up. But for the next 11 months you have to keep delivering on the order (non-zero cost) without further payments (zero revenue) — your bottom line takes a hit.</li></ul><p>Bulk orders and upfront payments are great for your business, but if revenue means "cash in hand", then your P&amp;L might tell the opposite story.</p><p>A better way to think about revenue is as "the value of products delivered or service provided".</p><p>In each month of a subscription, you do 1 month of work. So even with 12 months' payment upfront, you only recognise 1/12th of that payment as revenue each month. The remaining 11/12th becomes <strong>Deferred Revenue.</strong> This is actually a liability on your balance sheet — your customers have essentially given you a loan which you must pay back each month, in the form of t-shirts.</p><p>The same principle applies for bulk orders — you recognise the revenue when you deliver the product, <em>not</em> when you get paid.</p><p>This is called <strong>Accrual Accounting</strong>, and it more accurately answers the question "Do you make money?".</p><p>So — you've got a balance sheet, showing your current financial state, and you've got a P&amp;L, showing how things change over time. The bank, however, remains unsatisfied.</p><p>Sadly, consistent profits, measured with accrual accounting, can still leave you penniless on payday.</p><p><h4 id="heading-4">Financial Statement #3: The Cashflow Statement</h4></p><p>In 1863, the Dowlais Iron Company had a dilemma.</p><p>On paper, things were great — they'd recovered from a downturn and were posting healthy profits. To smelt more iron, they set out to buy a new blast furnace. But despite their promising P&amp;L, it turned out that they had no cash to buy it.</p><p>What gives?</p><p>Their problem was in spending cash too quickly — as soon as they got some, they'd use it on inventory (iron ore, etc). The profits were rolling in, but the cash wasn't sticking around.</p><p>The company needed a way to understand how cash was coming in and out — the cashflow. Their solution was the origin of the modern <strong>Cashflow Statement</strong>.</p><p>Like the P&amp;L, the cashflow statement shows how things change over each month, but crucially, it only focuses on cash — how much you started with, what you spent it on, where you got more of it, and how much you ended up with. In short, the cashflow statement explains the difference between one balance sheet and the next.</p><figure id="w-node-508193268673-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefe644e9cf27ec56e99c29_Untitled-3.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The bank should now have enough information to decide whether to give you a loan:</p><ul role="list"><li>Balance Sheet — shows everything that you own, and everything that you owe</li><li>P&amp;L/Income Statement — shows how your business operates</li><li>Cashflow Statement — shows how you spend and earn cash</li></ul><p>These financial statements are a shared language, letting businesses communicate across industries and borders. They also "flatten" a business' evolving operations — new business models, delivery methods, and products — to give a coherent view of a company through time.</p><p>Investors use financials to judge performance, lenders use them to assess credit-worthiness, and governments use them to make sure that taxes are correctly paid.</p><p>But the whole system only works if every company follows the same rules when compiling their financials.

<p>It's no secret that finishing a side project is hard.</p>
<p>I've struggled with some side projects and had success with others. In this post, I'll focus on the actions and adjustments that have worked for me.</p>
<p>It's possible to work on and finish side projects even with a busy schedule, the key is to optimize for interruptability. You will be interrupted so instead of counting on having hours of deep work available, it's better to be realistic and make some adjustments to use available time in a better way and reducing the cost of interruptions by having tricks to switch context fast.</p>
<h2 id="a-failed-side-project-story">A failed side project story <a href="#a-failed-side-project-story">#</a></h2>
<p>Maybe you are familiar with a similar situation</p>
<p>At the beginning:</p>
<ul>
<li>High motivation.</li>
<li>Priority over other tasks.</li>
<li>Working long hours because it's fun.</li>
<li>Desire to work with a new technology</li>
<li>No problem working on weekends.</li>
</ul>
<p>After some time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Motivation decreases.</li>
<li>Feels overwheelming.</li>
<li>Harder to justify working on the project when there are other responsibilities.</li>
<li>Other stuff seems more interesting now.</li>
<li>Forgot how to set things up to continue working on the project.</li>
<li>Not sure what I was working on.</li>
<li>Forgetting about the project and archiving it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-challenges-with-side-projects">The challenges with side projects <a href="#the-challenges-with-side-projects">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Context switching and high cognitive load is exhausting.</li>
<li><strong>Losing interest/ motivation</strong>.</li>
<li>Perfectionism - never ending projects.</li>
<li>Impostor syndrome.</li>
<li>Lack of focus.</li>
<li>Lack of time.</li>
<li>Unexpected life events.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="re-framing-the-goal">Re framing the goal <a href="#re-framing-the-goal">#</a></h2>
<p>I believe you can set yourself for failure from the start if the goal is not clear.</p>
<p>I've been excited about ideas but later found that I was not really invested in the idea and just wanted to explore a cool feature/tool. It's good to go deeper to your true motivation.</p>
<p>Feeling overwhelmed can also contribute to abandoning the project, I'll talk about <strong>small steps</strong> and why it's key.</p>
<p>If your track record includes lots of ambitious projects and none of them finished, then starting with something smaller seems like the logical approach.</p>
<p>Pick a small battle, maybe just the key feature first, maybe support for just one platform. Cut off features for the first version, remember that there's a lot of forces against you completing your project so reducing load is important.</p>
<h2 id="the-approach">The approach <a href="#the-approach">#</a></h2>
<p>Now that you have a clear idea of what you want to finish, there's some actions and adjustments to your process that will increase the chance of winning the battle (shipping).</p>
<ul>
<li>Preparing your environment (painless context switch)</li>
<li>Work in <strong>Small steps</strong></li>
<li>Mental warm-up before each session.</li>
<li>Anticipate and expect interruptions.</li>
<li>Changing your physical location.</li>
<li>Writting down the ideas on your mind at the end of the session.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="small-steps-are-key">Small steps are key <a href="#small-steps-are-key">#</a></h2>
<p>I like the idea of not having too many open boxes at the same time, where each box is a task/feature or something that you  started but haven't finished yet.</p>
<p>It's demoralizing to wait weeks or months for a win. Small steps give you small wins, it keeps the journey fun. There's less change of feeling stuck.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.geepawhill.org/2020/06/26/more-on-small-steps/">Geepaw Hill</a> shares excellent resources on the topic of small steps in software.</p>
<h2 id="warming-up-before-each-session-to-reduce-cognitive-exhaustion">Warming up before each session to reduce cognitive exhaustion <a href="#warming-up-before-each-session-to-reduce-cognitive-exhaustion">#</a></h2>
<p>Before starting actual work, write about what would be good to achieve in the session. I find this ritual valuable as it helps me figure out the next small step. Writing the project goal (high level) every session is also a good way to switch context and reminding yourself what's it all about.</p>
<p>I'll talk about having a "context" log, where you write the current progress, and what to do next. If you have this file, reading the previous session log let's you resume your work faster.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-context-switching">Immediate context switching <a href="#immediate-context-switching">#</a></h2>
<p>With the limited amount of mental energy, is crucial to reduce the number of setup tasks required to do a working session on your project. The goal here is reducing the number of small decisions you have to make to have a working environment.</p>
<p>This is one of the most important things for me, and the way I approach it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a separated system User on my laptop.</li>
<li>Having an email address only for my project.</li>
<li>Having a "context" file where I log what's currently happening with my project, usually at the end of a work session.</li>
</ul>
<p>These have been valuable tools for me, let me explain why:</p>
<h3 id="a-separate-system-user-for-your-side-project">A separate system user for your side project <a href="#a-separate-system-user-for-your-side-project">#</a></h3>
<p>By creating a separate user, you automatically have all the operative system tools (calendar/notes/reminders , etc.) available ONLY for your project.</p>
<p>All the files on your desktop will have a relation to your project. This may not seem impressive but think about all the small distractions you find if you use the same user for your personal/work tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time to find a file (filtering unrelated stuff will bring memories of other things)</li>
<li>Reminders/calendar notifications not related to your project</li>
<li>Dealing with other project setups can be stressful.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it was Seth Godin who recommended having a separate laptop for a side project like writing a book. This is an alternative too.</p>
<p>You can add more extreme measures like redirecting distracting sites like news or reddit. If you need to login to one of those sites, it's better to switch user accounts. Try to keep your project user clean.</p>
<h3 id="having-an-separate-email-for-your-project">Having an separate email for your project <a href="#having-an-separate-email-for-your-project">#</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://hugozap.com/posts/ultimate-info-capturing-tool/">I'm a fan of email</a> as a note taking tool, it's available everywhere, the UI is simple. Having a separate email account lets you capture related notes/ideas/links from any device. This has been useful for me when I'm doing something else and have an idea, or find a resource that can be used to do something I want to incorporate into the project.</p>
<p>Later, when I log in to my project environment I'll get the emails with relevant information, no chance of getting distracted with other stuff.</p>
<h3 id="the-context-file%2C-(brain-dump).">The context file, (brain dump). <a href="#the-context-file%2C-(brain-dump).">#</a></h3>
<p>A context file is just a text file where you add a short summary of the current project status and what's on your mind at the time.</p>
<p>This has been valuable to me, because the act of writing it down helps me have a clear idea of things I could do next and next time I have time to work on my project I'll have a starting point and it reduces the cognitive load which maximizes the session efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="location">Location <a href="#location">#</a></h2>
<p>Going to a library or café (when possible) or event to another room and have a dedicated space for your current side project will make a difference.</p>
<p>Not sure about why, but using the same desk for different work and side projects is not ideal for me. If you can I recommend having a different place that helps you switch context quickly.</p>
<h2 id="abandoned-projects-may-not-be-a-failure-after-all.">Abandoned projects may not be a failure after all. <a href="#abandoned-projects-may-not-be-a-failure-after-all.">#</a></h2>
<p>Some abandoned projects end up being an inspiration to create something else years later. Maybe you learned something new, explored an idea, or found a problem not possible to solve with the knowledge and resources you had at the time.</p>
<p>It's good to have an open mind and be ok with finding dead-ends, they are powerful teachers.</p>
<p>However, shipping projects <strong>is awesome</strong> and by reducing scope and anticipating interruptions you will be able to complete your project and release it to the world.</p>

As of this writing, we’re still in the middle of a global pandemic that the United States seems to have just given up on.</p><p>We’re in seeing a renewed fight for social justice, with more of us fighting against centuries of racial inequality than ever before.</p><p>The first two quarters of 2020 have taken an emotional toll on me just like they probably have on you. Everyone is hurting – individuals and business owners included.</p><p>But for the last two years, I’ve written an annual reflection on my own business.</p><p>To be honest, the anniversary snuck up on me this year!</p><p>But I wanted to go a little deeper on this year’s reflection. I wanted to bring you some <strong>real numbers</strong>, some <strong>behind-the-scenes</strong>, and the <strong>lessons learned</strong>.</p><p>And it’s important to note – <strong>I do not equate earnings with success</strong>. I certainly don’t equate them with happiness. If you look at earnings alone, my 2019 would look like a&nbsp;<em>huge&nbsp;</em>step backwards. But in reality, I believe 2019 to be far more impactful than 2018.</p><p>I’m optimizing for flexibility, fulfillment, and long-term vision. So as you’ll see in my 2019 breakdown, I accepted a short-term earnings compromise to get there.</p><p>If you want the tl;dr version, here’s a visual overview of my P&amp;L every year from 2017. It includes the my actual figures for January through June of 2020, as well as a projection for the full year based upon those numbers.</p><p><picture><source data-lazy-srcset="https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PL2020-2.webp 822w,https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PL2020-2-300x169.webp 300w,https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PL2020-2-768x432.webp 768w,https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PL2020-2-100x56.webp 100w" sizes="(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px" type="image/webp"><source data-lazy-srcset="https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PL2020-2.png 822w, https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PL2020-2-300x169.png 300w, https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PL2020-2-768x432.png 768w, https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PL2020-2-100x56.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20822%20462'%3E%3C/svg%3E" height="462" width="822" data-lazy-srcset="https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PL2020-2.png 822w, https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PL2020-2-300x169.png 300w, https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PL2020-2-768x432.png 768w, https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PL2020-2-100x56.png 100w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px" data-lazy-src="https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PL2020-2.png"></picture></p><p>If you’re ready to dig into what happened each of those years and why those trends look the way they do, let’s get started.</p><h2><strong>Year One: 2017</strong></h2><p>I spent the first four months of 2017 gainfully employed! Those earnings are <em>not</em> reflected in the numbers above or below, but it does mean that I had four fewer months to work with.</p><p>I quit my job in late April 2017. It came about a month sooner than I anticipated, but the timing seemed right for both me and the company I was leaving.</p><p>You can read more detail about that decision <a href="https://jayclouse.com/chapter-three/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, but it was a pretty half-baked move, truth be told.</p><p>I didn’t really have much of a plan, and I don’t recommend jumping into the deep end like I did!</p><p>The biggest victory was getting my first 15-member paid cohort of the Unreal Collective Accelerator off the ground.</p><p>Here’s my cringe-worthy first promotional video for Unreal Collective:</p><p>Pulling that first cohort together wasn’t<em>&nbsp;</em>easy. I ran a beta group of five members for a couple of months prior, and I was able to turn their stories into testimonials.</p><p>But I was still coming in with very little credibility.</p><p>The model behind the Unreal Collective Accelerator is pretty straightforward, and it’s similar to a typical mastermind program.</p><p>You take a small number of great people with ambitious goals, you force them into meeting once per week, and magic happens. <strong>Progress</strong> is made, <strong>goals</strong> are met, <strong>transformation</strong> is experienced.</p><p>Getting the right number of people, who mesh together well, ready to start the program at the same time is where you find the challenge.</p><p>But I’ve always been good at logistics and timelines, so I’m able to make it work – even if it was through brute force of a <em>lot </em>of conversations.</p><p>I wasn’t even calling it an accelerator at the time! I wasn’t sure what it was going to be – I <a href="https://jayclouse.com/on-unreal-collective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thought</a> it might be a live events company.</p><p>After that first program ended, it was October. And I realized I wasn’t going to be able to pull another group together before the end of the year due to Thanksgiving, Christmas, and the new year.</p><p>So my financial engine was put on pause until 2018.</p><p>And I was broke.</p><p>To scrape by, I picked up a couple of freelance gigs building simple WordPress websites, writing email sequences, and helping a friend launch his podcast.</p><p>Then in late December, I got a surprise email: an opportunity to become a LinkedIn Learning instructor. I walked through the application process and was accepted shortly thereafter.</p><h3><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></h3><ul><li>👍&nbsp; Creating a budget was absolutely critical</li><li>👍&nbsp; Investing in mentorship and my own education was well worth it</li><li>👍&nbsp; When I’m in a bind, I look for work from the people close to me</li><li>👎&nbsp; I need to learn how to predict my cash flow</li><li>👎&nbsp; Things take longer to get started than I expect</li><li>👎&nbsp; When I underprice myself, it’s problematic through the project and for months afterward</li></ul><h3><strong>By the Numbers</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Gross income</strong>: $29,468</li><li><strong>Expenses</strong>: $18,289</li><li><strong>Net income</strong>: $11,179</li></ul><h2><strong>Year Two: 2018</strong></h2><p>The start of the new year couldn’t come soon enough. When the year began, I was still working on a freelance marketing contract that saved my butt at the end of 2017.</p><p>But I wanted to start a new cohort of the Unreal Collective Accelerator.</p><p>And actually, 2018 was the first time I started calling it an Accelerator. I put a lot of thought into Unreal Collective as a business, because I wanted it to be a brand that meant more than just the 12-week program.</p><p>In February, I pulled my thoughts together and decided Unreal would split into three core product offerings:</p><ol><li>The 12-week program (Unreal Collective Accelerator)</li><li>A community membership (Unreal Collective)</li><li>Digital products and courses (called Guides at the time)</li></ol><p>I broke it all down in this 24-minute monologue called “Unreal Collective 2.0” that I shared with the community (then about 35 people):</p><p>To start the year, I brought together another cohort of 15 people. At the same time, I began writing my first LinkedIn Learning course and even accepted a part-time Entrepreneur In Residence position with Columbus’s Smart City team.</p><p>So things got off to a strong start.</p><p>But I burned myself out. Outside of my business, I was:</p><ul><li>Serving as Entrepreneur in Residence for Smart Columbus</li><li>Helping organize a track of events for Columbus Startup Week</li><li>Organizing a hackathon for Smart Columbus</li><li>Serving as Vice Chair of a nonprofit organization</li><li>Organizing a 6-month outdoor music series</li></ul><p>…and most of that was a volunteer effort.</p><p>The Smart Columbus role was fantastic – I was able to make an impact for the team and we put on an incredible event.</p><p>And somehow I also wrote 4 courses for LinkedIn Learning, ran two cohorts of the Unreal Collective Accelerator, and launched our podcast, <a href="https://upside.fm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">upside</a>.</p><p><a href="https://jayclouse.com/two-years-into-the-journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can read my full 2018 reflection here</a></p><p>It was a strong year of earnings, but I really wanted to focus and devote more time to my core business. So I stepped away from the Smart Columbus role, the Vice Chair role, and the music series.</p><h3><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></h3><ul><li>👍&nbsp; Creating LinkedIn courses were great for cash flow and creating my own content</li><li>👍&nbsp; Coaching others was a viable service that people benefitted from</li><li>👍&nbsp; Freelance work can pay pretty well</li><li>👍&nbsp; I can pick up freelance work pretty easily</li><li>👎&nbsp; Freelancing can also be a diversion from my core business goals</li><li>👎&nbsp; Volunteering a lot of my time was hurting my business</li><li>👎&nbsp; Earning more doesn’t matter if my costs increase</li><li>👎&nbsp; Earning close to my previous salary doesn’t matter if I’m saving far less</li></ul><h3><strong>By the Numbers</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Gross income</strong>: $72,713 (<strong><span>147% increase</span></strong>)</li><li><strong>Expenses</strong>: $45,834 (<strong><span>151% increase</span></strong>)</li><li><strong>Net income</strong>: $26,879 (<strong><span>140% increase</span></strong>)</li></ul><h2><strong>Year Three: 2019</strong></h2><p>In 2019, I resolved to do <em>less </em>so that I could do <em>more</em>. I <a href="https://jayclouse.com/doing-fewer-doing-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> in January 2019:</p><blockquote><p>This year is all about doing fewer so that I can do more. Fewer projects, fewer opportunities that are outside of my core intention, in order to do more with the things I am focusing on.</p><p><strong>It’s not unlikely that I actually earn less this year</strong> than I did last year. A large part of my income in 2018 was from contracting and ad hoc projects, and those take time away from building my core business.</p></blockquote><p>Turns out, I was right. My income dropped 25% percent in 2019.</p><p>I decided to take on less freelance work – including courses from LinkedIn.</p><p>Instead, I focused on more Unreal Collective Accelerator cohorts and developing my own proprietary content.</p><p>That content took a few forms:</p><ul><li>Freelancing School courses</li><li>More episodes of upside</li><li>Planning for the launch of a new podcast (Creative Elements)</li><li>My weekly newsletter, Work In Progress</li></ul><p>I spent most of the first six months of 2019 producing the <a href="https://freelancing.school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three courses within Freelancing School.</a> It was a <em>massive </em>effort and the courses get really great reviews from students.</p><p><iframe loading="lazy" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/419356632?color=109aa1&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0"></iframe></p><p>And all the while, I facilitated three sessions of the Unreal Collective Accelerator – welcoming 50 new members across three cohorts.</p><p>…and that was exhausting. The program itself is 12 weeks long with about 4 weeks of marketing and onboarding required up front.</p><p>Some quick math will show you that 16 weeks across 3 sessions equals 48 weeks out of the year…and I wanted to finish before Thanksgiving!</p><p>I ended up staggering the second and third cohorts a bit, with two sessions overlapping for two weeks. And it was intense.</p><p>But, at the same time, my courses were published and beginning to sell.</p><p>Our podcast, upside, even earned more than $20,000 in gross income through sponsorships and partnerships (not reflected in the numbers below).</p><p>Over the summer, that podcast business produced a full-length documentary about the startup ecosystem in Columbus, Ohio, called <em>Test City, USA.</em></p><p>The film is 94 minutes long, features prominent voices in Columbus’s tech scene, and was shot <em>beautifully</em>.</p><p><picture><source data-lazy-srcset="https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3R5A0389_compressed.webp 1000w,https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3R5A0389_compressed-300x169.webp 300w,https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3R5A0389_compressed-768x432.webp 768w,https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3R5A0389_compressed-100x56.webp 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" type="image/webp"><source data-lazy-srcset="https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3R5A0389_compressed.jpg 1000w, https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3R5A0389_compressed-300x169.jpg 300w, https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3R5A0389_compressed-768x432.jpg 768w, https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3R5A0389_compressed-100x56.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20563'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="Mallory and I at the Test City, USA Premiere" height="563" width="1000" data-lazy-srcset="https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3R5A0389_compressed.jpg 1000w, https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3R5A0389_compressed-300x169.jpg 300w, https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3R5A0389_compressed-768x432.jpg 768w, https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3R5A0389_compressed-100x56.jpg 100w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-lazy-src="https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3R5A0389_compressed.jpg"></picture></p><p>We spent the entire summer filming and editing, and due to some lucky timing, we premiered the film at the Film Festival of Columbus in September where it won Best Ohio Feature.

      To really explain why I use org-mode for <bold>everything</bold>, I probably first have to explain my rules, which also requires a backstory.  I'll keep it short, no problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      I jacked into Unix the first time at Calhoun Community College, in Decatur, Alabama, during the summer of 1974.  I was 15, and my dad was a part-time programming instructor.  Having been an avid reader since the age of 6 (I read the entire elementary school library before the middle of second grade), text and text-processing was much on my mind.
    </p>
    <p>So when I encountered a system where plain text is the raw material flowing through the pipes, I was hooked.

      This led me to undertake an informal study of Unix, all the way back to the Tech Model Railroad Club and all the hackers that came from there.  Yeah, I read the story about Margaret and the groceries and the Volkswagen; I understand his pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what I really learned was that the rules of Unix could be adapted to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      After about 30 years as a tech writer and frequent programmer, I finally settled on a set that works for me.  Little did I know that these very principles would lead me to org-mode, which would later lead me to find my people.

	Unix rules for life
      </center>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep it simple: It's cheaper and easier to carry around.</li>
      <li>Do one thing at a time: Multitasking is a lie.</li>
      <li>Network: You were born to connect.</li>
      <li>Say what you mean; nothing is truer than the truth.</li>
      <li>Hack: Trial and error is the only way we learn anything</li>
      <li>Be who you are: Even a bent wire can carry a great light.</li>
      <li>Use leverage; a bigger hammer isn't always the answer.</li>
      <li>Use what you have: never dig diamonds with a brick of gold.</li>
      <li>Have faith; all's possible, except maybe skiing through a revolving door.</li>
      <li>Think ahead, but don't worship your plans; remember today is the first day of the rest of your learning experience.</li>

<h3>
  a vi convert
</h3>
<p>
  I didn't start with org-mode, actually, but with plain journal files labeled YYYYMMDD, in a special directory in <code>/var/log</code>.  I still have those going back to sometime in the 90's.  The format was simple, but using the files soon became complex:

    .
    .
    .
  </pre>
  The unwieldy part came with all the repeated tasks, and tasks that got carried over from one day to the next (or didn't get finished). I had to copy yesterday's file, change all the key info, sort out the todo list, erase yesterday's journal, and generally do far too much work to keep my journal up.

  </blockquote>
<p>
  I did it, but intermittently, supplanting it with post-it notes, pads, planners galore, palm pilots, palmtop computers, etc.  It seemed like every day I was badly copying tasks from one day to the next. Meanwhile, my unwillingness to use Windows didn't give the the luxury of Outlook, when it came along.

<p>
  I got turned onto emacs sometime in the mid-nineties, when I moved to Atlanta to work for HP.  A fellow writer there used it, and suggested it might help me write and code up examples more effectively.  He was right, and it stuck as my editing platform of choice.
</p>
<p>
But I hadn't discovered org-mode yet. Either he didn't use it, or it hadn't been invented yet.  And to be honest, I kinda went back and forth between vi and emacs, depending on my "mood of the month."
</p>
<h3>
  a modem in the woods
</h3>
<p>
  Eventually, my HP job became a telecommuting-type arrangment, and I moved home to the farm, about an hour outside New Orleans, in the woods.  At that time, Internet was still modem-driven out here, so having command-line Linux with emacs on my laptop was a real lifesaver.
</p>
<p>
  Sometime not long before Katrina hit, I stumbled across org-mode.  I'd already used outline mode for some period of time (can't remember how long), and org-mode seemed like a logical follow-on from there.
      </p>
      <p>
	From there, org-mode just grew, and I grew with it.  All the features made it easy for me to both do what seemed natural for me, and do things in a way that felt like they supported my principles.  Gradually, my other methods of keeping track of things faded away, except for my alarm clock.  </p>
<p>
  Even when smart-phones took off, I was always trying to find some way to send org files over to my phone and use them there.  I think I even wrote some lua code in an iPhone wiki app to emulate org-mode with my files, though it was not fully satisfactory.
</p>
<h3>
  an org-mode resume
</h3>
      <p>
	Fast-forward to last May.  I'd been wanting to get on with Canonical for a long time, but hadn't found the right position, one that really matched my skills.  Then one Saturday, while I was waiting for my wife to meet me for some community event we were hosting, I saw a position that virtually described me.  I started to write a resume, but then decided that I would just take the job description elements, one-by-one, put them in an org file, and send them to the hiring manager.
      </p>
<p>
  Long-story short, almost everyone on this team used emacs, and org-mode, and lots of other .el packages that I also used every day.  I got the job, and so far, I'm very happy and feel like I fit in very well.
      </p>
      <h3>
	org-mode and my principles
      </h3>
      <p>
	Here's how I feel about using org-mode for everything: email, git, irc, web-browsing, organization, time-keeping, and so on.  And yes, I do use org-mode to connect with my email and the web, even though I use other packages (rmail, eww, magit, erc) to do the heavy lifing.  Let me walk it down, principle by principle:
	</p><ul>
	  <li><strong>Keep it simple:</strong> Granted, emacs isn't the simplest user interface, that is, until it becomes second nature.  After that, you'll find yourself accidentally erasing cells in your Google spreadsheet when you hit "C-x C-s" to try to save (good thing there's an undo). But the fact that you can use the same text for multiple functions: appointments, task states, task notes, clocking time, building an agenda, sending email, project planning, percentage completion, ....  The list is too long to quote, but just a simple statement, like "Get the discourse publishing tool working," can become the nucleus for a whole cycle's work and all the actions that go with it.</li><br>
	  <li><strong>Do one thing at a time:</strong> The window-driven nature of emacs makes it easy to switch tasks when you have to (just open another buffer) and then switch back later, and more quickly link back to where you were; not to mention that, if you become adept at using the agenda, you can keep yourself on track and move other things around with ease, and without any fear that they'll get lost.</li><br>
	  <li><strong>Network:</strong> Since I'm set up to send email, IRC, Mattermost, etc., directly from my org-mode tasks, it's easy to track where I am.  But even if I used another app, it's still really easy to just cut and paste a note next to a task and then set a follow-up time to prod, all without breaking your train of thought.  You're literally still looking at the work you're doing while you're messaging about it, so there's that.</li><br>
	  <li><strong>Say what you mean:</strong> You have the entire outline in front of you for whatever you're working on, so presentations, show-and-tell sessions, and status reports are really simple to give, whether verbally or in writing.</li><br>
	  <li><strong>Hack...:</strong> If it doesn't do what you want, you've got customizable variables, a huge library of packages, strong macro capability, and push-come-to-shove, emacs lisp, though I rarely have to go there, TBH.</li><br>
	  <li><strong>Be who you are:</strong> Org-mode matches my thinking style. Not true for everyone, but I tend to outline or mindmap (which you can do with org-mode, with the right .el package).</li><br>
	  <li><strong>Use leverage:</strong> Org-mode seriously leverages the power of plain text, in that you can either use the shortcuts to add an appointment, add tags, search tags -- or you can just do it by hand, because all of the special notation is plain text.  Leveraging human language in this way is helpful to me.</li><br>
	  <li><strong>Use what you have:</strong> Org-mode and emacs give me a stable platform that works everywhere, even on a printout.  I don't need license fees, special extensions, subscriptions, add-on tools, or constant updates to keep my life humming.</li><br>
	  <li><strong>Have faith:</strong> Org-mode has justified my faith, as has emacs.  Lots of tools I've used break, crash, or get killed by absorption (I once liked Astrid, e.g., but it suddenly got sold and went away).  Org-mode and emacs are pretty much here to stay, especially since there is no license fee, and I can keep a self-contained version backed up at home, should it ever stop being distributed.</li><br>
	  <li><strong>Think ahead:</strong> This is where org-mode, and especially the agenda, shine.  If I'm busy, I don't have to worry about keeping my outline clean.  I can stop in the middle of notes for another project, hit return, enter a to do for later (and tag it and schedule it to pop up later), and then move that to someplace more suitable later.  The agenda will clean it up and put it in perspective for me.  Or I can search for it, or pull up all open to-do items …</li></ul></div>

  <p>PostgreSQL is open source software so we can install it wthout any limitation, including our personal code changes. It is distributed under own The PostgreSQL License(TPL).</p>
<p>Installation of PostgreSQL is easy on Linux Distributions.<br>
For purpose of tutorial we use CentOS 8.</p>
<p>We shuold get newest PostgreSQL from official repo - version in OS repos are mostly old - like for now when we get with CentOS 8 PostgreSQL 9.6 :)</p>

This user must also own the server process.

The database cluster will be initialized with locale <span>"en_US.UTF-8"</span>.
The default database encoding has accordingly been set to <span>"UTF8"</span>.

<p>This post has been delayed due to the events of 2020 including a global pandemic and social justice demonstrations, if you are touched by those I wish you all the best.  For my family and I we have been very lucky and spent most of the last months tending our garden in the Copenhagen suburbs, but others have been a lot more directly affected.</p>

<p>One consequence of the pandemic may be that from now on more interaction will be online, which presents both opportunities and challenges.  I think it’s important that any opportunities are democratised as much as possible, so I hope this post will help those with data science skills have an easier route to generate an income from those skills if they choose to.</p>

<p>The demo tech stack chosen is one to keep online payments as simple yet as secure as possible, with low running costs taken care of via serverless infrastructure.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234/Shiny-R-SaaS">demo app code is on GitHub available here</a> and a working demo with that code is running on <a href="https://mark.shinyapps.io/r-saas/">shinyapps.io here.</a></p>

<h2 id="money-and-open-source-software">Money and open source software</h2>

<p>The interaction between open-source and how it’s paid for is interesting economics.  There are several open-source projects that are highly valuable and essential for modern living, yet created by people in their free time with no expectation of payment.  Indeed, from my own experience, the motivations to create these open source projects are more about craftsmanship, education and pride than any promise of monetary reward.</p>

<p>Yet if those projects are to go beyond hobby projects, at some point the open source contributor needs to be paid, and this seems to happen in a few ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>The employer of the contributor pays enough that they can work in their free time

<ul>
<li>This risks burnout of the contributor</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The employer agrees to subsidise the open source project directly

<ul>
<li>The employer may then want rights over the open source project, potentially compromising it</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The open source project serves as a CV for demonstrating the contributors skill

<ul>
<li>The project may then be abandoned once the contributer is busy with paid projects</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The open source project generates income from direct sponsorship of its users

<ul>
<li>With <a href="https://github.com/sponsors">GitHub Sponsors</a> this is now easier than ever, and may be the future of open source, although favours public facing projects over critical infrastructure</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The open source project offers paid options on top of the free to use version, which supports the open-source work

<ul>
<li>This is the RStudio (PBC) model, with paid enterprise options supporting huge open source efforts</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>If we’re lucky the contributor finds how to make one of the above work.  For example Hadley Wickham and Wes McKinney were employed by firms who wanted to support the open source work they were doing directly.  But what about those projects that rely on free time or user contributions?  Unfortunately, the most likely possibility is that they have to stop supporting the project - we can at best hope the person got a good job via the CV recognition route.</p>

<p>My ambition is that the demo payment template described in this post will help people into easier direct sponsorship or dedicated apps before they are abandoned.</p>



<p>GitHub Sponsors has also been a huge step in this area and there was <a href="https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it">a recent report of a contributor with a $100k salary</a> which is fantastic.</p>

<p>I am humbled by the people who have also <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/MarkEdmondson1234">sponsored my efforts</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://code.markedmondson.me/images/github-sponsors.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Any feedback is always a great motivation for me to carry on with my work (I used to fret I got no-one creating GitHub issues) and it never is taken for granted.  To have some who will actually take the time to send some money with that feedback is amazing and was another motivation to give back with this project.  It greatly reduces burnout to know that the work has some value to others.</p>

<h2 id="r-as-a-production-language">R as a production language</h2>

<p>Another motivation for this template is to help sustain R programmers in particular.  Although the demo payment flow will work with any service (the Paddle javascript embeds in any HTML) I focused on making a front end for R using Shiny as there is a thirving ecosystem of <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/">fantastic Shiny apps</a> that are currently offered for free, and I think it’ll be cool if there are more that also generate income for their creators.</p>

<p><img src="https://code.markedmondson.me/images/shiny-showcase.png" alt=""></p>

<p>A myth that R can’t be used in production is possibly perpetrated as it has arisen via academia and so commercial applications haven’t been a priority.  Nothing cements R as a production language more than if people are making a living from it. I certainly do in my day-to-day work at <a href="https://iihnordic.com/">IIH Nordic</a>, but anything to help others have the same is probably worth while.</p>

<li>Firebase to handle authentication and store subscription user data</li>
<li>Paddle to handle payments, taxes and fulfillment</li>
<li>Cloud Functions to sync changes between Paddle and Firebase</li>
<li>Shiny frontend with demo content for ‘free’, ‘logged in but not subscribed’ and ‘subscriber’ content</li>
</ul>

<p>The detailed setup steps needed are in the <a href="https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234/Shiny-R-SaaS">GitHub readme</a>, for this blogpost I’ll take about what choices were made and why.</p>

<h2 id="overall-flow">Overall flow</h2>

<p>I used <a href="https://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/"><code>library(DiagrammeR)</code></a> to plan out what flows were needed (click image to make bigger):</p>

<p><img src="https://code.markedmondson.me/images/paddle_flow.png" alt=""></p>

<p>It does take some planning!</p>

<p>The key areas are how a user logs on and the app knows they are a paid subscriber, and what happens offline if say the credit card is declined - the app needs to know this state has been updated the next time a user logs on.</p>

<h3 id="firebase">Firebase</h3>

<p>Firebase is a development platform for building mobile and web apps that is a layer on top of the Google Cloud Platform.</p>

<p>Firebase has many tools to help make application development easier, but only two were needed for this project: Firebase AuthUI and Firestore, a noSQL database.</p>

<p><img src="https://code.markedmondson.me/images/firebase-login.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Firebase AuthUI has been implemented for Shiny apps via JohnCoene’s <a href="https://github.com/JohnCoene/firebase">firebase package</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This has a nice open source story of taking inspiration from each other, first started by <a href="https://github.com/shinyonfire/sof-auth-example">Andy Merlino showing a POC of Firebase</a> on Shiny, myself putting in the Firebase Auth UI module which helped simplify the code and finished and polished by John to make a simple and powerful Shiny package to implement Firebase authentication.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its easy and secure to setup, and since the authentication uses a centralised database running on Firebase it works across apps/website so a user who logs in with Shiny can also be recognised elsewhere, which you can use to make a suite of services, support or apps.</p>

<p>In a similar manner, Firestore is a noSQL database that is used to carry the subscription data, linked to the Firebase userId.</p>

<p><img src="https://code.markedmondson.me/images/firebase-database.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Being noSQL it is quick for reads and also lets you keep historic events such as when a user subscribed, cancelled or updated. Since its on the Google Cloud Platform I could use <a href="https://code.markedmondson.me/googleAuthR/"><code>googleAuthR</code></a> to authenticate and generated the R function to read it:</p>

<pre><code>library(googleAuthR)

gar_auth_service("firebase-reader-auth-key.json",
                 scope = "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/datastore")

#' Gets a Firebase data entry.  Will return NULL if it can not
fb_document_get &lt;- function(document_path,
                            database_id = "(default)",
                            project_id = Sys.getenv("FIREBASE_PROJECT")){

  the_url &lt;- sprintf("https://firestore.googleapis.com/v1/projects/%s/databases/%s/documents/%s",
                     project_id, database_id, document_path)

  f &lt;- gar_api_generator(the_url,
                         "GET",
                         data_parse_function = function(x) x)

  f()
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="paddle">Paddle</h3>

<p>For a long time I was thinking of using Stripe for this template, but whilst Stripe has a great API and I’d <a href="https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234/stripeR">worked with it before</a>, there was still some work to do to make reliable payment apps such as handling when a user’s card gets declined (how would your app know to deny paid content?) and international taxes etc.</p>

<p>The pitch of <a href="https://paddle.com/">paddle.com</a> was that it took care of all that for you, so you are closer to a working app.  They do charge more per transaction than Stripe, so if you are looking for the cheapest then you may want to stick with Stripe and implement the “Stripe stack”, but I figured it was worth it for keeping the implementation simple.</p>

<p>Paddle has a simple JavaScript button to implement the payment popups -</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="https://cdn.paddle.com/paddle/paddle.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
	Paddle.Setup({ vendor: 1234567 });
&lt;/script&gt;

...
// a buy button
&lt;a href="#!" class="paddle_button" data-product="12345"&gt;Buy Now!&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://code.markedmondson.me/images/paddle-paymentstep-2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Paddle then uses webhooks to communicate with your server (in this case, Firestore) - so the next ingredient was how to create a webhook for communication between Paddle and Firestore.  You can then test this from the Paddle UI:</p>

<p><img src="https://code.markedmondson.me/images/paddle-webhook-test.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="google-cloud-functions">Google Cloud Functions</h3>

<p>For simple “glue” data flows my go-to is Google Cloud Functions, as you only need write the code and deploy without needing to worry about servers or scale.  Firebase has its own Cloud Function UI as well but that only supports node.js, so I opted to use the GCP console Cloud Functions in Python3.7 (Its the same service and infrastructure as Firebase.)</p>

<p>Paddle had lots of Python examples already on the website on how to verify and deal with the data in their webhook payload so a lot of it was just copy-paste from there into the Cloud Function UI.  There is some more setup info in the <a href="https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234/Shiny-R-SaaS/tree/master/payment_app">Cloud Function readme</a> - the only extra bit I needed to add was how to take the webhook payload and write it to Firestore - this was all handled by this snippet of code:</p>

<pre><code>import logging
from google.cloud import firestore

def update_firebase(data, collection, doc_id):
    logging.info('fb update - collection {} doc_id {}'.format(collection, doc_id))

    db = firestore.Client()
    doc_ref = db.collection(collection).document(doc_id)
    doc_ref.set(data)

    # add the event
    event_ref = db.collection(collection).document(doc_id).collection('event').document(data['alert_id'])
    event_ref.set(data)   
</code></pre>

Growth startups require both personal and business scaling.</p>

<p>The hardest part of working at a growth startup is having to re-interview for your job every year.</p>

<h3 id="the-challenge-of-scaling">The challenge of scaling</h3>

<p>You’re heading a key function at your 25-person startup. Maybe you’re head of engineering; maybe you run marketing. Hell, maybe you’re the CEO. You kick ass and your startup grows fast – and with that growth, the needs of the company evolve. Things in the new world are now going okay, but perhaps not optimally. Eventually, the CEO and board of directors get in a room to discuss what to do.</p>

<p>I can tell you what will happen in this room. The board will discuss your performance, and compare it to the performance of other, hypothetical executives – just as if you were interviewing for your own job. In your favor: you are a known quantity, presumably viewed as talented, and perhaps even a close friend. Against you: you haven’t done this before, and we need results now.</p>

<p>In many cases this conversation will lead to you being demoted or asked to leave. In extra cruel circumstances, you can literally get fired for having done a great job. This is normal, semi-expected, and sucks. And this happens to everyone – even founding CEOs are not immune.</p>

<p>The hardest part of this situation? These hard truths often go unspoken. Sometimes it’s just too awkward to tell someone who’s been there through thick and thin that they’re expected to be a stand-in for a future big league exec. And if you have a first-time management team, they might not even realize what’s going on – they may also be in the process of not scaling fast enough, either. At least when you’re interviewing, you’re explicitly given the chance to shine; such opportunities may not be spoon-fed to you during hectic growth.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-scale-yourself">How to scale yourself</h3>

<p>To avoid this situation you need to become a self-scaling machine. Read voraciously, and find opportunities to put new skills into practice – during growth mode there’s always too much to do, so take advantage and gain actual battlefield experience. You should constantly have an image in your mind of where you expect your team to be in 6 months and steer towards that future world. Learning to see around corners allows you to scale independently, and independence is a key leadership trait since <a href="https://staysaasy.com/scaling/2020/05/07/startup-is-this-normal.html">startups are constantly on fire</a>. Finding mentors who are at least 2-3 years ahead of you in terms of their own careers is another great way to build these instincts.</p>

<p>And most importantly, <em>ask questions</em>. Ask your manager how they expect your job will be different in 6 months (if you’re the CEO, this advice will be slightly different –&nbsp;a trusted advisor and/or executive coach can help). Ask them what they see as your current trajectory in the role. In my experience people are way too shy about asking direct questions in general, especially to their managers – it is literally your manager’s job to provide high-quality answers to your career questions. If you nail this, it’s a fast track towards increasing responsibility and growth.</p>

<h3 id="this-isnt-a-bad-thing">This isn’t a bad thing!</h3>

<p>From the other perspective, well-run growth startups give you the regular opportunity to interview for roles that are a level higher (or two!). <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marissamayer/">This</a> is a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcbenioff/">proven way</a> to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericsyuan/">accelerate</a> your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai#Career">career</a>. If you scale with a growing organization, you can pack decades of experience into years.</p>

  <article>
    

    <section>




<p>1300 words, 4 and a half minutes.
<img src="https://blog.eutopian.io/images/huxley-4.jpg" alt="This man was right"></p>

<p>This will probably be the first and last time I write about social networking.</p>

<p>I’m an antisocial social networker. I had an expectation that part of the job of a networking platform (professional or social) would be to filter content or updates, both in terms of who was posting them and the individual significance or quality of the posts. Boy was I wrong. One person re-posts every single article they see, another “motivational” poster repeats blithe optimism without context at the end of every day (tellingly never the beginning). There is the virtue signaller whose primary tactic is to post about people they hate. There is the stream of charity requests, the next more worthy than the last while not one attempts to address the root causes of the suffering they hope to alleviate. Probably because that would be either too hard, too complicated to explain, or in some way conflicts with the value system of those who might otherwise donate money. I digress. Finally, we have the recent US election cycle whose cant and humbug has swamped every communication channel. My choices? Mute, disconnect, or report. Said another way, ignore, gag, or crocodile pit. Not very satisfactory.</p>

<p>I have a preference for quality over quantity. I’m not very interested in constant contact, I maintain a relatively short list of connections/followers/followed. I appreciate that I may not be a person that social networking sites wish to appeal to. That said, I’m not alone. I expect there are many others like me, time-poor, a little impatient, uninterested in much of the public discourse, looking for nuggets of news, information, and important updates from my valued contacts.</p>

<p>Like some <a href="http://www.martingeddes.com/linkedin-lockedin-deleted-account/">other</a> people I rate, I’ve decided not to make LinkedIn my primary platform for this content, although all of it is of a professional nature. I haven’t quit LinkedIn but as a user of a platform I only dip into every once in a while, I am a witness to its decline. The fire alarm hasn’t gone off, I don’t think it’s time to evacuate, but there is a slight whiff of smoke so I’m keeping an eye on the nearest emergency exit. As a result, I don’t want to store content in what could become a closed platform in the future or one I may choose to drift away from. I think LinkedIn picked the right time to <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/microsoft-buys-linkedin-2016-6">sell</a>.</p>

<h3 id="a-prediction">A Prediction</h3>

<p><em>Bear in mind I’m no social media expert.</em></p>

<p>I predict that when a real alternative to LinkedIn appears it will get traction. Furthermore, I predict that the New-LinkedIn’s selling point will be the ability to control the volume and quality of what you see. I’ll even tell you how this could happen.</p>

<ul>
<li>Users could pay the site for more powerful filtering capability.</li>
<li>Filters could be made available from 3rd parties in an App Store selling free and paid-for plug-ins, just like Salesforce.com’s AppExchange.</li>
<li>Moderators could be paid by non-moderators or by the site for their expert curation and filtering skills in some kind of marketplace.</li>
<li>The site could use a state of the art system like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot#Peer_moderation">karma</a> from <a href="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>.</li>
<li>There could be a hierarchy of users where consistent quality contributors are rewarded with access to a larger audience’s feed.</li>
<li>In my New-LinkedIn nirvana, money only buys <em>control</em>. Quality and reputation buy <em>distribution</em>.</li>
<li>There are probably more readers than there are posters, the money-4-control versus reputation-4-distribution thing might work.</li>
<li>What if a reader’s control versus a poster’s distribution could be influenced by the site operator to finely balance the utility of the site to both?</li>
<li>What if the optimum point between control and distribution could be managed automatically via a feedback mechanism?</li>
<li>Those with a high quality/reputation rating <em>could</em> leverage that for nefarious purposes but would see their distribution diminish automatically if they started spewing spammy posts.</li>
<li>If this reputational system sounds familiar, you might have been involved in the <a href="https://www.spamhaus.org/">fight against Email spam</a> before.</li>
</ul>

<p>I can think of at least a dozen different options for monetisation of such a site, none of which involve diluting or harming the user experience, selling personal data, or negatively impacting the site’s value to participants. I’m not ruling out straight advertising if it could be accommodated in such a way that it did not detract from the utility of the site. Having satisfied myself that at least a couple these suggestions are realistic, let’s look at how they might be implemented.</p>

<h3 id="filters">Filters</h3>

<p>Hard-core trolls, paid-for shills, bots, and spammers are all well-understood problems. Just like Email spam, they are by and large a solved problem. So why <em>don’t</em> social network sites solve them? If your business model relies upon this noise then you are not going to eliminate it. There is nothing technically difficult about doing so. The harder problem is what to do about genuine posters who, wonderful people though they may be, spout posts you could well do without.</p>

<p>In the past, I’ve used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem">Bayesian classifiers</a> to beat spam in the days before products were available off the shelf to do so. I’ve also used the same technology in one or two <a href="https://blog.eutopian.io/about/#backchannel">novel applications</a> to classify unstructured or semi-structured text in an automated way, sorting each new never-seen-before message into one of a few dozen buckets. Bayesian isn’t just good for sorting spam from notspam. What if we trained a Bayesian classifier to spot some of those familiar social media posters? The charity fundraiser, the virtue signalling hater, the motivation post spouter.</p>

<ul>
<li>What if we gave the user an option to break each of those and a dozen more auto-classified types of post into buckets or feeds?</li>
<li>What if each feed was constrained to some screen area, or tab, or could be summarised in some way, or even muted?</li>
<li>What if the user could decide the percentage mix of postings he would see in a day of each type before the squelch was automatically turned up on the rest?</li>
<li>What if such a system learned through likes or forwards or reads what sort of updates you tended to enjoy?</li>
<li>What if those kinds of updates could be given prominence at the expense of the rest?</li>
<li>What if the filter could classify a given post as 30% advertorial 70% editorial, and what if you could set a threshold for seeing posts of up to 25% advertorial but no more?</li>
<li>What if the filter could identify that you’d already received 25 permutations of essentially the same thing this month, and handle it accordingly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today, most of what you see is down to your contacts, their proximity to you on the social network graph, and the few groups you’ve bothered to join or companies you follow. If any of those entities start spamming out noise, then it hits. The advanced filtering proposed above is another chance to avoid muting them or unlinking them, it is another chance to control and moderate the fire hose.</p>

<h3 id="convergence-with-collaboration">Convergence With Collaboration</h3>

<p>We already have much of the knowledge of mankind available at our fingertips, we have the technical means to collaborate, soon we will be connected to anyone, anywhere (give it another 10 years). Yet in spite of all of this, collaboration is still limited. Collaboration remains an inefficient market, the best collaborators don’t always find the best co-collaborators, and when they do they don’t always collaborate to maximum effect. Even within one single organisation, like a large corporation, collaboration can be difficult. If the firm is large then a skills matrix gets too big, it is more often than not out of date and may be less useful than just looking on LinkedIn. The Open Source software movement collaborates on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Mailman">mailing lists</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">version control repositories</a>, newsgroups, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Hangouts">chatrooms</a>, but those platforms are not as popular for other disciplines outside of software. For the rest of humanity, social networking is probably the gateway or platform to frictionless collaboration.</p>

<p>Given the pay-off, it’s probably worth someone investing effort in combining social and business networking with collaboration. Such a platform would appeal to the remaining 99% of the population. That won’t happen without the ability for end users to better control the environment. Without that capability, collaboration will remain inefficient and social networking will remain blighted by background noise.</p>

<p>I wonder if the LinkedIn guys have a Microsoft non-compete clause. <a href="https://twitter.com/reidhoffman">Reid</a> are you out there?</p>

    <h3>
      WYSINEUTWYG be damned
    </h3>
    <hr>
    <a href="http://stormrider.io/index.html">blog index</a><br>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I hate WYSINEUTWYG.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all, WYSIWYG is mostly a lie; it's really "What you see is NOT ENTIRELY UNRELATED TO what you get."  Face it; skeuomorphic text editing isn't really that efficient, because you have to break your stride to find the button, or find the modifier key, or double-check that you haven't screwed up the closure...you know the drill.
    </p>
    <p>
      My whole career is really about one thing: parsing text.  My way of learning most new languages is to port the BSD calendar program to it, and I get lost in complicated conversions of text from one format to another.  That parsing extends to writing, which is really just parsing abstract ideas into readable text.  So you might say "writing and parsing text," to be more clear, but it's really all part of the same thing for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I've always tried to escape from any need for a mouse -- or special modifiers -- when editing.  Sure, I might throw it in GoogleDocs or slam it into Word and make it look pretty for the editors, but the whole concept of trying to write something intelligent, while at the same time farting around with format, is just inefficient and damn annoying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lately, I've had much occasion to use the <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">discourse</a> forum.  If you've used it, you probably know the WYSINEUTWYG* editor is pretty decent -- just not ideal for someone who once said, "Life is 90% of my use cases for [emacs]."  Discourse also has a fairly robust API, so I'm doing what any good coder would do: I'm writing my own publishing interface, using that API.
    </p>
    <h3>
      basic requirements
    </h3>
    <p>
      My basic requirements for this tool are simple, but precise:
      </p><ul>
	<li>The tool must pull existing topics from discourse and deposit them in a local file, in perfect discourse markup (no process trash).</li>
	<li>The tool must push local markdown files back to existing topics, replacing the topic text, producing perfect discourse files in the process.</li>
	<li>The tool must create new discourse topics from local files, setting them in perfect discourse format.</li>
      </ul>
      There are also a couple of "nice-to-haves:"
      <ul>
	<li>It would be <em>nice</em> if the tool is able to pull topics and create a filename based on the topic "slug," which is the topic title, stripped of all punctuation, with words separated by dashes, maybe including the topic number on the end of the filename.</li>
	<li>It would be <em>nice</em> if the tool could pull metadata from the discourse topic, like whether it's been deleted or when it was last edited, e.g, and store that separately.</li>
	<li>It would be <em>nice</em> if the tool could pull a range of topics, like, say, all the topics in category "X" that aren't deleted.</li>
	<li>It would be <em>nice</em> if the tool could make copies of a range of topics, like, say, all the undeleted topics in category "X," and create a duplicate set in category "Y" (e.g., for drafting updates to an entire docset).
      </li></ul>
    
    <h3>
      starting point: push and pull existing topics by number
    </h3>
    <p>
      I decided to do this in python, partly because it has some excellent libraries, and partly because it's a relatively new language for me, so it's good practice.  I'm quite sure there are better ways to do this, and I'll probably get lots of suggestions when I post this on HN, which is fine.  Just realize that I'm applying Djikstra's dictum ("don't optimise to start with") and trying to get something that works, and then improve it from there.
    </p>
    <p>
      My "psuedocode" for a first version goes something like this:
      </p><ul>
	<li>Import the libraries, with some exception checking</li>
	<li>Parse command line options (using OptionParser, it's CLI-worth)</li>
	<li>Validate options &amp; reject non-sequiturs with a usage message</li>
	<li>Read credentials from a yaml config file</li>
	<li>Read the topic from discourse to get the post number</li>
	<li>Handle a GET (pull), if that was requested, using the post number</li>
	<li>Handle a PUT (push), if that was requested, also using post number</li>
	<li>Optionally output the intermediate JSON for topic and/or post</li>
      </ul>
      Let me clarify a couple of those things:
      <ol>
	<li>First, I read the topic to get the post number because there's either a bug in the discourse API or I can't get the incantation right to update a topic.  I've tried every combination, so I think it's a bug.</li>
	<li>Second, the credentials are in an external YAML file so that they're not embedded in the code; this is pretty much standard practice, but not everybody does this, so I'm pointing it out.</li>
	<li>Third, I'm adding a way to output the intermediate JSON for topic and/or post, because it's useful if I want to find some other piece of metadata that I want (like, say, when the post was last edited).</li>
      </ol>
      There's also one little "gotcha" in here I havent figured out, so I'm going to work around it: For some reason, article shorter than 9000 characters don't always want to repost.  They give a vague error.  I can solve that, eventually, but for now I'm just going to pad my RAW input out to 9000 characters -- using only space -- if it's short.  Remember that all of the API tools will compress repeated spaces down to one space.  When I tested this technique, it works perfectly and doesn't slow the process down noticeably.
    
    <p>
      So without further adieu, let me just post the code I've written so far, and point to the github so you can play with it.  I'll talk more about it in a next blog:

<p>Free Cloud based CRM systems are hosted on servers at a location designated by the vendor, which could potentially be anywhere in the world. But generally the CRM vendor will try to align server location to the locale of the customer, and sometimes will allow the customer to choose the server location.</p>



<p>A user or group of users will be provided access to assign and manage user login credentials for other users within their organization. Any user who has been provided an active login can login into the application and access the data online over the internet via a web browser. </p>



<p>If a system administrator deletes or deactivates a user, that user will still be able to access the CRM login page, but will no longer be able log in and therefore no longer has access to the data and application.</p>

The code for each technique is included under the corresponding Implementation heading.</em></p>

<h2 id="section-0"><a href="#section-0">Background</a></h2>

<h3 id="section-1"><a href="#section-1">Taylor series</a></h3>

<p>To motivate the definition of $e$, we will recall some calculus. Let $f$ be a <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SmoothFunction.html">smooth</a> function at $a$. This is to say that $f$ is infinitely <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Differentiable.html">differentiable</a> at some real value $a$: for every $k^{\text{th}}$ derivative $f^{(k)}$, we can differentiate $f^{(k)}$ again to obtain the $(k + 1)^{\text{th}}$ derivative $f^{(k + 1)}$. By definition, any function with this property which can also be uniquely represented as a <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TaylorSeries.html">Taylor series</a> expansion “centered” at $a$ is called <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RealAnalyticFunction.html">analytic</a>. The Taylor series of $f$ centered at $a$ and evaluated at $x$ is defined to be</p>

<p>$$
f(x) = \frac{f(a)}{0!}(x - a)^0 + \frac{f’(a)}{1!}(x - a)^1 + \ldots + \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x - a)^k + \ldots
$$</p>

<p>This is a <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PowerSeries.html">power series</a>, or infinite polynomial with one variable. The center of expansion determines a neighborhood of values returned by the Taylor series, and the coefficient of each <em>Taylor term</em> is determined by repeatedly differentiating the function $f$ and evaluating it at $a$. A common center of expansion is $a$ = 0, in which case the Taylor series is also called a <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MaclaurinSeries.html">Maclaurin series</a> and the series is centered around the origin. This can be considered the “default” setting. If you cut off all terms of the Taylor expansion after some term $k$, you obtain a polynomial with degree $k$. The coefficient of the $k^{\text{th}}$ term of the series (or polynomial, if truncated) is given by</p>

<p>$$
a_{k} = \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}
$$</p>

<p>where 0! = 1.</p>

<p>For a concrete example, consider the Taylor series expansion of the <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Sine.html">sine</a> function. The sine function is not only infinitely differentiable, but cyclic.</p>

<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\sin^{(1)}(x) &amp;= \cos(x), \\
\sin^{(2)}(x) &amp;= \cos^{(1)}(x) = -\sin(x), \\
\sin^{(3)}(x) &amp;= -\sin^{(1)}(x) = -\cos(x), \\
\sin^{(4)}(x) &amp;= -\cos^{(1)}(x) = \sin(x)
\end{aligned}
$$</p>

<p>We determine each $k^{\text{th}}$ coefficient of the Taylor series by evaluating $f^{(k)}$ at $a$ and dividing it by the factorial of $k$. If we want to expand the sine function around the origin ($a$ = 0), we obtain the cyclic coefficients</p>

<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\sin(0) &amp;= 0, \\
\sin^{(1)}(0) &amp;= \cos(0) = 1, \\
\sin^{(2)}(0) &amp;= \cos^{(1)}(0) = -\sin(0) = 0, \\
\sin^{(3)}(0) &amp;= -\sin^{(1)}(0) = -\cos(0) = -1, \\
\sin^{(4)}(0) &amp;= -\cos^{(1)}(0) = \sin(0) = 0
\end{aligned}
$$</p>

<p>Since $(x - 0)^{k} = x^{k}$, we have the Taylor series expansion</p>

<p>$$
\sin(x) = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \frac{x^9}{9!} - \ldots
$$</p>

<p>Truncating the Taylor expansion of a function $f$ at any term $k$ gives a finite approximation of $f$ using the $k$ degree <em>Taylor polynomial</em>. A Taylor polynomial of $f$ centered at $a$ produces very accurate approximations of $f(x)$ when $x$ is relatively close to $a$. As the absolute value of $x$ increases away from $a$, the accuracy of the Taylor polynomial rapidly decreases, which means it requires more terms of the Taylor series (i.e. a higher degree polynomial) for accurate approximation. Consider the following plot, which shows the values of $\sin(x)$ over the interval $[-20, 20]$ compared to its Taylor polynomials of degree 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 centered at $a$ = 0.</p>

<figure>
  <p><a href="https://www.pseudorandom.com/assets/images/articles/implementing-exp/sin_taylor_series.svg"><img src="https://www.pseudorandom.com/assets/images/articles/implementing-exp/sin_taylor_series.svg"></a></p>
  <figcaption>$T_{n}$ denotes the degree $n$ Taylor polynomial of $\sin$</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Observe that the Taylor approximation of $\sin(x)$ is more accurate when $x$ is near $a$ = 0, but quickly flies away from the true value of $\sin(x)$ further away from 0. The degree 1 Taylor polynomial is only an accurate approximation for $\sin(x)$ for a very small interval near the origin, whereas the degree 9 Taylor polynomial is very accurate within $[-5, 5]$. How long the approximation holds until it becomes extremely inaccurate depends on the number of terms of the Taylor polynomial. A higher degree polynomial will maintain a better approximation of $\sin(x)$ for longer, but any finite polynomial will eventually become extremely inaccurate.</p>

<h3 id="section-2"><a href="#section-2">Defining $e$</a></h3>

<p>The <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/e.html">mathematical constant</a> $e$ is (almost) entirely motivated by the very nice properties it exhibits under exponentiation. In particular, the definition of $e$ was born out of the desire to find a continuous function which is its own derivative and which maps the additive identity 0 to the multiplicative identity 1. This is because solving difficult integration and differentiation problems is vastly more expedient with such a function. By extension a significant fraction of problems in applied mathematics and physics reduce to solving differential equations, for which such a function is fundamental.</p>

<p>As it happens, $f(x) = e^x$ uniquely satisfies this property. We can show this, and define $e$ directly in the process, by starting from the Taylor series representation of an arbitrary function $f$ infinitely differentiable at $a$ = 0. Suppose $a_0, a_1, \ldots$ are the coefficients of the Taylor series of $f$ centered at $a$. Then we have the Taylor series</p>

<p>$$
f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + \ldots
$$</p>

<p>It follows from the linearity of differentiation that the Taylor series expansion of the first derivative $f’$ is</p>

<p>$$
f’(x) = a_1 + 2a_2 x + 3a_3 x^2 + \ldots
$$</p>

<p>To determine a function which is its own derivative, we solve for the coefficients $a_0, a_1, \ldots$ which satisfy $f = f’$:</p>

<p>$$
a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \ldots = a_1 + 2a_2 x + 3a_3 x^2 + \ldots
$$</p>

<p>From here we can see the pattern</p>

<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
a_0 &amp;= a_1, \\
a_1 &amp;= 2a_2, \\
a_2 &amp;= 3a_3
\end{aligned}
$$</p>

<p>and so on, which is equivalent to</p>

<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
a_1 &amp;= a_0, \\
a_2 &amp;= \frac{a_1}{2}, \\
a_3 &amp;= \frac{a_2}{3}
\end{aligned}
$$</p>

<p>By induction we have a <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RecurrenceEquation.html">recurrence relation</a> which defines the $k^{\text{th}}$ coefficient $a_k$</p>

<p>$$
a_k = \frac{a_{k - 1}}{k}
$$</p>

<p>Given $a_0$ = 1, we find that the Taylor series of a function which is its own derivative is</p>

<p>$$
f(x) = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \ldots.
$$</p>

<p>We denote this function with $e^x$, where $e$ is defined to be the value of this function at $x$ = 1.</p>

<p>$$
e = f(1) = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k!} = 2.7183\ldots
$$</p>

<p>A more intuitive illustration of why $e^x$ is special is given by the following graph, in which exponential functions with various bases are plotted alongside their derivatives. An exponential function with a base less than $e$, like $b$ = 2, grows more quickly than its derivative. But when the base is greater than $e$, like $b$ = 4, it grows less quickly than its derivative.</p>

  <figcaption>When $b &lt; e$, we have $f'(x) &lt; f(x)$. When $b &gt; e$, we have $f'(x) &gt; f(x)$. But $b = e$ is the "goldilocks" base at which $f'(x) = f(x)$.</figcaption>

<h3 id="section-3"><a href="#section-3">Floating point</a></h3>

<p>There is an intrinsic tension in that we want to determine accurate values of $e^x$ without doing too much work. Before we can consider the efficiency of an algorithm, we need to consider its accuracy. This leads us to define a variety of types of error, the most important of which comes from the way we approximate real numbers. It’s often impossible to calculate the exact value of $f(x)$ for an arbitrary function $f$, because computers can’t work with arbitrary real numbers.<label for="cb-3"><sup id="footnote-3"><span>3</span></sup></label><span><p>3:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_all">Almost all</a> real numbers are not <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ComputableNumber.html">computable</a>. The reals which are computable are frequently not exactly representable to a desirable level of accuracy because they’re either irrational (and therefore have infinite decimal expansions) or rational with very long decimal expansions.</p></span> The best we can do is approximate the value to some acceptable accuracy.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE 754</a> <em>floating point</em> standard discretizes real intervals into a computable form by mapping all nearby real values in given neighborhoods to a single rounded value. Internally, an IEEE 754 binary floating point number $N$ is represented using the normalized form</p>

<p>$$
N = \pm b_1.b_2b_3 \ldots b_p \times 2^{E_{k}}
$$</p>

<p>where the first bit is allocated for the sign (the <em>sign bit</em>), the $p$ bits $b_1.b_2b_3 \ldots b_p$ comprise the <em>mantissa</em>, or <em>significand</em>, and $E_{k}$ is an integer exponent consisting of $k$ bits. Note that since this form is normalized, $b_1 = 1$, while each of $b_2, \ldots b_p$ may equal 0 or 1. IEEE 754 single precision binary floating point numbers have a total size of $32$ bits: $8$ are allocated for the exponent $E \in [-126, 127]$ and $23$ are allocated for the mantissa (with $p$ = 24 accounting for the normalized bit). Thus you can represent $2^{32}$ different values in single precision floating point, with underflow and overflow limits of $2^{127} \approx 3.4 \times 10^{38}$ and $2^{-126} …</p></article></div>

It sells the idea that you install a client and don’t have to think about it again. This requires reliability that has to start with Let’s Encrypt itself. We can now see that with KeyChest.</p>

<p>The problem of any automation is that it breaks without warning. Let’s Encrypt is brilliant in providing us with certificates. What it does not offer is any service beyond that. The service that would mitigate the risk of 6 renewals instead of usual one.</p>
<p>It is not unusual to build own infrastructure monitoring but what should you do when renewals suddenly start failing. Has something happened on your servers or is the Let’s Encrypt certification authority down?</p>
<p>Let’s Encrypt has its own manually edited status page - <a href="https://letsencrypt.status.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://letsencrypt.status.io</a><span>. I used this for a couple of uptime analysis before. It provides more detail than any other verification authority (CA) provides but it still contains a lot of uncertainty.</span></p>
<p>We have now launched an independent monitoring of Let’s Encrypt CA. It continually request certificates and stores detailed information for each response. This allows a detailed view into the Let’s Encrypt performance.</p>

<h2><span>First Downtime Detection </span></h2>
<p>When we were &nbsp;checking for errors in log files on 25 June, we suddenly saw loads of failures. It didn’t occur to us that we can actually see a real time a Let’s Encrypt downtime. I confess that we had to improve data processing to see the downtime in the dashboard. Eventually we could see what the monitoring servers detected.</p>

<p><em>Figure: The first detection of a Let’s Encrypt Downtime</em>.</p>
<p>What I find amazing is that our servers detected the downtime 11 minutes before Let’s Encrypt did it itself. <a href="https://letsencrypt.status.io/pages/history/55957a99e800baa4470002da" rel="noopener" target="_blank">It’s official entry</a> states the start of the incident at 7:04am. We looked at our logs and that was the moment when the internet facing RESTful API started returning a new error after its caching was exhausted.</p>
<p>Here is a brief dissection of failures recorded by our monitoring servers.</p>
<h3>Frankfurt</h3>
<p>What can we see in the test logs? Let's have a look at the&nbsp; Frankfurt server:</p>
<p><code>06:53:45 - failed to create a <strong>new_account</strong> - connection was refused</code></p>
<p><code>06:53:44 - <strong>new_order</strong> - the initial message starting an issuance transaction failed with an error message "No Key ID in JWS header" - HTTP code 400</code></p>
<p>(at this point "dir" and "nonce" request worked correctly)</p>
<p><code>06:54:07 -&nbsp; <strong>new_account</strong> fails again - the message is "Unknown desc = failed to select one blockedKeys" and also&nbsp; "Too&nbsp; many connections"</code></p>
<p>The server continued attempts to initiate renewals in 30 second intervals. Each attempt included:</p>
<ul>
<li>dir - request for a list of the API endpoints - correct response</li>
<li>nonce - request for a new random transaction nonce - correct reponse</li>
<li>new_account - "failed to select one blockedKeys" / '"Too many connections"</li>
<li>new_order&nbsp; - "No Key ID in JWS header"</li>
</ul>
<p>The responses were the same up to <strong>07:06:38am</strong>. At this point the "dir" command fails with <strong>HTTP code 503 - Service Unavailable</strong>. At this point, Let's Encrypt seems to have noticed a problem.</p>
<p>The "dir" command continued to fail till <strong>07:16:53</strong>&nbsp; when it returned the first correct response. And the server got the first certificate finalized at <strong>7:17:00</strong>.</p>
<h3>Mombai</h3>
<p>The Mombai server has shown the first failure on the "finalize" command&nbsp; - submission of the CSR.</p>
<p>0<code>6:53:58 - <strong>new_order</strong> fails with an error "Error retrieving account", HTTP code 500</code></p>
<p><code>06:59:27 - attempt for new_account fails with "Unknown desc = failed to select one blockedKeys"</code></p>

<p>errors now become identical to those recorded by the Frankfurt server.</p>
<p><code>07:07:26 - the <strong>dir</strong> command fails for the first time.</code></p>
<p>The first correct response&nbsp; was then&nbsp; received&nbsp; at&nbsp; <strong>07:16:54</strong>.</p>
<h3>Singapore</h3>
<p>The Singapore server recorded the first failure at&nbsp; <strong>06:53:54</strong> when the new_order was refused.</p>
<p>The events were similar to those on the Mombai server with the first dir failing at <strong>07:07:09</strong>. And the recovery at <strong>07:16:53</strong>.</p>
<h3>N. Virginia</h3>
<p>The server in N. Virginia, US detected the first failure at 06:53:33 and the recovery is shown at <strong>07:16:53</strong>.</p>

<h2>System Design</h2>
<p>the monitoring system consists of completely autonomous servers that collect the performance data. This is transformed into hourly stats and compiled into reports once a week.&nbsp;<br>Online reports query the monitoring servers directly to obtain fresh data that is then presented to the visitors of <a href="https://keychest.net/letsencrypt" rel=" noopener">https://keychest.net/letsencrypt</a>.</p>

<p><br>We believe that the monitoring only makes sense if it provides a sufficient granularity and also a good reliability of its results. We decided that we use 4 or more monitoring servers running in different locations. Locations provided by Amazon data centers. The setup consists of:</p>
<p>Production Let’s Encrypt monitoring:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mombai, India</li>
<li>Frankfurt, Germany</li>
<li>Singapore</li>
<li>N. Virginia, US</li>
</ul>
<p>As we have to comply with rate limits, we monitor the production Let’s Encrypt API (application interface) with 400 domain names. this allows us to run monitoring with two transactions per minute.</p>
<p>Staging Let’s Encrypt monitoring:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ohio, US</li>
<li>N. California, US</li>
<li>Tokyo, Japan</li>
<li>London, UK</li>
<li>Sydney, Australia</li>
</ul>
<div><p>The monitoring here is more frequent - at four transactions per minute.</p></div>

      <h2 id="new-blog-series-deep-learning-papers-visualized">New blog series: Deep Learning Papers visualized</h2>
<p>This is the first post of a new series I am starting where I explain the content of a paper in a visual picture-based way.
To me, this helps tremendously to better grasp the ideas and remember them and I hope this will be the same for many of you as well.</p>
<h2 id="todays-paper-accurate-large-minibatch-sgd-training-imagenet-in-1-hour-by-goyal-et-al">Today’s paper: Accurate, Large Minibatch SGD: Training ImageNet in 1 Hour by Goyal et al.</h2>
<p>The first paper I’ve chosen is well-known when it comes to training deep learning models on multiple GPUs. Here is the link to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02677">paper of Goyal et al.</a> on arxiv.
The basic idea of the paper is this: when you are doing deep learning research today, you are using more and more data and more complex models. As the complexity and size rises, of course also the computational needs rise tremendously. This means that you typically need much longer to train a model to convergence.
But if you need longer to train a model, your feedback loop is long which is frustrating as you already get many other ideas in the mean time, but as it takes so long to train, you cannot try them all out.
So what can you do?</p>
<p>You can train on multiple GPUs at the same time and in theory get results faster the more GPUs you use. Assume you need 1 week to train your model on a single GPU, then with 2 GPUs in parallel, you should be able to achieve the same training in about 3.5 days and when using 7 GPUs you only need a day.</p>
<p>So how does it work to train your model on multiple GPUs? Typically, data parallelization is used which simply means that when you have your epoch, you send some distinct data to each distinct GPU. But then how do you get a model that benefits from all the data? Basically, you always synchronize the gradients, so after each batch, you collect the gradients from each GPU, calculate the average of the gradients over all GPUs and then adjust the model weights.</p>
<p>Let’s take a visual look at this:</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="https://www.paepper.com/blog/posts/accurate-large-minibatch-sgd-training-image-net-in-1-hour/multi_gpu_training_batch_sizes.png" alt="Training the same amount of data on 1 vs 2 vs 4 GPUs">
    
      <figcaption>Training the same amount of data on 1 vs 2 vs 4 GPUs</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


<h3 id="increasing-the-batch-size---increasing-the-learning-rate">Increasing the batch size -&gt; increasing the learning rate</h3>
<p>Note what happens when you do this: your batch size is rising!
Let’s say you have 200 images per epoch and your batch size is 10. Then for a single GPU, you have 20 batches per epoch à 10 images. If you train on 2 GPUs, then your batch size is twice the size: 20. That’s because each of your two GPUs gets 10 images and calculates the gradients of those 10 and then you take the average of the gradients of those 2 GPUs, so your gradients are averaged over 20 images. This means that your epoch now only has 10 batches per epoch à 20 images. So by increasing the batch size, your are also reducing the number of batches per epoch and this in turn is exactly why it’s almost (except for the synchronization overhead) twice as fast to train.
Similarly, if you were to use 4 GPUs, then each GPU receives 10 images per batch, so your effective batch size is 40. Thus, you only need 5 batches per epoch to train your 200 images.</p>
<p>But in turn, if you only use 5 batches per epoch instead of 20, that also means that you are only taking 5 gradient descent steps instead of 20 on a single GPU.
We need to take a look what that means:</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="https://www.paepper.com/blog/posts/accurate-large-minibatch-sgd-training-image-net-in-1-hour/formula_3_and_4.png" alt="Equations 3 and 4 from the paper">
    
      <figcaption>Equations 3 and 4 from the paper</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


<p>Equation 3 represents the single GPU case after k iterations, in our case let’s take k = 4, so after 4 batches. This means we were updating our weights 4 times which is the first sum with j &lt; k, so j=0, j=1, j=2 and j=3. The second sum is the loop over the images in the corresponding batch and we calculate the gradient ($\nabla l$) determined by our weights at that time t+j and the image example x. We divide everything by n which is just the batch size, so n=10 in our example case and multiply by the learning rate $\eta$.</p>
<p>In contrast, equation 4 represents the multi GPU case for 4 GPUs (as we had k = 4). The 4 GPUs only take a single gradient descent step as the batch size is 4 times as large ($kn=4*10=40$). In this case, the first sum with j &lt; k is over our 4 GPUs and the seconds sum over the batch of each individual GPU. As we take the average of all of these, we divide by $kn=40$. This means that our step is k times smaller.</p>
<p>Now, the main idea of the paper is that we can make sure that the step size is roughly the same by scaling up our learning rate by the number of GPUs we are using: $\hat{\eta}=k * \eta$.
By doing so, equations 3 and 4 become roughly the same, because $\hat{\eta} * \frac{1}{kn} = k*\eta * \frac{1}{kn} = \eta * \frac{k}{kn} = \eta * \frac{1}{n}$.</p>
<p>Or to visualize:</p>

      <figcaption>Four SGD steps on a single GPU is a single step with four GPUs</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


<h3 id="intuition">Intuition</h3>
<p>To summarize so far: when we increase the number of GPUs to train with, we are increasing the effective batch size which leads to less batches per epoch and thus less SGD training steps. To compensate for less steps, we need to scale the learning rate linearly. This is simple: multiply the original single GPU learning rate by the number of GPUs you are using to train now. For example if your learning rate was 1e-3 before with a single GPU and now you train with 4 GPUs, then simply increase it to 4e-3.</p>
<p>Why does it intuitively make sense to scale the learning rate?</p>
<p>When your batch size is larger you will get a better estimate of the direction of the gradient in the right direction -&gt; your gradients are less fuzzy. Thus, when you have a more representative gradient, it makes sense to be able to take a larger step as the likelihood of walking in the wrong direction is reduced by the larger sample of examples.</p>
<p>Here is an illustration with the single GPU model taking 4 small steps (yellow) and the 4 GPU model taking 1 larger step (blue; the learning rate is multiplied by 4, so the step is four times as large):</p>

  <figure>

Red circle is the target / optimal weight configuration. Starting from a weight initialization in the left of the image, the single GPU model (yellow) takes 4 noisy steps. In contrast, the 4 GPU model (blue) takes a single larger step in a better approximated direction.">
    
      <figcaption>Illustration of gradient steps in the weight space. Red circle is the target / optimal weight configuration. Starting from a weight initialization in the left of the image, the single GPU model (yellow) takes 4 noisy steps. In contrast, the 4 GPU model (blue) takes a single larger step in a better approximated direction.</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


<h3 id="problem-initial-large-learning-rates">Problem: initial large learning rates</h3>
<p>The authors note that the learning process is most vulnerable in the beginning, because the weights are initialized at random and steps in the wrong direction can lead to a suboptimal space. Thus, they argue that the learning rate should not be immediately set to the higher value, but rather a learning rate annealing schedule should be used, so it starts low and then increases over time.</p>
<p>They try out different warm-up schedules and conclude that it works best to warm-up over 5 epochs, so that after 5 epochs the maximal learning rate is reached. However, I already observed machine learning models where a longer warm-up period is required, so you should try it out for your own problem.</p>
<p>How does this look like in practice? Assume your learning rate for single GPU training is 1e-3. So you want to end up at 4e-3 when training with 4 GPUs. So you need to add the learning rate (4-1) times to itself over 5 epochs: $lr_{epoch} = lr_{single-gpu} + lr_{single-gpu} * (n-1) * (epoch / 5)$. Here, $lr_{epoch}$ is the learning rate to use in a given epoch, $lr_{single-gpu}$ is the initial learning rate, n is the number of GPUs and epoch is your epoch.</p>
<p>And this is how this warm-up looks like over epochs:</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>While the paper goes into more details, I discussed the most practical aspects of it and tried to visualize the key parts.</p>
<p>In particular, when training your machine learning model with multiple GPUs, you should scale your learning rate linearly with the number of GPUs you are using.
However, due to initial instability, use a learning rate warmup period which scales the learning rate linearly over the first couple of epochs.
By doing so, you are able to achieve similar loss curves as in the single GPU training.</p>
<p>The authors were able to train a ResNet-50 on ImageNet with a batch size of 8192 (!) on 256 GPUs at the same time and thus needing only 1 hour to train ImageNet. When the increased the batch size further than this, however, the accuracy got worse than the single GPU training, so there is still a (high) limit to how much you can reduce the training time by using more GPUs.</p>
<p>If you want to see how to implement this in PyTorch, check out <a href="https://www.paepper.com/blog/posts/pytorch-multi-gpu-training-for-faster-machine-learning-results/">my article PyTorch multi-GPU training for faster machine learning results</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-spent-my-summer">how I spent my summer</h3>

<p>A few months ago, I decided to implement set operations on curved regions.  I had the <a href="https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540779735">the canonical textbook on computational geometry</a>, which described approaches for polygons comprised of straight lines, and it seemed like <a href="http://paperjs.org/">other projects</a> had extended these techniques to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve">parametric curves</a>.  I figured it would take a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the field of computational geometry embodies a fundamental contradiction.  In geometry, the angles of a triangle add up to exactly π radians, and if <em>u</em> is clockwise from <em>v</em> then <em>v</em> must be counter-clockwise from <em>u</em>.  Computers, on the other hand, use floating point representations which make a mockery of these simple Euclidean truths.</p>

<p>The academic literature largely ignores this.  Algorithms are proven to be geometrically sound, and robust implementations are left as an exercise for the reader.  This is akin to a world in which hash collisions caused unavoidable data loss, and the academic response was to implicitly assume the existence of a perfect hash function.  If a paper is predicated on unrealistic assumptions, we cannot evaluate it on its own terms; we must understand, empirically, how well it functions when these assumptions are broken.</p>

<p>With this in mind, we can now look at the existing algorithms for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(computer_graphics)">polygon clipping</a>, which is the term of art for polygon set operations.  Every technique is a variation on a common theme:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-clipping.png" alt=""></p>

<ul>
  <li>Given two or more rings, find every point of intersection</li>
  <li>Segment the rings at the points of intersection</li>
  <li>Decide whether each segment should be included, based on the operation being performed</li>
</ul>

<p>The dozen or so papers on this subject differ only in the third step.  Since our decision to include a segment typically inverts at an intersection point, they describe a variety of approaches for using our decision to about one segment to inform our decision about adjacent segments.</p>

<p>My textbook described a method using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_connected_edge_list">doubly-connected edge lists</a>, which is a generic geometric data structure.  I assumed that meant it could be reused for other problems, so I started my implementation.</p>

<p>A month went by.</p>

<p>I had finished the implementation my first week, but it wasn’t reliable.  A DCEL is a collection of linked loops, which can be incrementally updated.  When performing a set operation, we incrementally bisect the original set of loops, and then determine which should and shouldn’t be included.  Despite my best efforts, I kept finding new shapes that caused adjacent faces to get tangled together, creating a Möbius strip that is simultaneously inside and outside the expected result.</p>

<p>Slowly, I realized the problem wasn’t the data structure, it was the first step that every paper glossed over: finding all the intersections.  The DCEL assumes the edges at a vertex have a total ordering: the previous edge is directly clockwise, and the next one is directly counter-clockwise.  If we miss an intersection, we might conclude two curves are both clockwise relative to the other, causing everything to fall apart.</p>

<p>I began to look for better ways to find intersections, hoping that if I found an approach that was sufficiently accurate, my work on the DCEL could be salvaged.  Unfortunately, the approaches I found in the literature and implemented in the wild were no better than what I had been using.  My data structure demanded precise inputs, without internal contradictions, and I couldn’t deliver.</p>

<p>At that point, I began to wonder if I had missed something fundamental.  I thought maybe if I dissected how other, more mature, libraries handled my pathological shapes, I could work backwards to see where I had gone wrong.  But when I began to feed these shapes into well-established projects like paper.js, I found they failed just as badly.</p>

<p>To find my pathological inputs, I had been using property-based testing.  Given a random combination of shapes, I would perform a point-in-region test and compare it to a reference result, generated by querying each shape individually and combining the results according to the operation.  Most inputs worked fine, but after a few hundred thousand inputs it would inevitably find some failure.</p>

<p>Other projects, it turned out, had been a little less eager to find their own failure modes.  Some only had a handful of example-based tests, others had a static suite of a few thousand inputs they used to validate their changes.  If I had missed something, it appeared to be that no one else expected these operations to be particularly robust.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="why-is-this-so-hard">why is this so hard?</h3>

<p>Floating point arithmetic is best understood through a simple, maddening fact: <code>a + (b - a)</code> does not necessarily equal <code>b</code>.  It might be equal, or it might be off by just a little, where “little” is relative to the larger of the two numbers.  This means that when we compare two floating point numbers, we cannot do a precise comparison, we have to ask whether they differ by less than some <em>epsilon</em> value.</p>

<p>This epsilon represents the level of numerical uncertainty to which we’ve resigned ourselves.  There is vast folk wisdom around how to minimize this uncertainty, but the fact remains that every arithmetic operation injects a bit of uncertainty, and it grows cumulatively with each successive operation.  When dealing with small numbers, this uncertainty may dwarf the values themselves.</p>

<p>An intersection, in a precise mathematical sense, occurs wherever the distance between the curves is exactly zero:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-precise-intersection.png" alt=""></p>

<p>But in a practical sense, it is wherever the distance between the curves is close enough to zero:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-fuzzy-intersection.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This has at least one intersection, but we could just as easily return three or ten within that overlapping range.  This uncertainty is anathema to the published techniques, which rely on counting these intersections to determine whether we’re inside or outside the other shape.  A single spurious intersection may cause the entire result to vanish.  If two objects with similar curvature move across each other, the result will tend to flicker in and out of existence.</p>

<p>These techniques may suffice for straight lines, which require smaller epsilons, but they are wholly unsuited to the relative imprecision of parametric curves.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="embracing-the-uncertainty">embracing the uncertainty</h3>

<p>As the weeks passed, the errors uncovered by my tests went from feeling random to feeling malicious.  Floating point arithmetic may be deterministic, but as I watched my screen, waiting for the tests to fail, I imagined a demon in the FPU nudging the values as they flowed past, trying to move them beyond the threshold of self-consistency.</p>

<p>One day, I realized this was exactly the narrative behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction">error-correcting codes</a>; we assume our data has been randomly altered en route, and we want to return it to a consistent state.  It didn’t seem like I could get it right the first time, so why not just fix it afterwards?</p>

<p>Consider the union of two ellipses:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-two-ellipses.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Ostensibly, there should only be three points of intersection, one on the left and two on the right.  But for the reasons described above, any intersection routine will likely find multiple points of intersection on the left as the curves converge on each other:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-ellipses-intersections.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The segments on the left are small enough, and thus imprecise enough, that our spatial intuition for the problem will just mislead us.  For this reason, it’s better to think of it as a graph:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-ellipses-graph.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Now we have to decide which edges to include, and which to exclude.  Since we’re trying to find the union, we want to keep any segments that are outside the other shape:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-ellipses-valid-result.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This is a well-formed result; there is a single cycle, and once we remove that cycle there are no leftover edges.  But we can’t rely on getting this lucky; the edges on the left might have succumbed to floating point error and believed they were both inside the other:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-ellipses-incomplete.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This is not a well-formed result; there are no cycles, and a bunch of leftover edges.  To make this consistent, we need to either close the loop, or remove the leftovers.  The cost of these changes is measured by the aggregate length of the edges we are adding or removing.</p>

<p>The minimal set of changes is equivalent to the shortest path between the dangling vertices.  Having found the path, we then invert the inclusion of every edge it passes through.  In this case, it passes through one of the edges we originally excluded, so we add that edge back in, and return the cycle we just created.</p>

<p>Alternately, both edges might think they are outside the other:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-ellipses-redundant.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In this case, we have a complete cycle, but once we’ve extracted it there’s a single leftover edge:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-ellipses-leftover.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Here again, we search through all the remaining edges for the shortest path between the two dangling vertices.  Since it passes through our leftover edge, we remove it.</p>

<p>Every floating point inconsistency will surface as one of these two cases, or some combination thereof.  By searching for the shortest path between the dangling edges, we find the smallest possible edit that will yield a consistent result.  Of course, a consistent result is not necessarily the <em>correct</em> one, but the fact that floating point errors tend to cluster around the smallest edges makes this a reasonable heuristic.  More importantly, it has weathered tens of millions of generative test cases without any issues.</p>

<p>A complete implementation of this algorithm can be found <a href="https://github.com/lacuna/artifex/blob/master/src/io/lacuna/artifex/utils/regions/Clip.java">here</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>I’m not sure if this is a novel approach, but at the very least it represents a meaningful improvement on the state of the art in open source.  Intuitively, it feels like this might be a means to avoid epsilon hell in a wide range of geometric and numerical algorithms.  If anyone is aware of prior art in this vein, I’d be very interested to see it.</p>

<p>My work on the <a href="https://github.com/lacuna/artifex">Artifex</a> library is ongoing, but I hope it proves useful to others, and look forward to sharing my own projects that it will enable in the near future.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>As probably anyone who has asked me about my programming experience has heard, my first real foray into the FOSS community was being a <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=1964056">LineageOS co-maintainer</a> (as HaoZeke) for the Xperia Z5 Dual. I haven’t thought about the community all that much for a few years, mostly since XDA became pretty toxic, and Android development just got, less exciting.</p>
<h2 id="the-email">The Email</h2>
<p>I recieved two of these from different accounts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you so much for your contribution to making my phone the phone it is!</p>
<p>Have a great day!</p>

<p>This was completely unexpected, and really made my day. In reterospect this seems like something which should be made more explicit, more often.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>My go-to editor of choice today is VSCode with the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim">VSCodeVim extension</a>. I won't go into why VSCode and Vim are great 😄. Instead, here are some tips for Vim users in VSCode.</p><p>VSCodeVim is a community VSCode plugin that adds good (though not perfect) Vim emulation. It also includes a few popular Vim plugin features. Overall, I'm quite happy with this combination. My main gripes are with performance and responsiveness (compared to Vim) but the extra VSCode features are well worth it for me.</p><p>It's worth scrolling through the VSCodeVim <a href="https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/blob/master/README.md">README</a>, which is packed with features. Here are some of my favorites.</p><h2>VSCodeVim Tricks</h2><p>The <a href="https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim#-vscodevim-tricks">VSCodeVim tricks</a> section includes <code>g d</code> (go-to definition) and <code>g h</code> (show hover tooltip). Note that you can often mix-and-match VSCode shortcuts. For example, I use <code>⌘ + d</code> (VSCode shortcut to add next search selection) instead of VSCodeVim's <code>g b</code>. I usually follow multiple selections with <code>c</code> to change the selections.</p><p>Many of VSCode features are built for mouse navigation. Some of these includes <code>⌘ + click</code>, <code>⌥ + ⌘ + click</code>, etc. With Vim, we want to stay on the keyboard as much as possible. I recommend browsing the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_keyboard-shortcuts-editor">keyboard shortcuts editor</a> and adding your own keymaps. One of my favorite commands is <code>editor.action.revealDefinitionAside</code>, which opens the definition of the current symbol under your cursor in a split. I map this to <code>g D</code>.</p><pre><p><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>"vim.normalModeKeyBindings"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"before"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"g"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"D"</span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"commands"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"editor.action.revealDefinitionAside"</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre><h2>Easymotion</h2><p>VSCodeVim comes with built-in <a href="https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim#vim-easymotion">easymotion</a>! If you're not familiar with the Vim <a href="https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion">plugin</a>, easymotion shows markers for Vim motions, allowing you to jump to a target. The ones I use are search by two characters and start of line forwards and backwards. To turn on this plugin, set the VSCode setting <code>"vim.easymotion": true</code></p><p>I use easymotion A LOT, pretty much for any motion that isn't on the same line. I map <code>s</code> to easymotion 2 char and <code>⌃ + j</code> <code>⌃ + k</code> to easymotion line forwards backwards, respectively.</p><pre><p><span>"vim.normalModeKeyBindingsNonRecursive"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"before"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"s"</span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"after"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"&lt;leader&gt;"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"&lt;leader&gt;"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"2"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"s"</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"before"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"&lt;C-j&gt;"</span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"after"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"&lt;leader&gt;"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"&lt;leader&gt;"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"j"</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"before"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"&lt;C-k&gt;"</span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"after"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"&lt;leader&gt;"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"&lt;leader&gt;"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"k"</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>]</span></p></pre><h2>Semantic selections</h2><p>Did you know that VSCode has <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_shrinkexpand-selection">semantic selections</a>? You can expand and shrink your text selection powered by the language service (e.g. TypeScript). It almost works with VSCodeVim with the caveat that you need to press <code>v</code> before inputting your action, even though it already looks like a visual selection.</p><p>It's worth noting VSCodeVim has its own expand motion <code>a f</code> but it is not semantic. However, it does the right thing 90% of the time and may be worth using as your default because of the tighter integration.</p><h2>Surround</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim#vim-surround">vim-surround</a> emulation is worth a mention. It provides operations to work with surrounding characters like parentheses, braces, quotes, etc. If you are working on web frontend, it makes it easy to wrap things with XML tags.</p><p><code>S [desired char]</code> will wrap your visual selection. A common operation I perform is select a chunk of text in visual mode and then type <code>S &lt;div&gt;</code> to wrap it in a div tag (obviously replace with tag of choice). You can even type attributes <code>S &lt;div className="foo"&gt;</code> but the input is hidden until you close the tag. Similarly, wrap with <code>S {</code> <code>S (</code> etc.</p><p>Editor tips are never comprehensive but I hope you found something to add to your toolkit. <a href="https://twitter.com/_paulshen">Tell me</a> your favorites!</p><p>June 27, 2020</p></article></div></div>]]>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This post introduces the architecture of a <em>distributed storage engine</em> that satisfies various storage requirements.</p>

<h2 id="local-storage-engine">Local Storage Engine</h2>

<p>Let’s start with the architecture of a local storage engine.</p>

<p>A classic LSM-Tree storage engine (e.g. LevelDB, RocksDB) looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://huachaohuang.com/images/lsm-tree-storage-engine.png" alt="LSM-Tree Storage Engine"></p>

<p>All writes go to a <em>Write Ahead Log</em> (WAL) first and then applied to a memtable.
When the size of a memtable reaches a threshold, the memtable is flushed to the drive as an SST file.
SST files are organized into multiple levels with an increasing size threshold.
When the size of a level reaches its threshold, the level is compacted with the next level.
During compaction, the input files are merged, sorted, and compressed into new output files, which needs a lot of computation.</p>

<p>As for reads, hot data are cached in memory to speed up performance.
We can say that a memtable is also a kind of cache, which holds the newly written data.</p>

<p>The components described above have very different characteristics.
A WAL is an append-only file, which is mostly written and occasionally read (on restart).
All SST files are static and read-only.
Memtable and cache only stay in memory.
Flush and compaction consume a lot of CPU.</p>

<p>A local storage engine binds all these components together.
This is fine because a local storage engine can only utilize the resource on a single machine.
However, in a distributed environment (cloud), this way is not good for resource distribution, because we can’t scale an individual component on demand.
For example, if I want to speed up read performance, I can’t just add more memory for the cache.
I also have to add more CPU and IO for other components so that I can deploy more instances of the storage engine.
Similarly, I can’t just add more CPU to speed up compaction.</p>

<p>This is why we should decompose these components in a distributed storage engine.</p>

<h2 id="distributed-storage-engine">Distributed Storage Engine</h2>

<p>People usually expect more from a distributed storage engine than a local one.
Some common requirements of a distributed system include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>High Availability. Data should be replicated to prevent a single point of failure.</li>
  <li>High Scalability. Data should be scheduled to different nodes for load balancing.</li>
  <li>Data Consistency. Some applications are fine with eventual consistency, but some require strong consistency.</li>
  <li>Data Analysis. It should provide a convenient and efficient way to run large scale data analysis jobs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Moreover, a distributed storage engine should not limit the ability of domain-specific optimizations.
For example, a time-series database has some very different characteristics, which provide a lot of opportunities to optimize the data format, compression algorithms, and compaction policies, etc.</p>

<p>Now let’s see how we can decompose the components of a local storage engine to form a distributed storage engine.
We assume that data are partitioned into a lot of shards according to some application strategy, mostly hash-based or range-based.
From the perspective of a local storage engine, each shard consists of a WAL, a memtable, a cache, and some SST files.
What we need to do here is to distribute these components of all shards in a way that satisfies our requirements.</p>

<h3 id="distributed-journal-system">Distributed Journal System</h3>

<p>First is the WAL.</p>

<p>We need a distributed journal system to handle writes from all shards.
The journal system provides a WAL for each shard and guarantees the necessary availability and consistency.
For example, we can use a consensus algorithm like Raft or Paxos to guarantee high availability and strong consistency. Or we can use a simple asynchronous replication strategy for eventual consistency.</p>

<p><img src="http://huachaohuang.com/images/distributed-journal-system.png" alt="Distributed Journal System"></p>

<h3 id="distributed-cache-system">Distributed Cache System</h3>

<p>The distributed cache system provides various APIs for upper-level applications.</p>

<p><img src="http://huachaohuang.com/images/distributed-cache-system.png" alt="Distributed Cache System"></p>

<p>Many applications love to use Redis-like APIs because those APIs provide the data structures that match their scenarios best.
This is why there are so many Redis API compatible storage systems, either open-sourced or homebrewed.</p>

<p>However, most of these systems store data in some other general-purpose database, which doesn’t give them control to the underlying storage engine and limits the possibility for further optimizations.
Of course, you can build the whole system from the ground up so that you can do whatever you want.
But that requires a lot of effort (if not too much), especially when you only want to customize some data format or file layout.</p>

<p>With these considerations, the distributed cache system needs to provide flexibility for customization.</p>

<p>In the cache system, each shard controls its API, cache, and memtable.
Shards are stateless, they can be distributed to different nodes easily.
You can scale the cache system by adding more memory nodes without any data migration.
You don’t need to worry about cache consistency either, because all writes of a shard go to the same node in the cache system.
A shard first writes to the distributed journal system and then updates its memtable.
When the size of a memtable reaches the threshold, the memtable is flushed to the distributed file system (we will talk about it later).
The beauty here is that a shard has full control of the data format and the layout of its files.
A shard can use any data structure for its memtable, flush the memtable into any file format and compact the files using any strategy.
You can also flush a memtable into multiple files with different formats for different workloads.
For example, a record-oriented file format for OLTP and a column-oriented file format for OLAP.
In this case, we can achieve real-time OLAP. The newest written data are accessible in the memtable and all other data are accessible in the distributed file system, no other synchronization mechanisms are needed.</p>

<h3 id="distributed-file-system">Distributed File System</h3>

<p>The distributed file system stores all files flushed from the distributed cache system.</p>

<p><img src="http://huachaohuang.com/images/distributed-file-system.png" alt="Distributed File System"></p>

<p>The distributed file system guarantees its availability and scalability.
Since files in the file system are static, they can be replicated by simply copying them to different places.
It doesn’t require a complex consensus algorithm to ensure data consistency.
And it can just move files to different places for load balancing.
For example, if a file is too hot, the file system can create more replicas of that file in other nodes to split the traffic.</p>

<p>Besides, the distributed file system can also provide some other nice features.
For example, it is reasonable to separate files for online processing and files for offline analysis into different sets of nodes so that they will not interfere with each other.
And most data analysis jobs can benefit from a lightweight snapshot mechanism.
The distributed file system can create a snapshot of some files by adding some kind of references without copying the files.</p>

<p>On the other side, the problem of a distributed file system versus a local file system is that you need to access your data through the network.
That adds some latency and potential bottleneck in the bandwidth.
But I don’t very worry about it because the network is becoming more and more powerful, 100Gbps bandwidth is not uncommon.
That said, it is also a good idea to add some kind of coprocessor mechanism to the distributed file system. Coprocessors let us push down the expressions to the data instead of transferring large amounts of data through the network.</p>

<h3 id="distributed-job-system">Distributed Job System</h3>

<p>Finally, we need a distributed job system to schedule different kinds of background jobs, like compaction and compression.</p>

<p><img src="http://huachaohuang.com/images/distributed-job-system.png" alt="Distributed Job System"></p>

<p>A shard can compact its files in the distributed file system by submitting a compaction job to the distributed job system.
The job system needs to find a proper node to run the job.
These background jobs are mostly CPU-bound. We can utilize some hardware acceleration by adding some GPU and FPGA nodes to the system.</p>

<p>A dedicated job system also empowers some heavy-weight compression algorithms, which may be too expensive for a local storage engine, especially during peak hours.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Let’s put these systems together to review the architecture of the distributed storage engine:</p>

<p><img src="http://huachaohuang.com/images/distributed-storage-engine.png" alt="Distributed Storage Engine"></p>

<p>The core idea here is to decompose the components with different characteristics to a standalone system so that they can be reused and scale independently.</p>

<p>The distributed cache system requires a lot of CPU and memory. It can be scaled by adding more CPU and memory with no data migration.
The distributed journal system and file system are mostly IO-bound (Well, if we don’t consider the coprocessor).
But the journal system is more latency-sensitive than the file system because it handles frontend write requests.
So it is a cost-efficient manner to use high-end drives (e.g. Optane SSD) in the journal system to reduce latency while using ordinary drives (e.g. SATA SSD) in the file system.
The distributed job system can schedule background jobs to any place with enough CPU resources.</p>

<p>Another important thing is that the distributed cache system fully controls its data, which makes all domain-specific optimizations possible.
We can optimize an application with very different assumptions by designing a new set of APIs, file formats, and maybe background jobs, without worrying about the other parts of the whole system.
This is way simpler than building a new storage system again.</p>

  <p>How can we enable more science fiction to become reality?</p>
  <p><span>If you want to do something, it usually pays to study those who have done that thing successfully in the past. Asking </span><span>‘what is this outlier’s production function?’
    </span><span>can provide a starting point. </span></p>
  <p><span>DARPA is an outlier organization in the world of turning science fiction into reality. Since 1958, it has been a driving force in the creation of weather satellites, GPS, personal computers, modern robotics, the
      Internet, autonomous cars, and voice interfaces, to name a few. However, it is primarily limited to the domain of defense technology – there are DARPA-style ideas that are out of its scope. &nbsp;Which emulatable attributes contributed to
      DARPA’s outlier results? </span><span>What does a</span>&nbsp;domain-independent&nbsp;“ARPA Model” look like? <span>Is it possible to
      build other organizations that generate equally huge results in other domains by riffing on that model?</span></p>
  <p>Gallons of ink have been spilled describing <span>how</span><span>&nbsp;DARPA works</span><a id="footnote_source_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup>1</sup></a><span>,
      but </span><span>in a nutshell here is</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>how DARPA works.</span><span>&nbsp;Around 100 </span><span>program managers (PMs)</span><span>&nbsp;with ~5 year appointments create and run <span>programs</span> to pursue high-level visions like “actualize the idea of man-comp</span><span>uter symbiosis.” In these programs they fund researchers at universities and both
      big and small companies to do research </span><span>projects</span><span>&nbsp;of different sizes. Collectively, groups working on projects are called </span><span>performers</span>.&nbsp;Top-level
      authority lies with a <span>Director </span>who ultimately reports to the Secretary of Defense. </p>
  <p><span>DARPA has an incredibly powerful model for innovation in defense research, and I believe an abstract ‘<span>ARPA Model</span>’ could yield similar results in other domains. In this piece I’ll explain in detail why
      DARPA works. I’ll use that description to feel out and describe to the best of my ability a platonic ARPA Model. &nbsp;I’ll also distill some of the model’s implications for potential riffs on the model. Incidentally,
      I’m working on just such an imitator, and in future essays, I’ll explain why this model could be incredibly powerful when executed in a privately-funded context.</span></p>
  <h4>How to use this document</h4>
  
  <p>This document acts more like a collection of atomic notes than a tight essay – a DARPA-themed tapas if you will. The order of the sections is more of a guideline than a law so feel free to skip around. Throughout you will come across internal links that <a id="self-link" href="#self-link">look like this</a>.
    These links are an attempt to illustrate the interconnectedness of the ARPA Model.</p>
  <p><span>There are two stand-alone pieces to accomodate your time and interest:</span><span> a
    </span><span><a href="#distillation">distillation</a></span><span>, and the </span><span><a href="#h.nbyw8g2b67uk">full work</a></span><span>. </span><span>The
      distillation is meant to capture and compress the main points of the full work. Each section of the distillation internally links to the corresponding section one level deeper so if you want more info and nuance you can get it. </span></p>
      <p><span>I would rather this be read by a few people motivated to take action than by a broad audience who will find it merely interesting. In that vein, if you find yourself wanting to share this on Twitter or Hacker News, consider instead sharing it with one or two friends who will take action on it. Thank you for indulging me!</span></p>

      pattern that the abstract qualities that make “great talent” in different high-variance industries boils down to the ability to successfully make things happen under a lot of uncertainty. Given that pattern, the people who would
      make good DARPA PMs would <span>also</span> make good hedge fund analysts, first employees at startups, etc. so digging into </span><span><a href="#why_do_people_become_darpa_program_managers?">people’s motivations for becoming a PM</a></span><span>&nbsp;is important. More precise details about what makes a PM good prevent you from going after the exact same people as every other high-variance industry. When ‘talent’ isn’t code for ‘specialized
      training’ it means the role or industry has not been systematized. Therefore, despite all the talk here and elsewhere about ‘the ARPA Model’ we must keep in mind that we may be attributing more structure to the process than

      Only 5–10 out of every 100 programs successfully produce transformative research, while only 10% of projects are terminated early. Shifting the risk from the performers to the program managers enables DARPA to tackle </span><span>systemic </span><span>problems where other models cannot.</span></p><p><span><a href="#the_best_darpa_program_managers_notice_systemic_biases">The best program managers notice systemic biases and attack them. </a></span><span>For example, noticing that all of the finite element modeling literature
      assumes a locally static situation and asking ‘what if it was dynamic?’ </span><span>“The best program managers can get into the trees and still see the forest.”</span><span> Obviously, this
      quality is rather fuzzy but leads to two precise questions:</span></p>
  <ol ="1"="">
    <li><span>How do you find people who can uncover systemic biases in a discipline? </span></li>
    <li><span>How could you systematize finding systemic biases in a discipline?</span></li>
  </ol>
  <p><span>The first question suggests that you should seek out heretics and people with expertise who are not experts. The second question suggests building structured frameworks for mapping a discipline and its assumptions.

      sense of creating networks, not just plugging into them. PMs meet disparate people working on ideas adjacent to the area in which they want to have an impact and bring them together in small workshops to dig into which possibilities are not
      impossible and what it would take to make them possible. The PMs host </span><span>performer days</span><span>&nbsp;— small private conferences for all the people working on different pieces of the program where
      performers can exchange ideas on what is working, what isn’t working, and build connections that don’t depend on the PM. </span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._R._Licklider">J.C.R. Licklider</a></span><a id="footnote_source_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup>2</sup></a><span>&nbsp;is a
      paragon here. He brought together all the crazy people interested in human-focused computing. On top of that, &nbsp;he also helped create the first computer science lab groups. PMs also build networks of people in different classes of organizations –
      government, academia, startups, and large companies. These connections smooth the path for technologies to go from the lab to the shelf. </span></p><p><span><a href="#darpa_pms_need_to_think_for_themselves,_be_curious,_and_have_low_ego">DARPA PMs need to think for themselves, be curious, and have low ego.</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Why does this matter? When you are
      surrounded by smart, opinionated people the easy option is to either 100% accept what they’re saying because it’s eloquent and well-thought through or reject it outright because it sounds crazy or goes against your priors. Thinking
      for yourself allows you to avoid these traps. PMs need to be curious because building a complete picture of a discipline requires genuine curiosity to ask questions nobody else is asking. A large ego would lead to a program manager imposing
      their will on every piece of the program, killing curiosity and the benefits of top down problems and bottom up solutions.</span></p><p><span><a href="#darpa_is_incredibly_flexible_with_who_it_hires_to_be_program_managers">DARPA is incredibly flexible with who it hires to be program managers.</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>There are legal provisions in place that
      let DARPA bypass normal government hiring rules and procedures. Hiring flexibility is important because PMs are the sort of people who are in high demand, so they may be unwilling to jump through hoops. Bureaucracies ensure consistency through
      rules – minimal bureaucracy means there are no safeguards against hiring a terrible program manager so the principle that ‘A players hire A players and B players hire C players’ is incredibly important. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span><a href="#darpa_program_managers_have_a_tenure_of_four_to_five_years">DARPA Program managers have a tenure of four to five years.</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>This transience is important for many reasons.
      Transience can inculcate PMs against the temptation to play it safe or play power games because there’s only one clear objective – make the program work. You’re out regardless of success or failure. Explicitly temporary roles can
      incentivize people with many options to join because they can have a huge impact, and then do something else. There’s no implicit tension between the knowledge that most people will leave eventually and the uncertainty about when that
      will be. Regular program manager turnover means that there is also turnover in ideas.</span></p><p><span><a href="#why_do_people_become_darpa_program_managers?">Why do people become DARPA Program managers? </a></span>From a career and money standpoint, being a program manager seems pretty rough.<span>&nbsp;There are unique benefits though. It offers an outlet for people frustrated with the conservative nature of academia. The prospect of getting to control a lot of money without a ton of oversight appeals to some people.
      Patriotism is definitely a factor, and hard to replicate outside of a government. Being a PM can gain you the respect of a small, elite group of peers who will know what you did. Finally, there may be a particular technological vision they want
      to see out in the world and DARPA gives them the agency to make it happen in unique ways.</span></p>

    <p>Instructions on converting an old walkman-style cassette player into a synthesizer using an Arduino, a DAC, a few wires, and some code.</p>
    <p>I love weird music projects. I’ve recorded <a href="https://infinitedigits.bandcamp.com/album/alsep12">an album soundtracking the Apollo 12 mission</a> and recently <a href="https://schollz.com/blog/heartbeat">used my heart beat to control music tempo</a>. You can find more of my music at <a href="https://music.byinfinitedigits.com/">music.byinfinitedigits.com</a></p>
<p>Recently, I finished converting an old walkman-style cassette player into a MIDI-controlled synthesizer using an Arduino and a little code - dubbed <strong>the cassette synthesizer</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>cassette synthesizer</strong> works by playing a pre-recorded drone (a single tone) from tape and then modulating the speed of the playback to pitch up the tone to any pitch you want. I got this idea for the cassette synthesizer from <a href="http://www.ondemagnetique.com/">Onde Magnétique</a> who got the idea from the <a href="http://www.mellotron.com/">Mellotron</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a video of me playing the cassette synthesizer, controlled via MIDI by my other keyboard:</p>
<p>
<iframe height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LdBik_Zlwy0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>
<p>The neat thing about this synthesizer is that it has a very “analog” quality to the changing of notes - the pitch often <em>slides</em> between notes in a neat way (i.e. lots of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portamento"><em>portamento</em></a>). It also is versatile because you can record <em>any</em> sound to the tape and use that as your synthesizer.</p>
<h2 id="making-a-cassette-synthesizer">Making a cassette synthesizer</h2>
<p>To make one of these things is actually <em>really</em> easy. I found a great video from Analog Industries showing exactly how to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pF6Yegj7A9o">hack a cassette player</a> to add voltage control to the cassette player. I followed that and then wrote a simple MIDI controller in the browser to modulate the voltage to specific notes.</p>
<p>These instructions will take you through the hardware (Arduino / Cassette player) and the software for the MIDI controller.</p>

<h2 id="hacking-the-ge-3-5362a-tape-player">Hacking the GE 3-5362A tape player</h2>
<p><em>Note:</em> You don’t necessarily have to use the GE 3-5362A. Any tape player with a variable playback will work. You’ll just have to figure out how to hook up the voltage :)</p>
<p>First thing is to open up the tape player. There are four screws on the back. Just unscrew them and open it carefully. The power lines are connected on the back plate so just don’t rip those out.</p>
<p><img src="https://schollz.com/img/s1/overview.jpg" alt="Hacking the GE 3-5362A tape player."></p>
<p>To get this tape player working for us we will solder two new components. First we will solder in the <code>Vin</code> which will allow us to control the speed of the cassette player with a voltage controller. Then we will add an audio splitter as a <code>Line in</code> which will let us record directly onto tape (in case you don’t have a tape deck).</p>
<p>If you don’t know how to solder - don’t sweat. Its easy. Check out <a href="https://youtu.be/HTy9Z9LpA2U?t=1011">this video</a> which shows you how to use the existing solder pad and put something onto it.</p>
<h3 id="adding-the-vin-to-control-tape-speed">Adding the <code>Vin</code> to control tape speed</h3>
<p>Locate the dial that says “Variable Speed Playback”. This is where we will splice in two lines. I like to use red for active and brown/green for ground. Attach the active line to <code>VS+</code> and the ground to the pad right below the one labeled <code>B+</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://schollz.com/img/s1/vs.jpg" alt="Solder a cable to VS+ and one to the pad next to B+."></p>
<p>A note - I like to use jumper cables that have a female end so I can easily plug stuff into here!</p>
<h3 id="add-in-a-line-in-to-record-directly-onto-tape">Add in a <code>Line in</code> to record directly onto tape</h3>
<p>Locate the red and black cables plugged into pads labeled “MIC-” and “MIC+”. You can solder and remove these cables and attach your own from the audio breakout cable. Just solder red to “MIC+” and black to “MIC-".</p>
<p><img src="https://schollz.com/img/s1/linein.jpg" alt="Solder a line-in via the MIC- and MIC+."></p>
<h3 id="record-a-drone-to-tape">Record a drone to tape</h3>
<p>Put in a tape and record via the line in! Record any note you want, usually a single drone on C works well as a starting point. Record a long time - 30 minutes or so (this would be a good place for tape loops if you have them!). Make sure to record a single tone because you will pitch it up/down later.</p>
<p><img src="https://schollz.com/img/s1/rec.jpg" alt="Recording a drone from my OP-1 to the tape."></p>
<h2 id="setup-an-arduino-as-midi-interface">Setup an Arduino as MIDI interface</h2>
<p>The Arduino serves as a bridge between MIDI and the voltage. A MIDI keyboard is plugged into a computer and a Chrome browser gets the response. The browser executes a request to a server running which sends the serial information for the voltage change to the Arduino, which then modulates the voltage on the walkman.</p>
<p><img src="https://schollz.com/img/s1/arduino.png" alt="Connecting the MCP4725 DAC to the Arduino"></p>
<p>First, simply connect the Arduino to the MCP4725. The MCP4725 is a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) that allows modulating specific voltages directly from the Arduino. The <code>OUT</code> from the MCP4725 should go to the RED wire you connected to the cassette player. Then attach the ground wire on the cassette player to the ground on the Arduino.</p>
<p>The code for the Arduino just communicates via a Serial port to send voltages. For instance, sending <code>voltage1.1</code> will change the output voltage on the DAC to <code>1.1</code>. Here is the code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;Wire.h&gt;</span><span>

  }
}
</code></pre></div><h3 id="server-to-send-serial-commands">Server to send serial commands</h3>
<p>To communicate with the Arduino you can use a simple server that hooks the MIDI to the voltage Serial. You can get this code from <a href="https://github.com/schollz/tape-synth">github.com/schollz/tape-synth</a>. Make sure you have Golang installed (install <a href="https://golang.org/dl/">here</a>).</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ git clone https://github.com/schollz/tape-synth
$ <span>cd</span> tape-synth
$ go build  
$ ./tape-synth -com ARDUINOCOM
</code></pre></div><p><em>Note:</em> you’ll have to run in <code>sudo</code> to access the USB ports usually if you are using Linux. The <code>ARDUINOCOM</code> is the COM-port for the USB-connected Arduino. For Windows it is usually <code>COM4</code>.</p>
<p>The server will serve a webpage from <code>index.html</code>. You should open up Chrome to <code>localhost:8080</code> and you’ll be able to connect a MIDI keyboard and send voltages to the Arduino (Chrome is the most popular <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MIDIAccess">MIDI-capable browser</a>).</p>
<h2 id="connect-everything-and-play">Connect everything and play!</h2>
<p>To get it going, start the serial server. Plug in a midi keyboard. Open chrome to the <code>localhost:8080</code>. Turn on the cassette player and <strong>start jamming!</strong> A note on the keyboard should translate into a note on the cassette synthesizer.</p>
<h3 id="tuning-the-synth">Tuning the synth</h3>
<p>Because we are dealing with mechanical pitch shifting (via tape speed) its necessary to tune the synth. To tune each pitch, just open <code>index.html</code> and edit the <code>voltageMap</code>. Each note should have a voltage (between 0 and 3) associated with its pitch.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>var</span> voltageMap <span>=</span> {
    <span>"C"</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span>,
    <span>"C#"</span><span>:</span> <span>0.7</span>,

        <p>The AWS incidents that make the news are normally data loss incidents (ex. a public S3 bucket), but one of the common ways people find out about a compromise is through their AWS bill, because a common incident that isn’t made public is a compromised AWS key that is used to spin up EC2s to mine bitcoin.  That attack is used for the personal gain of the attacker, but it is possible that an attacker just wants to bring hurt to you.  Historically, this would have taken the form of a DDoS attack, but in the age of the cloud, that attack can be modified to be a Denial of Wallet attack, where the goal is to cause a high bill such that you run out of money.</p>

<p>When you have servers in a datacenter, and an attacker just wants to bring you hurt, they can DDoS you and your site goes down.  When you run in the cloud, an attacker can do things such that your site might stay up, but you’ll be bankrupt.  This post will describe this concept, how it can be abused, and how it can be avoided.</p>

<p>This post comes about from <a href="https://twitter.com/baphometadata/status/1268192247176220679">this</a> tweet:</p>

<p><a href="https://summitroute.com/img/tweet-denial_of_wallet-kpop.png">
<img src="https://summitroute.com/img/tweet-denial_of_wallet-kpop.png" alt="Denial of wallet attack tweet" title="Denial of wallet attack tweet"></a></p>

<p>As I’m going to be discussing improvements on the attack, mitigations, and other technical issues related to this, I want to start by briefly touching on some of the non-technical issues involved here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Black lives matter.</li>
  <li>I don’t condone illegal or unjust activities, whether that is done by protestors or police officers.</li>
  <li>Increasing police department expenses may only be shifting the burden to tax payers.</li>
  <li>This tweet could have instead been about an app that allows protestors to report on police somehow that was overwhelmed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now onto the technical issues.</p>


<p>One of the first things you should do on an AWS account is create a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/monitor_estimated_charges_with_cloudwatch.html">billing alert</a>. It is better to find out about a dozen expensive EC2s running on the day they are spun up, so you can take action, rather than 20 days later after they’ve incurred 20 days worth of charges against your account.</p>

<p>If you’re just trying AWS out for the first time and you hear about this “free tier” concept, you might be surprised to discover that nothing stops you doing things that actually cost money, and you won’t know about this until the end of the billing cycle.  There is no way to tell AWS “Don’t charge me more than X for the month, and terminate my application if it exceeds that amount.”   You however can set alerts for when your estimated charges exceed a threshold.  I normally set this to something like $10 for accounts I expect to be free (often you end up with bills for using AWS for something like $0.49, so setting the threshold to $0 causes alerts you aren’t too worried about).</p>

<p>For enterprises with monthly spend in the millions, this can be more difficult, but can still be helpful.  If you’re in that category, you should talk to folks like <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig">Corey Quinn</a> of the <a href="https://www.duckbillgroup.com/">Duckbill Group</a> and Thomas Dullien (aka <a href="https://twitter.com/halvarflake">halvarflake</a>) of <a href="https://optimyze.cloud/">optimyze</a> who each focus on different areas of cloud spend improvements.  This is not a paid ad. I have a lot of respect for both of those people.</p>

<p>One strategy commonly used is to set multiple alarms that you expect to trigger throughout the month. For example, if you expect your bill to be $1000, then set the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alarms for $250, $500, $750, and $1000 and name them based on the week you expect them to trigger.  If your $500 alarm triggers in week 1, you need to investigate.</li>
  <li>Alarms for $1500 and $2000 so you know when your expenses have increased dramatically.</li>
</ul>

<p>For my free tier accounts I have alerts for $10 and $100.  When the $10 alert triggers, and I’m not around my computer, I’ll casually make a note to look into it when I get back to a computer.  Usually it’s a domain name being renewed for $12.  When the $100 triggers, I run to my computer because something bad must be happening.</p>

<p>You can have these alerts not only email you, but also text you.  You can set up to 10 alarms for free, after which it is $0.10/mo.</p>


<p>AWS has a number of hard and soft limits that among other possible reasons, help mitigate run-away code. Many people have <a href="https://medium.com/@asankha/lambda-programming-errors-that-could-cost-you-thousands-of-dollars-a-day-265dfac354f">stories</a> about infinite loops happening in AWS that caused resources to be created over and over again, or a Lambda to trigger that caused itself to trigger again.  This is a common enough problem that the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/Create-CloudWatch-Events-CloudTrail-Rule.html">Cloudwatch Event Rule documentation</a> even has a warning about it.</p>

<p><a href="https://summitroute.com/img/inifinite_loops_cloudwatch_warning.png">
<img src="https://summitroute.com/img/inifinite_loops_cloudwatch_warning.png" alt="Cloudwatch infinite loop warning" title="Cloudwatch infinite loop warning"></a></p>

<p>The limits help stop these coding mistakes.  They can also lead to outages when you hit into these as your application attempts to scale.  For this reason, operations teams should have some familiarity with the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/introducing-service-quotas-view-and-manage-your-quotas-for-aws-services-from-one-central-location/">Service Quotas</a> service.</p>

<p>These limits also play a role in mitigating the impact of someone using your account for bitcoin mining.  Without these limits an attacker could try to spin up a million EC2s, but due to these limits, the attacker might only spin up a few dozen EC2s.</p>


<h2 id="one-hit-knockouts">One hit knockouts</h2>
<p>There are a lot of ways to spend money in AWS, but a sort of game that comes up periodically is coming up with the single most expensive API call that could be made in an account.  The largest memory optimized EC2, the x1e.32xlarge with 3TB of memory, costs $26.688/hr in us-east-1, or over $19K/mo, for an on-demand instance.  As Corey Quinn has <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1243316557993795586">pointed out</a> though, you can instead make a single call that costs $3M by reserving the instance, using one in a more expensive region, and with with an associated license.</p>

<p><a href="https://summitroute.com/img/tweet-most_expensive_call.png">
<img src="https://summitroute.com/img/tweet-most_expensive_call.png" alt="Expensive API call" title="Expensive API call"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_PurchaseReservedInstancesOffering.html">That call</a> does allow you to specify an instance count, which is initially limited to 20, so that single call could cost $62M.  From the comments on that thread, another expensive option is to create a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/latest/APIReference/API_CreateSavingsPlan.html">Savings Plan</a> for $26M.</p>

<p>Involving multiple calls to bump up service limits, actual phone calls to AWS salespeople to get access to things like Outposts or Snowmobile, or possibly by exploring AWS Marketplace or IQ could also bump up the costs. However, chances are a conversation with AWS can likely revoke all those charges.</p>

<h2 id="business-costs">Business costs</h2>
<p>If someone has the ability to make those types of calls in your AWS account, they likely also have the ability to delete all your files in S3, terminate all your instances, and cause other mayhem that has the potential to cause worse business impact.  We’re reminded here of <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2608076/murder-in-the-amazon-cloud.html#:~:text=Code%20Spaces%20was%20a%20company,essentially%20murdered%20by%20an%20attacker.">Code Spaces</a>, a company that had all of its files deleted, including backups, and had to shutdown within 24 hours of their incident.</p>

<h2 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h2>
<p>For both of these scenarios of running an arbitrary API call, or deleting files, the attacker has compromised access.  You can mitigate both of those scenarios by implementing least privilege on services, enforcing MFA on people, and implementing <a href="https://summitroute.com/blog/2020/03/25/aws_scp_best_practices/">SCPs</a>.  You can mitigate an attacker’s ability to destroy a business by limiting the blast radius through the use of multiple AWS accounts and WORM backups through the use of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/s3-object-lock/">S3 Object Lock</a> or again through multiple AWS accounts and SCPs. Those concepts are discussed further in my <a href="https://summitroute.com/downloads/aws_security_maturity_roadmap-Summit_Route.pdf">AWS Security Maturity Roadmap</a>.</p>

<p>Beware of S3 Object Lock though as an attacker could abuse this call to apply an object lock to your files such that they can’t be deleted, even by the root user, so things like lifecycle policies that you attempt to apply to clear out an S3 bucket of user uploads would not have an effect.  You’d have to work with AWS Support to try to undo the retention policy so that you’re not paying for unnecessary files.  The API call for this is <code>s3:PutObjectRetention</code>, so someone with <code>s3:Put*</code> that you think might only be able to write files, can write files and lock them so they aren’t deleted.</p>


<p>In the face of a DDoS, depending on how the attack is performed, you likely can overcome it through the use of auto-scaling resources. Auto-scaling results in a higher bill though. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/shield/">AWS Shield</a> is AWS’s DDoS solution.  By default, and for free, CloudFront and Route53 come with protections against Layer 3 and 4 attacks (ex. SYN Flood).  For higher level attacks, and attacks against EC2 and ELB, you can get Shield Advanced for $3K/mo plus an additional per GB cost for data transferred out.  Shield Advanced includes access to the AWS DDoS Response Team who can apply mitigations on your behalf.  The biggest benefit of Shield Advanced is that in the event of a DDoS where you have to scale up services to handle it, you can get credits back to your account for that additional cost imposed, so this service acts as an insurance policy that your finance team might be interested in.</p>

<p>You may also be able to use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/waf/">AWS WAF</a> to block certain types of attack.  The <a href="https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/DDoS_White_Paper.pdf">AWS Best Practices for DDoS
Resiliency</a> goes into further detail about the AWS solutions for DDoS mitigation.</p>


<p>A common application need is the ability to upload files, which the original tweet was about.  One way of doing this is to allow users to upload directly to an S3 bucket.  Using javascript in a web app you can have the browser upload files to S3 directly.  This can also be done with a mobile app.  AWS S3 has no service limits that I am aware of, and there is no way to limit the size of files uploaded to an S3 bucket, the rate at which they are uploaded, or most anything else, through the use of IAM policies or resource policies on the S3 bucket. This means that if you grant an IAM role the ability to upload files to an S3 bucket, they can potentially abuse it.</p>

<p>One attack that can be performed, is to upload large numbers of files or large files. If you actually have AWS credentials, you can do this using <code>aws s3 sync</code>.  By specifying a public bucket as the source, and the victim bucket as the destination, this technique uses AWS’s own resources against itself, resulting in much faster transfer speeds than you would be able to obtain by attempting to upload files directly from your own laptop.  To avoid problems associated with this, you need to ensure you can differentiate and block specific users that may be abusing your service. You also will want to restrict the file name and size so that single users are not uploading many files or a single large file.  To do this, you should use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html#createPresignedPost-property">presigned-posts</a> which allow you to use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-HTTPPOSTConstructPolicy.html">POST policies</a> where you can specify the name and size limits.  You’ll …</p></div></div>

<h2>The Bright Future of AppleOS and Multi-Touch Universal&nbsp;Computing</h2>
<time>June 23, 2020</time>
<permalink><a href="https://kenyarmosh.com/appleos-future-multitouch-universal-computing">∞</a> </permalink>
</header>
<p>Steve Jobs once noted that Apple’s extensive user testing studies didn’t favor using multi-touch on a Mac&nbsp;screen.</p>
<p>But that was a long time ago during <a href="https://youtu.be/AKMG5ox8X6c?t=3389">a Mac special event in October 2010</a> where he introduced iOS features to its Mac&nbsp;counterpart.</p>
<p>A long time ago, at least, in computing&nbsp;years.</p>
<p>What Jobs rightfully pointed out back then was that hardware was one reason that multi-touch didn’t work in a vertical desktop computing environment. Touch wanted to be horizontal and vertically oriented touch was “ergonomically terrible.” Additionally, there was an internal architecture issue with the hardware. Apple’s touch-based devices operated on a different chipset than its desktop&nbsp;counterparts.</p>
<p>Things continue to change on all these&nbsp;fronts.</p>
<p>The Microsoft Surface suite has since shown how touch can work on the “desktop.” Hinges on Surfaces, whether the laptop-like form factor of the Surface Go and Surface Pro or the larger desktop Surface Studio, enable both desktop-like and touch-oriented experiences. On the flip side, magnets in Apple’s Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro transform it from tablet to a more traditional desktop&nbsp;computer.</p>
<p>There’s a coalescing across these form factors but which will&nbsp;win?</p>
<p>The answer is…they all&nbsp;will.*</p>
<p>From external to internal hardware design, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295475/apple-mac-processors-arm-silicon-chips-wwdc-2020">the introduction of Apple’s ARM chipset</a> on the Mac is monumental. Tim Cook inferred that the move to Apple Silicon is the next milestone in Mac’s history and a “game changer.” As one example, ARM runs iOS apps without any modification on the more traditional desktop Mac computing&nbsp;environment.</p>
<p>Hardware is just one part of the&nbsp;story.</p>
<p>On the software side, <a href="https://twitter.com/kenyarmosh/status/1135609609387991040">the introduction of iPadOS in 2019 was ironic</a> for those who have been around since day one of touch in the Apple ecosystem. “iPhone OS” as it was called back then, was rebranded to “iOS” when the iPad hit the scene. By splitting off almost 10 years later, iPadOS seemed to fragment the ecosystem even&nbsp;further.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/macos-big-sur-the-macstories-overview/">forthcoming macOS 11 Big Sur</a>, Apple is finally retiring Mac OS X, proving that a more unified platform is coming. macOS 11 brings all-new design inspired by iOS and iPadOS. From iOS-like app icons, increased corner radiuses, removal of bezels, and greater attention to screen real estate, it’s the start of a much more touch-friendly desktop operating&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>This new macOS, soon to be powered by ARM, which can run iOS and macOS apps, showcases the future of an AppleOS and multi-touch universal computing&nbsp;ecosystem.</p>
<p>AppleOS will have the smarts to adapt to the form factor, screen size, and preferred computing paradigm of the user. That means if someone has an iMac but wants to use it in multi-touch mode, the OS will know the difference between a Magic Mouse, Apple Pencil, or finger. Apps in this ecosystem will be built to move easily across screen sizes and input&nbsp;methods.</p>
<p>Users won’t have to decide between iPhone, iPad, or Mac in the sense of “which is my main computing device” or “which device is best for this task.” All of them will be. Users will no longer be tethered to the iPad because it’s the only device that supports the Apple Pencil for sketching and drawing. Likewise, the Mac no longer will be their only choice to carry out “pro” desktop&nbsp;activities.</p>
<p>AppleOS and the future multi-touch universal computing paradigm will not negate the advantage of one form factor over another. Instead, users will have more flexibility than is offered in today’s computing environment, where a specific OS and device is demanded by&nbsp;default.</p>
<p>Big Sur in the form of macOS 11 and ARM are exciting advancements. Years from now, they will be seen as foundational for AppleOS. Somewhere within Apple Park, in an undisclosed location (of course), that future is being worked on right&nbsp;now.</p>
<p><em><code>*</code> Much like the debate between native and web. I regularly noted <a href="https://twitter.com/kenyarmosh/status/10296417955">back in the late 2000s</a> that both would win their respective&nbsp;mediums.</em></p>

<p>Programming a deep learning model is not easy (I’m not going to lie) but testing one is even harder. That’s why most of the TensorFlow and PyTorch code out there does not include unit testing. But when your code is going to live in a production environment, making sure that it actually does what is intended should be a priority. After all, machine learning is not different from any other software.</p>

<p>Note that this post is the third part of the <strong>Deep Learning in Production course where we discover how to convert a notebook into production-ready code that can be served to millions of users.</strong></p>

<p>In this article, we are going to focus on how to properly test machine learning code, analyze some best practices when writing unit tests and present a number of example cases where testing is kind of a necessity. We will start on why we need them in our code, then we will do a quick catch up on the basics of testing in python, and then we will go over a number of practical real-life scenarios.</p>

<h2 id="why-we-need-unit-testing">Why we need unit testing</h2>

<p>When developing a neural network, most of us don’t care about catching all possible exceptions, finding all corner cases, or debugging every single function. We just need to see our model fit. And then we just need to increase its accuracy until it reaches an acceptable point. That’s all good but what happens when the model will be deployed into a server and used in an actual public faced application? Most likely it will crash because some users may be sending wrong data or because of some silent bug that messes up our data preprocessing pipeline. We might even discover that our model was in fact corrupted all this time.</p>

<p>This is where <strong>unit tests</strong> come into play. To prevent all these things before they even occur. Unit tests are tremendously useful because they:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Find software bugs early</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Debug our code</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure that the code does what is supposed to do</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Simplify the refactoring process</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speed up the integration process</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Act as documentation</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Don’t tell me that you don’t want at least some of the above. Sure testing can take up a lot of your precious time but it’s 100% worth it. You will see why in a bit.</p>

<p>But what exactly is a unit test?</p>

<h2 id="basics-of-unit-testing">Basics of Unit testing</h2>

<p>In simple terms, <strong>unit testing is just a function calling another function (or a unit) and checking if the values returned match the expected output.</strong> Let’s see an example using our UNet model to make it more clear (If you haven’t followed the series you can find the code in our <a href="https://github.com/The-AI-Summer/Deep-Learning-In-Production" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a>.</p>

<p>In a few words, we took an official Tensorflow google colab that performs image segmentation and we try to convert it into a highly optimized production-ready code. Check the first two parts <a href="https://theaisummer.com/deep-learning-production/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://theaisummer.com/best-practices-deep-learning-code/" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>

<p>So we have this simple function that normalized an image by dividing all the pixels by 255.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>def</span> <span>_normalize</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>input_image</span><span>,</span> <span>input_mask</span><span>):</span>
    <span>""" Normalise input image
    Args:
        input_image (tf.image): The input image
        input_mask (int): The image mask

    Returns:
        input_image (tf.image): The normalized input image
        input_mask (int): The new image mask
    """</span>
    <span>input_image</span> <span>=</span> <span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>cast</span><span>(</span><span>input_image</span><span>,</span> <span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>float32</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>255.0</span>
    <span>input_mask</span> <span>-=</span> <span>1</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>input_image</span><span>,</span> <span>input_mask</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To make sure that it does exactly what it is supposed to do, we can write another function that uses the “_normalize” and check its result. It will look something like this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
  <span>def</span> <span>test_normalize</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>input_image</span> <span>=</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>array</span><span>([[</span><span>1.</span><span>,</span> <span>1.</span><span>],</span> <span>[</span><span>1.</span><span>,</span> <span>1.</span><span>]])</span>
        <span>input_mask</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
        <span>expected_image</span> <span>=</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>array</span><span>([[</span><span>0.00392157</span><span>,</span> <span>0.00392157</span><span>],</span> <span>[</span><span>0.00392157</span><span>,</span> <span>0.00392157</span><span>]])</span>

        <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>unet</span><span>.</span><span>_normalize</span><span>(</span><span>input_image</span><span>,</span> <span>input_mask</span><span>)</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>assertEquals</span><span>(</span><span>expected_image</span><span>,</span> <span>result</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>])</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The “test_normalize” function creates a fake input image, calls the function with that image as an argument, and then makes sure that the result is equal to the expected image. The “assertEquals” is a special function, coming from the <strong>unittest</strong> package in python (more on that in a sec) and does exactly what its name suggests. It asserts that the two values are equal. Note that you can also use something like this bellow but using built-in functions has its advantages</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>assert</span> <span>expected_image</span> <span>==</span> <span>result</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s it. That’s unit testing. Tests can be used on both very small functions and bigger complex functionalities across different modules.</p>

<h2 id="unit-tests-in-python">Unit tests in Python</h2>

<p>Before we see some more examples, I’d say to do a quick catch up on how Python supports unit testing.</p>

<p>The main test framework/runner that comes into Python’s standard library is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unittest</a>. Unittest is pretty straightforward to use and it has only two requirements: to put your tests into a class and use its special assert functions. A simple example can be found below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>import</span> <span>unittest</span>


<span>class</span> <span>UnetTest</span><span>(</span><span>unittest</span><span>.</span><span>TestCase</span><span>):</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>test_normalize</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>.</span> <span>.</span> <span>.</span>

<span>if</span> <span>__name__</span> <span>==</span> <span>'__main__'</span><span>:</span>
    <span>unittest</span><span>.</span><span>main</span><span>()</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some things to notice here:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>We have our test class which includes a “test_normalize” function as a method. In general,  test functions are named with “test_” as a prefix followed by the name of the function they test. (This is a convention but it also enables unittest’s autodiscovery functionality, which is the ability of the library to automatically detect all unit tests within a project or a module so you don’t have to run them one by one)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To run unit tests, we call the “unittest.main()” function which discovers all tests within the module, runs them and prints their output.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our UnetTest class inherits the “<strong>unittest.TestCase</strong>” class. This class helps us set unique test cases with different inputs because it comes with “<strong>setUp()”</strong> and <strong>“tearDown()”</strong> methods. In setUp() we can define our inputs that can be accessed by all tests and in tearDown() we can dissolve them( see snippet in the next chapter). This is helpful because all tests should run independently and generally they can’t share information. Well, now they can.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Another two powerful frameworks are <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pytest</a> and <a href="https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">nose</a>, which are pretty much governed by the same principles. I suggest playing with them a little before you decide what suits you best. I personally use pytest most of the times because it feels a bit simpler and it supports a few nice to have things like fixtures and test parameterization( which I’m not gonna go into details here, you can check the official docs for more). But honestly it doesn’t have that big of a difference so you should be fine with either of them.</p>

<h3 id="tests-in-tensorflow-tftest">Tests in Tensorflow: tf.test</h3>

<p>But here I’m going to discuss another one, a less known one. Since we use Tensorflow to program our model we can take advantage of “<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/test" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tf.test</a>”, which is an extension of unittest but it contains assertions tailored to Tensorflow code (yup I was shocked when I found that out too). In that case, our code morphed into this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>import</span> <span>tensorflow</span> <span>as</span> <span>tf</span>


<span>class</span> <span>UnetTest</span><span>(</span><span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>test</span><span>.</span><span>TestCase</span><span>):</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>setUp</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>super</span><span>(</span><span>UnetTest</span><span>,</span> <span>self</span><span>).</span><span>setUp</span><span>()</span>
        <span>.</span> <span>.</span> <span>.</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>tearDown</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>pass</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>test_normalize</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>.</span> <span>.</span> <span>.</span>

    
<span>if</span> <span>__name__</span> <span>==</span> <span>'__main__'</span><span>:</span>
    <span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>test</span><span>.</span><span>main</span><span>()</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It has exactly the same baselines with the caveat that we need to call the “super()” function inside the “setUp”, which enables “tf.test” to do its magic. Pretty cool hah?</p>

<h2 id="mocking">Mocking</h2>

<p>Another super important topic you should be aware of is Mocking and mock objects. Mocking classes and functions are super common when writing java for example but in Python is very underutilized. <strong>Mocking makes it very easy to replace complex logic or heavy dependencies when testing code using dummy objects</strong>. By dummy objects, we refer to simple, easy to code objects that have the same structure with our real objects but contain fake or useless data. In our case a dummy object might be a 2d tensor with all ones which mimics an actual image (just like the “input_image in the first code snippet).</p>

<p>Mocking also helps us control the code’s behavior and simulate expensive calls. Let’s look at an example using once again our UNet.</p>

<p>Let’s assume that we want to make sure that the data preprocessing step is correct and that our code splits the data and creates the training and tests dataset as it should (a very common test case).  Here is our code we want to test:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>def</span> <span>load_data</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>

<p>In 2017, I spent a few days traveling through Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands with Richard Dawkins.</p>



<p>If you don’t know&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1589136599524000">Dawkins</a>, he’s a famous writer, atheist, and evolutionary biologist.</p>



<p>He’s written more New York Times Bestsellers than most writers have written books.</p>



<p>He’ll be remembered as one of history’s most influential thinkers.</p>



<p>So you can imagine my surprise when one afternoon he passed around a&nbsp;manuscript of his next book and asked a few of us on the trip for feedback.</p>
</div></div>



<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/stewfortier.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bc00f230-decb-473e-930a-c873a4cb7828.jpg?fit=580%2C438&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="470" height="355" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/stewfortier.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bc00f230-decb-473e-930a-c873a4cb7828.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/stewfortier.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bc00f230-decb-473e-930a-c873a4cb7828.jpg?resize=300%2C227&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/stewfortier.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bc00f230-decb-473e-930a-c873a4cb7828.jpg?resize=1024%2C773&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/stewfortier.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bc00f230-decb-473e-930a-c873a4cb7828.jpg?resize=768%2C580&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px"></figure></div>



<p><em>What on Earth could I tell Richard Dawkins about how his next book could be better?</em></p>



<p>The book was a beginner’s guide to atheism written for kids and young adults who were having doubts about the Bible and religion in general.</p>



<p>It was meant to be a sort of guide to help them articulate their doubts.</p>



<p>And after I read the first couple chapters, I realized something…</p>



<p><em>Yeah, these chapters are absolute fire, but what’s the point if the kid never brings it up to their parents? If they’re going to build confidence in their new beliefs, they need to ask adults questions and then see how bad their answers are.</em></p>



<p>The rest of the group chimed in with suggestions, but it was&nbsp;mostly just one form of praise or another.</p>



<p>Dawkins politely nodded along…</p>



<p>“You should add questions at the end of each chapter that a kid can ask their parents at the dinner table,” I told Dawkins.</p>



<p>He lit up.</p>



<p>“That’s a wonderful idea. Yes, I love that,” he said. He asked his girlfriend to write down the suggestion.</p>



<p>It was the only one he wrote down.</p>



<p>“Damn,” I thought to myself. “I guess I can pretty much always add value if I just try.”</p>

When I started the Redis project more than ten years ago I was in one of the most exciting moments of my career. My co-founder and I had successfully launched two of the major web 2.0 services of the Italian web. In order to make them scalable we had to invent many new concepts, that were already known in the field most of the times, but we didn’t know, nor we cared to check. Problem? Let’s figure out a solution. We wanted to solve problems but we wanted, even more, to have fun. This was the playful environment where Redis was born. But now Redis is, incredibly, one of the main parts of so many things.

(You may recall that I disclosed another one last year.) The privacy protections system (also known as TCC: Transparency, Consent, and Control) was introduced in macOS Mojave, and one of its purposes is to protect certain files on your Mac from access by unauthorized apps. I've discovered a way for an unauthorized app to read the contents of protected files, thus bypassing the privacy protections. This issue exists in Mojave, Catalina, and the Big Sur beta. It remains unaddressed and is therefore, in one sense, a zero-day.

Problems stemming from faulty design often show up as scalability problems, resilience problems or data issues. However, solving those problems is often the equivalent of addressing the symptoms and not the disease - we may be able to patch up the system enough to keep it running, but the underlying design issues remain and can be triggered again under different circumstances. It takes a lot of effort, not to mention organizational wrangling, to be able to analyze design related root causes when the system is failing in production.</p><p id="viewer-85vjj">As with an earlier post on <a href="https://www.kislayverma.com/post/code-review-checklist-for-distributed-systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>code reviews for distributed systems</u></a>, this article is a simplistic checklist of things that I look out for when reviewing design of a distributed system functionality (anything which requires multiple systems to work together). </p><p id="viewer-6re76">I think of distributed design issues in terms of three buckets : <strong>Consistency-vs-Availability</strong>, <strong>Domain Coupling</strong>, and <strong>Observability</strong>. The first two often leak into each other because a distributed system is like a complex mesh and each design choice impacts multiple other things. Each bucket is a huge huge topic in its own right, so the following guidelines represent a minimum level of scrutiny that I believe should be imposed on any design. </p><p id="viewer-dm3dm">Depending on the use-case and context of the problem, you should go far deeper into specific aspects after these basics have been checked off. Conversely, if there's a problem with these, be extremely cautious.</p><h2 id="viewer-9uj8i">Consistency or Availability</h2><p id="viewer-960v9">I should remind you upfront that when I say “system” in this article, I mean a collection of independent systems  which collaborate in different ways to deliver the final user experience. And when we talk about consistency versus availability, we are talking about all the involved systems. </p><p id="viewer-38o3r"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>CAP Theorem</u></a> tells us that we can choose any two out of consistency, availability, and partition tolerance for our system. However, network partitions are a fact of life, hence the true choice of CAP theorem is between consistency and availability - we can have an <strong>"AP"</strong> system (available, aka continues to work under partition) or a <strong>"CP"</strong> system (fails if all involved components are not alive and well).</p><p id="viewer-a8li3"><strong>A fundamental rule of software architecture is that all software fails</strong>. So let's say that we need consistency across three components for a feature to work as designed. This makes the feature brittle because if any one of the components is down, the feature does not work. We now have the dreaded “<em>Single Point of Failure”</em> - in fact we have three of them!!! The more we try to make the entire system consistent, the more we make it susceptible to failure at the slightest glitch. The more components that must stay in sync, the worse this gets.</p><p id="viewer-e9ve0">Fortunately, there is a way out.</p><p id="viewer-5anb4">When looking at individual systems, CP and AP can be binary choices (e.g. MySQL is consistent, Cassandra is not), but when looking at a distributed system, they can start taking on shades of grey. Each component may be consistent (order, inventory and payment), but the overall system can still be designed to be eventually consistent. This gives us the necessary leeway to add some availability to our system. So the main guideline here is to design the OVERALL system for availability, such that the complete functionality can be achieved over time despite individual subsystems being intermittently unavailable.</p><h3 id="viewer-3iira"><strong>Use asynchronous message passing for communication</strong></h3><p id="viewer-951uj">This is the most powerful weapon we have for taking off the pressure of consistency in favour of availability and features as a major guideline in the <a href="https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Reactive Manifesto</u></a>. Consider making the communication between components asynchronous (message passing over a message broker) instead of making it a request-response style API call. If <a href="https://hackernoon.com/synchronous-communication-is-the-new-cocaine-in-silicon-valley-oi22734tj" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>synchronous communication is the crack cocaine of Silicon Valley</u></a>, synchronous API calls are the crack cocaine of the distributed system design. Consider this - if two systems don’t have to be consistent, then why should we do anything immediately (as the synchronous communication model demands). A request-response model creates a form of <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/tech-blog/forms-of-temporal-coupling/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>temporal coupling</u></a> ("serve this request right now!") between the caller and callee, which causes the former to fail if the latter is unavailable at a time, which can then cause cascading failures in its callers and so on. Asynchronous communication allows the called system to process requests at its own pace, thereby taking off the pressure of availability.</p><p id="viewer-7vqr8">While asynchronous messaging is a powerful tool, there are several things that MUST be kept in mind when adopting it.</p><ol><li id="viewer-2e6r"><p><strong>Define the minimal acceptable user experience</strong> - For every end-user experience, define the absolute minimal consistent experience. E.g. If a user wins an online game, must we credit bonus points, award him a new position on the leaderboard, notify all his friends, and send him a notification in an all-or-nothing manner? As should be obvious, the more we can agree to do outside the core, consistent experience, the less likely it is that we will encounter system failure. We must be ruthless about this when discussing requirements and do only the minimum needed to support that - everything else should be done asynchronously.</p></li><li id="viewer-9rp8e"><p><strong>Explicitly guarantee eventual consistency</strong> : A single user action or client request can modify data across multiple components, and the design should guarantee that all these systems will come into consensus with some specified time - even if it is via a distributed rollback.</p></li><li id="viewer-fn6i0"><p><strong>Guarantee SLA for consistency systemically</strong> : This point is worth calling out all by itself. We may have a plan for eventual consistency, but without the mechanism for setting and enforcing a set time frame on it, it is impossible to detect failure from slow processing. Since we cannot determine whether an event threw an error during processing or whether it got dropped in the network, an explicit hard bound in time is necessary to maintain the eventual consistency guarantee.</p></li></ol><h2 id="viewer-ebf0q">Domain Coupling</h2><p id="viewer-69c17">Good distributed system design essentially hinges on separating distinct things from each other at the right level of abstraction. This line of separation is called the domain boundary and is identified by a unique language of communication and interfaces for functionality unique to that domain. E.g. A message broker domain encapsulates messages, delivery guarantees, storage media etc. Payments domain encapsulates transactions, payment gateways etc.</p><p id="viewer-89vst">While this broadly maps to the concept of bounded-context in microservice language, the idea is applicable broadly and recursively. E.g. Payments can be a domain, inside which payment gateways and transactions can be sub-domains, and so on. </p><p id="viewer-20sk3">The main idea of designing a distributed system in terms of domain is in terms of decoupling domains at the same level, while building cohesion at the level of their parent domain (if any).e.g. In the example above, we would try to keep payment gateways and transactions as decoupled from each other as possible in terms of implementation, but being part of the same domain should dictate a certain consistency in terminology and data models.</p><ol><li id="viewer-52e4f"><p><strong>Create domain boundaries</strong> : With the <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/cloud-adoption-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>huge uptick in adoption of microservices</u></a>, it becomes very important to identify the domain of each component in a manner decoupled from the underlying technical implementation. It is important to identify which components belong to which domain and how external systems talk to these systems. We might use multiple services to handle a shipment (tracking service, scanning service, audit service etc), but external users should work with a cohesive “logistics” domain entity and API. A very good tool for building domain boundaries are <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>API gateways</u></a> which can abstract the internal details of a domain behind higher order APIs.</p></li><li id="viewer-fdodc"><p><strong>Use standard domain language to communicate between systems</strong> : Chatter between two components should be in terms of existing entities + their states + actions possible on them instead of some newly created constructs which belong to neither domain. We can use constructs from either side of the communication for this, depending on whether we want events or messages. If you find that communicating between two components requires creation of some special language, it “might” mean that there is some problem in the way these two components are separated or perhaps we are missing another component that should exist between these two.</p></li><li id="viewer-1mv0b"><p><strong>Separate multi-domain/multi-component actions into workflows</strong> - A very common way domain coupling occurs is when one component starts taking end-to-end control of a multi-component workflow. This means that this one domain now knows about various other domains, their behaviour, and the nature of a “workflow” outside of its own boundary. This awareness makes the component coupled to the existing workflows and hence difficult to evolve.</p></li><li id="viewer-3bc2f"><p>If our features invoke multiple components, we should separate this orchestration out of the core services modelling the domain into stateful orchestration components. This can be dedicated orchestrating services or some sort of BPM systems. Statefulness means that we get benefits like retries, error reports, SLA etc from one place.</p></li><li id="viewer-a9ifh"><p>Using choreography to build workflows is also a viable option if we cannot use explicit orchestration for everything, but we should use some way of tracking task completion SLA to reduce the brittleness for long-lived workflows.</p></li><li id="viewer-fmjho"><p><strong>Model business processes across components</strong> : A corollary to the above point is that we should model businesses processes end-to-end regardless of technical boundaries. Since we are already decoupling domains by offloading orchestration to workflows, it doesn’t make sense to build workflows within narrow team boundaries. We should make the workflows encompass as much of the business process as a whole as we can - this will build central repositories of business knowledge and provide deep …</p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>

<h3>My Backdrop</h3><p>As geeky entrepreneur I dabble on many things tech and look for opportunities to see how tech can be leveraged to solve a business problem. I got really dirty learning and hacking Machine Learning problems and dabbled a bit on Deep Learning a couple of years back.&nbsp;</p><p>I always wanted to get back to learning more on the Deep Learning side of things when possible. "Deep Learning" is the key word.</p><p>I haven't played Games after my college days.</p><p>Since the time I started my consulting venture, I end-up working either full-stack or some part of it depending on my consulting gig that I end-up signing for.</p><p>So when I wanted to purchase a laptop, I ended up ordering a <b>Gaming Laptop</b> with Intel -7 processor and RTX 2070 GPU, based on advice of <a href="https://blog.codonomics.com/2020/06/A%20Full%20Hardware%20Guide%20to%20Deep%20Learning" target="_blank">Tim Dettmers</a>. I know very many companies that procure a Gaming Laptop for their ML/DL engineers. Also, you will see almost all ML/DL web-sites advising its readers to go for Gaming Laptops.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm not used to settling down easy and in my quest to understand the world of hardware to see what marries what and solves what kind problems, I stumbled upon <b>Workstation Laptops</b>, and was left wondering how this is both similar to and different from Gaming Laptops.&nbsp;</p><p>The section below summarizes my understanding of the key differences between the two kinds of beasts.</p><h3>Gaming Vs Workstation Laptops</h3><p>I'd drawing a quick comparison table with the metrics that should help you decide the right pick for you.</p><div><table bordercolor="#888"><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;<b>Metric<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></b></td><td><b>&nbsp;Gaming Laptop</b></td><td><b>Workstation Laptop&nbsp;</b></td><td><b>&nbsp;Comments</b></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Cost</td><td>&nbsp;Cheaper<span>&nbsp;</span></td><td>&nbsp;Expensive</td><td>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;What is your budget?</span><br></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Built</td><td>&nbsp;Depends on brand and model</td><td>&nbsp;Relatively Sturdier. <br>&nbsp;Typically server/military grade with some certification like ISV to prove it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;One of the key reasons for price difference.&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Portability</td><td>&nbsp;Relatively less portable because of its size, weight&nbsp;and/or fragility.</td><td>&nbsp;Better portability.&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Default Windows OS Type</td><td>&nbsp;Home edition<span>&nbsp;</span></td><td>&nbsp;Pro edition</td><td>&nbsp;You can always install your choice of OS later, though!</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Looks</td><td>&nbsp;Usually more jazzy and less professional</td><td>&nbsp;Usually bland and professional</td><td>&nbsp;Looks do matter!</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Longevity<span>&nbsp;</span></td><td>&nbsp;Comparatively lesser</td><td>&nbsp;Comparatively better</td><td>&nbsp;What is the ROI (bang for the bucks)?</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Audio</td><td>&nbsp;Superior</td><td>&nbsp;Relatively inferior</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Display</td><td>&nbsp;Superior<br>&nbsp;The Refresh Rate is key differentiator for smooth AAA game play experience.</td><td>&nbsp;Inferior in terms of Refresh Rate.<br>&nbsp;Usually 60 FPS.</td><td>&nbsp;High refresh rate prevents screen tearing, stuttering, motion blur and ghosting.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Heat Dissipation</td><td>&nbsp;Better</td><td>&nbsp;Relatively poorer</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Control of hardwares</td><td>&nbsp;Depending on the brand and model, you can control/configure Fan speed, CPU under-volting, etc with the help of factory software that gets installed in your OS.</td><td>&nbsp;Absent!</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Nvidia GPUs</td><td>&nbsp;Typically comes with GTX or RTX GPUs.<br>&nbsp;(RTX is more performant than GTX.)</td><td>&nbsp; Typically comes with Quadro P series, T series and RTX series GPU processors.<br>&nbsp;(P &lt; T &lt; RTX in terms of performance)</td><td><ul><li>Nvidia Quadro P1000 is a mobile entry-level workstation graphics card for notebooks.&nbsp;</li><li>Nvidia Quadro T1000 for laptops is a professional mobile graphics card that is based on the Turing architecture (TU117 chip).</li><li>Nvidia Quadro RTX 5000 for laptops is a professional high-end graphics card for big and powerful laptops and mobile workstations.&nbsp;</li><li>ProTips: Buy atleast Quadro RTX 3000. Don't go for P/T series, if ML/DL is your primary purpose.</li><li>NVIDIA GeForce and AMD Radeon are graphics cards meant for gaming.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Intel CPUs</td><td>&nbsp;Typically comes with i7 processors for AAA titled gamers play.</td><td>&nbsp;Typically comes with Intel XEON processors as base model these days</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;ECC Memory</td><td>&nbsp;Not required and so is absent.</td><td>&nbsp;Required and thus present.</td><td><ul><li>Error-correcting code memory (ECC memory) is a type of computer data storage that can detect and correct the most-common kinds of internal data corruption. ECC memory is used in most computers where data corruption cannot be tolerated under any circumstances, such as for scientific or financial computing.</li><li>ProTip: For most gamers and general home office users, ECC RAM will not be worth the additional expense.&nbsp;</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><p>A Gaming Laptop can match your Workstation in performance with right specs. You Workstation Laptop cannot match the gaming and multi-media experience delivered by its Gaming Laptop counterpart. Also you pay more for the workstation models for its improved life-span and sturdier built that relieves you from handling with delicate care every single time.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are someone like me, you should go with Workstation laptop but can opt for Gaming laptop provided you understand the Cons of it.</p><p><b>Bonus :</b> The other things that you shouldn't miss irrespective of the laptop kind you buy, is the maximum years of warranty (preferably onsite) that the company provides and also include ADP cover for maximum number of years. This is an insurance that is often overlooked by buyers only to regret later.&nbsp;</p><p>Hope it serves you well to make an informed decision in your buying the right laptop.&nbsp;</p><h4>References</h4>

  <em>
    Posted 2020-06-27
  </em>
</p>

<p>I’d heard about being able to <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/">run Docker containers with a custom security
profile</a>, but wasn’t really sure what that meant or what was
happening behind the scenes, so I decided to do some experimentation to find
out.</p>

<p>It turns out that the Linux kernel includes a feature called “secure computing
mode,” or <code>seccomp</code> for short. Using <code>seccomp</code> lets you tell the kernel that you
only expect your program to use a specific set of system calls, and if your
program makes any system calls that aren’t in your approved list, the kernel
should kill your program.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>But why would you want to do this? I think if you had a pretty simple program,
using <code>seccomp</code> might be overkill. But if your program makes different system
calls depending on possibly-untrustworthy user input, it might make sense to try
to limit what the program is allowed to do. Looking at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp#Software_using_seccomp_or_seccomp-bpf">a list of software using
<code>seccomp</code> on Wikipedia</a> backs this up: the software listed are mostly
hypervisors/container runners (like Docker), web browsers, etc.</p>

<p>By reading <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html">the manual page for the <code>seccomp(2)</code> system call</a>, we
can learn how to write a program to try this out. The simplest action is to
enter “strict mode,” which prevents all system calls except for <code>read(2)</code>,
<code>write(2)</code>, <code>_exit(2)</code>, and <code>sigreturn(2)</code> — in other words, what I think
should be just enough to write hello world! Let’s give it a shot:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#include &lt;linux/seccomp.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/prctl.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int
main()
{
        if (prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_STRICT) != 0) {
                perror("prctl");
                return 1;
        }
        printf("hello, world!\n");
        return 0;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When I compile and run my program, I just see <strong>Killed</strong> being printed, not
<strong>hello, world!</strong>. Well, this is pretty good evidence that <code>seccomp</code> is doing
<em>something</em> — it’s at least killing my program! Let’s try to find out why it’s
being killed using <a href="https://strace.io/"><code>strace</code>, a program that shows you all of the system calls
being made</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ strace ./hello
execve("./hello", ["./hello"], 0x7fff77b754b0 /* 20 vars */) = 0

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There’s a lot at the beginning about loading dynamically linked libraries,
reading the program binary, and mapping it into memory that I don’t fully
understand. But the last few syscalls provide some clues: right after <code>prctl</code> is
called, we see <code>fstat</code> being called! <code>fstat</code> is a system call for getting the
status of a file, and <code>1</code> happens to be the file descriptor for standard output.
It makes sense that calling <code>printf</code> might involve checking the status of
standard output, so I tried commenting out the call to <code>printf</code> in <code>hello.c</code>.
When I compiled and ran the new version, it still just printed <strong>Killed</strong>, so I
used <code>strace</code> again. Just looking at the last few lines:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_STRICT) = 0
exit_group(0)                           = ?
+++ killed by SIGKILL +++
Killed
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now my program is making the <code>exit_group</code> system call. Thinking back to the
manual page for <code>seccomp</code>, it said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The only system calls that the calling thread is permitted to make are
<code>read(2)</code>, <code>write(2)</code>, <code>_exit(2)</code> (but not <code>exit_group(2)</code>), and
<code>sigreturn(2)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It looks like I’ll need to actually do some real filtering if I want to run my
hello world program and not just use strict mode. To do this, we need to use
<code>SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER</code> and pass a pointer to a <code>struct sock_fprog</code>, which
according to the manpage is “a Berkeley Packet Filter program designed to filter
arbitrary system calls and system call arguments.”</p>

<p>While we could construct a BPF program using an array of <code>struct sock_filter</code>s,
looking at the chain of instructions we’d need made me think it would be much
easier to enlist the services of <a href="https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp"><code>libseccomp</code></a>, a library designed
for just this purpose. Let’s try rewriting <code>hello.c</code> to use <code>libseccomp</code> and
allowing those three syscalls we saw before (<code>fstat</code>, <code>write</code>, and
<code>exit_group</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#include &lt;seccomp.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

scmp_filter_ctx ctx;

/* graceful_exit cleans up our seccomp context before exiting */
void
graceful_exit(int rc)
{
        seccomp_release(ctx);
        exit(rc);
}

/* setup_seccomp initializes seccomp and loads our BPF program that filters
 * syscalls into the kernel */
void
setup_seccomp()
{
        int rc;

        /* Initialize the seccomp filter state */
        if ((ctx = seccomp_init(SCMP_ACT_KILL)) == NULL) {
                graceful_exit(1);
        }
        if ((rc = seccomp_reset(ctx, SCMP_ACT_KILL)) != 0) {
                graceful_exit(1);
        }

        /* Add allowed system calls to the BPF program */
        if ((rc = seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(fstat), 0)) != 0) {
                graceful_exit(1);
        }
        if ((rc = seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(write), 0)) != 0) {
                graceful_exit(1);
        }
        if ((rc = seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(exit_group), 0)) != 0) {
                graceful_exit(1);
        }

        /* Load the BPF program for the current context into the kernel */
        if ((rc = seccomp_load(ctx)) != 0) {
                graceful_exit(1);
        }
}

int
main()
{
        setup_seccomp();
        printf("hello, world!\n");
        graceful_exit(0);
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since we’re now using <code>libseccomp</code>, we need to tell our C compiler to link the
library:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ cc -o hello hello.c -lseccomp
$ ./hello
hello, world!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Success! Our program compiles and runs, and all of the necessary syscalls have
been allowed. Now let’s try modifying the <code>main()</code> function of our program to do
something bad, like trying to read the password file <code>/etc/shadow</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>int
main()
{
        FILE *fd;
        setup_seccomp();
        printf("hello, world!\n");
        if ((fd = fopen("/etc/shadow", "r")) == NULL) {
                perror("fopen");
                graceful_exit(1);
        }
        fclose(fd);
        graceful_exit(0);
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now when we compile and run our program, we get:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ ./hello
hello, world!
Bad system call (core dumped)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Nice! The kernel killed our program when we tried to use a system call
(<code>openat</code>) that we didn’t plan on!</p>

<p>Now<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> let’s go back to how this all fits in to Docker. Looking at <a href="https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/profiles/seccomp/default.json">Docker’s
default <code>seccomp</code> profile</a>, a lot of it starts to make more
sense. In fact, it looks like they’re using the exact same names from
<code>libseccomp</code> that we used in our program! If we search <a href="https://github.com/moby/moby/search?q=libseccomp">the moby source code for
<code>libseccomp</code></a>, we can see that it is indeed being used (via Go
bindings).</p>

<p>Let’s try to use a custom <code>seccomp</code> profile to prohibit programs in our Docker
container from listening for network connections. To start, I want to make sure
I can accept network connections, then modify my profile and watch it break. I
downloaded the default <code>seccomp</code> profile to use as a starting point for
tweaking, started a container with port 4000 open, then used <code>nc</code> to try
communicating from my host machine to a listener in the Docker container:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ docker run --rm -it -p 4000:4000 --security-opt seccomp=seccomp.json alpine
/ # nc -l -p 4000
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When I run <code>echo hi | nc 127.0.0.1 4000</code> in a separate terminal, my greeting is
printed by the netcat listener in the Docker container—success! Now that I know
my basic TCP server works, let’s try blocking it with <code>seccomp</code>!  To start
listening on a TCP port, I know that <code>nc</code> has to use the <code>socket</code>, <code>bind</code>, and
<code>listen</code> system calls (which we can verify using <code>strace</code>). I’ll try removing
them from the list of allowed system calls in the default profile, and run the
docker container again with the modified profile:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ docker run --rm -it -p 4000:4000 --security-opt seccomp=seccomp.json alpine
/ # nc -l -p 4000
nc: socket(AF_INET,1,0): Operation not permitted
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Awesome! We just used <code>seccomp</code> to control what our Docker container is allowed
to do!</p>

<p>I can imagine this might be helpful if you had an environment where security was
extremely important and wanted to really lock down your containers, but it’s
hard to imagine that writing custom <code>seccomp</code> profiles for every container in
your production environment is the best use of time without having some specific
situation you’re trying to address.</p>

  </p>
  <p>I show how to use heterogeneous lists and traits to implement a type-safe printf in Rust. These mechanisms can ensure that two variadic argument lists share important properties, like the number of format string holes matches the number of printf arguments.</p>
  <p><em>Part of an ongoing series about type-level programming in Rust. Consider reading <a href="http://willcrichton.net/notes/type-level-programming/">part one</a> first! All code in this node can be found in <a href="https://gist.github.com/willcrichton/e7fcf1b0e84b4be7f172f0e0245cf149">this gist</a>.</em></p>

<p>Rust has a great printf function, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.println.html"><code>println!</code></a>. It has a rich formatting language, but also catches mistakes at compile-time. For example, <code>println!</code> will check that the number of arguments matches the number of holes in the format string:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error: 2 positional arguments in format string, but there is 1 argument
  --&gt; src/printf.rs:36:13
   |
36 |   println!("{} {}", "Hello");
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>How does the Rust compiler make this check? Because both the format string and the argument are within the macro, Rust will check that the number of holes matches the number of arguments. Consequently, format strings <em>have</em> to be within the macro. If we write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>"{} {}"</span><span>;</span>
<span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>"hi"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This code fails to compile with the error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error: format argument must be a string literal
  --&gt; src/printf.rs:42:12
   |
42 |   println!(s, "hi");
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’ll show you how to implement type-safe printf without using procedural macros. More generally, this note contains a Rust recipe for functions where:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Arguments are variadic</li>
  <li>Each argument can be a different type (<code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> not allowed)</li>
  <li>Multiple variadic inputs share a parallel property, e.g. the number of arguments should match the number of format holes</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="core-mechanism-hlist">Core mechanism: HList</h2>

<p>First, we need to understand the main type-level mechanism: a heterogeneous list (or H-list). An H-list is a sequence of values of potentially different types. For example, <code>[1, "a", true]</code> is an H-list, but not a valid Rust vector. H-lists are implemented in Rust using a linked-list style:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>HNil</span><span>;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Head</span><span>,</span> <span>Tail</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>head</span><span>:</span> <span>Head</span><span>,</span>
  <span>tail</span><span>:</span> <span>Tail</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>let</span> <span>example</span><span>:</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>bool</span><span>,</span> <span>HNil</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>HCons</span><span>{</span><span>head</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>tail</span><span>:</span> <span>HCons</span><span>{</span><span>head</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>tail</span><span>:</span> <span>HNil</span><span>}};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The key idea is that the type of an H-list changes every time you make a change to it. By contrast, if you push to a <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>, the type of the vector stays the same.</p>

<p>Just like Rust has <code>vec![]</code>, we can use the <a href="https://github.com/lloydmeta/frunk#hlist">frunk</a> crate to get an <code>hlist!</code> macro.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>example</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>true</span><span>];</span> <span>// same as above</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="setting-up-printf">Setting up printf</h2>

<p>Let’s go back to the ingredients of printf. We need a format string and an argument list. The key idea is to represent both with an H-list, and carefully use Rust’s traits to ensure our desired property: the number of arguments should match the number of holes.</p>

<p>First, to represent format strings, we will have a sequence of structs that represent each part of the string.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>'static</span> <span>str</span><span>);</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FVar</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Assume that we compile "Hello {}! The first prime is {}" into this code.</span>
<span>// That would be a simple syntactic transformation.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>example</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span>
  <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span><span>,</span> <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"! The first prime is "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span>
<span>];</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To represent arguments, we will use a matching H-list of values. For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"world"</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>];</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, our goal is to create a function <code>format</code> such that this is true:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span>
  <span>example</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>),</span>
  <span>"Hello world! The first prime is 2"</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And this should be a compile-time (NOT run-time) error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>example</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"Only one arg"</span><span>]);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="the-format-trait">The Format trait</h2>

<p>In the spirit of type-level computation, we start by defining a trait.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, <code>self</code> is the H-list of the format directives, and <code>Args</code> is the H-list of the variadic arguments. <code>Format</code> need to take <code>Args</code> as a type parameter, because its type will change as we remove elements from the <code>Args</code> list.</p>

<p>Now, we proceed to implement the <code>Format</code> trait by cases. First, the base case for reaching the end of the format list <code>HNil</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HNil</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>HNil</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>HNil</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>""</span><span>.to_string</span><span>()</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This impl says that when we reach the end of a format list, just return the empty string. And the only argument we will accept is an empty argument list. Combined with the next impls, this inductively ensures that extra arguments are not accepted.</p>

<p>Next, we will implement <code>FString</code>. This implementation should use the string constant contained in the <code>FString</code> struct, and combine it recursively with the rest of the format list. We don’t use variadic arguments for <code>FString</code>, so they get passed along. In Rust, this English specification becomes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FString</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>:</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.head</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>.to_owned</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.tail</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that we have to add <code>FmtList: Format&lt;ArgList&gt;</code> to ensure the recursive call to <code>self.tail.format</code> works. Also note that we aren’t implementing <code>Format</code> directly on <code>FString</code>, but rather on an H-list containing <code>FString</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, the most complex case, <code>FVar</code>. We want this impl to take an argument from the <code>ArgList</code>, then format the remaining format list with the remaining arguments.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FVar</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span>
  <span>FmtList</span><span>:</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>ToString</span><span>,</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>args</span><span>.head</span><span>.to_string</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.tail</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>.tail</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Be careful to observe which H-list is being accessed by <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code>. Here, the <code>args</code> H-list provides the data to fill the hole via <code>args.head</code>.</p>

<h2 id="checking-our-properties">Checking our properties</h2>

<p>With this implementation, our correct example successfully compiles and runs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>example</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span>
  <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span><span>,</span> <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"! The first prime is "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span>
<span>];</span>
<span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span>
  <span>example</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"world"</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>]),</span>
  <span>"Hello world! The first prime is 2"</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What about our incorrect example? If we write this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>example</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"just one arg"</span><span>]);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This code fails to compile with the error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --&gt; src/printf.rs:48:18
   |
48 |   example.format(hlist!["just one arg"]);
   |                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |                  expected struct `Cons`, found struct `HNil`
   |
   = note: expected struct `HCons&lt;_, HNil&gt;`
              found struct `HNil`
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While the error is enigmatic, our mistake is at least correctly caught at compile-time. This is because Rust deduces that <code>example.format()</code> expects an H-list of the shape <code>HCons&lt;_, HCons&lt;_, HNil&gt;&gt;</code>, but it finds <code>HNil</code> too soon in our 1-element H-list. A similar error occurs when providing too many args.</p>

<p>Stupendous! We have successfully implemented a type-safe printf using H-lists and traits.</p>

<h2 id="extending-our-abstraction">Extending our abstraction</h2>

<p>Right now, our <code>Format</code> function just checks that the format list and argument list are the same length. We could extend our format structures, for example to ensure that an <code>FVar</code> must be a particular type, or must use <code>Debug</code> vs. <code>Display</code>. Here’s the sketch of such a strategy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>marker</span><span>::</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Add flags for whether using Display or Debug</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FDisplay</span><span>;</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FDebug</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Use a type parameter with PhantomData to represent the intended type</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FVar</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Flag</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Flag</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Now, T has to be the same between the format list and arg list</span>
<span>// Also, FDisplay flag requires that `T: Display`</span>
<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FVar</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>FDisplay</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span>
  <span>FmtList</span><span>:</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>Display</span><span>,</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// using format! is cheating, but you get the idea</span>
    <span>format!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.tail</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>.tail</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Similar impl for `T: Debug` when `FDebug` is used</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this approach, if our format list and arg list differ in type:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>fmt</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"n: "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span><span>::</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>FDisplay</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>)];</span>
<span>fmt</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"not a number"</span><span>]);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then the code will not compile with the error, <code>&amp;'static str is not i32</code>.</p>

<p>Shout-out to <a href="https://www.servant.dev/posts/2018-07-12-servant-dsl-typelevel.html">this blog post</a> from Haskell’s servant framework which got me thinking about adapting their strategy into Rust.</p>

        <p>One line summary: Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache">lru_cache decorator</a></p>

<h3 id="caching">Caching</h3>

<p>If we’re calling expensive functions in the program very frequently, It’s best to save the result of a function call and use it for future purposes rather than calling function every time. This will generally speed up the execution of the program.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The expensiveness of function can be in terms of computational (CPU usage) or latency (disk read, fetching a resource from the network).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The saving result of function calls is generally referred to as caching. The naive way to do caching is to store every function calls. But, this doesn’t scale very well with the number of parameters of function and range of each parameter.</p>

<p>So, we need a smart way to do caching with a fixed amount of memory. And, there are plenty of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies">caching strategies available</a> depending upon what type of information is available to us.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Caching is heavily used in plenty of areas from low-level (hardware/CPU) to high level (network/CDNs).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In most of the languages, We will choose caching strategies of our choice and implement them using a few data structures (hashmap, priority queue). Depending upon the language, It might take as little as few minutes to few hours to implement the generic solution of our need.</p>

<p>But, Python’s standard library <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html">functools</a> already comes with one strategy of caching called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache">LRU(Least Recently Used)</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecorators">decorators</a> in python, It only takes one line to integrate into the existing codebase</p>

<p>As, <strong>we can see the optimal cache size of fib function is 5</strong>. Increasing cache size will not result in much gain in terms of speedup.</p>

<h3 id="important-note">Important Note</h3>

<p>I strictly suggest to use lru decorator in only deterministic functions.</p>

<h4 id="deterministic-functions">Deterministic Functions</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>In computer science, a deterministic algorithm is an algorithm which, given a particular input, will always produce the same output, with the underlying machine always passing through the same sequence of states. Deterministic algorithms are by far the most studied and familiar kind of algorithm, as well as one of the most practical, since they can be run on real machines efficiently.</p>

  <p>– Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.</p>

  <p>– Phil Karlton</p>

</tbody></table>
<h2 id="Setup"><a href="#Setup" title="Setup"></a>Setup</h2><p>Rust is installed using the <a href="https://rustup.rs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rustup</a> command. rustup is similar to <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nvm</a> in Node.js. You can use it to install and manage multiple versions of Rust and more.</p>
<h2 id="Cargo"><a href="#Cargo" title="Cargo"></a>Cargo</h2><p>Installing Rust using rustup also installs Cargo similar to how installing Node.js also installs NPM. Cargo is Rust’s package manager and would feel very familiar if you’ve used NPM before.</p>
<p>Rust’s packages are called “crates”, and they’re downloaded from the <a href="https://crates.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crates.io</a> registry similar to how NPM packages are downloaded from <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">npmjs.com</a>.</p>
<p>NPM while primarily a package manager, is also used as a task runner using the <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">npm scripts</a> feature. Cargo has builtin support for common tasks like running code, building code etc. Cargo has features like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/workspaces.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">workspaces</a> (similar to <a href="https://lerna.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lerna</a>), <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dependency overrides</a> (similar to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/patch-package" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch-package</a>) out of the box. It is also a test runner (similar to mocha, jest etc), benchmark runner etc.</p>
<p>So basically, Cargo is NPM on steroids!</p>
<h2 id="Project-Setup"><a href="#Project-Setup" title="Project Setup"></a>Project Setup</h2><p>Creating a new project is done by running</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo new hello_rust</code></pre>
<p>This is somewhat similar to <code>npm init</code>. This creates a directory called “hello_rust” with the following files:</p>
<pre><code>hello_rust
├── .git
├── .gitignore
├── Cargo.toml
└─┬ src
  └── main.rs</code></pre>
<h2 id="Cargo-toml"><a href="#Cargo-toml" title="Cargo.toml"></a>Cargo.toml</h2><p>This is the package manifest file similar to package.json. The lock file (package-lock.json equivalent) is named Cargo.lock. Opening the Cargo.toml, you’ll see a familiar layout:</p>
<pre><code>[package]
name = "hello_rust"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["sheshbabu"]
edition = "2018"

[dependencies]</code></pre>
<p>The <code>[package]</code> <a href="https://toml.io/en/v0.5.0#section-16" target="_blank" rel="noopener">table</a> contains metadata like the crate name, author, keywords etc. The <code>[dependencies]</code> table is similar to the <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#dependencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dependencies object in package.json</a>. Cargo.toml also supports <code>[dev-dependencies]</code> similar to <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#devdependencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">devDependencies</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Dependency-Management"><a href="#Dependency-Management" title="Dependency Management"></a>Dependency Management</h2><p>Installing a new dependency is done by manually editing the Cargo.toml file, adding the dependency under <code>[dependencies]</code> and running <code>cargo build</code>. For example, if we want to install the “serde” crate, we need to edit the Cargo.toml file as follows:</p>
<pre><code>[package]
name = "hello_rust"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["sheshbabu"]
edition = "2018"

[dependencies]
<span>+ serde = "1.0.106"</span></code></pre>
<p>and run</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo build</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, to remove or update a dependency, we need to manually edit the Cargo.toml file and run <code>cargo build</code>. I was initially confused by the existence of the <code>cargo install</code> command but it turned out to be an equivalent of <code>npm install -g</code>.</p>
<p>If you want something similar to <code>npm install</code>, <code>npm update</code> or <code>npm uninstall</code>, you can install <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cargo-edit</a> which enhances Cargo with <code>cargo add</code>, <code>cargo rm</code> and <code>cargo upgrade</code> subcommands.</p>
<p>You can also specify the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#caret-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dependency version using patterns</a> similar to NPM.</p>
<h3 id="Task-Runner"><a href="#Task-Runner" title="Task Runner"></a>Task Runner</h3><p>Cargo supports running common tasks like build, run, test etc. But if you want something similar to NPM scripts, you can use make or <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-make" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cargo-make</a></p>
<h3 id="Live-Reload"><a href="#Live-Reload" title="Live Reload"></a>Live Reload</h3><p>Nodemon is an essential tool for Node.js development - it watches for changes to files and automatically restarts the application. <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-watch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cargo-watch</a> is the equivalent in Rust world.</p>
<h3 id="Linter-and-Formatter"><a href="#Linter-and-Formatter" title="Linter and Formatter"></a>Linter and Formatter</h3><p>Rust has builtin linter called <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clippy</a> and formatter called <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rustfmt</a>. They’re equivalent to ESLint and Prettier in JS ecosystem. Precommit hooks can be managed using <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-husky" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cargo-husky</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Vulnerability-Checking"><a href="#Vulnerability-Checking" title="Vulnerability Checking"></a>Vulnerability Checking</h3><p>Scanning for vulnerabilities in dependencies is done using <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-audit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cargo-audit</a> and is very similar to <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/audit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">npm audit</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading! :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2020-06-29 This blogpost was edited the day after it got posted. During my morning walk I realised that my code had a glaring bug in the statistics. I was reporting training set figures, not the validation set. I re-ran the system with the appropriate numbers and while the conclusions did not change, some of the figures/numbers did.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I started in data, many years ago, people were actively working on heuristics. These are rules that could look at data and then make appropriate decisions. In schematics, this was the norm;</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">

Figure 1: Those were the days.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>You had to understand the data to come up with these rules and this was very time consuming. But then machine learning changed everything. Instead of writing rules that fit a problem, we provide labels and have a machine figure out the rules instead.</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<div><p><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-2"></span>
<img src="https://koaning.io/posts/mean-squared-terror/now.png" alt="The latest and greatest." width="100%"></p><p>
Figure 2: The latest and greatest.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The latter approach has merit to it but it requires a new way of working. It also tends to be compute intensive because we’re interested in finding the best possible settings.</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<div><p><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-3"></span>
<img src="https://koaning.io/posts/mean-squared-terror/alg.png" alt="All those settings." width="100%"></p><p>
Figure 3: All those settings.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>To find the best settings for all of these models we’ve even got gridsearch via cross validation; an industry standard to make sure that we pick the best model.</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<div><p><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-4"></span>
<img src="https://koaning.io/posts/mean-squared-terror/settings.png" alt="All this expensive compute better be worth it." width="100%"></p><p>
Figure 4: All this expensive compute better be worth it.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, there’s merit to the methodology. We want to demonstrate consistent results in our models. But we’re representing <strong>all the possible properties of a model</strong> as a single number. That’s a massive reduction of information, and frankly, an overly simplified way to think about models.</p>
<h2 id="dangerzone">Dangerzone</h2>
<p>I’ve written before that “GridSearch is not Enough[tm]” but in this document I wanted to give an example of how the technique can also be a problem. GridSearch is insufficient at best, it can also be dangerous at worst.</p>

<p>The main reason is that I’ve seen people put blind faith into the methodology causing a blind spot for other issues with the model. I’ve also spoken to data scientists who think that machine learning algorithms are unbiased tools that find the “truth” in the data and that grid search is a methodological purity. This is a dangerous attitude so I figured I’d create a counter-example.</p>
<h2 id="experiment">Experiment</h2>
<p>So let’s do a small experiment. The goal is to see the effect of machine learning on a biased dataset. Given a biased dataset, will grid search amplify the bias in the dataset or reduce it?</p>
<p>I’ve draw a dataset using <a href="https://drawdata.xyz/">drawdata.xyz</a>. Let’s pretend that this usecase represents predicting salaries based on skill level. The skill level is plotted on the x-axis and the salary/reward is plotted on the y-axis. There’s two groups of datapoints and one represents a marginalized group. This group is under represented, only appears with low salaries and it also has a lower salary than it’s non-marginalised peers. The current illustration is a blunt representation of what might happen in a real life dataset (the bias can be more subtle) but the question is; what pattern will be picked up after grid search?</p>

<p>Below we’ll have a look at the results of three different models. We’ll also list the mean squared error that was reported back to us from the gridsearch.</p>

<h5 id="linear-model-with-dummy-variable">Linear Model with Dummy Variable</h5>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<div><p><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-6"></span>
<img src="https://koaning.io/posts/mean-squared-terror/plot-linear.png" alt="Mean Squared Error, Train: 1166.64 Test: 1767.36" width="100%"></p><p>

<div data-layout="l-body">
<div><p><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-7"></span>
<img src="https://koaning.io/posts/mean-squared-terror/plot_nn.png" alt="Mean Squared Error, Train: 909.66 Test: 2337.65" width="100%"></p><p>
Figure 6: Mean Squared Error, Train: 909.66 Test: 2337.65
</p>
</div>
</div>
<h5 id="grouped-linear-model">Grouped Linear Model</h5>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<div><p><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-8"></span>
<img src="https://koaning.io/posts/mean-squared-terror/plot_group.png" alt="Mean Squared Error, Train: 993.57 Test: 1343.09" width="100%"></p><p>
Figure 7: Mean Squared Error, Train: 993.57 Test: 1343.09
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Notice how the model that has the lowest mean squared error is also the model that causes the most bias between groups for higher skill levels. This increase in bias <em>cannot</em> be blamed merely on the data. It’s the choice of the model that increases this bias which is the responsibility of the algorithm designer.</p>
<p>Now, you could argue that this is a theoretical dataset. No professional would include something like gender into a model predicting salary. <a href="https://github.com/scailable/sclbl-tutorials/issues/7">Right?</a> We can repeat the same exercise with something that correlates with a sensitive attribute instead but you can expect similar result. You can get a smaller mean squared error when you can learn the bias in the dataset. No matter how subtle.</p>
<p>This is what I find scary about gridsearch. People have been learned to trust it even though it can pick a model you should not consider. Notice how the grid search would tell us that there <em>should</em> be a big payment gap between the two groups even if they display high levels of skill. In algorithmic terms some might call this behavior “optimal” while in real life, you would call this sexism, ageism or racism.</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<div><p><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-9"></span>
<img src="https://koaning.io/posts/mean-squared-terror/mcsultancyy.png" alt="Mean Squared Terror: over 9000." width="100%"></p><p>
Figure 8: Mean Squared Terror: over 9000.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The thing to remember here is that 100% unbiased datasets don’t really exist. This phenomenon of overfitting on a metric is something that gridsearch contributes to. Combine that with algorithm designers who don’t have domain knowledge in the domain that they’re applying your algorithm to and you might just get this.</p>

<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>
<p>This post was prompted by a discussion on <a href="https://thegradient.pub/pulse-lessons/">twitter</a> as well as a discussion on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6679637058597789696/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A(activity%3A6679637058597789696%2C6679704886969475072)&amp;replyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A(activity%3A6679637058597789696%2C6679775009537343488)">linkedin</a>. It’s dissapointing to see data professionals be dismissive of how bias is amplified by algorithms. It’s not something the profession should be casual about.</p>

    <p>A journey in fixing browser history
    </p></section>
    <!-- are sections appropriate for that? -->

    <section>
    <p>
Promnesia is a browser extension (Chrome/Firefox/Firefox mobile) that serves as a web surfing copilot
by enhancing your browsing history, improving your web exploration experience, and integrating with your knowledge base.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia#readme">The repository</a> contains more information about the project and the setup guide, this post is more about the motivation and the story of what led me to work on it.
</p>
<p>
Also, you can quickly skim through the <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia#demos">demos</a> first before reading, if you prefer!
</p>

<div>
<h2 id="singularity_when"><a href="#singularity_when">¶</a><span>1</span> I want my singularity!</h2>
<div id="text-singularity_when">
<p>
I was raised on science fiction and grew up dreaming about technology drastically changing our lives.
Artificial intelligence, augmenting the brain with a math co-processor, head-up displays, neural interfaces, having perfect reaction and memory – many of you are on the same page and know the drill.
</p>
<p>
Years passed, I became a software engineer, and realized just how far we are from all these fancy technologies I wanted.
So my aspirations have become more modest, and I've chosen a more realistic and plausible target:
using my digital trace (such as browser history, webpage annotations and my <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#exobrain">personal wiki</a>) to make up for my limited memory.
</p>
<p>
I'm exploring lots of information on the Internet, and it feels wasteful to use my <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#meatsack">meat resources</a> to keep track of it.
Meanwhile, web browsers keep a record automatically, without any manual and conscious effort.
Surely we can benefit from the immense computing power and memory capabilities of computers?
</p>
<p>
So I figured that I wanted:
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="what_i_want"><a href="#what_i_want">¶</a><span>2</span> Ok, maybe a web assistant at least?</h2>
<div id="text-what_i_want">
<p>
A web surfing companion. A copilot.
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">Memex</a>.
A <a href="http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~rhodes/Papers/remembrance.html">Remembrance Agent</a>?
</p>
<p>
Call it whatever you like, I <i>wish</i> it were a concept with a widely accepted name. Something that will sit in my browser and:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
aid me with <b>information processing</b>
</p>
<p>
Keep track of what I've read, when, on which device, and for how long.
</p></li>
<li><p>
show me my <b>annotations and highlights</b>, within the original page
</p>
<p>
I don't want to keep wondering whether I have my notes and thoughts stashed in some app, I want the computer to let me know instead.
</p></li>
<li><p>
unify my <b>scattered and siloed bookmarks</b>
</p>
<p>
Firefox bookmarks; Reddit/Hackernews saves; "Watch later" on Youtube, saved links in my instant messenger.
</p>
<p>
These are the same damn thing, yet there is no way to oversee and process them through a single interface.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://jborichevskiy.com/posts/digital-tools/#queue-management-for-inbound-digital-content">"Queue management for inbound digital content"</a>:
a post expanding further on this idea.
</p></li>
<li><p>
connect with my online presence: chats and social networks
</p>
<p>
If I tweeted about a page, surely this should be somehow recorded in the browsing history?
</p>
<p>
In fact, the page that I bothered to tweet about is <b>much</b> more important than a page I merely visited in the browser.
</p></li>
<li><p>
help me explore new information and <b>prioritize</b> it
</p>
<p>
There is so much awesome stuff on the Internet! The biggest problem I have is picking the next cool link to dig into.
</p>
<p>
Imagine if in one click, I could see which of my friends, or the people I follow have read a certain link.
What did they think? Have they posted about it, annotated, or something else? Do they follow the author, perhaps I should too?
</p></li>
<li><p>
bridge the gap between the browser and my <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#exobrain">personal wiki</a>
</p>
<p>
Whatever product I choose for managing my notes: Google Keep, Evernote, Roam Research, or even org-mode files on my disk,
they always end up <b>isolated and disconnected</b> from my web browsing.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
I searched for a system like this <a href="https://twitter.com/karlicoss/status/767412935316611072">for</a> several <a href="https://twitter.com/karlicoss/status/896313846159298560">years</a>.
</p>
<p>
After enough failed attempts at finding an <a href="#prior_art">existing solution</a>, I figured it was going to be yet another thing I'd have to implement myself.
</p>
<p>
The journey of building it took longer than I expected, led me through a rabbit hole of <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#dataliberation">data liberation</a>, lots of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">yak shaving</a>,
and made me realize: <b>browser history is very, very broken</b>.
</p>
<p>
Note: the next two sections are (somewhat technical) rants. If you prefer a more positive/less boring agenda, feel free to skip them straight to <a href="#prior_art">"Existing solutions"</a>
, and you can return back later if you feel like it.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="history_broken"><a href="#history_broken">¶</a><span>3</span> Browser history is broken</h2>
<div id="text-history_broken">
<p>
To a large extent, URLs express <b>relationships and hierarchy</b> between the bits of information. For example:  <code>blog &lt;-&gt; post &lt;-&gt; comment</code>, <code>person &lt;-&gt; tweet</code>, <code>playlist &lt;-&gt; video</code>.
</p>
<p>
With this information you should be easily able to find everything relevant to the current page and trace your jumps through past websites.
Merely by looking at URLs, without "AI" or some dubious machine learning algorithm!
Seems like a low hanging fruit to harvest, right?
</p>
<p>
Web browser history is a rich source of potentially useful information.
Just think about it: it's zero effort <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#lifelogging">lifelogging</a>.
It contains exact timestamps and links which <i>basically</i> address information.
</p>
<p>
Now think about the experience you actually have. What was the last time you used the browser history in any nontrivial way, for something other than reopening an accidentally closed tab?
</p>
<p>
Besides:
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="not_just_browser"><a href="#not_just_browser">¶</a>it's not just about web browsers</h3>
<div id="text-not_just_browser">
<div><p><span>
When you're using a native phone app (say, for Reddit or Twitter), your history either isn't logged anywhere or if it is, it's only stored locally on your phone.

</span></p></div>
<div><p><span>
On Android, it's likely to be in an Sqlite database in <code>/data/data/app.name</code>.
This directory is not accessible to normal users <b>unless your phone is rooted</b>.
Just think about how ridiculous this is. It's <b>your own data</b>, yet your OS babysits you, preventing access to it.

And yes, I know sandboxing and security are important, but locking my data inside the app is hardly an acceptable tradeoff.
</span></p></div>
<p>
As a specific example, the <a href="https://github.com/ccrama/Slide">Reddit Slide</a> app keeps your view history in <code>/data/data/me.ccrama.redditslide/SEEN</code>.
Okay, say you root your phone and access the database. Turns out the the app isn't persisting the data forever, it's merely keeping a few weeks' cache.
And I can hardly blame the developer for this: because of the data model, no one expects regular users to access this database.
</p>
<p>
So if you want your complete history, you have to backup this database regularly, keep the snapshots and <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/exports.html#synthetic">somehow</a>
reconstruct it.
</p>
<p>
You may dismiss this as nitpicking and obsession over every last bit of my data.
But when <b>all</b> of your phone apps are doing this you're missing out on quite a lot of useful information.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="siloed"><a href="#siloed">¶</a>it's scattered and siloed</h3>
<div id="text-siloed">
<p>
Building on the previous point:
</p>
<ul>
<li>for the most part, you can't access history in your phone apps</li>
<li>lots of data which <i>ought</i> to be counted as web history is scattered across silos

<ul>
<li><div><p><span>in the cloud: behind APIs (best case), GDPR and manual exports (worst case)

It is never easy to get hands on, <i>even</i> if you're an experienced software engineer.</span></p></div></li>
<li><p>
on the filesystem, for example in markdown/org-mode files
</p>
<p>
A slightly better scenario, but as far as the web browser is concerned, it doesn't make any difference.
</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>
Even <i>regular</i> browser history is not easy to get:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Firefox <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1080942">used to</a> silently 'expire' your browser history</li>
<li><p>
Chrome deletes history older than <a href="https://superuser.com/a/364475/300795">90 days</a>
</p>
<p>
The only way to access older history I'm aware of is <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/">Google Activity</a> and Takeout.
</p></li>
<li>Google Takeout <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/takeout-data-gone.html">quietly recycles your history</a></li>
<li><p>
Migration is limited to the most popular browsers
</p>
<p>
The retention limits the migration as well.
E.g. if you migrate from Chrome to Firefox, history older than 90 days is locked and siloed in your Google Account.
</p></li>
<li><p>
You're going to have a hard time if you're not using Google/Mozilla sync
</p>
<p>
Your history will be scattered across devices and lost on OS reinstalls.
</p>
<p>
There are ways of self-hosting Firefox sync, and (<a href="https://superuser.com/questions/614744/how-to-set-up-a-own-chrome-sync-server">allegedly</a>) even Chrome sync,
but as you can imagine, is quite tedious.
</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="significance"><a href="#significance">¶</a>it's got varying significance</h3>
<div id="text-significance">
<p>
Not all links in your history are equally important:
</p>
<ul>
<li>some are clicked on by accident</li>
<li>some you've just skimmed</li>
<li>some are on your reading list</li>
<li>some you've been reading for hours and are full of your highlights and annotations</li>
<li>some you reference in your knowledge base/personal wiki</li>
<li>some of them you've shared with others on social media</li>
</ul>
<p>
The current browser history experience makes no distinction between these scenarios.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="urls_broken"><a href="#urls_broken">¶</a><span>4</span> URLs are broken</h2>
<div id="text-urls_broken">
<p>
This topic probably deserves a separate post, but I'll keep it section-sized for now.
</p>
<p>
URLs might seem great because they mostly address content and are semi-descriptive: people <i>try</i> to keep URLs somewhat reasonable, tidy and working.
But in the real world:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
links <b>rot</b>
</p>
<p>
Many URLs are <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Archiving-URLs#link-rot"><b>literally</b> broken</a>.
We're lucky to have <a href="https://web.archive.org/">archive.org</a>, so you can at least access dead pages.
</p>
<p>
But there is no way to migrate your browser history, e.g. point old URLs to their respective archive.org entries or a new domain.
Similarly if you had the page annotated, your annotations become orphans without an easy way to relink them.
</p></li>
<li><p>
links are <b>obfuscated</b> by shortening and redirects
</p>
<div><p><span>
What happens to all the <code>t.co</code> links when Twitter as a service dies?

</span></p></div></li>
<li><p>
links are <b>obscured</b>
</p>
<p>
There is no easy way to know what's behind <code>https://www.instapaper.com/read/1265139707</code> without querying the Instapaper API.
</p>
<p>
Relations between data are often obscured as well. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22918980</code> is a submission link</li>
<li><code>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22919718</code> is a comment to that submission</li>
</ul>
<p>
These links are clearly related, but there is no way to tell it just from <samp>id</samp>.
</p>
<p>
Compare this to Reddit links:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>https://reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/g6ejwe/is_there_an_orgmode_workbook_tutorial_that_is</code> is a post link</li>
<li><code>https://reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/g6ejwe/is_there_an_orgmode_workbook_tutorial_that_is/fo9qnen</code> is a comment to that post</li>
</ul>
<p>
The ids are obscure, but at least we can clearly see the <code>post &lt;-&gt; comment</code> relation merely by looking at the URLs.
Alas, browsers are just ignoring this useful information.
</p></li>
<li><p>
links are <b>unstandardized</b>
</p>
<p>
For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string">queries</a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>typically don't point to anything persistent and are used for querying (duh)</li>
<li>but other times they are used to address information: <code>http://wiki.c2.com/?LispLanguage</code> or <code>https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2694</code></li>
<li>and in many cases are utter garbage used for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#Tracking">tracking</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
The worst part is that these use cases overlap. For example, take a look at <code>youtube.com/watch?v=wHrCkyoe72U&amp;feature=share&amp;t…</code></p></li></ul></div></div></section></article></div>

June 28, 2020 | https://adamham.dev/posts/producing-a-deepfake-on-aws/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://adamham.dev/posts/producing-a-deepfake-on-aws/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For a music video project I worked on we had to produce a deep fake. I had previously made some attempts at deepfakes using a local machine with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080. Now I'll be using a MacBook Pro and an AWS account with a generous credit (the running cost of the server only ended up being about $30 per 24 hours).</p>
<p>If you want to understand more about how machine learning works I would recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9OHn5ZF4Uo">this video</a>.</p>
<h2>Setting up</h2>
<p>The first thing was to choose a library, the two main players in the open-source deepfake space are <a href="https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap">Faceswap</a> and <a href="https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab">DeepFaceLab</a>. I chose to go with Faceswap because the GUI and the CLI seemed more user-friendly to me, it supports multiple GPUs, has a solid workflow and great community and support.</p>
<p>I had originally planned to do the inital tests on my local machine but my MacBook Pro has an ATI graphics card 🥺. So straight to the cloud I go... I used a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g4/">g4dn.xlarge EC2 instance</a> and loaded it with the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/amis/">AWS Deep Learning AMI</a>. After wrestling with the <a href="https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap/blob/master/INSTALL.md">installation of faceswap</a> (had some dependancy issues that may have been related to using the deep learning AMI) I managed to get it up and running on the remote instance.</p>
<h3>Preliminary tests</h3>
<p>To start we did a test run first to see what kind of results we could get using mostly default settings and with minimal intervention, just to get an idea of what was really possible with our material. For this I used the same footage for Face A from the target video that I wanted to convert, and for Face B I recorded 60 seconds of the subject performing basic facial movements from different angles.</p>
<p>From the preliminary results I could identify what the parameters that I was working within were. I noticed that a lot of my faces are a profile view, deepfakes work much better with a frontal view. Also my source material is a very low resolution (480p YouTube rip of an 80s video). This makes faces harder to detect, particularly smaller faces.</p>
<p>I would highly suggest doing a few tests before fully training your model. It'll also help you to tell which angles and expressions are lacking from your source footage.</p>
<h3>Project structure</h3>
<p>My initial tests also encouraged me to define a folder structure, I found this to be an efficient structure for deepfake projects</p>

        <deckgo-highlight-code>
          <code slot="code">/my-project
/my-project/src
/my-project/src/faceA/              // - Source footage/images for Face A
/my-project/src/faceB/              // - "                       " Face B
/my-project/src/target/             // - Footage to convert
/my-project/extract/faceA           // - Extracted faces from Face A
/my-project/extract/faceB           // - "                  " Face B
/my-project/model/                  // - Trained model
/my-project/output/                 // - Converted media (final exports)</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code>
      
<h2>1. Extract</h2>
<h3>Face A - 6586 faces extracted</h3>
<p>I used 3 video clips of Robin Gibb that I could find from that era and cut out the footage that was worth extracting.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-U058BIAGo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-U058BIAGo</a> <strong>(This is also the target video)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMvRLLPd8Ak">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMvRLLPd8Ak</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Nykcs7Zhg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Nykcs7Zhg</a></p>
<h3>Face B - 7382 faces extracted</h3>
<p>I recorded 5 minutes of footage of the subject replicating the facial movements from the target source.</p>
<p>To prepare the extracted faces for training they need to be cleaned up. The better your source material is the better your result will be. This part of the process took about 10 hours.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove any extracted faces that are of poor quality</li>
<li>Remove any bad detected faces</li>
<li>Regenerate alignments file to remove the deleted faces</li>
<li>Manually go through each face and clean up the alignment</li>
<li>Generate new masks</li>
</ul>
<p>After extracting the faces to use for training I cleaned and sorted the faces to remove any poor quality faces or things that were detected by error. Faceswap actually has a tool to allow you to sort the extracted faces by relevance to help you filter them out. After deleting the bad faces you'll also need to remove them from your alignments file using the alignments tool.</p>
<h2>2. Train</h2>
<p>There are a few different types of models you can train it all depends on what material you have and the results you want to achieve. I had time and computing power on my side so I decided to launch 3 instances and train variations of models to 20,000 iterations and then select the best one from there. I chose to go with Dfaker using a VCC-Clear mask.</p>
<p>Note: I made an error and accidentally deleted the full timelapse permanently but I have a few captures here for demo purposes. The final model was much more defined than shown in this timelapse.</p>
<p>My final model was trained for 75,000 iterations. I started it again and ran it for another 10,000 where I could see that the loss level was not improving, therefore the model was no longer learning and I could conclude that my model was trained.</p>
<p><img src="https://adamham.dev/posts/producing-a-deepfake-on-aws/training.gif" alt="Timelapse of model being trained in faceswap"></p>
<h2>3. Convert</h2>
<p>To prepare the target footage to be converted we need to repeat step 1 (extract) again being as meticulous as possible with the alignments. I spent about 4 hours on ~4,100 frames to achieve my result.</p>
<p>I definitely ran into difficulties with the face detection because of the low resolution of my source footage.</p>
<h2>Result</h2>
<h3>Converted Video</h3>
<p> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sqc8EvnyyBM?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>  </p>
<h3>Original Video</h3>
<p> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A-U058BIAGo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>  </p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>The abilities of the technology is really hyped up in the media. To achieve an undetectable result you really do need source footage that fits into the parameters of what a deepfake can work with.</p>
<p>For this project the aim wasn't to have a perfectly undetectable deepfake, the limitations weren't a problem but infact contributed to the concept. The song is a cover and seeing artifacts from the deepfake reinforces this idea.</p>
<p>The cost of processing the deepfake on AWS comes at about $30 per day. If you were doing a couple of renders a year then it's an amazing option rather than using your own hardware. However, things like manual alignments are really tricky using a remote machine so ideally you would want to have a CUDA capable graphics card in your local. A dedicated graphics machine with comparable specs would start at about $1400 (about 46 days of AWS EC2 usage) plus electricity bills.</p></div></div>]]>

<h4><em><strong>This will be a chapter in my upcoming book “Functional MRI” </strong><strong>in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge Series&nbsp;</strong></em></h4>
<hr>
<p>Functional MRI is unique in that, in spite of being almost 30 years old as a method, it continues to progress in terms of sophistication of acquisition, hardware, processing, in our understanding of the signal itself. There has been no plateau in any of these areas. In fact, by looking at the literature, one gets the impression that this advancement is accelerating. Every new advance opens the potential range where it might have an impact, allowing new questions about the brain to be addressed.</p>
<p>In spite of its success – perhaps as a result of its success – it has had its share of controversies coincident with methods advancements, new observations, and novel applications. Some controversies have been more contentious than others. Over the years, I’ve been following these controversies and have at times performed research to resolve them or at least better understand them. A good controversy can help to move the field forward as it can focus and motivate groups of people to work on the issue itself, shedding a broader light on the field as these are overcome.</p>
<p>While a few of the controversies or issues of contention have been fully resolved, most remain to some degree unresolved. Understanding fMRI through its controversies allows a deeper appreciation for how the field advances as a whole – and how science really works – the false starts, the corrections, and the various claims made by those with potentially useful pulse sequences, processing methods, or applications. Below is the list of twenty-six major controversies in fMRI – in approximately chronological order.</p>
<h2>#1: The Neurovascular coupling debate.</h2>
<p>Since the late 1800’s, the general consensus, hypothesized by Roy and Sherrington in 1890 (1), was that activation-induced cerebral flow changes were driven by local changes in metabolic demand. In 1986, a publication by Fox et al. (2)challenged that view, demonstrating that with activation, localized blood flow seemingly increased beyond oxidative metabolic demand, suggesting an “uncoupling” of the hemodynamic response from metabolic demand during activation. Many, including Louis Sokolof, a well-established neurophysiologist at the National Institutes of Health, strongly debated the results. Fox nicely describes this period in history from his perspective in “The coupling controversy” (3).</p>
<p>I remember well, in the early days of fMRI, Dr. Sokolof standing up from the audience to debate Fox on several circumstances, arguing that the flow response should match the metabolic need and there should be no change in oxygenation. He argued that what we are seeing in fMRI is something other than an oxygenation change.</p>
<p>In the pre-fMRI days, I recall not knowing what direction the signal should go – as when I first laid eyes on the impactful video presented by Tom Brady during his plenary lecture on the future of MRI at the Society for Magnetic Resonance (SMR) Meeting in August of 1991, it was not clear from these time series movies of subtracted images the direction he performed the subtraction operation. Was it task minus rest or rest minus task? Did the signal go up or down with activation? I also remember very well, analyzing my first fMRI experiments, expecting to see a decrease in BOLD signal – as Ogawa, in an earlier paper(4), hypothesized that metabolic rate increases would lead to a decrease blood oxygenation thus a darkening of the BOLD signal during brain activation. Instead, all I saw were signal increases. It was Fox’s work that helped me to understand why the BOLD signal should <em>increase</em>with activation. Flow goes up and oxygen delivery exceeds metabolic need, leading to an increase in blood oxygenation.</p>
<p>While models of neurovascular coupling have improved, we still do not understand the precise need for flow increases. First, we had the “watering the whole garden to feed one thirsty flower” hypothesis which suggested that flow increases matched metabolic need for one area but since vascular control was coarse, the abundant oxygenation was delivered to a wider area than was needed, causing the increase in oxygenation. We also had the “diffusion limited” model, where it was hypothesized that in order to deliver enough oxygen to the furthest neurons from the oxygen supplying vessels, an overabundance of oxygen was needed at the vessel itself since the decrease of oxygen as it diffused from the vessel to the furthest cell was described as an exponential. &nbsp;This theory has fallen a bit from favor as the increases in CMRO<sub>2</sub>or the degree to which the diffusion of oxygen to tissue from blood is limited tend to be higher than physiologic measures. The alternative to the metabolic need hypothesis involves neurogenic “feed-forward” hypotheses – which still doesn’t get at the “why” of the flow response.</p>
<p>Currently, this is where the field stands. We know that the flow response is robust and consistent. We know that in active areas, oxygenation in healthy brains always increases, however we just don’t understand specifically why it’s necessary. Is it a neurogenic, metabolic, or some other mechanism to satisfy some evolutionary critical need that extends beyond simple need for more oxygen? We are still figuring that out. Nevertheless, it can be said that whatever the reason for this increase in flow, it is fundamentally important, as the BOLD response is stunningly consistent.</p>
<h2>#2: The Draining Vein Effect</h2>
<p>The question: “what about the draining veins?” I think was first posited at an early fMRI conference by Kamil Ugurbil of the University of Minnesota. Here and for the next several years he alerted the community to the observation that, especially at low field, draining veins are a problem as they smear and distort the fMRI signal change such that it’s hard to know specifically where the underlying neuronal activation is with a high degree of certainty. In the “20 years of fMRI: the science and the stories” special issue of NeuroImage, Ravi Menon writes a thorough narrative of the “Great brain vs vein” debate (5). &nbsp;When the first fMRI papers were published, only one, by Ogawa et al. (6), was at high field – 4 Tesla – and relatively high resolution. In Ogawa’s paper, it was shown that there was a differentiation between veins (very hot spots) and capillaries (more diffuse weaker activation in grey matter). Ravi followed this up with another paper (7)using multi-echo imaging, to show that blood in veins had an intrinsically shorter T2* decay than gray matter at 4T and appeared as dark dots in T2* weighted structural images yet appeared as bright functional hot spots in the 4T functional images. Because of the low SNR and CNR at 1.5T, allowing only the strongest BOLD effects to be seen, and because models suggested that at low field strengths, large vessels contributed the most to the signal, the field worried that all fMRI was looking at was veins – at least at 1.5T.</p>
<p>The problem of large vein effects is prevalent using standard gradient-echo EPI – even at high fields. Simply put, the BOLD signal is directly proportional to the venous blood volume contribution in each voxel. If the venous blood volume is high – as with the case of a vein filling a voxel – then the potential for high BOLD changes is high if there is a blood oxygenation change in the area. At high field, indeed, there is not much intravascular signal left in T2* weighted Gradient-echo sequences, however, the extravascular effect of large vessels still exists.&nbsp; Spin-echo sequences (sensitive to small compartments) still are sensitive to the susceptibility effects around intravascular red blood cells within large vessels – even at 7T where intravascular contribution is reduced. Even with some vein sensitivity, promising high resolution orientation column results have been produced at 7T using gradient-echo and spin-echo sequences (8). The use of arterial spin labeling has potential as a method insensitive to large veins, although the temporal efficiency, intrinsic sensitivity, and brain coverage limitations blunt its utility. Vascular Space Occupancy (VASO), a method sensitive to blood volume changes, has been shown to be exquisitely sensitive to blood volume changes in small vessels and capillaries. Preliminary results have shown clear layer dependent activation using VASO where other approaches have provided less clear delineation(9).</p>
<p>Methods have arisen to identify and mask large vein effects – including thresholding based on percent signal change (large veins tend to fill voxels and thus exhibit a larger fractional signal change), as well as temporal fluctuations (large veins are pulsatile thus exhibit more magnitude and phase noise). While these seem to be workable solutions, they have not been picked up and used extensively. With regard to using the phase variations as a regressor to eliminate pulsatile blood and tissue, perhaps the primary reason for this not being adopted is because standard scanners do not produce these images readily, thus users do not have easy access to this information.</p>
<p>The draining vein issue is least problematic at voxel sizes larger than 2mm, as at these resolutions, mostly the region of activation- as defined as &gt;1 cm “blob” is used and interpreted. Other than enhancing the magnitude of activation, vein effects do not distort these “blobs” thus are typically of no …</p></div></article></div>

    <p>I was looking for an alternative to Google Analytics to track visitors on a website. Analytics (and most of its competitors) provide detailed information and real-time data at the cost of privacy. Google can track you across sites using a bunch of different techniques and through their Chrome browser. Combined, this can be assembled to a detailed profile that can not only be used for tracking, but for marketing too.</p><p>I found some (open source) alternatives like <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GoatCounter</a>, which anonymously collect data without invading the user's privacy. But all of the tools I found either rely on cookies, which the visitor needs to opt-in for or cost money for the server-side only tracking solution. While I'm willing to pay for good software, especially when it comes from a small team or just one developer, I was wondering if I could build something that I can integrate into my Go applications.</p><p>This post is about my solution called <em>Pirsch</em>, an open-source Go library that can be integrated into your applications to tracks visitors on the server-side, without setting cookies. I will write about the technique used and what the advantages and disadvantages are.</p><blockquote><h2>TL;DR</h2><p>Invading the privacy of your website visitors is evil. Pirsch is a privacy-focused tracking library for Go that can be integrated into your applications. Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/emvi/pirsch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a>!</p><p>You can find a live demo <a href="https://marvinblum.de/tracking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> on my website and the whole thing on GitHub as a <a href="https://github.com/Kugelschieber/marvinblum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">sample application</a>.</p></blockquote><h2>What's With the Name?</h2><p>Pirsch is German and refers to a special kind of hunt:&nbsp;<em>the hunter carefully and quietly enters the area to be hunted, he stalks against the wind in order to get as close as possible to the prey without being noticed.</em></p><p>I found this quite fitting for a tracking library that cannot be blocked by the visitor. Even though it sounds a little sneaky. Here is the Gopher for it create by <a href="https://github.com/Motorschpocht" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Daniel</a>.</p><img src="https://marvinblum.de/static/blog/OxdzmGZ1Bl/0wV4YBIYaCm9JiteSaa3.svg" alt="https://api.emvi.com/api/v1/content/0wV4YBIYaCm9JiteSaa3.svg"><h2>How Does It Work?</h2><p>I will go over each step in more detail later, but here is a high-level overview of how Pirsch tracks visitors.</p><img src="https://marvinblum.de/static/blog/OxdzmGZ1Bl/vuvopEa9M7yGpKWgwXht.svg" alt="https://api.emvi.com/api/v1/content/vuvopEa9M7yGpKWgwXht.svg"><p>Once someone visits your website, the HTTP handler calls Pirsch to store a new hit and goes on with whatever it intends to do. Pirsch will do its best to filter out bots, calculate a fingerprint, and stores the page hit. You can analyze the data and generate statistics from it later.</p><p>The process must be triggered manually by calling the <code>Hit</code> method and passing the <code>http.Request</code>. This enables you to decide which traffic is tracked and which is not. I'm usually just interested in page visits, so I'll add a call to Pirsch inside my page handlers. Resources are served on a different endpoint and won't be tracked that way.</p><h3>Fingerprinting</h3><p>Fingerprinting is a technique to identify individual devices by combing some parameters. The parameters are typically things like the graphics card ID and other variables that are unique to a device. As we are interested in tracking website traffic, we won't have access to this kind of information. Instead, we can make use of the IP and HTTP protocol. Here are the parameters used by Pirsch to generate a fingerprint:</p><ul><li><p>the IP is the most obvious choice. It might change, as ISPs only have a limited pool of IPs available to them, but that shouldn't happen too frequently</p></li><li><p>the User-Agent HTTP header contains information about the browser and device used by the visitor. It might not be filled though, but it usually is</p></li></ul><p>To generate a unique fingerprint from this information, we can calculate a hash. Pirsch will add the current day to prevent tracking users across days and calculate an MD5 hash. I found this to be the fastest algorithm available in the Go standard library. This will also make the visitor anonymous at the same time as we do not store IPs or other identifiable information.</p><p>This method is called <em>passive</em> fingerprinting, as we're only using data that we have access to anyways. The alternative is called <em>active</em> fingerprinting, which makes use of JavaScript to collect additional information on the client-side and sends it to the backend. But as we're trying to build a privacy-focus tracking solution, passive fingerprinting is the way to go.</p><p>We will use the fingerprint later to count unique visitors.</p><h3>Filtering Bots</h3><p>Filtering out bot traffic is hard, as there is no complete list of all bots and they won't send any special kind of information, like an <em>I'm a bot</em> header. All we can do is to process the IP and the User-Agent header send and make some assumptions. Pirsch will look for terms often used by bots within the User-Agent header. Should it contain words like <em>bot</em> or <em>crawler</em> or an URL, the hit will be dropped. Filtering for IP ranges is not implemented (yet), but you can filter hits that are coming from popular IP ranges, like AWS.</p><h3>Hits</h3><p>Each page request is stored as a <em>Hit</em>. A hit is a data point that can later be analyzed. Here is the definition of a hit:</p><pre><code language="text/x-go">// I removed some details to make it more readable for this blog post
type Hit struct {
	Fingerprint string
	Path        string
	URL         string
	Language    string
	UserAgent   string
	Ref         string
	Time        time.Time
}</code></pre><p>A hit contains the full request URL, the path extracted from the URL, the language, user-agent and reference passed by the client in their corresponding headers and the time the request was made.</p><h3>Analyze</h3><p>Pirsch provides an <em>Analyzer</em> that can be used to extract some basic statistics:</p><ul><li><p>total visitor count</p></li><li><p>visitors by page on each day</p></li><li><p>visitors by hour on each day</p></li><li><p>languages used by visitors</p></li><li><p>active visitors within a time frame</p></li></ul><p>Most of these functions accept a filter to specify a time frame. The data can then be plotted like on my <a href="https://marvinblum.de/tracking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">tracking page</a>.</p><img src="https://marvinblum.de/static/blog/OxdzmGZ1Bl/QOeMcMKi8yS2p4WB2Xlu.png" alt="https://api.emvi.com/api/v1/content/QOeMcMKi8yS2p4WB2Xlu.png"><p>To reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed the hits get aggregated each night and hits are cleaned up afterward.</p><p>Postgres is used as the storage backend at the moment as it is a fantastic open-source database and provides all features needed to read these statistics easily. You can extract more statistics, like the visitor page flow, from the database if you care.</p><h3>Tracking From JavaScript</h3><p>While it is simple to integrate tracking into your backend, you might also want to have some way to track from your frontend as well, in case you're running a single page application for example. In that case, you can add an endpoint to your router and call it using Ajax. The path can manually be overwritten in Pirsch by calling <em>HitPage</em> instead of <em>Hit</em>.</p><h2>How Well Does It Work?</h2><p>As far as I can tell right now, it works pretty well. I still need to collect more sample data and a way to compare it to something like Google Analytics in order to make a more precise statement. Keep in mind that while Analytics and other tools provide more detailed statistics, like the location, age, gender, and so on, they can be blocked by tools like uBlock. Pirsch cannot be blocked by the client and therefore it can track visitors you won't even notice with a client-side solution.</p><p>Bots are probably the weak spot of Pirsch right now, as filtering for them requires adding a whole bunch of keywords to the filter list.</p><p>Another disadvantage of server-side tracking depending on your use-case  might be that you cannot track your marketing campaigns. In case you're using Adsense for marketing, you can track how well your campaigns perform through Analytics. This won't work with Pirsch.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Tracking on the server-side isn't too hard to archive and all in all, I think it's worth the effort. I hope you gained some insight into how you can use fingerprinting and Pirsch to your advantage. I will continue improving Pirsch and implement it into <a href="https://emvi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Emvi</a> and compare the output to Analytics. I might also add a user interface for Pirsch so that you can host it without integrating it into your application and without the need to generate the charts yourself. In case you would like to send me feedback, have a question, or would like to contribute you can contact me.</p>

run a program which calls <code>open</code>, <code>fork</code>, <code>read</code>, <code>write</code> (and many others) you are making a system call.</p><p>System calls are how a program enters the kernel to perform some task. Programs use system calls to perform a variety of operations such as: creating processes, doing network and file IO, and much more.</p><p>You can find a list of system calls by checking the <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syscalls.2.html">man page for syscalls(2)</a>.</p><p>There are several different ways for user programs to make system calls and the low-level instructions for making a system call vary among CPU architectures.</p><p>As an application developer, you don’t typically need to think about how exactly a system call is made. You simply include the appropriate header file and make the call as if it were a normal function.</p><p><code>glibc</code> provides wrapper code which abstracts you away from the underlying code which arranges the arguments you’ve passed and enters the kernel.</p><p>Before we can dive into the details of how system calls are made, we’ll need to define some terms and examine some core ideas that will appear later.</p><h2 id="hardware-and-software">Hardware and software</h2><p>This blog post makes the following assumptions that:</p><ul><li>You are using a 32-bit or 64-bit Intel or AMD CPU. The discussion about the methods may be useful for people using other systems, but the code samples below contain CPU-specific code.</li><li>You are interested in the Linux kernel, version 3.13.0. Other kernel versions will be similar, but the exact line numbers, organization of code, and file paths will vary. Links to the 3.13.0 kernel source tree on GitHub are provided.</li><li>You are interested in <code>glibc</code> or <code>glibc</code> derived libc implementations (e.g., <code>eglibc</code>).</li></ul><p>x86-64 in this blog post will refer to 64bit Intel and AMD CPUs that are based on the x86 architecture.</p><h2 id="user-programs-the-kernel-and-cpu-privilege-levels">User programs, the kernel, and CPU privilege levels</h2><p>User programs (like your editor, terminal, ssh daemon, etc) need to interact with the Linux kernel so that the kernel can perform a set of operations on behalf of your user programs that they can’t perform themselves.</p><p>For example, if a user program needs to do some sort of IO (<code>open</code>, <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, etc) or modify its address space (<code>mmap</code>, <code>sbrk</code>, etc) it must trigger the kernel to run to complete those actions on its behalf.</p><p>What prevents user programs from performing these actions themselves?</p><p>It turns out that the x86-64 CPUs have a concept called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_level">privilege levels</a>. Privilege levels are a complex topic suitable for their own blog post. For the purposes of this post, we can (greatly) simplify the concept of privilege levels by saying:</p><ol><li>Privilege levels are a means of access control. The current privilege level determines which CPU instructions and IO may be performed.</li><li>The kernel runs at the most privileged level, called “Ring 0”. User programs run at a lesser level, typically “Ring 3”.</li></ol><p>In order for a user program to perform some privileged operation, it must cause a privilege level change (from “Ring 3” to “Ring 0”) so that the kernel can execute.</p><p>There are several ways to cause a privilege level change and trigger the kernel to perform some action.</p><p>Let’s start with a common way to cause the kernel to execute: interrupts.</p><h2 id="interrupts">Interrupts</h2><p>You can think of an interrupt as an event that is generated (or “raised”) by hardware or software.</p><p>A hardware interrupt is raised by a hardware device to notify the kernel that a particular event has occurred. A common example of this type of interrupt is an interrupt generated when a NIC receives a packet.</p><p>A software interrupt is raised by executing a piece of code. On x86-64 systems, a software interrupt can be raised by executing the <code>int</code> instruction.</p><p>Interrupts usually have numbers assigned to them. Some of these interrupt numbers have a special meaning.</p><p>You can imagine an array that lives in memory on the CPU. Each entry in this array maps to an interrupt number. Each entry contains the address of a function that the CPU will begin executing when that interrupt is received along with some options, like what privilege level the interrupt handler function should be executed in.</p><p>Here’s a photo from the Intel CPU manual showing the layout of an entry in this array:</p><p><img src="https://blog.packagecloud.io/images/idt.png" alt="Screenshot of Interrupt Descriptor Table entry diagram for x86_64 CPUs"></p><p>If you look closely at the diagram, you can see a 2-bit field labeled DPL (Descriptor Privilege Level). The value in this field determines the minimum privilege level the CPU will be in when the handler function is executed.</p><p>This is how the CPU knows which address it should execute when a particular type of event is received and what privilege level the handler for that event should execute in.</p><p>In practice, there are lots of different ways to deal with interrupts on x86-64 systems. If you are interested in learning more read about the <a href="http://wiki.osdev.org/8259_PIC">8259 Programmable Interrupt Controller</a>, <a href="http://wiki.osdev.org/APIC">Advanced Interrupt Controllers</a>, and <a href="http://wiki.osdev.org/IOAPIC">IO Advanced Interrupt Controllers</a>.</p><p>There are other complexities involved with dealing with both hardware and software interrupts, such as interrupt number collisions and remapping.</p><p>We don’t need to concern ourselves with these details for this discussion about system calls.</p><h2 id="model-specific-registers-msrs">Model Specific Registers (MSRs)</h2><p>Model Specific Registers (also known as MSRs) are control registers that have a specific purpose to control certain features of the CPU. The CPU documentation lists the addresses of each of the MSRs.</p><p>You can use the CPU instructions <code>rdmsr</code> to <code>wrmsr</code> to read and write MSRs, respectively.</p><p>There are also command line tools which allow you to read and write MSRs, but doing this is <em>not recommended</em> as changing these values (especially while a system is running) is dangerous unless you are really careful.</p><p>If you don’t mind potentially destabilizing your system or irreversibly corrupting your data, you can read and write MSRs by installing <code>msr-tools</code> and loading the <code>msr</code> kernel module:</p><figure><pre><code data-lang="sh">% <span>sudo </span>apt-get install msr-tools
% <span>sudo </span>modprobe msr
% <span>sudo </span>rdmsr</code></pre></figure><p>Some of the system call methods we’ll see later make use of MSRs, as we’ll see soon.</p><h2 id="calling-system-calls-with-assembly-is-a-bad-idea">Calling system calls with assembly is a bad idea</h2><p>It’s not a great idea to call system calls by writing your own assembly code.</p><p>One big reason for this is that some system calls have additional code that runs in glibc before or after the system call runs.</p><p>In the examples below, we’ll be using the <code>exit</code> system call. It turns out that you can register functions to run when <code>exit</code> is called by a program by using <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/atexit.3.html"><code>atexit</code></a>.</p><p>Those functions are called from glibc, not the kernel. So, if you write your own assembly to call <code>exit</code> as we show below, your registered handler functions won’t be executed since you are bypassing glibc.</p><p>Nevertheless, manually making system calls with assembly is a good learning experience.</p><div><p>Create a package repository in less than 10 seconds, free.</p></div><p>Using our prerequisite knowledge we know two things:</p><ol><li>We know that we can trigger the kernel to execute by generating a software interrupt.</li><li>We can generate a software interrupt with the <code>int</code> assembly instruction.</li></ol><p>Combining these two concepts leads us to the legacy system call interface on Linux.</p><p>The Linux kernel sets aside a specific software interrupt number that can be used by user space programs to enter the kernel and execute a system call.</p><p>The Linux kernel registers an interrupt handler named <code>ia32_syscall</code> for the interrupt number: 128 (0x80). Let’s take a look at the code that actually does this.</p><p>From the <code>trap_init</code> function in the kernel 3.13.0 source in <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v3.13/arch/x86/kernel/traps.c#L770"><code>arch/x86/kernel/traps.c</code></a>:</p><figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>void</span> <span>__init</span> <span>trap_init</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span>

The arguments for the syscall itself are to be placed in the remaining general purpose registers.</p><p>One place this is documented is in a comment in <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v3.13/arch/x86/ia32/ia32entry.S#L378-L397"><code>arch/x86/ia32/ia32entry.S</code></a>:</p><figure><pre><code data-lang="c"> <span>*</span> <span>Emulated</span> <span>IA32</span> <span>system</span> <span>calls</span> <span>via</span> <span>int</span> <span>0x80</span><span>.</span>

                    <p>Before coronavirus pandemic, more than half of the world was burning in the fire of warfare. Military operations, surgical strikes, terrorism, and weaponization were mainstream news. There was chaos around the world on both the International and national level. The world economy was consisted up on war budgets. Then Coronavirus appeared and the whole world bent down to ceasefire. </p><h3 id="artificial-intelligence-ai-is-need-of-covid-19-pandemic-era">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is need of Covid-19 pandemic era</h3><p>Since all aspects of life were devastated by this pandemic, including jobs, gatherings, business, etc., a new approach to deal with this secondary threat was necessary. When you think of <a href="https://thinkml.ai/will-robot-take-my-job/">replacing human at the workplace</a>, only one solution comes to mind, i.e. Artificial Intelligence (AI). Automation has been considered as a <a href="https://thinkml.ai/is-artificial-intelligence-ai-a-threat-to-humans/">threat to human</a> employment. But now, nobody can think anything else except the AI and robotics as modern salvation. In this article, we shall see how states changed their direction from weapons to robots and AI to cope with life problems.</p><p>The first case of COVID-19 was reported in China’s city of Wuhan. In the beginning, it was not taken seriously but over time, COVID-19 proved itself worthy of global attention. All the governments and states were forced to put aside petty grievances and focus on the pandemic. Public health policies were redesigned and war adventures were halted.</p><p>The world’s superpowers are now forced to cut the defense budgets and assign more grants to a medical emergency. This can devastate the long term war goals and all previous investment may lay waste. In this article, we shall discuss the warfare budget cuts and medical grants for fighting against COVID-19.</p><h3 id="how-china-is-focusing-on-healthcare-rather-than-defense">How China is focusing on Healthcare rather than defense?</h3><p>China’s expected health expenditure will be around $1 trillion by 2020, while China’s defense budget is $177.6 billion. This makes China the 2<sup>nd</sup> most spender on defense. Analytics firm <a href="https://www.globaldata.com/">GlobalData</a> has predicted that the world may face a shortage of 880,000 ventilators during the COVID-19 outbreak. China is apt for accepting this challenge and working continuously to provide the world with the lifesaving breath. China has received a demand for 20,000 ventilators from different countries. They are working 24.7 to meet the global as well as local demand. </p><p>There are 21 ventilator manufacturing companies in China. Eight of them just received European standard clearance for export. These eight companies produce 20% of the total global production of ventilators. These firms can make 2200 ventilators in a week.</p><p>The whole world has known what the real enemy of humanity is. All the conspiracies and warfare have contracted into medical defense. Now, the international community is joining hands to fight against pandemic and putting aside all grudges. We can hope that this outbreak will open our eyes and states will work more for humanity rather than power games.</p><p>China’s biggest tech giants like Alibaba and Baidu, Tencent, and Huawei sneaked into the health care evolution after the successful conquest of business horizons. All these giants promised to put all their efforts to cope with coronavirus pandemic. Being artificial intelligence companies, they utilized their skillset for combating the outbreak. </p><h3 id="ct-image-analytics-for-covid-19">CT Image Analytics for COVID-19</h3><p>Alibaba launched their online medical facility in January 2020, where patients can contact medical professionals online. This company deployed an online drug delivery system in February as well. The AI unit of Alibaba has claimed to launch an <a href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/solutions/ct-image-analytics">AI program</a>that can analyze Computerized Tomography (CT) scan reports within 3 to 4 seconds with 96% accuracy. This algorithm is capable of differentiating between coronavirus pneumonia, mild COVID-19 pneumonia, and non-COVID chest infections. It is a joint venture of Alibaba <a href="https://damo.alibaba.com/">DAMO Academy</a>and Intel Corp for the decentralization of AI.</p><p>Alibaba’s cloud program designed an algorithm for quick genome sequencing and analysis to fasten the genome research and COVID-19 vaccine development.</p><p>Baidu has launched the biggest online medical consultation free platform that has responded to 15 million queries and consists up of 100,000 doctors to respond. </p><p><a href="https://www.baidu.com/">Baidu</a>’s new artificial intelligent algorithm called LinearFold is a Next-Generation Sequencing analyzer that compares and annotate the COVID-19 viral genome for quick research.</p><p><strong>“</strong>The special situation of the epidemic has created a huge demand for online medical services and information. The public has been using the internet to gain information about the latest development of the epidemic and professional health-care services,<strong>”</strong> Yang Minglu, general manager of Baidu’s health-care business unit talked to CNBC.</p><h3 id="u-s-defense-budget-cut-and-covid-19-funding">U.S. Defense budget cut and Covid-19 funding</h3><p>Pentagon has submitted the request for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/military-faces-another-potential-coronavirus-toll-budget-cuts/2020/05/14/ae7abbf6-906b-11ea-8df0-ee33c3f5b0d6_story.html">$705 billion</a> in the defense head, which comprises 50% of the total federal government’s budget for the fiscal year 2021. But Federal Government officials have shown the fear that this demand would not be fulfilled due to serial budget deficits for the last five years and COVID-19 pandemic. Besides the budget constraints, soldiers may be prone to have coronavirus infection. Projections are indicating a 3% budget reduction, which is quite a big amount. This may lead to restricted purchasing of high-fi military equipment like F-35 fighter jets.</p><p>US Department of Health &amp; Human Services (<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/index.html">HHS</a>) is playing a major role in fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic. HHS is distributing $175 billion among hospitals and healthcare providers who are helping against coronavirus outbreak. Previously, the US government failed to have a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/business/coronavirus-us-ventilator-shortage.html">consignment of ventilators</a> from different medical equipment manufacturing companies up to now. But HHS has reached out to ventilator manufacturers to stock up thousands of ventilators for the US public.</p><p>Besides medical supplies, other life aspects need some attention. Policies are being made to keep the industry on and exposure to COVID-19 minimal. Here jumps in the Robotics. Before the coronavirus outbreak, there was a huge debate if automation is replacing humans with robots at workplaces, and humans will lose their jobs soon. But now it is a general public perception that this automation speed is not enough. </p><p>The recycling industry has greatly suffered because people think sorting garbage can make a worker highly susceptible to coronavirus transfer. <a href="https://www.amprobotics.com/">AMP Robotics</a> has provided a great solution for automated garbage sorting. The company has claimed that during the outbreak, demand for robots has tremendously increased. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="pakistan-s-first-oxygenator-coming-soon">Pakistan’s first oxygenator coming soon</h3><p>Despite being far behind in the race of technology, Pakistan has started manufacturing oxygenators (a simpler form of ventilators). Out of 67, 13 designs have been approved by Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC). These approved designs meet European standards. Pakistan will not only be able to fulfill the local need but will be able to export these oxygenators to other countries.</p><h3 id="russia-s-financial-response-against-coronavirus">Russia’s financial response against coronavirus</h3><p>Russia is facing double threat i.e. oil price fall and coronavirus. Russia has 432k confirmed coronavirus cases with 196k recovered and 5215 deaths by now. Russia may lose $39 billion due to oil price cut, said Anton Siluanov, Russian finance minister. Russia has announced a $4 billion grant for the economic as well as health crisis during COVID-19. It is projected that Russia may have to release $120 billion to cope with budget deficits in the coming years.</p><p>Russia’s total defense budget is <a href="https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2020-04/fs_2020_04_milex_0_0.pdf">US$69.2 billion</a> which 3.4% of global defense expenditure. Russia's health budget is 3.5% of its total GDP, compared to a 3.9% defense budget. Russia has manufactured 500 ventilators in April 2020 and planned to produce 6000 more ventilators in the coming 3 months. Interestingly, Russia has claimed to have an effective treatment against COVID-19. An anti-influenza drug, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/01/russia-approves-drug-to-treat-covid-19-hospitals-to-use-in-june.html">Avifavir</a>, has been approved and will be delivered to hospitals to treat corona patients.</p><p>Stay safe!</p><p><em>Message from the Author...</em></p><figure><img src="https://thinkml.ai/content/images/2020/06/united-nations-covid-19-response-8g-vyBUUwG0-unsplash.jpg"></figure>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From time to time I hear that my posts are a little bit too deep and complicated for beginners. I totally agree: especially in my newest series on <a href="https://opensourc.es/blog/constraint-solver-1">"How to build a constraint solver from scratch?"</a> which is probably a never ending series. I do like to blog about it and will continue but this series is different.</p>
<p>Julia is a relatively young language and not too many people are using it. It thrives in scientific computing but I believe that it can be used for general computing (probably where start up time is not that relevant) i.e. I do use it for creating this blog with <a href="https://franklinjl.org/">Franklin</a> which I blogged a bit about as well <a href="https://opensourc.es/blog/Franklin.jl">here</a>.</p>
<p>This series tries to explain some of the core concepts of Julia and maybe some packages to beginners. I, the explainer of this stuff here, am by no means an expert in any of these. If you know this blog then you might know that I'm trying to explain stuff directly after I've learned them to hopefully be able to communicate better than some people who do this their entire life and are experts in it. Blogs from experts are sometimes hard to follow for me, so maybe also for you. I'll let them proof read my blog post just to be sure that there is nothing wrong with what I explain ;)</p>
<p>Okay everyone ready?</p>

<h2 id="what_is_dispatch"><a href="#what_is_dispatch">What is dispatch?</a></h2>
<p>In every programming language there are <code>functions</code> which have the purpose of providing structure and reusability of code. The functions have a <code>name</code> and some <code>arguments</code>.  They are defined like</p>
<pre><code>def add(x, y):
    return x + y</code></pre>
<p>In Python this can be called with <code>add(2,3)</code> which gives the expected <code>5</code> but also <code>add("2","3")</code> gives <code>'23'</code> which might make sense or not depending on who you ask :D</p>
<p>Now how about <code>add("2", 3)</code> ?</p>
<p>This results in an error <code>TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str</code> which again can make sense. Well I would say it does but Javascript does something different:</p>
<pre><code>function add(x,y) {
    return x+y
}</code></pre>
<p>will produce <code>"23"</code> for that.</p>
<p>Then there are of course languages like <code>C++</code> where this all is not that simple because we need to introduce types:</p>
<pre><code>int add(int x, int y) {
  return x+y;
}</code></pre>
<p>There it is clear for everyone that it takes two <code>int</code> and returns one <code>int</code>. Because it is a compiled language we would get an error directly when trying to call it with <code>add("2", 3)</code>.</p>
<p>Now what is the point? We can see different concepts here with having static types as in C++ and dynamic typing in JS and Python. They both have pros and cons which is probably obvious.  The one is easier to reason about and the others are maybe easier to hack around with.</p>
<p>Let's go into dispatching on those three languages:</p>
<p>In Python it is: Ah okay the user wants to call <code>add</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We have the <code>add</code> function</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lets call it with the arguments.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Good that works as it expects two arguments and we have two.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we might get to the point where the function doesn't work like for <code>add("2", 3)</code> and throw an error or it works out and the answer is returned. </p>
<p>It is basically the same in JS. There are possibility some "extensions" like Typescript where things might happen differently. I haven't programmed with any of those languages lately so keep that in mind.</p>
<p>In <code>C++</code> more things are going on as each variable has a static type and one can check directly whether this fits or not. This means as we can later see that there can be more functions with the same name. I'll explain the difference between function overloading and multiple dispatch in that part ;)</p>
<p>In all of these languages we can have classes such that we might have a class <code>Manufacturer</code> and we can define <code>add(self, thing)</code> or something like that and can call the function with  <code>manufacturer.add(thing)</code>. This can be kind of seen as single dispatch. Dispatch is basically the process of deciding which function to call. Here it depends on the type of <code>manufacturer</code>. Is it a <code>Manufacturer</code> or a <code>Box</code>? For a <code>Box</code> we might have defined a class <code>Box</code> and <code>add(self, box)</code> inside of it.</p>
<div><p>⚠ Note</p> <p>These examples are more from the Python world but hopefully convey the point.</p></div>
<p>For people coding in Julia for longer this might sound like a weird concept. Actually writing about it, I am thinking: How would I do some things, where I use multiple dispatch all the time (like in the ConstraintSolver) in one of those languages?</p>
<p>Before I explain multiple dispatch I want to note:</p>
<p>Yes there are ways in Python for single dispatching like <a href="https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2016/02/23/python-3-function-overloading-with-singledispatch/">@singledispatch</a> but given that the main posts I found when searching are 3-4 years old I doubt that a lot are using it :D</p>
<p>And it is still single dispatch.</p>
<h2 id="how_does_dispatch_work_in_julia"><a href="#how_does_dispatch_work_in_julia">How does dispatch work in Julia?</a></h2>
<p>Now that there is that out of our way let us have a look at one example in Julia:</p>
<pre><code>add(x, y) = x+y</code></pre>
<p>just to show a neat little way of defining one-line functions... (or as they are called in Julia: Methods)</p>
<p>The interesting things is when you type this in the Julia REPL (Read-eval-print loop) you get:</p>
<pre><code>julia&gt; add(x, y) = x+y
add (generic function with 1 method)</code></pre>
<p>calling that function works basically like in Python (from the user perspective for now). It doesn't work for strings though.</p>
<div><p>⚠ Note</p> <p>Julia and <code>+</code> for strings: Julia is a mathematical language and <code>+</code> is commutative whereas concatenating strings is not. So <code>"2"+"3"</code> is not <code>"3"+"2"</code>. Therefore Julia decided to use <code>*</code> instead. Which is commutative for numbers but not matrices for example.</p></div>
<p>Okay where did I interrupt myself? ... Ah yeah so we have an <code>add</code> function with one method now in the REPL. That looks like we might be able to add a new one, right?</p>
<div><p>⚠ Note</p> <p>As correctly pointed out on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Julia/comments/hfk3u3/basics_multiple_dispatch_start_of_a_new_series/fvykyl3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x">Reddit</a>: I use mostly the word function. In Julia there is actually a difference between functions and methods. There is one <code>+</code> function with a lot of different implementations: called methods.</p></div>
<pre><code>julia&gt; add(x,y) = 2x+y
add (generic function with 1 method)</code></pre>
<p>okay that did not work because it still allows all types of inputs (and throws an error later when it doesn't work) because the compiler had no way to decide which <strike> function</strike>method to call. </p>
<p>Should it guess? It just overwrites the old method.</p>
<p>A small side step again: Let's check what happens when we call <code>add("2", "3")</code>
</p><pre><code>julia&gt; add("a", "b")
ERROR: MethodError: no method matching *(::Int64, ::String)
Closest candidates are:
  *(::Any, ::Any, ::Any, ::Any...) at operators.jl:529
  *(::Missing, ::AbstractString) at missing.jl:174
  *(::T, ::T) where T&lt;:Union{Int128, Int16, Int32, Int64, Int8, UInt128, UInt16, UInt32, UInt64, UInt8} at int.jl:54
  ...
Stacktrace:
 [1] add(::String, ::String) at ./REPL[3]:1
 [2] top-level scope at REPL[4]:1</code></pre>
<p>That error occurs when calling <code>2x</code> where it figured that <code>2</code> is an integer and <code>x = "2"</code> is a string. It gives us information of what kind of types it can multiply.</p>
<p>Let's pick one: </p><pre><code>*(::T, ::T) where T&lt;:Union{Int128, Int16, Int32, Int64, Int8, UInt128, UInt16, UInt32, UInt64, UInt8} at int.jl:54</code></pre>
<p>This tells us that we can multiply two numbers of those types when they are the same. So <code>UInt8</code> with <code>UInt8</code> but I come to that syntax later.</p>
<p>You might wonder how many of those <code>*</code> <strike> functions</strike>methods there are: <code>357</code> is the answer which you get when typing</p>
<pre><code>julia&gt; methods(*)
...</code></pre>
<p>which gives you a long list with all kind of weird types where it sometimes spreads over several lines. I mean what is this? :D</p>
<pre><code>[345] *(A::LinearAlgebra.LQ{TA,S} where S&lt;:AbstractArray{TA,2}, B::Union{DenseArray{TB,1}, DenseArray{TB,2}, Base.ReinterpretArray{TB,1,S,A} where S where A&lt;:Union{SubArray{T,N,A,I,true} where I&lt;:Union{Tuple{Vararg{Real,N} where N}, Tuple{AbstractUnitRange,Vararg{Any,N} where N}} where A&lt;:DenseArray where N where T, DenseArray}, Base.ReinterpretArray{TB,2,S,A} where S where A&lt;:Union{SubArray{T,N,A,I,true} where I&lt;:Union{Tuple{Vararg{Real,N} where N}, Tuple{AbstractUnitRange,Vararg{Any,N} where N}} where A&lt;:DenseArray where N where T, DenseArray}, Base.ReshapedArray{TB,1,A,MI} where MI&lt;:Tuple{Vararg{Base.MultiplicativeInverses.SignedMultiplicativeInverse{Int64},N} where N} where A&lt;:Union{Base.ReinterpretArray{T,N,S,A} where S where A&lt;:Union{SubArray{T,N,A,I,true} where I&lt;:Union{Tuple{Vararg{Real,N} where N}, Tuple{AbstractUnitRange,Vararg{Any,N} where N}} where A&lt;:DenseArray where N where T, DenseArray} where N where T, SubArray{T,N,A,I,true} where I&lt;:Union{Tuple{Vararg{Real,N} where N}, Tuple{AbstractUnitRange,Vararg{Any,N} where N}} where A&lt;:DenseArray where N where T, DenseArray}, Base.ReshapedArray{TB,2,A,MI} where MI&lt;:Tuple{Vararg{Base.MultiplicativeInverses.SignedMultiplicativeInverse{Int64},N} where N} where A&lt;:Union{Base.ReinterpretArray{T,N,S,A} where S where A&lt;:Union{SubArray{T,N,A,I,true} where I&lt;:Union{Tuple{Vararg{Real,N} where N}, Tuple{AbstractUnitRange,Vararg{Any,N} where N}} where A&lt;:DenseArray where N where T, DenseArray} where N where T, SubArray{T,N,A,I,true} where I&lt;:Union{Tuple{Vararg{Real,N} where N}, Tuple{AbstractUnitRange,Vararg{Any,N} where N}} where A&lt;:DenseArray where N where T, DenseArray}, SubArray{TB,1,A,I,L} where L where I&lt;:Tuple{Vararg{Union{Int64, AbstractRange{Int64}, Base.AbstractCartesianIndex},N} where N} where A&lt;:Union{Base.ReinterpretArray{T,N,S,A} where S where A&lt;:Union{SubArray{T,N,A,I,true} where I&lt;:Union{Tuple{Vararg{Real,N} where N}, Tuple{AbstractUnitRange,Vararg{Any,N} where N}} where A&lt;:DenseArray where N where T, DenseArray} where N where T, Base.ReshapedArray{T,N,A,MI} where MI&lt;:Tuple{Vararg{Base.MultiplicativeInverses.SignedMultiplicativeInverse{Int64},N} where N} where A&lt;:Union{Base.ReinterpretArray{T,N,S,A} where S where A&lt;:Union{SubArray{T,N,A,I,true} where I&lt;:Union{Tuple{Vararg{Real,N} where N}, Tuple{AbstractUnitRange,Vararg{Any,N} where N}} where A&lt;:DenseArray where N where T, DenseArray} where N where T, SubArray{T,N,A,I,true} where I&lt;:Union{Tuple{Vararg{Real,N} where N}, Tuple{AbstractUnitRange,Vararg{Any,N} where N}} where A&lt;:DenseArray where N where T, DenseArray} where N where T, DenseArray}, SubArray{TB,2,A,I,L} where L where I&lt;:Tuple{Vararg{Union{Int64, AbstractRange{Int64}, Base.AbstractCartesianIndex},N} where N} where A&lt;:Union{Base.ReinterpretArray{T,N,S,A} where S where A&lt;:Union{SubArray{T,N,A,I,true} where I&lt;:Union{Tuple{Vararg{Real,N} where N}, …</code></pre></div></div>

He said that's normal, since it's energy intensive for the body to maintain antibodies it doesn't need.</p>  <p>What was "a little bit surprising," he said, was the fact that 40 per cent of people with asymptomatic infections had no detectable antibodies at all.</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH | Dr. Samir Gupta on Alberta's testing plans:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><span></span><span>Dr. Samir Gupta says Alberta's testing may help to understand how far the coronavirus spread but he's doubtful we've reached herd immunity.<!-- --> <!-- -->8:35</span></span></span></p>  <p>However, Gupta&nbsp;said,&nbsp;people have immunity to coronaviruses that cause common colds for only a few months, and that may also be the case for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.</p>  <p>On the other hand, he said, "antibodies aren't the whole story."</p>  <p>There are other components of the immune system that play a role, such as memory cells. They remember a pathogen&nbsp;and begin releasing antibodies when they encounter it again, but they are hard to detect, Gupta said.</p>  <h2>What this means for herd immunity and vaccines</h2>  <p>Still, Tania Watts, a professor of immunology at the University of Toronto who was not involved in the study, expressed concern about the implications.</p>  <p>"This suggests that natural infection may not give long-lasting immunity, which is what people have been worried about," she said.</p>  <p>Some countries <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m2376"><u>such as Sweden</u></a> and <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/herd-immunity-should-not-be-supported-tam-says-1.5545332"><u>at least one Canadian province</u></a> have previously suggested that one way to control the spread of COVID-19 is to allow most of the population to get infected in a controlled fashion to generate <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/herd-immunity-should-not-be-supported-tam-says-1.5545332"><u>"herd immunity."</u></a>&nbsp;Once the population reaches a certain threshold of previous infection, there won't be enough susceptible people to spread the virus, and it can't spread exponentially as an epidemic.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5574385.1589816270!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/virus-outbreak-vaccine-race.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5574385.1589816270!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/virus-outbreak-vaccine-race.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5574385.1589816270!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/virus-outbreak-vaccine-race.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5574385.1589816270!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/virus-outbreak-vaccine-race.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5574385.1589816270!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/virus-outbreak-vaccine-race.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5574385.1589816270!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/virus-outbreak-vaccine-race.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>A patient receives a shot in the first-stage safety study clinical trial of a potential vaccine for COVID-19 in March.

Warren/The Associated Press)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>But Watts said the low and short-lived levels of antibodies in asymptomatic infections in this study suggest we can't rely on herd immunity being induced for long enough a period of time to have an impact.</p>  <p>That means we may need to wait for a vaccine that induces a stronger, longer-lived response than many natural infections, she said.&nbsp;"I think this puts even more pressure on vaccine development."</p>  <h2>What this means for antibody tests,&nbsp;'immunity passports'</h2>  <p>Watts said another implication of the study is that serological (blood) or antibody tests — which have been touted as a way to get an idea of who has been previously infected, how much of the population that represents&nbsp;and how close that is to herd immunity —&nbsp;may not work as hoped.</p>  <p>And it throws cold water on the idea of controversial "<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thehouse/immunity-passes-could-be-an-interim-measure-on-the-way-to-reopening-society-physician-says-1.5544368"><u>immunity passports</u></a>," the idea of allowing more social interactions, such as work, travel&nbsp;and mass gatherings, for people who have previously been infected and therefore are immune and can't spread the virus — which would be based on serological testing.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Until we know what part of the immune system is protective," Watts said, "it's difficult to be able to do a test and tell someone you're safe or not."</p>  <h2>What this&nbsp;means for disease transmission</h2>  <p>While it's known that presymptomatic people can transmit COVID-19, it's not really known whether people who remain asymptomatic through the course of the disease can.</p>  <p>Watts said she thinks the finding in this study that people without symptoms shed the virus longer than people with&nbsp;symptoms is "shocking" and suggests we need to worry about transmission from asymptomatic people.</p>  <p>"Until we have a vaccine, I think we should have very clear recommendations that everybody wears masks."</p>    <p>She said the longer period of viral shedding is probably because a lack of symptoms indicate a weaker immune response, resulting in a longer time to clear the infection.</p>  <p>On the other hand, too intense an immune response is what puts patients in the ICU struggling to breathe.</p>  <p>The ideal is somewhere in between&nbsp;and what we'd like in a vaccine, Watts&nbsp;said.</p>  <p>"We really need that Goldilocks immune response."</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  

  

  <p>You can read this post in Spanish <a href="https://stanete.com/es/fucked-up-everybody-knows">here</a>.</p>

<p>We all fuck up. All the time. It’s human and it’s ok. As long as we don’t let our ego blind us and learn from our mistakes.</p>

<h3 id="you-fucked-up">You fucked up</h3>

<p>Here is a message I wrote on a private Slack channel not so long ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@here Peeps just wanted to say something about the whole search feature. Using the provider directly or as a bypass is something that WE, as Engineering team decide. If we think it will help the current and possible future product requirements, then we can go with it. But if we think there is a simpler solution to meet the product requirements then we will go with that one. Just wanted to say that is US who decide how to implement the feature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So much is wrong with this message. It is pretty aggressive. It promotes division between Product Managers and Software Engineers. The use of <em>@here</em> doens’t help. And the use of capital letters doesn’t help either.</p>

<p>I know it is out of context but the important thing here is that <em>I just fucked up</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/alone_before_dawn.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="everybody-knows">Everybody knows</h3>

<p>When you reach a certain point in life, it is hard to make friends outside of the work environment. A big part of my social life and interests spins around the startup ecosystem.</p>

<p>I’m subscribed to newsletters, read books and blogs, read newspaper articles and listen to podcasts. I spend a lot of time on Twitter. I have silly T-shirts. I go to meetups and events. I have a blog. And I don’t have the data (I wish) but I assume most startup employees do the same.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve made very good friends around the startup ecosystem. We all have the same problems and we all have to overcome the same personal challenges. We are all interested in what happens in other startups, how do they overcome those problems, how did they evolve and where did they screw up so we don’t have to. The books are a nice way to learn the theory but nothing helps you as much as sharing experiences with other people.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/conversation.png" alt=""></p>

<p>My point is… we know. Everybody knows. We know when you fired someone while they were on medical sick leave. We know about that aggressive Slack message even if it was on a private channel. We know about your dubious marketing practices. We know about your homophobic comments during lunch time. We know about your unhealthy hiring process and how you never give any feedback to the candidates that don’t pass. We know about that time you left a meeting screaming and slamming doors. We know how unhealty is your culture and how bad is your internal communication.</p>

<p>It doens’t matter if you are a Software Engineer, a Product Manager, the CEO or an Engineering Manager. The consequences are demolishing. You won’t be able to hire the people you want. You won’t be hired by the companies you want. You won’t be able to work with the investors you seek. You won’t be invited to give a talk to a meetup. Nobody will read your blog. You won’t be able to grow. And the list goes on and on.</p>

<h3 id="and-now-what">And now what?</h3>

<p>You can’t hide. You can’t undo what you’ve done. And you can’t deny it. But you can fix it.</p>

<p>It’s sad that I have to be so explicit but, as Fitzpatrick and Collins-Sussman write in <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/debugging-teams/9781491932049/">Debugging Teams</a>, you should build your culture around <em>humility</em>, <em>respect</em> and <em>trust</em> from the beginning. Not only your culture, but also yourself. Because almost every social conflict can ultimately be traced back to a lack of one of these 3.</p>

<p>You will fuck up. I do all the time. In many ways. And I’m ashamed of some of them. But we are all here in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wupToqz1e2g">pale blue dot</a> learning how not to be douchebags. We either learn to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QnujP4LDhI">live together, or die alone</a>. You see, <em>learning</em> is the key. If you have a true desire to <em>improve</em> as a human being and as a professional, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OD3F7J2PeYU">it will be alright</a>.</p>

<p>Everyone has their own journey but the basics are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Take <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd10-f9bzu0">accountability</a> and admit your ego was bigger than your <em>values</em> and <em>principles</em>. Admit you were wrong. Sometimes you need to ask for forgiveness. There is no other way you can wash your own image and the image of your startup.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Identify your own personal issues and start working on them. Being a decent human being is hard. Talking with your manager, with your mentor or with your friend works sometimes. Therapy works most of the time. It works for me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Start acting like everything could go public at any time. It already is public. NDAs protect intellectual property but they don’t stop spreading the word about unhealthy culture and toxic personalities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Start identifying and fixing the systemic problems of your unhealthy culture <a href="https://twitter.com/JonErlichman/status/1276618589441835008">one by one</a>. ASAP. Mostly because it takes a lot of time and effort. So the sooner you start, the sooner you’re going to see results. Your role doesn’t matter. Take ownership and start fixing your culture. Some books I recommend on this topic: <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/debugging-teams/9781491932049/">Debugging Teams</a>, <a href="https://basecamp.com/books/calm">It Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at Work</a>, <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-collaboration/9781492041726/">Mastering Collaboration</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/What-You-Do-Who-Are/dp/0062871331/">What You Do Is Who You Are: How to Create Your Business Culture</a>.</p>

<p>…or sculpturing is not that bad for health ;P</p>
<h4>Intro</h4>
<p>Well, it just had to be this pic:)</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/m346MsE.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/m346MsE.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<h4>The story</h4>
<p>Some time ago, <a href="https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=501">Carrion/Bonzai</a> asked me to fix his SX-64 keyboard. I was like … hell yeah! … I’ve never worked on SX-64 gear. The problem was, at that moment I didn’t know what was wrong with that keyboard … until pics arrived</p>
<p>By the way, <a href="https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=501">Carrion</a> and <a href="https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=29175">Yugorin</a> run an awesome website – <a href="https://c64portal.pl/">c64portal.pl</a> – The website is in Polish and contains lots of valuable info about Polish Commodore demoscene and Commodore in general. Both gentlemen are also the main guys behind the <a href="https://moonshinedragons.party/">Moonshine Dragons party – currently, the largest C64 party in Poland.</a></p>
<p>Since I already agreed that I’ll fix it, there was no excuse. Carrion sent me that keyboard and the party has begun 🙂</p>

<h4>Plastic welding and reinforcements</h4>
<p>As it turned out, after close inspection, there were way more cracks than I thought.</p>
<p>All these cracks had to be addressed and reinforced – <a href="https://retrohax.net/extreme-refurbishing-episode-2-atari-800-xl-part-one/">this is a lesson that I’ve learned after my Atari 800 XL refurb</a> where joints were not stable enough and resulted in tiny cracks over time.</p>
<p>To achieve a proper result, I’ve welded in a brass mesh to serve as a reinforcement of cracked spots and as a base for resin-based compounds used later to rebuild missing plastic. Obviously, the mesh had to be custom cut.</p>
<p>This is how the process looks.</p>

<p>Once every piece was cut to a proper size, I’ve soldered them together. I’ve also added a thicker copper wire to make the mesh stiffer and less prone to bending.</p>

<h4>Rebuilding missing plastic</h4>
<p>At this stage, I was ready to apply fiber-glass putty. This is a quite messy process and looks kinda ugly. I’ve used some old PCB laminate to get every edge correctly positioned and as close to the original as possible. This part boils down to pretty much three things – putty application, sanding, laminate repositioning … putty application, sanding, laminate repositioning … etc. etc.</p>

<p>The first corner was nearly ready for finishing touches. I only had to file it down to its original round shape. That was done with the help of a files 🙂</p>

<p>The second corner required even more work. I’ve used the same method again. </p>

<p>When I finally had a base rebuilt, I had to make a clip sockets in its original places. To do that, I had to cut down a Dremel tool to a proper size.</p>

<p>After making slots, I could start trying on the bottom part against the top. Unfortunately, one of the hooks snapped off during the process 🙁</p>
<p>I had to fix it first. I’ve made it out of a metal paper clip that was cut down to size and welded in a top case.</p>

<h4>Epoxy resin and finishing</h4>
<p>After all the above work was done, I’ve mixed a cup of thin epoxy resin to fill in hard to access gaps and spots. It also helped to smoothen all uneven surfaces. The resin was applied to all spots with brass mesh with a plastic pipette.</p>

<p>Once the resin cured, I’ve applied a layer of spray putty which helped me to spot all minor mistakes and correct them with finishing putty and 400 grit sandpaper.</p>

<p>After another round of putty and sanding, I’ve applied black undercoating which was then wet-sanded with 1000 grit this time.</p>

<p>Finally, I could apply the last two layers of custom made spray paint. This paint color exactly matches the original. These custom spray paints for various computers will be available in my <a href="https://retrohax.net/">webshop</a> soon. The first series of spray paints will include the following colors:</p>
<ul><li> Atari XL Beige</li><li> Atari XE/ST Gray</li><li> Commodore 64C Beige</li><li> Amiga 500 Beige </li></ul>

<h4>Badges and plastics</h4>
<p>Due to its age, paint from a badge chipped off during removal so I had to fix it. I’ve used a standard black marker to cover all these tiny spots. Later, I’ve removed old glue from the rubber base and applied fresh double-sided adhesive tape on both rubber and badge.</p>

<p>I also had to address other scratched plastic parts. That was easily fixed by applying a thin layer of silicone oil.</p>

<h4>Keyboard cleaning</h4>
<p>Obviously, all keycaps had to be clean. This time, I had to remove every single keycap and clean it individually. It took a while to get it done properly 🙂</p>

<p>Don’t ask me why so late but this is the moment when I’ve realized there is a major failure :/</p>
<p>I’ve no idea why I didn’t spot it earlier. After assembly, it turned out that there is a small gap between parts. It is barely visible and only from a side of the case but I was pissed off at myself that I didn’t spot it and fix it before the case was painted.</p>

<p>Obviously, I didn’t have any spray paint left.</p>
<h4>The grand finale</h4>
<p>This restoration was rather time-consuming. It took more or less 15 workdays. This is because I had to wait for chemistry to fully cure before moving on to the next step.</p>
<p>So here it is. Fully restored Commodore SX-64 keyboard for Carrion. Hopefully, he will like it 🙂</p>

<h4 id="a-primer-on-the-cruel-tacit-laws-of-type-level-programming-in-haskell"><em>A primer on the cruel, tacit laws of type-level programming in Haskell</em></h4>

<p>Haskell programs are constructed at the junction of two worlds: one of types, and the other of values. Values are operational run-time entities that are denoted syntactically by <em>terms</em> in the code. To this end, types classify terms. They provide a powerful abstraction to organize data, determine how it should be stored in memory, passed through various operations, and more. On a superficial level, the difference between these worlds is simple: <em>types</em> refer to datatypes, which are either built-in (such as <code>Integer</code> and <code>String</code>), or user-declared, for example:</p>

<pre><code>data SpringFlingQueen = Cady | Regina
</code></pre>

<p>By comparison, <em>values</em> are denoted by <em>terms</em> those types categorize (such as <code>1</code> and <code>"abc"</code> described by the standard library’s <code>Integer</code> and <code>String</code> types, or <code>Cady</code> and <code>Regina</code> in the case of our user-declared type, <code>SpringFlingQueen</code>). Thus, the term <code>1</code> denotes a value that exists in memory only when the program is run.</p>

<p>In addition to these two worlds, a third, darker, and more elusive underworld of <em>kinds</em> also lurks in the shadows of Haskell programs. Haskell kinds can be as unpredictable and insidious as the soulless alpha-female of an elite high school clique. While daunting, understanding the coaction between these three worlds lays the foundation for type-level programming, a topic worth learning as it strengthens overall Haskell intuition.</p>

<h3 id="kindness-is-a-virtue">Kindness is a virtue</h3>

<p>Much like counter-intuitive adolescent social dynamics, mastery of Haskell bears a steep learning curve because of its underlying complexity. It is difficult to wrap one’s head around the language’s typeclass hierarchies, category-theoretic roots, or the intricacies of compiler behavior. However, an intimate understanding of the type system lets programmers look beyond the chaos of code and apply a recognizable template by which to understand it.</p>

<h3 id="kindness-takes-patience">Kindness takes patience</h3>

<p>This topic is also difficult to master because it is both vast and subtle. Ideas underlying type-level programming are scattered across many disconnected resources focused on several corners of the Haskell ecosystem. Authoritative references on the topic (such as relevant library documentation) tend to assume familiarity with domain-specific terminology that may be unknown to non-experts. Due to the paucity of approachable materials on the subject, I’ve attempted to break down type-level programming into explanations of its constituent parts. While I don’t go into extensive depth on any individual section below, I hope to provide a valuable starting point with which readers can explore ideas in greater detail.</p>

<h3 id="types-vs-values">Types vs. Values</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, Haskell programs are divided into two worlds: the <em>type-level</em> and the <em>value-level</em>. The <em>type-level</em> refers to the part of a program analyzed by the static type-checking phase during compilation. Since every expression is assigned a type, code is checked against Haskell’s type system to ensure it fits <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a>’s specified correctness criteria.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/875834/84704534-fce9fd80-af27-11ea-9544-13961a56c444.png" alt="types classify terms, just like hostile teens with identity crises classify one another"></p>

<p>If the program is well-typed, the program will compile. However, this type-information evaporates once the compilation process terminates, leaving only <em>values</em> behind at run-time. In this way, types and values can be better distinguished by the phasing distinction, with types being compile-time entities and values being run-time entities.</p>

<p>For example, if a function takes a <code>String</code>, the type-checker doesn’t care if the <code>String</code> has a value denoted by <code>"abc"</code> or <code>"123"</code> or <code>"get in loser"</code>—so long as it’s a <code>String</code>. Type information gets discarded at run-time, leaving only the string’s value (ex.,<code>"get in loser"</code>). In some cases, however, we want the type system to care about what those values are and distinguish between them. The <code>DataKinds</code> extension, which we’ll explore below, lets us do that by allowing us to shove more information about our program into the type system. This lets us add meaning to the value of a <code>String</code> at the type-level, moving them from their usual, strictly run-time existence, into the compile-time phase. The technique allows us to use more information statically in the logical development and abstraction of the program’s behavior. We’re also able to add consequences that can halt compilation if the specific value of <code>String</code> doesn’t conform to the rules we’ve specified, or define classes over them.</p>

<h4 id="distinguishing-types-and-values-in-ghci">Distinguishing types and values in GHCi</h4>

<p>Let’s examine our aforementioned <code>SpringFlingQueen</code> datatype in GHCi. When we query the type of one of its constructors using <code>:t</code> (a handy shorthand for <code>:type</code>), we see that it is indeed of type <code>SpringFlingQueen</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ data SpringFlingQueen = Cady | Regina
λ :t Cady
Cady :: SpringFlingQueen
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now consider literals <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>. These are <em>values</em> of a type that parameterizes the <code>Num</code> class:</p>



<p>Typing <code>:t 1</code> into GHCi gives us <code>Num p =&gt; p</code>, indicating that a literal such as <code>1</code> can be of any polymorphic type <code>p</code> as long as the <code>Num</code> type class has instances for that type (for example, <code>Integer</code> and <code>Float</code> both have <code>Num</code> instances and therefore are valid types that <code>p</code> could be instantiated with). This is possible due to <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Type_inference">type inference</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/875834/84704346-ae3c6380-af27-11ea-8078-6f1ddfc7b238.png" alt="type inference can be used to deduce concrete types wherever they're obvious. If a type looks like a mouse, it's a mouse—duh!"></p>

<h3 id="kinds">Kinds</h3>

<p>Just like types classify terms, <a href="https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/decls.html#sect4.1.1">kinds</a> classify types, and therefore are frequently described as “types of types”, or referred to be “one level up.” The “star” syntax (i.e., <code>*</code>) denotes kinds. It is defiantly used in this post despite <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0143-remove-star-kind.rst">recent syntactic changes</a>. A prerequisite for understanding the kind system necessitates comprehending the differences between three pairs of ideas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data constructors vs. type constructors:</strong> data constructors create values, whereas type constructors create types. Type constructors take one or more type arguments and produce a datatype when enough arguments are provided. This means that through <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Currying">currying</a>, a type constructor can be <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Partial_application">partially applied</a>. For example, the list type constructor <code>[]</code> may take a single type argument (ex. <code>String</code>) to denote the elements of the list (i.e., <code>[String]</code>). <code>[String]</code> is simply syntactic sugar for <code>[] String</code>, where the type <code>[]</code> is applied to <code>String</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Full vs. partial application</strong> A partially-applied type, like a <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Partial_application">partially-applied function</a>, is one that is missing some of its data constructors. For instance, consider the list type <code>[]</code>. The kind of <code>[]</code> is <code>* -&gt; *</code>. A fully-applied list has data constructors, such as <code>[Int]</code>, and its kind is <code>*</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Inhabited types vs. uninhabited types:</strong> An inhabitant of a type is precisely a value of that type. This means that <em>inhabited</em> types refer to the types that contain concrete values, such as the value denoted by the term <code>1 :: Int</code>. This suggests that the type <code>Int</code> is inhabited by value denoted by <code>1</code>. By contrast, <em>uninhabited</em> types refer to type constructors to which no values are abstracted. For instance, <code>Void</code> is uninhabited because it has no data constructors, and thus can not be used to construct a valid term. While <code>Void</code> may seem pointless at first, it can be a useful way to represent that a container is empty (ex., <code>[Void]</code>, which <em>is</em> inhabited by the term <code>[]</code> and the value this term denotes).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>How do these ideas relate to the kind system? Well, all fully-applied runtime values are of kind <code>*</code> <em>and</em> they are inhabited. You can confirm this by typing <code>:k Int</code> and <code>:k String</code> in GHCi. However, this doesn’t work the other way around—just because a type is inhabited, doesn’t necessarily mean it’s fully-applied (ex., <code>[]</code> is not fully-applied but it <em>is</em> inhabited, and its kind signature is <code>* -&gt; *</code>). Conversely, all partially-applied types are uninhabited (since they don’t correspond to a value), but not all uninhabited types are partially applied. <code>Void</code> for instance is not partially-applied, but it is uninhabited.</p>

<p>To get the hang of this idea, consider the following examples:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Inhabited?</th>
      <th>Fully-applied?</th>

      <td><code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Either</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td><code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Void</code></td>
      <td>No</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>

<p>Kind signatures can be specified manually in GHCi using the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/8.0.1/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#ghc-flag--XKindSignatures"><code>XKindSignatures</code></a> extension. Try extending the above table by investigating the kind signatures of various types.</p>

<h3 id="higher-kinded-types">Higher-kinded types</h3>

<p>Just like there are higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as arguments), there are higher-kinded types (types constructors that take other type constructors as arguments). Type constructors such as <code>[]</code> are a first-class type, but also a higher-kinded type, given they take another type constructor to be reified:</p>



<p>Let’s consider <code>Functor</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ :k Functor
Functor :: (* -&gt; *) -&gt; Constraint
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We see that <code>Functor</code> takes a type constructor <code>* -&gt; *</code> and returns a <code>Constraint</code>. Let’s use <code>:info</code> to examine <code>Functor</code> a bit more closely:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ :info Functor
class Functor (f :: * -&gt; *) where
  fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b
  (&lt;$) :: a -&gt; f b -&gt; f a
  {-# MINIMAL fmap #-}
  	-- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor (Either a) -- Defined in ‘Data.Either’
instance Functor ((,,,) a b c) -- Defined in ‘Data.Orphans’
instance Functor ((,,) a b) -- Defined in ‘Data.Orphans’
instance Functor [] -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor Maybe -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor IO -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor ((-&gt;) r) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor ((,) a) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We see that <code>Functor</code> allows type constructors like <code>Maybe</code> and <code>[]</code> to have <code>Functor</code> instances, but not <code>Int</code> or <code>String</code>. This is because <code>Maybe</code> and <code>[]</code> are <code>* -&gt; *</code>, while <code>Int</code> has kind <code>*</code>. Similarly, <code>Either</code> has <code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code>, which is why its instance above is parameterized with a type parameter denoting something of kind <code>* -&gt; *</code>: <code>Either a</code>.</p>

You can either read source code to get some intel, or read emails with patches in mail list archives (<a href="https://sourceware.org/ml/binutils/2006-10/msg00377.html">Re: GNU_HASH section format</a> is a pretty good one). Those are the only places you can try to find the truth on the matter.</p><p>Of course, there're some articles on the web where people try to break it down. Like this one.</p><p>This article does not aspire to be the ultimate truth either. But I'll try to cover everything about GNU Hash Table and explain all aspects of its work.</p><p>Before reading any further please ensure that you understand what <a href="https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/elf/gabi4+/ch4.symtab.html">Symbol Table</a> and <a href="https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/elf/gabi4+/ch4.strtab.html">String Table</a> are in the <a href="https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/elf/gabi4+/contents.html">ELF</a>. Also you may want to read my previous article <a href="https://flapenguin.me/2017/04/24/elf-lookup-dt-hash">ELF: symbol lookup via DT_HASH</a> to know the standard (90s-ish) way of doing symbol lookup.</p><p><code>DT_GNU_HASH</code> has nothing in common with standard <code>DT_HASH</code>, apart from serving the same purpose. It has its own hashing function, its own layout, it adds restrictions for the symbol table and contains an additional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">bloom filter</a> to stop lookup for missing symbols early.</p><h2>Hashing function</h2><p>Let's start with the hashing function. It can be found in <a href="https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=blob;f=bfd/elf.c;h=a08e0f8ea6197f103908364665ec6e5f6c89927d;hb=HEAD#l222">bfd_elf_gnu_hash</a> or in <a href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=elf/dl-lookup.c;h=3d2369dbf2b7ca219eaf80a820e2a8e1329fbf50;hb=HEAD#l569">dl_new_hash</a>.</p><pre><span>#<span>include</span> <span>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</span></span>

    <span>uint32_t</span> nbuckets;
    <span>uint32_t</span> symoffset;

    <span>uint32_t</span> bloom_shift;
    <span>uint64_t</span> bloom[bloom_size]; 
    <span>uint32_t</span> buckets[nbuckets];
    <span>uint32_t</span> chain[];
};
</pre><h2>Bloom filter</h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Bloom filter</a> is used to stop the lookup for missing symbols early. <code>bloom_size</code>, <code>bloom_shift</code>, and <code>bloom</code> are parts of the structure, as their names suggest.</p><p>Bloom filter behaves slightly differently for various <code>ELFCLASS</code> binaries (defined by <code>EI_CLASS</code> field in <a href="https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/elf/gabi4+/ch4.eheader.html#elfid">ELF Identification</a>). Let's define <code>ELFCLASS_BITS</code> to be <code>64</code> for 64-bit binaries (<code>ELFCLASS64</code>) and <code>32</code> for 32-bit binaries (<code>ELFCLASS32</code>).</p><p>Before doing symbol lookup, take <code>bloom[(hash / ELFCLASS_BITS) % bloom_size]</code>. If bits <code>hash % ELFCLASS_BITS</code> and <code>(hash &gt;&gt; bloom_shift) % ELFCLASS_BITS</code> are set then a symbol <strong>may or may not</strong> be in the hash table, and you should proceed with a regular lookup through buckets and chains. But if at least one bit is not set then a symbol is <strong>certainly</strong> absent from the hash table.</p><h2>Buckets and chains</h2><p><code>DT_HASH</code> contains an element per symbol table's element. This leads to a waste of space because <code>STN_UNDEF</code> and some other symbols are in the hash table but are never looked up. GNU hash table allows to skip first <code>symoffset</code> symbols at the beginning of the symbol table.</p><p>Same as in <code>DT_HASH</code>, symbols are put in one of <code>nbuckets</code> buckets depending on their hashes. To be specific, each symbol should be placed into <code>hash % nbuckets</code> bucket.</p><p>Chains in the GNU hash table are nothing like strange linked lists in <code>DT_HASH</code>, they are contiguous sequences of hashes for symbols with the same index (remember that chains' indexes are shifted by <code>symoffset</code> relatively to the symbol table). The last bit in chains' element is discarded and instead used for indicating the chain's end. If it is set then the element is the last one in the chain.</p><p><code>bucket</code> array holds indexes of the first symbols in the chains. Note that those are not indexes for the <code>chain</code> array. Indexes for it will be <code>bucket[foobar] - symoffset</code>.</p><p>Chains being contiguous sequences imply that symbols within the same bucket must be stored contiguously. Order of buckets in the symbol table does not really matter but usually they're stored in an ascending order.</p><p>While looking extraneous, creating such restriction over the symbol table gives great advantage: a hash table now can store almost full hash (without the lowest bit) of a symbol within the same 32 bits. This allows linkers to compare hashes before comparing strings. Also, because <code>DT_GNU_HASH</code> requires symbol table ordering and <code>DT_HASH</code> doesn't, you can fit both into a single binary. This way both standard and GNU linkers can look up symbols in it.</p><h2>Example</h2><p>Nothing is better than a visual representation of the rules. So, let's create one.</p><p>I took the same symbols as in <a href="https://flapenguin.me/2017/04/24/elf-lookup-dt-hash">ELF: symbol lookup via DT_HASH</a> and created <code>DT_GNU_HASH</code> table from them. The example is for 64-bit ELF binaries, for 32-bit you'll need to recalculate bloom word and bits.</p><pre>nbuckets = 4      (because I decided that there will be four buckets)
symoffset = 1    (STN_UNDEF is not a part of the hash table)
bloom_size = 2   (because I decided that 16 byte bloom filter is sufficient)
bloom_shift = 5  (again, just because I can)

June 28, 2020 | https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post" itemprop="articleBody">

    

<p>In this benchmark test, we compare three web application servers—Go, Node, and Elixir (<a href="https://ninenines.eu/">Cowboy</a>)—by subjecting each to a synthetic workload, first with 10k, and later with 100k connections.</p>

<p>To simulate a generic web application client and server behavior, we have devised the following synthetic workload. The client device opens a connection and sends 100 requests with 900±5% milliseconds in between each one. The server handles a request by sleeping for 100±5% milliseconds, to simulate a backend database request, and then returns 1 kB of payload. Without additional delays, this results in average connection lifetime of 100 seconds, and average load of 1 request per second, per device.</p>

<p>In the first test, we set the target to simulate 10k devices on a c5.2xlrage AWS instance that has 8 vCPUs and 16 GiB of RAM.</p>

<p>In the second test, we set the target to simulate 100k devices on a c5.9xlarge AWS instance that has 36 vCPUs and 72 GiB of RAM.</p>

<p>Correspondingly, our target load was 10k and 100k requests per second. The test run consisted of a 20-minute rampup from 0 to the target device count and load, then 20 minutes of sustained target device count and load, and, finally, a 20-minute rampdown back to 0. Each test takes 1 hour to complete.</p>

<p>The metrics were collected from two sources. First, we collected the following metrics from each client device: the time to open a connection, the time from sending a request to receiving HTTP headers of the corresponding response, and the time from receiving HTTP headers to receiving the entire HTTP body.</p>

<p>These metrics were aggregated from all client devices into histograms to retain distribution characteristics. In addition, summary metrics such as the total number of open connections and average requests per second were collected.</p>

<p>The second source of metrics was the target server itself, where we collected network and CPU utilization.</p>

<p>We used Ubuntu 18.04 with 4.15.0-1031-aws kernel, with sysctld overrides seen in our <a href="https://gitlab.com/stressgrid/dummies/blob/dbcc59ce83234bb55d6766ea914f116761bfe9e7/etc/sysctl.d/10-dummy.conf">/etc/sysctl.d/10-dummy.conf</a>.</p>

<p>Our test webservers were Go version 1.10.4, Node version 10.14.2, and Erlang 21.2.4-1 with Cowboy 2.6 and Ranch 1.7. The source code for each test application is available at <a href="https://gitlab.com/stressgrid/dummies/tree/dbcc59ce83234bb55d6766ea914f116761bfe9e7">https://gitlab.com/stressgrid/dummies</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-10k-connections-test">The 10k Connections Test</h2>

<p>In the 10k test, all test webservers achieved their target connection count.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-active.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-active.png"></a></p>

<p>Go and Elixir both were mostly keeping up with the target load of 10k requests per second. Node, due to latencies we will see later, was maxing out at slightly below 10k requests per second.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-rps.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-rps.png"></a></p>

<p>The time to open a connection averaged out in single-digit milliseconds. It is mostly the same across the three subjects, with the exception of Go having a few hiccups during the rampup phase.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-conn.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-conn.png"></a></p>

<p>The time to receive request headers includes our artificial delay of 100 milliseconds and randomization of ±5%. Both Go and Elixir are very similar in reflecting this delay, in addition to constant network latency. The story with Node is very different, as we observe it adding latency immediately, followed by a big jump in both latency and latency deviation about 12 minutes into the run, when the rampup hits 5750 requests per second.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-headers.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-headers.png"></a></p>

<p>The time to receive request body averaged out in single-digit microseconds. In the sustained phase, Go, Node, and Elixir are very similar.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-body.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-body.png"></a></p>

<p>Inbound network utilization is very similar for all three test applications. In the sustained phase, it is 1.75 MB per second, which makes one request be around 175 bytes. Outbound network utilization is closely correlated to requests per second, with Node somewhat lagging behind. In the sustained phase, it is around 12.5 MB per second, which means for every 1kB of payload there is about 250 bytes of protocol overhead.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-network.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-network.png"></a></p>

<p>CPU utilization is where things get interesting. The Node application utilized the least amount of CPU time and achieved its maximum CPU utilization while still in the rampup phase. We’ve seen that Go and Elixir demonstrated very similar performance characteristics from a client’s perspective, yet Elixir achieved this result with <em>significantly</em> higher CPU utilization.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-cpu.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/10K-cpu.png"></a></p>

<h2 id="the-100k-connections-test">The 100k Connections Test</h2>

<p>In the 100k test, only Go and Elixir reached the target connection count. Node peaked at about 60k connections.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-active.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-active.png"></a></p>

<p>Both Go and Elixir were also able to keep the sustained target load of 100k requests per second. Node maxed out at about 25k requests per second.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-rps.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-rps.png"></a></p>

<p>12 seconds into the rampup phase, at about 60k connections, Node became severely overloaded with connections taking single-digit seconds to open.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-conn.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-conn.png"></a></p>

<p>Go and Elixir remained in low single-digit milliseconds to open connection, with a few hiccups.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-conn2.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-conn2.png"></a></p>

<p>As Node overloaded, the average time to receive request headers grew to 1.5 seconds.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-headers.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-headers.png"></a></p>

<p>For both Go and Elixir, the time to receive request headers remained at around 100 milliseconds. Notably, Elixir maintained a nearly-constant performance throughout the entire test. Go’s average slowed by a few milliseconds after reaching about 70k connections.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-headers2.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-headers2.png"></a></p>

<p>The time to receive request body remained in single-digit microseconds, with a distribution very similar to the 10k test. This likely means we are testing the client side :-)</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-body.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-body.png"></a></p>

<p>Network utilization grew proportionally to the 10k test. Go and Elixir both peaked at 125 MB/s on the outbound network, which is about 1 Gigabit per second. This means that if we wanted to achieve 10x of the workload, we would come close to saturating a 10 Gb/s link. Node, by peaking at below the target workload, also showed network utilization corresponding to the handled load.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-network.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-network.png"></a></p>

<p>CPU utilization confirms the findings from the 10k test. Go was very efficient in using CPU and would have headroom, had the application been more compute-intensive. Elixir nearly saturated all 36 cores while delivering a surprisingly consistent performance. Node exhausted its scalability limit while utilizing only single-digit percent of available CPU resources.</p>

<p><a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-cpu.png"><img src="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/100K-cpu.png"></a></p>

<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>

<p>To run this test, we used the <a href="https://gitlab.com/stressgrid/stressgrid">Stressgrid</a> framework with 2 c5.2xlrage generators for 10k devices and 20 c5.2xlrage generators for 100k devices. Stressgrid monitors CPU utilization of the generators, so we can avoid skewed results due to generator oversaturation. In this test, all generators stayed below 80% CPU utilization.</p>

<p>Both target and generator instances were placed into a single VPC with two availability zones, using the internal IP network for communication. With this approach, we tried to simulate the typical behavior of a load balancer. With on-demand instances, the 10k test cost was around $10 and the 100k test cost was around $40, including data transfer.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>The goal of this benchmark was <em>not</em> to analyze why Go, Node, and Elixir exhibit the observed behavior. Instead, we wanted to quantify their behavior so that readers familiar with the internal workings of each system can reflect on the strong and the weak sides. For those readers already using one of the systems, or those planning to migrate from one to another, we hope to provide some back-of-the-napkin guidelines to help with capacity planning. We also welcome suggestions on how to improve our benchmarking approach.</p>

A new report by the Angus Reid Institute suggests the majority of Canadians support the idea of a shorter work week. (Richard Buchan/THE CANADIAN PRESS)</p><div>
                    <p>Support for the idea of a shorter work week is growing in popularity in Canada as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to upend the working lives of Canadians, according to a <a href="http://angusreid.org/four-day-work-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new study by the Angus Reid Institute</a>.</p>
<p>More than half of Canadians (53 per cent) surveyed by the non-profit research centre said it would be a good idea to make a new 30-hour work week standard in Canada, the study found.</p>
<p>That’s a six-point increase compared to 2018 and more than twice the number of people who feel the present 40-hour workweek is just fine, the survey said.</p>
<p>Researchers at the institute speculate that the increase in support for a shorter workweek is perhaps driven in part by the COVID-19 pandemic and difficulties it has presented for many out of work Canadians.</p>
<p>The proportion of supporters of a 30-hour workweek rises to 58 per cent among those who have applied for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. This is eight-points higher than those who have not applied for the program, the study found.</p>
<p>Support for a shorter workweek is highest at the lowest levels of household income (64 per cent) and lowest among those with incomes over $150,000 per year (47 per cent).</p>
<p>Past Conservative voters are the most fervent in their opposition to the idea of a shorter workweek.</p>
<p>This group is most likely to say that shortening the work week is an ill-conceived idea, 40 per cent feel this way, while two-thirds of past Liberal and New Democratic Party voters voice support for the measure.</p>
<h5>‘An interesting notion’</h5>
<p>Ricardo Tranjan, senior researcher at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, said “30 for 40”, thirty hours work for forty hours pay, is an interesting notion, and one that should be widely discussed, even beyond the COVID-19 context.</p>
<p>Shorter working weeks would allow workers to participate more actively in their children’s education, spend more time caring for their own parents and engage in leisure and physical activities that would have a positive impact on their health, Tranjan said.</p>
<p>Ten additional hours at home could go a long way in alleviating “double shifts,” which burden women disproportionately more than men, he said.</p>
<p>“But I have two critical concerns,” Tranjan said. “First, this can’t happen unless wages are adequate. We would absolutely need to maintain the same wage levels for shorter weeks, but for some workers, that wouldn’t be enough.”</p>
<p>People who work 40 hours a week at the minimum wage are very likely to have household incomes close to the poverty line, he said.</p>
<p>“If we reduce hours for these workers, they’re likely to pick up extra shifts, hoping that will allow them to afford things like new winter jackets for the kids or more and healthier food for the family,” Tranjan said.</p>
<p>“Meantime, higher-wage workers will be enjoying all the benefits of shorter weeks, so we’ll be just exacerbating social inequalities.”</p>
<p>Tranjan said his second concern has to do with eligibility for income supports, which is often tied to working hours.</p>
<p>“For example, will employment insurance eligibility be reduced if weeks are reduced? Or will we end up with even fewer people qualifying for EI benefits?” Tranjan said. “We need to tackle these questions heads on, but we should continue to have this conversation.”</p>
<h5>Business owners not buying it</h5>
<p>Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB), which has more than 100,000 members, said it should surprise no one that the majority of Canadians like the idea of a four-day work week.</p>
<p>“The only people who would say no to such an idea are those that immediately recognize that this would likely require a 20 per cent reduction in their weekly pay or the massive unemployment that would occur if businesses were required to pay the same for fewer working hours,” Kelly said. “I would like six months of vacation and double my salary – that doesn’t mean it would be a reasonable request.”</p>
<p>Half of small Canadian businesses remain fully or partially closed due to the pandemic and most of those open now will be losing money every week they are open for months and months ahead, Kelly said.</p>
<p>Businesses have been hit with multiple months of lost productivity, rising debt and the costs of the personal protective equipment they now have to procure, Kelly said.</p>
<p>“Shorter work weeks at the same rate of pay for their staff would be an impossibility for nearly every business at this time,” Kelly said.</p>
<p>Twelve per cent of independent businesses report they are considering winding down or going bankrupt, he added.</p>
<p>“There could be 100,000 fewer small businesses before this is over,” Kelly said. “Let’s not push that number even higher.”</p>

				<p><em>Whatever else happens, you made a movie… Nobody can take that away. A hundred years from now, when we're all dead and gone, people will be watching this fucking thing.</em></p>
<p><em>– <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Soprano">Tony Soprano</a> to his nephew (whom he murders over this movie in a few episodes)</em></p>
<p>So I made a 90-second animated, um, I guess it's a blog post. I don't know about a hundred years from now, but I proudly invite you to watch the fucking thing right now:</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/xTOHyWphzFc" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>I hear that it's considered classy for animators, filmmakers and such to let their work stand on its own, either refraining from commentary or making it vague. However, anxious to secure my spot in eternity, I decided to rush my immortal masterpiece out the door, so I cut everything I could.</p>
<p>I then realized that I left out a delicate point which, despite my embarrassment, I must mention. Luckily, typing is much easier than animating, so the following afterthought was quick to put down [1]. Here goes.</p>
<p>The short isn't exactly a documentary, but real-life me did switch to a part-time job to free some time for animating, drawing, etc. I figured this mundane little step was a good topic for a starting filmmaker because it turned out to be surprisingly controversial. Here are some of the reactions I received:</p>
<ul>
<li>"So you finally got fed up with the job?"</li>
<li>"Part-time? But everyone here <em>needs</em> you!"</li>
<li>"Wow, I'm jealous! I want to work less, too. They pay you the same, right?" No, they pay less, I said. "Oh. Ha-ha. Work less, get less. Interesting!"</li>
<li>"You should really work more, not less, while you're young. Futurists predict a huge global pension crisis, so save for your retirement!"</li>
<li>"I doubt this will fly with the big deadline coming. Who's gonna do all the work? Not me!" (This guy works part-time himself – very productively.)</li>
<li>"Doesn't your wife object?" (Actually, my light table is Rachel's gift. I don't know when/if I'd ever get one on my own.)</li>
</ul>
<p>These comments suggest that many people want to work less, but something is keeping them from doing it. I can certainly relate to that. It took me 10 years to decide to work part-time – and then <em>5 more years to actually do it</em>.</p>
<p>Why is it so hard?</p>
<p>My own reasons mostly revolve around money. Where I live, money is much easier to make programming than animating (good luck even finding a half-stable job working on animated features.)</p>
<p>Hence "I went into programming for the money", as I said in the short – as I always say. And initially I figured I'd work all I can and retire early – the opposite of working part-time and animating in my spare time ("settling for a fraction of the dream"). And you've just seen how I changed my mind.</p>
<p>But there's another thing, which I usually<em> don't </em>say and which I must reluctantly admit. You see, I came for the money, and then I started liking the <em>getting paid</em> part.</p>
<p>What's the difference between money and getting paid? There's a world of difference!</p>
<p>Winning a lottery is a way to obtain money without getting paid for a service. And spending your wage on designer clothes is a way to get paid without having any money left. The difference is this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Money</strong> lets you buy things – food, living space, spare time, etc. It's about <strong>options</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Getting paid</strong> tells you the value of your service to whoever paid you. It's about <strong>achievement</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I like getting paid, I must admit despite the embarrassment.</p>
<p>Note that I'm not ashamed in the slightest to like money (options) and to have chosen a profession with the sole purpose of maximizing income.</p>
<p>Some people believe that you can't be happy doing something you don't love – and that you can't be any good at it, hence you won't make that much money, either. I disagree.</p>
<p>I'll tell you who my role model is, as a computer programmer. It's neither Bill Gates nor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_stallman">Richard Stallman</a>. My role model is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Guinness">Alec Guinness</a>, whom you probably remember as Obi-Wan Kenobi from Star Wars. Wikipedia says:</p>
<blockquote><p>In letters to his friends, Guinness described the film as "fairy tale rubbish" &lt;…&gt;</p>
<p>He was one of the few cast members who believed that the film would be a box office hit;&nbsp; he negotiated a deal for 2% of the gross royalties &lt;…&gt;</p>
<p>Lucas and fellow cast members … have spoken highly of his courtesy and professionalism, both on and off the set. Lucas &lt;said&gt; that Guinness contributed significantly to achieving completion of the filming.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here's a man working on something he disliked because it paid – and delighting his target audience and colleagues alike. To me it shows that "extrinsic motivation" – money – is a perfectly good primary motivation, contrary to <a href="http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2014/07/09/extrinsic-motivations-are-harmful/">some researchers' conclusions</a>.</p>
<p>I'm in it for the money – hence, I'll never get bored and lose interest, as long as there's money to be made. I'll dutifully work on the unpleasant parts necessary to get things actually done (and get paid). Not liking programming that much, I try to keep my programs short and easy to maintain and extend – so I can program less.</p>
<p>These are all desirable traits – and not everyone genuinely loving programming has them. Think about it. Who's the better henchman – the psychopath murdering for the thrill, or the coldblooded killer who's in it for an early retirement? Same thing here.</p>
<p>I'm your perfect henchman. Pay me, give me some time alone with your computers, and when you come back, you'll find them doing your bidding. Of this I am not ashamed.</p>
<p>Recently, however, I noticed that I'm no longer the coldblooded henchman I used to be, that I started to enjoy the thrill of the kill for its own sake. And this I cannot admit without blushing.</p>
<p>That's what getting paid does to the weak-minded. It warped my value system. The phases of my transition – or should I say my moral decay – went something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>I program because they pay me.</li>
<li>Programming is good because they pay me.</li>
<li>Programming is good.</li>
<li>Programming is good! I think I'll go program right now. Or read about it. Or write something about it. All in my spare time.</li>
</ol>
<p>And there you have it. <strong>"Achievement" has been redefined to mean "that thing you get paid for".</strong></p>
<p>This is how I ended up with a website dedicated largely to programming. Then a programming blog on the site and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.embeddedrelated.com/blogs-1/nf/Yossi_Kreinin.php">a similar blog elsewhere</a>. Then came the ultimate downfall: <a href="https://github.com/yosefk">open-source programs on GitHub</a>, written during evenings and weekends.</p>
<p>And I don't regret the writing. Keeping readers' attention on my very dry programming-related subjects is a worthy challenge for any starting storyteller.</p>
<p>But <em>programming for free? Me?</em> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/quotes">If you're good at something, never do it for free!</a> Oh, how the weak-minded have fallen.</p>
<p>Sometimes you need to hit rock bottom to begin rising. So it was with me. Realizing that I've just programmed for free for several weekends in a row made me think. Hard.</p>
<p>"I can't believe you," I said to myself. "All this money-chasing at least made some sense. But programming for free? Why not <em>draw</em> in your spare time instead? What's <em>wrong </em>with you?"</p>
<p>"Not so fast," said self. "For free or not, at least here you are doing something you're good at. You know you're good – you get paid for it! Would they pay you for drawing? Not so soon. Maybe never. Even if you're any good. <strong>In fact you'll never know if you're any good. </strong>Not if you're never paid. Nor if you're paid badly, which happens all the time in those arty parts of the world, even to the best. Why not stick to things you're <em>good</em> at – that you <em>know </em>you're good at?"</p>
<p>Could you believe this guy? Well, I wouldn't have any of that.</p>
<p>"You shameless, hypocritical, baiting-and-switching COWARD," I screamed at self at the top of my lungs. "You always said programming was for the money – to buy time, to buy that bloody creative freedom you kept chattering about! And now you say I should keep programming because I got good at it? But of course I got good – I've been doing it all this time! I could have gotten just as good at drawing – <strong>I still can</strong> – if I have the time!"</p>
<p>"And you say that now when I can afford some spare time," I went on, "I should regardless stick to what I'm good at, which by now is programming? Are you hinting that I won't ever draw very well? Is <em>that </em>why you suggested a career in programming in the first place – because you didn't believe I could draw? Was that chanting about needing money one big lie all along? Tell me, you lying bastard! I'm gonna -"</p>
<p>"OK, OK, chill, man, CHILL!" Self looked scared and unsettled. He clearly didn't see it coming. Now he was looking for some way to appease me. "You know," said self, "maybe you're right. Remember how you're always proud of taking a long-term view? Of how you care today about things 5, even 10 years ahead?"</p>
<p>I smiled smugly. Indeed I was proud of my long-term-centered, strategic thinking. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Colwell">Bob Colwell</a> – the legendary computer architect – once said that it's the architect's duty to think about the long term, because nobody else will. I <em>so</em> identified with that. (Colwell and I are both computer architects, you see – just, um, of different calibers.)</p>
<p>"Well," said self, "you <em>should</em> be proud. Too many lose sight of the future because of today's small but pressing worries!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah, yeah." I was losing my patience. "Thanks but no thanks for your brown-nosing. Listen, are you playing bait and switch on me again? What does this have to do with drawing?"</p>
<p>"But that's the point – it's the same thing," self exclaimed, "it's about long-term thinking! Sure, in the short term, maybe you're better at programming than drawing. But keep practicing and yes, of course you'll get good at drawing! Use your favorite superpower – your ability to imagine the future vividly, to practically live there – to overcome the temptation to stick to your comfort zone! Secure a better future today! Be the shrewd guy investing in a little unknown startup – yourself the would-be animator – to reap great benefits down the road! Be -"</p>
<p>"I get it. That's what I said though, isn't it? Let's practice – let's draw in the spare time."</p>
<p>"Sure. Sure! You're right," said self submissively. "I'm actually helping you, see? I'm telling you how to use your strengths to take the plunge!"</p>
<p>"Thaaaanks. You know what? We'll …</p></div></div>

  <p>It’s been just shy of three months since my last startup, Alegion, laid off about 1/3 to 1/2 of its Austin, TX office. Unfortunately, I was included in this layoff.</p>
<p>The swift contraction hit hard for everyone, but I felt somewhat uniquely impacted. I had:</p>
<ul>
<li>been the third employee</li>
<li>worked there for almost six years</li>
<li>relocated half way across the country with my family</li>
<li>participated in building the company and the platform from the ground up</li>
</ul>
<p>I have no idea whether or not it’s true that I was uniquely impacted. Everyone has challenges they have just overcome, and more challenges on the horizon.</p>
<p>At any rate, the last three months have been a whirlwind of changes.</p>
<p>My family and I made the decision to move back home to Seattle. We put our house in Austin on the market, bought a popup camper, and drove our dogs half way across the country. We stayed with friends while I was interviewing, and just this week I started my new job. We put an offer out on a house, and will close next month.</p>
<p>Whew.</p>

<p>There are things Alegion engineering did that I think were better than anywhere I have ever worked before. While I helped to design and implement these following successes, typically I was not alone in the effort.</p>
<h2 id="culture-and-hiring">Culture And Hiring</h2>
<p>In the course of six years, I interviewed maybe one hundred candidates, and helped hire around forty of them. These candidates were screened for not just technical fit, but also fit for software development philosophies, humbleness, curiosity, desire to test, and commitment to quality to name a few of our core cultural qualities.</p>
<p>Overall, we were extremely successful in building empathetic, high performance teams.</p>
<h2 id="testing-and-quality">Testing And Quality</h2>
<p>As an engineering organization, all of our teams embraced the DevOps mindset. The team that wrote code, tested it, deployed it, and maintained it.</p>
<p>Tests were a big focus. Coverage was tracked.</p>
<p>Not just coverage, but intent, and overall quality of tests were points of discussion. Tests must be short and expressive. Each test should test one business function. A well designed test suite should communicate a story between developers.</p>
<p>As a group we aligned strongly on these values, and it showed in the quality of our code and the velocity of feature delivery.</p>
<h2 id="protect-and-develop-engineers">Protect And Develop Engineers</h2>
<p>Natural tension exists between product and engineering. Product almost universally moves faster than engineering in terms of feature ideation and business understanding, while engineering has a better view into platform technicalities, capabilities, and shortcomings.</p>
<p>Without a strong cohesion between product and engineering this tension can easily become inefficient, toxic, or otherwise damaging to team morale.</p>
<p>Shared responsibility, trust, and understanding are critical to the health of this relationship. The natural tension can be used to challenge each other in a healthy way, improve alignment, and increase trust through successful execution.</p>
<p>At Alegion, we did all of this extremely well. Each of my former colleagues, without exception, approached challenges with an open mind, integrity, and a strong desire to collaborate and to learn.</p>

<p>Through it all, I’ve had somewhat significant trouble processing all of my thoughts and emotions related to my career the last six years, as well as the layoff. This is a normal problem for me and I go to therapy to help develop my ability at introspection.</p>
<p>For one, I have a lot of regrets. If I could go back to square one with what I know now, the outcome may be different, and I could’ve been more successful in realizing my own goals. However, that’s not guaranteed, and not really useful to ponder over for too long.</p>
<h2 id="empathetic-communication">Empathetic Communication</h2>
<p>I regret that I wasn’t better at empathetic communication from the beginning. I think this skill would have made a critical difference in my trajectory, as well as the trajectory of the company. Instead of being focused on the outcome, I should have been focused more broadly on the people and our interactions, in addition to the outcome.</p>
<h2 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h2>
<p>I regret that I didn’t achieve my goals for my career at Alegion. From the beginning, I desired an executive leadership position. However, without the experience or vocabulary to articulate my goals, they remained elusive.</p>
<p>About three years into my employment, the company had been in growth mode. Individuals were hired above me, and before I knew it, there were no more leadership positions available.</p>
<p>I had worked so hard for three years, relocated my family from Seattle to Austin without a second thought, and my singular goal of an executive leadership position was simply out of the question.</p>
<h2 id="politics-and-coalition-building">Politics And Coalition Building</h2>
<p>I regret that I didn’t do a better job connecting with my coworkers. If my goal was a leadership position, I should have been focused on building relationships across the organization, and not solely on proving my worth through delivering technology.</p>
<h2 id="technological-excellence">Technological Excellence</h2>
<p>I regret that I didn’t focus more on quality vs speed in the beginning. I still believe speed is critical to the survival of startups, but I needed to balance quality into the equation a little more. I also regret not pushing back against more requirements up front. We were simply too ambitious too early.</p>
<h2 id="blind-faith">Blind Faith</h2>
<p>I regret investing so heavily in a startup, so blindly. I worked many evenings, nights, and weekends developing the platform, building features, coaching teammates, and managing production. I worked from the delivery room for my first child. I took almost no paternity leave for two children.</p>
<p>I regret that my company evidently did not have the same intrinsic desire to invest in me.</p>
<p>This rejection was so unexpected, so complete, that I felt blindsided. The rejection cut deep, and I don’t know if I will ever feel the same. I may never work at a true startup again due to this experience.</p>

<p>To say this experience of rejection crushed me is an understatement. In hindsight, I don’t think I ever recovered from management’s decision to exclude me from any executive leadership opportunities.</p>
<p>Perhaps my goals were unrealistic given my experience and performance – that was the argument given to me. I have no such leadership experience. I have no proven record on delivering technology at a leadership level.</p>
<p>One question I frequently come back to is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, in any sense, should Alegion have taken a chance on me?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their decision to keep me in an IC role seems entirely rational and optimal given the situation, my experience, and the needs of the organization.</p>

<p>I had just naively believed that being an early employee meant that path was available to me (in fact, my boss had said as much in one of our early conversations, despite denying that path to me). This should serve as a warning to anyone else thinking that a startup is a good way to advance in their career path.</p>
<p>If fast advancement is a career goal, it must be explicit with clear, unambiguous, and achievable goals that the startup commits to in writing. Any less of a commitment, and you can wipe your ass with it, because that’s what it’s worth.</p>

<p>My startup experience was filled with what seemed like a lot of organizational successes, as well as personal failures. I’m not sure how much of this is true, how much of it is due to my mental health, and issues that I continue to work through.</p>
<p>I committed strongly to this startup, without really considering the sacrifices I was making over time to see the vision through. My mental health was severely damaged, and will take a while still to recover. My wife and I had two kids, and are probably done. I missed my opportunity to ever have paternity leave, and spend those first weeks/months focused on my family. I took vacation, but rarely, and almost never more than two weeks per year.</p>
<p>I had a wild ride, and learned <em>a lot</em>. From primarily web development experience in the beginning, to distributed microservices, DevOps, and security/compliance, there were a lot of turns that allowed me to hone my skills, as well as pick up new ones. I am extremely grateful for that experience.</p>
<p>My new job, which I started this week, pays more than I’ve ever made before. The pay increase is almost double my second largest pay increase. So, in that sense, the startup hustle paid off. It is also significantly less stressful. While the money is certainly welcome, it’s a bittersweet victory.</p>
<p>In the end, I don’t know if I will ever do another startup. Certainly not with the same leadership again. The emotional toll was just too much to outweigh the positive aspects of the experience.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Server cost is usually not a concern for most funded startups, but for a boot strapped SaaS product like ours,&nbsp; it was important to have an AWS bill that is easy on the pocket and a little more proportional to the MRR.</p><p>‍</p><p>To that end when we started<a href="http://superlemon.xyz/" target="_blank"> superlemon.xyz</a> one of the first things I did was to find ways to consume the least amount of resources on the cloud. We currently serve a traffic of ~ 250 requests per second with our AWS setup.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>Most applications require certain common cloud resources and these include</p><p>‍<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Compute instances</li><li>Database instances</li><li>Caching instances</li><li>CDN&nbsp;</li><li>A web server that acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer</li></ul><p>‍<br></p><div><p>I will now go through each of these resources and talk about both the expensive way and the cheap way to implement them</p></div><p><strong>Compute instances</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>When it comes to compute instances, most people go with AWS EC2 instances. EC2 instances are the safest choice to make for running server applications as they are highly configurable, scalable and you can change the configuration on demand according to your needs. However, sometimes you do not really need this level of control on your compute instances and that brings us to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/compute/lightsail/" target="_blank">AWS Lightsail</a>.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>Lightsail as the name suggests is a lightweight version of EC2. Under the hood Lightsail instances are actually EC2 instances, but this is not apparent to the user and unlike the highly configurable EC2, Lightsail comes with a fixed configuration that once you provision cannot be changed. The billing is also a fixed amount per month as opposed to EC2 which is billed by the hour.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>To give you a sense of how much less complicated Lightsail is, please take a look at these screenshots of the EC2 dashboard and Lightsail dashboard.</p><figure id="w-node-7afe1c2bdee3-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef82a451ea3cd05dfd4c146_x93boOZlEeQGL9kcVSXPZyGOX3SNQJfDNyRC0qG3jNDCYeySdZpIgBzYgkVDZqq3DhR92f_Eqdp8sG-vIgkwltIW9ExWhshfDSsb-gd2qCah6E5VjydVhGxO4QFRA5qCR2KXqhP5.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-2074947a61a8-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef737f4a33047deb1c0a4a6_ZMr0t2QqxGgPZ-Grg-TIHjpok_ujhoYzyHLQnsGzlSfLJj0wRrKWFMKNnVDwCoOorYJHs6j4aqKz_NgztOFGNSNc9Fw4nKGrwSRVK7E4hQtDkzE7OXIVaQp0lDjXxwjiKkHN1e3c.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>EC2 dashboard</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>But we are not here to debate the complexity of EC2 vs Lightsail, so let’s let us talk about the cost.</p><p>An EC2 instance with 2 virtual cores, 4GB RAM and a storage of 80GB costs roughly 37$ a month and a Lightsail instance with the exact same configuration costs 20$ a month which is almost half the cost!</p><p>‍<br></p><p>The only drawback here as previously mentioned is that the instance is fixed and neither the storage nor the compute power can be tweaked later according to spikes in traffic and usage.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>In our case we do not have a need for too much storage on the compute instance, and as for the computing power it was easy for us to simply provision another Lightsail instance when there is an increase in traffic and set it up behind a load balancer. This way our system is still scalable.</p><p><strong>Database instances</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>Choosing a database provider for your application can be a tricky decision, but on a high level there is just one thing that is absolutely required for any database provider - the ability to take regular backups of the DB automatically and the ability to restore the database from one of the backups.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>All of this functionality is provided by AWS RDS along with an array of other capabilities like autoscaling of storage, multiple availability zones, etc. However we did not not really need this level of control over the DB for our simple SaaS product, not to mention the fact that RDS would cost us a minimum of 200$ a month with the lowest acceptable configuration.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>Once again our saviour was Lightsail which provides managed Databases with a fixed storage at very cheap prices. Only MySQL and PostgreSQL are available though which was fine with us since I am quite comfortable with MySQL. We have currently provisioned one MySQL DB with 2 vCPUS, 4GB RAM and 120GB SSD and it costs us 60$ a month.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>And as mentioned before Lightsail provides the basic capabilities of backups and restoration.</p><figure id="w-node-e1f43dee380f-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef731c812136072299e133c_Q2n6wprxbcqgh5vI97YqjWYkOYV52HGzRtHXIQFfpgxwlHkGaO8YDv3aO3V-PwM2SI4qxPty6ZMlK0siv1-lAizSl9hf_6RASDqzNrSfEmIeMdu8UeSTsRhu4Sk1Ofg6Uw8CPPuK.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Database restoration from recent backup</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><div><p>The drawback here is that the DB will not scale automatically so your will have to make sure that your application does not use storage beyond what is available in the instance you select. We do this by regularly purging our Database of data that is older than X days and data that belongs to users who churned from our app more than X days ago and haven’t come back since.&nbsp;</p></div><p><strong>Caching instances</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>For our application we needed a Caching layer as well as the ability to queue up jobs that can be executed asynchronously. The seasoned folks here might have realised that the best tool to use for this is Redis and AWS has a service called ElastiCache which is Redis under the hood.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>Once again this would be a very safe choice to make because it is completely managed and scalable. Our need was a Redis instance with at least 6GB of memory and 2vCPUs and if we went with ElastiCache our cost would roughly come out to be 112$ a month, not to mention the additional cost of running our async workers somewhere else.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>I might sound like a broken record at this point but what we ended up doing was to provision a Lightsail instance with 2vCPUs and 8GB of memory for the cost of 40$ a month and installed an open source version of Redis on this instance. We also use the same instance to run our asynchronous workers which read from the Redis queue and execute jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>So what is the drawback? Well since it is not a managed service, you would have to monitor the Redis server yourself. There are many tools out there that help you do this and the one I would recommend is<a href="http://prometheus.io/" target="_blank"> prometheus.io</a>.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>This means that you have to do a little bit of extra work to setup metrics collection from your Redis instance and use a grafana dashboard where you can view these metrics, but this extra work saves a lot of money in the long run and you get to look at a super cool dashboard like this one</p><figure id="w-node-ed9ef23d383f-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef71b6832df460f9189c1ef_8fAYGJqB0CXvglSTkg-wXPXqpKi2e3fusNyMcOaiepfnZ-dC1kjn2Do44sILw5lbKOSISB1CMTEdCzyqBcyggDwK4tJcDEA17xkWXb2J1tUjLHBJgtMa_t3ekfIUfOiImx5IaZd6.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Grafana dashboard for monitoring redis instance</figcaption></figure><p><strong>CDN</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>Our application requires a javascript file to be loaded into the websites of our customers. This JS file gets a ton of traffic because this traffic scales according to how many visitors our customers get. Now this can be scary because it means we really had no idea how many requests the JS file might actually end up receiving so we hesitated to go with CloudFront which is the goto solution for a CDN on AWS.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>So we ended up taking an entirely different approach for this. Our application is a Shopify app and during the process of building the application we created a Shopify store. Every Shopify store gets its own personal CDN where you can manually upload anything and it will be served over the Shopify CDN. So we minified and uploaded our JS file to the CDN of our Shopify store and now we serve 20000 Shopify stores using this method at zero cost.</p><figure id="w-node-78b80f124ebd-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef71b68374cfd3932d127f5_z2vfALB6_5FJXMp4al-65PIczwKOE-wUb0TubqBXAFMiu0rnqPEKGAOl12Saf0Xn-Ay1DjWL7wIj7Vby1sNPfLHkpuXzHf17ytoJ5gQvql13DZl1BsIV2rJPeHgfnCnIdezWiddG.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Shopify CDN&nbsp;that is free of cost</figcaption></figure><p>There is a glaring drawback to this approach. The Shopify store CDN does not provide an API that you can use to programmatically upload files and it has to be done manually. Also unlike CloudFront, there is no option of invalidating a file once it is uploaded. So If you have to make updates to your file you would have to upload a new file and migrate all of your existing users to this new file.&nbsp;<br></p><p>‍</p><p>This might sound like a big drawback, but it actually took me an hour to whip up a script that updates the JS file for all our existing 20000 stores to the updated JS file that I provide. So whenever I make a new release to this JS file, I simply upload a new file manually to the CDN, then take that file as the input and run this script and we re live! This approach works for us because we do not make too many releases to the JS&nbsp;file to begin with.</p><p><strong>Web server + load balancer</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>Every application requires the ability to route requests coming to their domain or subdomain to various applications running under the hood. The best way to do this is to use AWS ELB which can be used to automatically distribute incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>This sounds quite fancy, but all we needed for our product was 4 things</p><p>‍</p><ul role="list"><li>Serving static files for our application dashboard</li><li>Distribute traffic among different Lightsail instances based on the path of the incoming URL</li><li>Load balance traffic that comes from our Merchants Shopify stores amongst N identical Lightsail instances.</li><li>Rate limiting of requests to prevent DDOS attacks.</li></ul><p>‍<br></p><p>All of this can be done using NGINX which is a great piece of software and is quite robust even with the default settings that it comes with.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So we simply installed a stable version of NGINX on one of our existing Lightsail instances which was already being used to host one of our server applications. We also use<a href="http://amplify.nginx.com/" target="_blank"> amplify.nginx.com</a> for monitoring it. This setup is pretty much equivalent to using a managed service at zero cost.</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-26b2c44e15ee-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef730c34b26677e785fa7ea_w67-tKkFsy_LekSEhO_PXqnHGxDiREqENBgMBaEAOqotyjEDJoKXRk6Wpd5K86OOv2z_S-ejGOnL37l6lj6MWqE_x2ZvrIZ4FCQraAC1uDWMne7yi0Fme4Jap2sp2uH2zrKdvpTz.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Amplify dashboard for monitoring health of the NGINX server</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>‍</p><ul role="list"><li>Use lightsail instances (20$ per instance) instead of EC2 instances (37$ per instance)</li><li>Use a lightsail database (60$ per DB) instead of RDS (200$ per DB)</li><li>Use a self hosted redis server on a compute instance (40$) instead of ElastiCache (112$)&nbsp;</li><li>If feasible, use a free CDN (cost savings depends on traffic size)</li><li>Use a self hosted NGINX server (20$ fixed cost) instead of ELB (cost depends on traffic and usage)</li></ul><p><strong>Closing notes</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>I would like to put emphasis on the fact that we are a micro-SaaS product that solves a small and specific use case and therefore this kind of AWS setup worked for us.

We have been running this product for a little over 1 year with this AWS setup and so far we have not encountered any problems.</p></div></div>]]>

      <p>SwiftUI feels very young when it first announced last year in WWDC19. It shows a promising future, but it has a rough edge here and there, and it quite hard to predict what it will be like in a year. The year has passed, and here is my thought on Apple's new declarative UI framework SwiftUI.</p>
<h2 id="the-gap-is-getting-closer">The gap is getting closer <a href="#the-gap-is-getting-closer">#</a></h2>
<p>My arguments around SwiftUI are always like, "You can't do x (UIKit features) in SwiftUI". This year, Apple show an incredible pace of SwiftUI development. The missing UI elements from last year already have a SwiftUI counterpart, e.g., <code>UIColelctionView</code> and <code>UITextField</code> already have a SwiftUI counterpart of <code>LazyH/VGrid</code> and <code>TextEditor</code>.</p>
<h2 id="first-class-citizen">First-class citizen <a href="#first-class-citizen">#</a></h2>
<p>It looks like SwiftUI doesn't want to be just a view for UIKit anymore. Now, you can write an entire app using pure SwiftUI.</p>
<p>The following is a working SwiftUI app code.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>import</span> <span>SwiftUI</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>@main</span><br><span><span>struct</span> <span>SwiftUIApp</span><span>:</span> <span>App</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    <span>var</span> body<span>:</span> some <span>Scene</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>        <span>WindowGroup</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>            <span>Text</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello! SwiftUI"</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>        <span>}</span></span><br><span>    <span>}</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>And the code above not just works on iOS, but the same code can make an iPad and Mac app. You can write a multiplatform app entirely with SwiftUI. Seem like the concepts of SwiftUI are far more powerful than I first thought.</p>
<h2 id="exclusive-deal">Exclusive Deal <a href="#exclusive-deal">#</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/widgetkit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">WidgetKit</a>, a new framework in iOS 14 for writing a Widget can only write using SwiftUI. This means you can't run away from it, even you love UIKit, it seems like you have no choice, but to also learn SwiftUI.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/29ba6373e9bf92bbbc301e0f6fb491f3cf51920a/819cd/images/swiftui-2-widget.png" alt="Widget">
  <figcaption>Widget</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="is-uikit-going-to-die%3F">Is UIKit going to die? <a href="#is-uikit-going-to-die%3F">#</a></h2>
<p>Nope, it is far from over. I don't think Apple has a plan to drop UIKit in the foreseeable future. As working on UIKit for years, SwiftUI feels like magic to me. It can replicate UIKit function with a single line of code (or no line of code since it builds right into SwiftUI). The bad thing about magic is that when things are not going as you want, it is hard to figure out what's wrong, and it might not be possible to fix it. That's when you need to go back to UIKit. UIKit is a foundation of iOS, and Apple still keeps adding new features to it (UICollectionView and UISplitViewController got a lot of cool features this year, you should check it out).</p>
<p>I see UIKit as a secret sauce behind all SwiftUI magic. Both UIKit and SwiftUI have their strength, and Apple picks the right tool for the right job (they use SwiftUI for WidgetKit because it suits the constraint that Widget has right now). I think these two will coexist for a very long time.</p>
<p>Apple put years of experience in their UIKit and tools into SwiftUI. It is enjoyable to work with, and the outcome is phenomenal. Apple can do this because they set up a way to bridge SwiftUI to UIKit, so they know that even when SwiftUI fails to do some tasks, there will always have UIKit there.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion <a href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Here comes the important question. Should you learn UIKit or SwiftUI?</p>
<p>My short answer would be <strong>SwiftUI</strong>.</p>
<p>And here is my long answer. From all the facts I point out in this article, SwiftUI is ready now. I think in the end you would end up learning both of them.</p>
<p>If you know UIKit, you are forced to learn SwiftUI since it is exclusive to a new framework like WidgetKit. Even not for that reason, I think you probably the one who appreciates SwiftUI the most. SwiftUI can do many great things right out of the box, things that we always want to do in UIKit, but don't have the opportunity and time to do it.</p>
<p>If you know SwiftUI, there would be a time that you want extra customization or hit some roadblock. When the time comes, UIKit will always there for you.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Quantum entanglement has attracted some attention from the public that this mysterious process might be useful for lots of future applications, such as quantum computing and teleportation.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss quantum entanglement superficially using mathematics.</p>

<h3 id="quantum-entanglement">Quantum Entanglement</h3>

<p>Assume we have two independent quantum systems $Q$ and $Q^{\prime}$, represented respectively by the vector spaces $\mathbb{V}$ and $\mathbb{V}^{\prime}$. The quantum system obtained by merging $Q$ and $Q^{\prime}$ will have the tensor product $\mathbb{V} \otimes \mathbb{V}^{\prime}$ as a state space.</p>



<p>If $\mathbb{V} \in \mathbb{C}^n$ with basic states $| x_0 \rangle, | x_1 \rangle, \cdots, | x_{n-1} \rangle$ and $\mathbb{V}^{\prime} \in \mathbb{C}^m$ with basic states $| y_0 \rangle, | y_1 \rangle, \cdots, | y_{m-1} \rangle$, the tensor product state space would be $\mathbb{V} \otimes \mathbb{V}^{\prime} \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times m}$ with basic states $| x_i \rangle \otimes | y_j \rangle$ for $0 \leq i \leq n-1$ and $0 \leq j \leq m-1$. Here, the basic state $| x_i \rangle \otimes | y_j \rangle$ means the first quantum systems $Q$ is in the state $| x_i \rangle$ and the second quantum system $Q^{\prime}$ is in the state $| y_j \rangle$.</p>



<p>More independent quantum systems $Q_0, Q_1, \cdots, Q_{k-1}$ could be merged together and the state space of the merged quantum system would be $\mathbb{V}_0 \otimes \mathbb{V}_1 \otimes \cdots\ \otimes \mathbb{V}_{k-1}$.</p>



<p>The system state of the merged quantum system from two independent quantum systems $Q$ and $Q^{\prime}$ could be expressed using basic states.</p>



<p>The probability of the system being in the state $| x_i \rangle \otimes | y_j \rangle$ after measurement, according to quantum mechanics, would be</p>



<p>If $c_{i,j} = 0$, then $P(| x_i \rangle \otimes | y_j \rangle) = 0$</p>



<p>We further consider the merged system whose $n = 2$ and $m = 2$.</p>



<p>Suppose $c_{0,0} = 0$, $c_{0,1} = 1$, $c_{1,0} = 1$, $c_{1,1} = 0$, i.e.,</p>



<p>When we measure the state of the first quantum system $Q$, there are two possible outcomes, either the system was in the state $| x_0 \rangle$ or $| x_1 \rangle$. Similarly, when we measure the state of the first quantum system $Q^{\prime}$, there are two possible outcomes, either the system was in the state $| y_0 \rangle$ or $| y_1 \rangle$.</p>



<p>If we saw the system state of $Q$ is $| x_0 \rangle$, the system state of $Q^{\prime}$ must be $| y_1 \rangle$ even without measurement. Similarly, if we saw the system state of $Q$ is $| x_1 \rangle$, the system state of $Q^{\prime}$ must be $| y_0 \rangle$ even without measurement. This is because the probability of observing $| x_0 \rangle \otimes | y_0 \rangle$ or $| x_1 \rangle \otimes | y_1 \rangle$ is 0.</p>



<p>This is called quantum entanglement.</p>



<p>In this case, no matter how far the two subsystems in the entangled system is, we know the system states of both subsystems by just observing one single subsystem.</p>



<p>The quantum entanglement is simultaneous and instantaneous. If we describe this process using “velocity”, we would find the “velocity” is infinitely large, faster than light speed, which is the fastest “velocity” we are currently using for information transmission. However, we prefer not to describe this process using velocity, since it is not a conventional physical “travel” process.</p>



<p>Formally, if a merged system state $| \psi \rangle$ can be broken into the tensor product of states from the constituent subsystems, i.e.,</p>



<p>We call this merged system state $| \psi \rangle$ separable state. Otherwise we call it entangled state, as we would find there is no solution to solve the above equation for an entangled state.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>Some people who did not study physics sometimes described the process of quantum entanglement as if there is a causation relationship, which means that it is the state of one subsystem affecting the other subsystem. However, from our mathematics analysis, we know this causation relationship does not exist.</p>

            <span> Jun 26, 2020</span>
            
                <a href="https://blog.mostlypointless.dev/tags/linux">linux</a>
            
                <a href="https://blog.mostlypointless.dev/tags/raspberry-pi">raspberry pi</a>
            
        
        <p>Almost two months ago, I started building a four node Raspberry Pi 4 cluster for a project I’m working on. Figuring out the best way to get Linux on each node lead me down a rabbit hole and I spent the next four weeks <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/Y/yak-shaving.html">yak shaving</a>.</p>
<p>The most common way to boot a Pi is from an SD card. But they are slow and unreliable - I don’t like them. Certain models of Pi 2 and Pi 3 support <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/msd.md">booting from USB storage</a>, but Pi 4 cannot do that yet. So, I’m stuck with using an SD card for each Pi. Or so I thought.</p>
<h3 id="enter-pxe-boot">Enter PXE boot</h3>
<p>Turns out, Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 also <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/net.md">support network booting</a>. A beta firmware was released late last year that enables <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment">PXE</a> for Pi 4. I found <a href="https://linuxhit.com/raspberry-pi-pxe-boot-netbooting-a-pi-4-without-an-sd-card">an article on LinuxHit</a> detailing the process of installing the firmware and setting up network boot.</p>
<p>Just to test this out, I updated the firmware and configured PXE server on one of the Pis. I tried booting another Pi over the network and…it worked!
Here is the gist of PXE server setup process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the contents of <code>/boot</code> and the rest of <code>/</code> into separate folders on your local filesystem. I copied mine to <code>/tftp/raspbian-boot</code> and <code>/nfs/raspbian-root</code> respectively.</li>
<li>Install and configure <code>dnsmasq</code> to enable TFTP and use <code>/tftp</code> as <code>tftp-root</code></li>
<li>Install and configure NFS server to share <code>/tftp/raspbian-boot</code> and <code>/nfs/raspbian-root</code></li>
<li>Edit the contents of <code>/nfs/raspbian-root/fstab</code> to mount the boot partition.</li>
<li>Edit <code>/nfs/raspbian-boot/cmdline.txt</code> to</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">console<span>=</span>serial0,115200 console<span>=</span>tty1 root<span>=</span>/dev/nfs nfsroot<span>=</span>&lt;IP addr&gt;:/nfs/raspbian-root,vers<span>=</span>4.1,proto<span>=</span>tcp rw ip<span>=</span>dhcp rootwait elevator<span>=</span>deadline
</code></pre></div><h3 id="pxe-booting-3-nodes-using-overlayfs">PXE booting 3 nodes using OverlayFS</h3>
<p>I cannot just boot all three nodes from the same boot and root filesystems since they are not read-only. And I don’t want to maintain a copy of these for each node. But this is a solved problem - Docker already lets you spin up multiple containers from a single base image. So I’ll just do <a href="https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/overlayfs-driver/#how-the-overlay2-driver-works">what Docker does</a> - create <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/overlayfs.html">OverlayFS</a> for each node using raspbian-root and raspbian-boot as my lower directories. I’ll share them over NFS like before.</p>
<p>Configuration for one of the nodes is below. Other two nodes follow the same pattern. Note that I moved raspbian-root and raspbian-boot to a USB hard drive (mounted at <code>/mnt</code>) to get better r/w performance. dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX is the MAC address of the node. I’m using <code>tftp-unique-root=mac</code> option in <code>dnsmasq</code> to maintain a separate boot environment for each node based on its MAC address.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ mount -t overlay nog-boot -o lowerdir<span>=</span>/mnt/raspbian-boot,upperdir<span>=</span>/mnt/upper/nog-boot,workdir<span>=</span>/mnt/work/nog-boot -o nfs_export<span>=</span>on -o index<span>=</span>on -o redirect_dir<span>=</span>nofollow /tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX

</code></pre></div><p>(In case you are wondering what <code>nog</code> is: I name my servers after planets from the Star Wars universe. Following this tradition, I’ve named the Pis Mandalore (PXE server), Nog, Ordo and Werda)</p>
<p>You are probably thinking that this worked. It did not.</p>
<p>NFS and OverlayFS did not play nice with each other. After a weekend trying to work around some weird issues, I gave up.</p>
<p>But OverlayFS is not the only copy-on-write filesystem in existence, is it? ZFS and BTRFS offer <a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Manpage/btrfs-subvolume">subvolumes and snapshots</a> that I can use instead. But not before I <del>procrastinate</del> spend 2 weeks deciding which one to use.</p>
<h3 id="moving-to-btrfs">Moving to BTRFS</h3>
<p>The plan is simple: I’ll create a subvolume each for raspbian-root and raspbian-boot. I’ll then create three snapshots of each subvolume - one for every node. I created a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAS_syndrome">btrfs file system</a> on my external drive and ran the following commands</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ btrfs subvolume create raspbian-root
$ btrfs subvolume create raspbian-boot

<span># Repeat the following for each node changing folder names as necessary</span>
$ btrfs subvolume snapshot raspbian-boot nog-boot
$ btrfs subvolume snapshot raspbian-root nog-root
$ mount --bind /mnt/nog-boot /tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX
$ mount --bind /mnt/nog-root /nfs/nog

<span># Don’t forget to edit cmdline.txt for each node</span>
$ cat /tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX/cmdline.txt
console<span>=</span>serial0,115200 console<span>=</span>tty1 root<span>=</span>/dev/nfs nfsroot<span>=</span>&lt;IP addr&gt;:/nfs/nog,vers<span>=</span>4.1,proto<span>=</span>tcp rw ip<span>=</span>dhcp rootwait elevator<span>=</span>deadline
</code></pre></div><p>Well, this worked! I have a Pi running without an SD card!! Now all I have to do is create systemd unit files to start all required services and mount snapshots. I can finally start working on my project.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. Take a closer look at the output of <code>cat /tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX/cmdline.txt</code>.
If you are like me, you will realize for the first time that <code>root=</code> in this file defines where the root filesystem will be mounted from. Right now, we are telling it to mount from <code>/dev/nfs</code>. What if I attach an external drive and set <code>root=</code> to point to the external drive?</p>
<h3 id="network-booting-into-a-usb-hard-drive">Network booting into a USB hard drive</h3>
<p>RPi 4 cannot directly boot from a USB drive. As in - it cannot find <code>/boot</code> on a USB drive when powering on. But what if we provide <code>/boot</code> with network boot and mount <code>/</code> from a USB drive using <code>cmdline.txt</code>? Time to test.</p>
<p>I copied raspbian-root to a USB drive, edited <code>fstab</code> to mount <code>/</code> using the partition’s PARTUUID and connected it to Nog. I then updated the contents of <code>/tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX/cmdline.txt</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ cat /tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX/cmdline.txt

</code></pre></div><p>After a couple of reboots, it worked! I now have a RPi 4 running off a USB hard drive!</p>
<h3 id="what-did-i-gain">What did I gain?</h3>
<p>Let’s start with what I was looking for. All I wanted was to not deal with SD cards because they are slow and unreliable. Reliability is relative - everything fails at some point. But a decent quality USB hard drive will likely outlive an SD card. So let’s just look at some read/write performance numbers and see how they compare.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ sync; dd <span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero of<span>=</span>twogeefile bs<span>=</span>1M count<span>=</span>2048; sync  <span># Write performance</span>

<p>With network boot, I was able to get read and write speeds similar to a class 10 SD card. Note that the boot images are hosted on a USB hard drive connected to Mandalore (PXE server). NFS seems to be the bottleneck here - raw r/w speeds of the hard drive are much better than this. All Pis are connected to Netgear’s 8 port gigabit ethernet switch.</p>
<p>To no one’s surprise, things improve considerably when Pis are running off a USB hard disk. Note that the external drives I used are 5400RPM hard disks repurposed from very old MacBooks. I bought them on eBay for $10 a pop. YMMV.</p>
<h3 id="current-setup">Current setup</h3>
<p>Right now, I have Mandalore booting from an SD card and <code>/</code> mounted from a USB hard disk. Nog, Ordo and Werda fetch <code>/boot</code> from Mandalore over the network and <code>/</code> mounted from a USB hard disk.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/boot-raspberry-pi-4-usb">A new beta firmware is out for RPi 4 that lets you boot from USB drives directly.</a></p>
<p>Oh well…</p>
<p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> This post was discussed on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23666564">Hacker News</a>. As jordybg <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23667247">points out</a>, USB boot is no longer “beta” and is available in the latest (2020-06-15) “stable” firmware release.</em></p>

 many datagrams are queued because the stream is not being read quickly
 enough, drop datagrams to avoid queueing. Implementations should drop older
 datagrams in favor of newer datagrams. The number of datagrams to queue
 should be kept small enough to avoid adding significant latency to packet
 delivery when the stream is being read slowly (due to the reader being slow)
 but large enough to avoid dropping packets when for the stream is not read
 for short periods of time (due to the reader being paused).</p>

This is a <strong>quick</strong> overview about: the architecture, the components, the pain, the learning, the open source and etc.</p>

<ul>
<li>GER 7×1 BRA (yeah, we’re not proud of it)</li>
<li>0.5M&nbsp;simultaneous&nbsp;users @ a single game – ARG x SUI</li>
<li>580Gbps @ a single game – ARG x SUI</li>
<li>=~ 1600 watched years @ the whole event</li>
</ul>

<p>The project was to receive an input stream, generate&nbsp;<a title="hls" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming" target="_blank">HLS</a>&nbsp;output stream for hundreds of&nbsp;thousands and to&nbsp;provide a great experience for final users:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fetch the RTMP input stream</li>
<li>Generate HLS and send it&nbsp;to <a title="cassandra" href="http://cassandra.apache.org/" target="_blank">Cassandra</a></li>
<li>Fetch binary and meta data from Cassandra and rebuild the HLS playlists with Nginx+lua</li>
<li>Serve and cache the live content&nbsp;in a <a title="how to learn high scalability" href="http://leandromoreira.com.br/2014/11/20/how-to-start-to-learn-high-scalability/" target="_blank">scalable way</a></li>
<li>Design and implement the player</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to understand why we chose HLS&nbsp;check&nbsp;<a title="Live Streaming @ Globo.com" href="http://www.slideshare.net/leandro_moreira/fisl15-streaming-de-video-ao-vivo-na-globocom" target="_blank">this presentation only in pt-BR</a>. <strong>tip</strong>:&nbsp;sometimes we need to rebuild some things from scratch.</p>

<p>The live stream comes to our servers&nbsp;as <a title="rtmp" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Messaging_Protocol" target="_blank">RTMP</a> and we were using <a title="ems" href="https://evostream.com/" target="_blank">EvoStream</a> (now we’re moving to <a title="nginx-rtmp" href="https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module" target="_blank">nginx-rtmp</a>) to <strong>receive this input and to generate HLS</strong>&nbsp;output to&nbsp;a <strong>known folder</strong>. Then we have some<strong>&nbsp;python daemons</strong>, running at the same machine, <strong>watching this known folder</strong> and <a title="python m3u8" href="https://github.com/globocom/m3u8" target="_blank">parsing the m3u8</a> and&nbsp;<strong>posting&nbsp;the&nbsp;data&nbsp;to Cassandra</strong>.</p>
<p>To watch files modification and to be notified by these events, we first tried watchdog but for some reason we weren’t able to make it work as fast as we expected and we changed to&nbsp;pyinotify.</p>
<p>Another challenge we had to overcome was to make the&nbsp;python program scale to x&nbsp;cpu cores, we ended up by creating multiple Python processes and using <a title="cassandra async" href="http://datastax.github.io/python-driver/api/cassandra/cluster.html#cassandra.cluster.Session.execute_async" target="_blank">async execution</a>.</p>
<p><strong>tip</strong>:&nbsp;maybe the best language / tool <a title="joke another castle" href="http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/05/27/your-princess-is-in-another-castle-misogyny-entitlement-and-nerds/jcr:content/image.crop.800.500.jpg/1405354940376.cached.jpg" target="_blank">is in another castle</a>.</p>

<p>We previously were using Redis to store the live stream data&nbsp;<a title="moving from redis to cassandra" href="http://planetcassandra.org/blog/interview/globo-rewinds-redis-for-their-dvr-system-fast-forwards-to-apache-cassandra-for-increased-availability/" target="_blank">but we thought&nbsp;Cassandra was needed</a>&nbsp;to offer DVR functionality easily (although we still uses&nbsp;Redis a lot). Cassandra response time was increasing with load&nbsp;to&nbsp;a certain point where&nbsp;clients started to timeout and the video playback completely stopped.</p>
<p>We were using it as <a title="cassandra anti-pattern" href="http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/cassandra-anti-patterns-queues-and-queue-like-datasets" target="_blank">Queue-like</a> which turns out to be a anti-pattern. We then denormalized our data and also changed to <a href="http://www.datastax.com/documentation/cql/3.1/cql/cql_reference/tabProp.html?scroll=tabProp__moreCompaction" target="_blank">LeveledCompactionStrategy</a> as well as we set <strong>durable_writes</strong> to false, since we could treat our live stream as ephemeral data.</p>
<blockquote><p>Finally, but most importantly, since we knew the maximum size a playlist could have, we could specify the start column (filtering with id &gt; minTimeuuid(now – playlist_duration)). This really mitigated the effect of tombstones for reads. After these changes, we were able to achieve a <strong>latency in the order of 10ms</strong> for our 99% percentile.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>tip</strong>: limit your queries + denormalize your data&nbsp;+ <a href="http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/pluggable-metrics-reporting-in-cassandra-2-0-2" target="_blank">send instrumentation data to graphite</a> + use SSD.</p>

<p>With all the data and meta-data we could build the HLS manifest and serve the video chunks.&nbsp;The only thing we were struggling was that we didn’t want to add an extra server to fetch and build the manifests.</p>
<p>Since&nbsp;we already had&nbsp;invested a lot of effort into&nbsp;<a title="nginx + lua" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/pushing-nginx-to-its-limit-with-lua/" target="_blank">Nginx+Lua</a>, we thought it could be possible to use lua to fetch and build the manifest. It was a matter of building a <a title="cassandra lua driver" href="https://github.com/jbochi/lua-resty-cassandra" target="_blank">lua driver for Cassandra</a> and use it. One good thing about this approach (rebuilding the manifest) was that in the end we realized that we were almost ready to serve <a title="dash" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP" target="_blank">DASH</a>.</p>
<p><strong>tip</strong>: <a title="busted" href="https://github.com/Olivine-Labs/busted" target="_blank">test your lua scripts</a> + check the&nbsp;lua global vars + <a title="cache stale" href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_cache_use_stale" target="_blank">double check your caching&nbsp;config</a></p>

<p>In order to provide a better experience, we chose to build <a title="brief explanation about clappr" href="http://blog.flavioribeiro.com/clappr-an-extensible-media-player-for-the-web/" target="_blank">Clappr</a>, an extensible open-source HTML5 video player. With Clappr – and a few custom extensions like PiP (Picture In Picture) and Multi-angle replays – we were able to deliver a great experience to our users. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.flavioribeiro.com/content/images/2014/Nov/06_player_multicamera-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>tip</strong>: open source it from day 0 + follow to flow issue&nbsp;-&gt; commit FIX#123</p>

<p>To keep an eye over all these system, we built a monitoring dashboard using&nbsp;mostly open source projects like: logstash, elastic search, graphite, graphana, kibana, seyren, angular, mongo, redis, rails and many others. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/image.slidesharecdn.com/fisl15-streamingdevideoaovivonaglobo-140509123535-phpapp01/95/fisl15-streaming-de-video-ao-vivo-na-globocom-22-638.jpg" alt="" width="638" height="359"></p>
<p><strong>tip</strong>: use SSD for graphite and elasticsearch</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-layout-label="Post Body" data-type="item" id="item-5ef7bc76e6aaf04d0e009f94"><div><div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-af03afdb075005d5c151"><div><p>Like many software engineers in the industry, I don't have a Computer Science degree.
I spent my college years in music school, doing an undergraduate degree in jazz guitar performance and most of a graduate degree in music technology.
I've had the conversation about how music is like software a few times, and recently <a href="https://twitter.com/CatMcGeeCode/status/1272097365764300802?s=20">this tweet</a> got me reflecting about the things I apply in my technology career that I learned in music school.
While I might not have gone on to be a professional musician, it turns out that music school taught me many things that I still find valuable today.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on the (important) fundamentals</strong></p>
<p>Few classes in the traditional music school curriculum are as polarizing as the pair of music theory and ear training.
In a music theory class, you study the structural underpinnings of what most people refer to as Classical Music¹, and ear training is where you teach your brain to put names to the sounds that your ears hear.
I personally loved music theory and wasn't fond of ear training, and in hindsight I should have worked harder on the latter and less on the former.
Music theory tickled the same part of my brain that programming does because it's all about breaking down structures into understandable units, giving names to abstract concepts, categorization, and analysis.
In short, it's a puzzle, and it almost certainly didn't make me a better musician².
At no point when creating improvised music do you have time to think "haha, I know, I'll use an altered dominant chord here, that'll be great," and if you do you're likely not listening to the people you're playing with very closely.
Instead, you hear a sound in your head, and at the best of times your brain knows exactly how to translate that into notes on your instrument.
As you probably guessed, the class that teaches that is the one that I wasn't particularly fond of.</p>
<p>There's a similar split in usefulness when dealing with the fundamentals of programming and Compute Science.
Is it important that the average programmer can rattle off the finer points of Von Neumman architecture?
Probably not.
But it's infinitely useful to be able to pattern match problems against known-good patterns for solving them.
If I can see that a problem models well as a finite state machine in a funny hat, then a good portion of solving the problem is already done for me.
The useful fundamentals are the ones that build your ability to pattern match a problem against a solution.</p>
<p><strong>Practice what you don't know</strong></p>
<p>There's a not-so-fine line between practicing and playing what you already know is going to sound good on your instrument.
The former involves meticulously working on making new musical concepts familiar, and the latter generally sounds good.
"Noodling" on one's instrument is fun, but it's not likely to make you much better³.
In contrast, practicing new songs, scales, etc. will almost certainly make you a better musician overall.
It will just as certainly sound terrible until you've worked on it for far longer than is likely comfortable.
A little-known fact about being a professional musician is that you spend most of it sounding terrible in private so that you sound good in public.</p>
<p>There's a particular type of musician⁴ who spends all of their time running scales that they already know at faster and faster speeds.
When they play on stage you can tell what they've practiced, because their music consists of scales played really really fast.
There's a certain physicality to that that's impressive, but I've never particularly found it musically interesting.
Likewise, if I spend my career going company to company building the same application, I'm likely not to grow much as an engineer after a certain point.
It's totally reasonable to become a master at building a particular kind of thing, and I'd never begrudge anyone the economic security that can come with being able to build something that companies need really fast because you've done it a hundred times, but it's important to recognize that that's likely <em>not</em> a path towards building one's technical chops.
If you want to get better, sometimes you have to do something new.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to others</strong></p>
<p>One of the things I look back on most fondly about music school is its culture of sharing influences.
A frequent topic of conversation is what you and your friends are listening to, and what ideas you're taking from them.
The best musicians I know take in a wide variety of influences and find things to appreciate about music they don't necessarily like.
Most programmers--myself included--could stand to do more of that.
Explore outside of your own ecosystem, and if you find yourself less-than-enamored with a language or tool, try to find some good ideas in it.</p>
<p><strong>Learn your history</strong></p>
<p>From talking with people who have done them, one thing that music school does better than CS programs is the study of the history of the field⁵.
Every music school student is required to take a certain number of music history courses, and composition students--the Enterprise Architects of the music world--generally have a pretty firm understanding of when they're being imitative vs innovative.
And even in the most basic history classes--the kind that non-majors take when they think it's going to be an easy elective, not realizing that the tests are basically a game of music trivia where you've just heard all of the songs for the first time this week--there's at least an attempt to contextualize innovation even if it sounds old to us now.</p>
<p>I took a history of opera class as a sophomore, and at no point was Verdi referred to as "legacy" or "deprecated"⁶.
Contrast that with how history is viewed in tech, if it's learned at all.
Chapters in a history book written by the comments sections of popular tech industry sites would contain passages like "HTTP was originally developed by Tim Berners Lee at CERN in 1989, but no one uses that anymore because Google came out with gRPC and it's much more performant."
Taking the time to learn and contextualize the history of programming languages and tools will almost always make you better at assessing new technologies and techniques.</p>
<p><strong>There's no substitute for learning from an expert</strong></p>
<p>I was mostly a self taught guitar player until my first semester of music school, and I'm pretty sure that I improved more in those first few months than at any other point.
Experts who are good teachers will be able to watch you play and pick out the one thing that you need to do right now to improve, and then give you a bunch of other things to work on that will keep you improving for months.
You can teach yourself a lot of things, both in music and in programming, but there's no substitute for sitting down one on one with an expert and learning from them, even if you don't do it regularly.</p>
<p>If you have the chance to pair program with an expert, do it, and ask for feedback.
One of the best pairing experiences that I've ever had was with my former colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/jmileham">John Mileham</a>, who at the time was the head of architecture and interim lead of the security team at the company that we worked for.
He was working on some security code written in Go, and because I had a burgeoning interest in the language he was nice enough to invite me to pair on it together.
I was "driving", and after we implemented the feature I went through my normal process of interactively adding chunks to the git diff with <code>git add -p</code>.
After I added the second or third diff, he stopped me and said something to the effect of "Can I make an observation? You go way too fast when you code."
It was feedback that I'd never received before, and it was exactly what I needed to hear to get better.
I'd gotten to the point where I was a relatively competent programmer, but made mistakes often enough because I didn't slow down to consider code before committing it, and nobody had sat with me to watch me code so it just seemed like I was careless.
If I hadn't gotten that one on one time with an expert, I likely would have kept making the same mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>Teaching others makes you better</strong></p>
<p>One of the hardest things I've ever tried to do is teach the difference between major and minor to a child learning to play the guitar.
While programming as a career tends to be a fairly applied discipline, its foundations are largely mathematical, and that shows when you're able to explain things with relatively precise language without too many exceptions.
In contrast, major and minor are labels that were applied to patterns of sounds long after they were in common use, and as such basically every explanation has some sort of exception to it.
Major is happy, except that "happy" isn't really a universal reaction, and some "major modes" are more "floaty" or "bluesy," and the sound of a chord is all contextual anyway so major after minor might be interpreted as "triumphant" or "ironic" instead of happy, and so on.
Every explanation besides the technical one is squishy and filled with squishy exceptions, and the technical one is both likely to be uninteresting to a child--and most adults--and won't help them be a better musician.</p>
<p>Having to come up with these explanations gave me a much better understanding of the thing I was explaining, and the same is true of programming.
When you learn something, one of the barometers for how well you've learned it is how well you can teach it to others.
If you really want to learn something well, schedule a talk about it some number of weeks in the future.
It doesn't have to be a high-stakes speaking engagement; a lunch and learn with your team arguably works better.
During the course of practicing your talk, act out audience questions and regularly check in with yourself as to whether you're parroting phrases or really understand them.
By the time you give your talk, you'll either know the topic well, or be able to identify where you need more study.</p>
<p><strong>Know your audience</strong></p>
<p>Ask any working musician to play a "wedding gig," and they'll know exactly what you mean: show up early, dress nicely, …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  <p>Deno is a JavaScript/TypeScript runtime with security by default. Deno tends to substitute Node.js with a simpler, modern, and more secure runtime.</p>
<p>Deno is built on V8, Rust, and <a href="https://tokio.rs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Tokio homepage">Tokio</a>, a Rust asynchronous runtime environment. It aims to be a productive and secure scripting environment for the modern world of programming, Deno is for you!</p>
<p>If you want to learn Deno you are in the right section.</p>
<p>Our Deno tutorial is designed for simplicity. We also have tons of examples to get you in the game.</p>
<h2>Deno Example Code</h2>
<pre><code>function generateRandom(max_number) {
  return Math.ceil(Math.random() * max_number);
}

console.log(generateRandom(5));</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://lyty.dev/diy/deno-typescript-random-number-example.html" target="_blank"><i>launch</i>&nbsp; Do It Yourself</a></p>
<h2>What Can Deno Do?</h2>
<p>Deno is a JavaScript/TypeScript runtime environment, this means that you can use Deno to process server-side actions by writing JavaScript or TypeScript. Think of anything that other server-side programming languages can do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Deno can <strong>serve</strong> web pages dynamically (like PHP, NodeJS, ASP, and other server-side languages).</li>
<li>Deno can <strong>create</strong>, <strong>open</strong>, <strong>read</strong>, <strong>write</strong>, <strong>delete</strong>, and <strong>close</strong> files on the server</li>
<li>Deno can be used to <strong>build</strong> command-line based applications</li>
<li>Deno can <strong>interact</strong> with any kind of database</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Use Deno?</h2>
<p>Think of anything other server-side programming languages can do, then think <strong>security</strong>, <strong>simplicity</strong>, and <strong>modernization </strong>with Deno.</p>
<ul>
<li>Security by default. No file, network, or environment access (unless explicitly enabled).</li>
<li>It is a TypeScript runtime, which means it supports TypeScript out of the box.</li>
<li>Comes with a single executable (<code>deno</code>).</li>
<li>Ships with built-in tools that make code inspection and formatting easy,&nbsp; the <code>deno info</code> and <code>deno fmt</code>.</li>
<li>You can bundle scripts into a single JavaScript file and more.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who Can Learn Deno?</h2>
<p>Deno can be learned by anyone, provided that you have the basic knowledge of <strong>JavaScript </strong>especially about <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>.</p>
<h2>Comparisons to Node.js</h2>
<div><table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Deno</td>
<td>NodeJS</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No package manager. Uses modules referenced as URLs or file paths</td>
<td>Has a package manager called <code>npm</code></td>
</tr>

            <p>OSLO, NORWAY -- 
	Norway began work on Friday to excavate the first Viking ship to be unearthed in the country in more than a century, with experts hoping it will shed light on the era of the Nordic seafarers.</p>
<p>
	Ground-penetrating radar detected the ancient vessel, buried about 50cm below ground in a mound covering a burial site, in 2018 in the south east near the Swedish border.</p>
<p>
	Initial observations suggested the remains were in very bad shape, forcing the authorities to launch excavations quickly before the ship was completely degraded.</p>
<p>
	Only three well-preserved Viking ships have been found in Norway, the last excavation dating back to 1904. All three are now on display in a museum near Oslo.</p>
<p>
	"With so few ships discovered, a new Viking ship will have a great impact on understanding the ships themselves, but also provide valuable information to understand the historical era as a whole," said archaeologist Knut Paasche of the Norwegian Institute for Cultural Heritage Research.</p>
<p>
	Viking warriors and merchants who sailed the seas between the eighth and eleventh centuries often buried kings and dignitaries with ships hoisted ashore.</p>
<p>
	"The Gjellestad ship is a discovery of outstanding national and international importance," said Culture Minister Sveinung Rotevatn.</p>
<p>
	The excavation is expected to last five months.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>It's a bit of a counterpoint.</p><p>I am a tech entrepreneur. I am supposed to dream Hypergrowth.</p><p>But lately, disturbed as I am with 2020 itself, I started to think - why are things the way they are. </p><h2 id="two-types-of-companies">Two Types of Companies</h2><p>There are two types of companies. Those that are designed to create wealth for founders and employees, and the others designed to create wealth for a Fund. Don't get me wrong - most companies end up doing neither - and some will do both. But every company is <em>designed</em> to do ONE and ONLY ONE of those things.</p><p>This is not just my opinion.</p><p>Paul Graham wrote in "Startup = Growth" that a startup is a company <em>designed</em> to grow very fast. One question to ask is - to what destination exactly? And why should a company <em>want</em> to grow so fast?</p><p>Let's try to unpack Hypergrowth. And let's borrow the framework from Daniel Kahneman, to do so.</p><h2 id="hypergrowth-tickles-the-market-s-fast-thinking-brain">Hypergrowth Tickles the Market's Fast Thinking Brain</h2><p>Hypergrowth is the business equivalent of your fast brain - the market reacts as if by instinct. Growing &nbsp;fast helps the company cover a good market share before competitors take note and 'copy-cats' come into the picture. Growing fast leads to a new behaviour (or a slight modification in the old one) getting adopted by a very large number of people, in a pretty short time. </p><h3 id="just-f-g-download-the-app-stop-thinking">Just F*****G Download The App, Stop Thinking</h3><p>The slow brain of the market would pause, think, analyse, and might decide NOT to adopt the new behaviour. It might ask questions about privacy, addiction, security, safety, life ... the fast brain of the market does not analyse. </p><p>It jumps instinctively to the shiny new app because it's trendy to do so. From a business perspective, you do not want the market to critique what you have built, you want them to adopt it.</p><p>What happens when the slow brain does kick in and start asking questions later? By that time, the behaviour is so well set, that it is hard to break. So it is likely to stick. Think about people criticising, and then using Facebook. As if they're addicted.</p><blockquote>Without hypergrowth and it's related behavioural sciences, we would still have Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp, but probably with lesser adoption, and in slightly different avatars.</blockquote><h2 id="hypergrowth-leads-to-winner-take-all-markets">Hypergrowth Leads to Winner Take All Markets</h2><p>Another thing that hypergrowth helps do is make money. To understand what speed has got to do with capital, we need to understand <em>Extrapolation</em>.</p><p>We love to extrapolate. From debates about race, to forest fires to climate change - everywhere you can see this happening. An easy way to detect careless extrapolation is the phrase "at this rate ... X will happen" - assuming that "the rate" is a universal constant.</p><p>We love extrapolation so much, that with took this word and created a special symbol to represent it. And then we made it the most important symbol of modern times. That symbol, of course is "@" or "at the rate of.." . Yeah yeah. I know, it was meant for some other purpose - but even in the old definition, the rate is implied to be a constant - even if for a small duration. But I digress.</p><p>So extrapolation.</p><p>This is how it works - you grow fast - say 8x a year. That growth 'activates' a multiplier to your valuation in the private markets. That multiplier is super handy because as larger and larger funds get in on the action, smaller investors are able to exit at a profit.</p><p>And it's all great except for one thing - it creates Winner Take All markets.</p><h3 id="stop-minding-your-business-and-come-work-for-me">Stop Minding Your Business and Come Work For Me</h3><p>Hypergrowth, when adopted at large scale, creates 'Winner Take All' markets. In these markets, every small company that does something similar to the big guy, tends to die out. This leads to a large number of people, who were literally minding their own businesses, to crash, burn and work for the large corporations. </p><p>Do a few cycles of this, over a few decades, and you get an economy that is seriously debt ridden, afraid that even the remaining jobs will be taken away in the name of innovation. This society responds with mass scale knee-jerk reactions, even if for the right causes. This society gets divided into "Heroes" and "Zeroes". And when there are enough Zeroes and they are unhappy enough, it's easy for chaos to ensue. An incompetent leadership is just an icing on the cake.</p><blockquote><strong>This society responds with mass scale knee-jerk reactions, even if for the right causes. This society gets divided into "Heroes" and "Zeroes". And when there are enough Zeroes and they are unhappy enough, it's easy for chaos to ensue. An incompetent leadership is just the icing on the cake.</strong></blockquote><h2 id="hypergrowth-einstein-works-3-jobs">Hypergrowth = Einstein Works 3 Jobs</h2><p>Hypergrowth is a great concept, intellectually. But, if it is force fed to a society, it kills innovation. Because in these economies, Einstein does not work at a Patent Office. He works 3 jobs to pay his debts, and never has a moment to think about "light, energy and matter".</p><p>Other than large scale internet companies helping us take selfies, we haven't innovated much. The situation is so bad that it takes a crazy right wing billionaire (another one of my heroes) to build a battery powered car mainstream. Ford built his MVP in a f****ing garage.</p><h3 id="a-world-without-winner-take-all-markets">A World Without Winner Take All Markets</h3><p>There isn't a quick fix solution to this. But if fixed, here's what the world would look like.</p><p>There would be 10-15 Facebooks, for different niches. Most subreddits would be dedicated communities, and companies, of their own. Most markets won't be winner take all. There will be way way way more entrepreneurs than today - mostly small, and mostly "businesspeople" not innovative. Lesser debt, more healthcare. Less stress, more time. Less "me too" disruption, more real innovation. &nbsp;Less noise, more signal. But also, way lesser companies for VCs to invest in, way lesser organised Funds, way lesser ways for rich people to invest in and make even more money.</p><p>Consequently, many smart people will fill these gaps, start new funds. Invest in "me too disruptive" companies. And in a few decades, the world will be back to "let's grow fast".</p><p>But in those decades, Einstein would happen, again.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div>

      <h2>Why I joined Coiled</h2>

      <p>I recently joined <a href="https://coiled.io/">Coiled</a> as Head of Data Science Evangelism and Marketing. In this post, I’ll tell you why.</p>

<h2 id="a-bit-about-me">A bit about me</h2>

<p><em>I am restlessly interested in promoting data literacy, broadening access to computation, and lowering barriers to data tooling.</em></p>

<p>To understand why I joined Coiled, a company that builds products and provides support for data scientists and teams working in Python with data at scale, it’s worth providing some context on who I am, where I’ve been, and what I do. Most recently, I worked at DataCamp, an EdTech company whose mission is to democratize data science education. An early employee there, I built out the foundational Python data science curriculum and wore other hats in marketing, product, data science and analytics, evangelism, and professional services. Prior to this, I worked in academic research (cell biology, applied mathematics, biophysics) at Yale University and the Max Planck Institute for Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, where I also taught workshops on Practical Data Science for Researchers. I am restlessly interested in promoting both data and computational literacy, reducing “computational anxiety,” lowering barriers to data tooling, and increasing both the adoption and development of open-source software (OSS).</p>

<h2 id="a-bit-about-coiled">A bit about Coiled</h2>

<p>Coiled is a company born from the open-source ecosystem to meet the increasing needs of teams, organizations, and the enterprise to use OSS. For data scientists, analysts, and engineers using Python at scale, the package <a href="https://coiled.io/blog/dask.org/">Dask</a> (which “provides advanced parallelism for analytics, enabling performance at scale for the tools you love”) is an attractive option but doesn’t meet the growing needs of teams and the enterprise. <a href="https://coiled.io/blog/hello-world.html">This is why we founded Coiled earlier this year</a>: to build products to meet those pressing needs.</p>

<p>So, then, why did I join Coiled? To answer this, I think it’s key to answer a set of sub-questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Why a company based around open-source software?</li>
  <li>Why a Python company?</li>
  <li>Why a seed stage startup?</li>
  <li>Why evangelism and marketing?</li>
  <li>Why Coiled?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="why-a-company-based-around-open-source-software">Why a company based around open-source software?</h2>
<p><em>I’m excited to play a part in the next level of OSS adoption around the world, both in academic research and industry.</em></p>
<p>
<img src="https://coiled.io/images/black-hole-katie-bouman.jpg" width="50%">
</p>
<p> <span size="-1">Dr Katie Bouman with the Event Horizon Telescope  <br> team's first ever image of a black hole, the creation  of <br> which  used the OSS PyData stack (look closely, it's matplotlib!) </span> </p>

<p>It is unquestionable that open-source software and tooling have changed the nature of business, academic research, and data science. I came of age in academic research at a time when there was a serious shift in moving away from proprietary software, such as MATLAB and Mathematica, to tools such as Python and R. The collaborative, open, and transparent nature of OSS, when done correctly, results in software that meets individual end-user needs and software that evolves as these needs evolve. As Eric Raymond notes in his seminal essay <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">The Cathedral and the Bazaar</a>, “given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.” This OSS mantra was named Linus’ Law in honor of Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux. The eponymous “Cathedral” refers to software with development cycles restricted to exclusive groups and  “Bazaar” to software developed in public view. Moreover, as <a href="https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/fernando-p%C3%A9rez">Fernando Perez</a>, creator of IPython and co-lead of Project Jupyter, stated in his keynote at the inaugural JupyterCon,</p>

<p><em>If science is about opening up the black box of nature, we shouldn’t be doing science with tools that we are not legally allowed to open up and understand.</em></p>

<p>It was the burgeoning impact of the open-source on data work of all kinds that led me to join DataCamp in early 2016 to build out their foundational and scalable Pythonic data science curriculum.</p>

<p>There are at least two related challenges in the OSS space:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The need for sustainable sources of funding for open-source software development;</li>
  <li>OSS meets the needs of individual end users, but cannot always meet those of teams, organization, and the enterprise.</li>
</ol>

<p>With respect to the second point, it’s key to note that, as <a href="https://physics.calpoly.edu/bgranger">Brian Granger</a>, co-lead of Project Jupyter, <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast/project-jupyter-interactive-computing">has stated</a>,</p>

<p><em>Open-source software is undergoing a phase transition from having individual users in organizations to having large scale institutional adoption.</em></p>

<p>Here are some examples across several verticals:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/">LIGO</a>’s discovery of gravitational waves in 2016 used <a href="https://www.gw-openscience.org/tutorials/">many OSS tools from the PyData ecosystem</a>;</li>
  <li>JP Morgan’s trading platform Athena contains <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/jpmorgans-athena-has-35-million-lines-of-python-code-and-wont-be-updated-to-python-3-in-time/">35 million lines of Python code</a>;</li>
  <li>Walmart uses Python, Dask, and XGBoost (a popular machine learning framework) to “<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/07/11/walmart-nvidia/">tear through their massive-scale data analytics and machine learning</a>”;</li>
  <li>Netflix <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/notebook-innovation-591ee3221233">runs over 150,000 batch Jupyter notebook jobs a day</a>;</li>
  <li><a href="https://opensource.t-mobile.com/blog/posts/r-tensorflow-api/">T-Mobile uses R and TensorFlow</a> to deploy machine learning models with the aim of  building conversational AI to improve the customer experience;</li>
  <li>The Event Horizon Telescope team used the OSS PyData stack <a href="https://numfocus.org/case-studies/first-photograph-black-hole">to create the first ever image of a black hole</a>!</li>
</ul>

<p>However, OSS is not always organization or enterprise ready, nor should it be. In the gap between OSS and the enterprise, we find the need for companies such as Coiled. This is why <a href="https://coiled.io/blog/founding.html">we built it</a>: to help Dask meet the needs of modern teams doing data science at scale. These needs include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data analysts, scientists, and engineers being able to have one-click hosted cloud deployments and seamless integration between their local workstation configurations and their at-scale data work on cloud clusters;</li>
  <li>Data team leads having insight into data infrastructure usage and spend across their team and the larger organization;</li>
  <li>IT requirements for security and authentication.</li>
</ul>

<p>Without companies that build products and provide support for organizations to use OSS, there will simply be less adoption of OSS. I joined Coiled because I’m excited to play a part in the next level of OSS adoption around the world, both in academic research and industry.</p>

<h2 id="why-a-python-company">Why a Python company?</h2>
<p><em>Data Science, impact, and community.</em></p>

<p>The reasons for joining a company in the Python ecosystem are simple: data scientist needs, impact, and community. Dave Robinson’s 2017 post <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/"><em>The Incredible Growth of Python</em></a> made it clear, if it wasn’t before, that Python was growing… well… in an incredible fashion… and it still is (you can play around with <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends">Stack Overflow Trends</a> to see this yourself). There is simply a huge amount of demand for companies built around the PyData stack and, as a Pythonista, I’m in a position where I hope to have impact by meeting those needs, which I predict will only increase over the coming years.</p>

<p>
<img src="https://coiled.io/images/stack-python-growth.png" width="75%">
</p>


<p>The other reason for joining a Pythonic company is the PyData community, many of whom I’ve enjoyed working with over the years and many of whom I consider friends and mentors. In many ways, the PyData community feels like family and gives me a sense of a home away from home. PyData conferences are some of my favorite conferences to go to, as is SciPy (and there’s also something about Austin in the summertime!). Anybody who tuned in to DataFramed, the DataCamp podcast I hosted, would have noticed a recurring emphasis on the PyData community and its impact (among other patterns, of course), including early interviews with <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast/data-science-astronomy">Jake VanderPlas</a> and <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast/data-science-nuclear-engineering">Katy Huff</a>, <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast/data-security-privacy-gdpr">conversations</a> with <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast/Data-Privacy-Age-of-COVID-19">Katharine Jarmul</a>, and interviews with PyData tool creators and builders <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast/data-science-tool-building">Wes McKinney</a> (pandas), <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast/credibility-crisis-in-data-science">Skipper Seabold</a> (statsmodels), and <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast/project-jupyter-interactive-computing">Brian Granger</a> (Project Jupyter). It is also worth mentioning how important academic research and educational communities, where I feel at home due to my research background, have been to the PyData stack, which has largely grown out of academia in the past (there is now much more diverse organizational coverage).</p>

<h2 id="why-a-seed-stage-startup">Why a seed stage startup?</h2>
<p><em>Leadership, learning, and a bias for getting things done.</em></p>

<p>There are 2 major reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I love the hustle and bustle, the do-what-needs-to-be-done, the problem-solving, and bias-for-action that’s required at smaller companies, and the necessary learning that then occurs;</li>
  <li>I am excited to be end-responsible for a business function and look forward to growing into a leadership position as we scale Coiled.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are so many examples of early-stage startup problem-solving and bias-for-action that I love but one stands out:</p>

<p><em>When I started at DataCamp, my mandate was to build out as many high quality Pythonic data science courses as possible. Company leadership told me that collaborations with RStudio had been successful on the R curriculum side and asked me who the RStudio of PythonLand was. I told them it was Continuum Analytics, now Anaconda Inc., although there were key distinctions between them. We had breakfast early one morning with Peter Wang, then CTO of Continuum, in Cambridge, MA. Peter seemed to really dig the product and introduced us to Travis Oliphant, then CEO of Continuum. We had some great calls with Travis but, in order to get 4+ courses on the roadmap with Continuum, we needed to get in the same room. So one Friday afternoon in mid-June of 2016, I called my CEO and said, “why don’t we just fly to Austin on Sunday and pop into the Continuum office on Monday to say hi?” He loved the idea but rightly suggested that I email Travis to let him know we were planning to visit. Travis replied generously, as always, that he’d be happy to see us but he may not have a lot of time as it was his birthday! En route to the Continuum office on West 6th St in downtown Austin, I decided to swing by a great hot sauce shop (with the great name <a href="https://www.tearsofjoysauces.com/">Tears of Joy</a>) and bought Travis a birthday hamper of hot sauces and salsas. Travis spent hours with us that day, talking shop, both business and technical, and took us to an early dinner before joining his family for his own birthday dinner. Two days later, as we were in a taxi heading for Austin Bergstrom Airport, we received a signed contract from Travis for our first 4 collaborative courses …</em></p></div></div></div>

<p>Nearly two dozen African nations are now committed to build and maintain the “Great Green Wall,” a chain of forests and woodlands spreading across the entire continent at the southern edge of the Sahara Desert, in the region known as the Sahel. Initially launched in 2007 by 11 countries, the initiative has now been joined by ten more. It is considered the world’s largest ecosystem restoration project by the <a href="https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/worlds-biggest-ecosystem-restoration-project" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">UN Environment Programme<span></span></a>.</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>The project aims to address many of the continent’s core challenges at once. Most directly, it provides a physical barrier to ward off the spread of the Sahara. The Sahara has been moving gradually south for millennia, encroaching on and disrupting local livelihoods. However <a href="https://kindling.xyz/tag/climate-change/" data-wpel-link="internal">climate change</a> has accelerated this process, creating a major economic and environmental threat to the nations of the Sahel, many of which are already among the world’s poorest and least developed. </p>

<p>The wall will reclaim 247 million acres of land by the year 2030, which can then be used for more economically productive purposes like agriculture and livestock. More trees will result in more rainfall being diverted back into the land, and therefore more water available to communities and ecosystems. The new trees will capture around <a href="https://time.com/5669033/great-green-wall-africa/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">250 million metric tons of carbon ever year<span></span></a>, roughly equivalent to removing all of California’s cars from the road for more than three year. The process of planting and maintaining the wall will also create hundreds of thousands of jobs over the course of the next several years.</p>
<p>It’s a win-win-win-win!</p>
<p>The effort is estimated to cost $8 billion USD and be completed by 2030. It is currently about 15% complete.</p>
<p>I love projects like these. They just make so much sense. They provide incredible economic bang for their buck, ensuring the <a href="https://kindling.xyz/tag/sustainability/" data-wpel-link="internal">sustainability</a> of livelihoods for decades, while also employing people in the process and offering a critical solution to the <a href="https://kindling.xyz/tag/climate-crisis/" data-wpel-link="internal">climate crisis</a>. But more than that, they demonstrate the importance and viability of international cooperation at a time when nearly all of humanity’s deepest challenges are trans-boundary, requiring us to collaborate with one another, even to re-envision ourselves as all part of the same team.</p>
<p>What other major development projects might we be able to make a reality if more countries acknowledged their shared challenges and pooled their resources together toward a common goal?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The language of mathematics is distinct from natural languages in that it aims to communicate abstract, logical ideas with precision and unambiguity. As a result, it is equipped with a system of specialized <strong><a aria-label="symbols (opens in a new tab)" href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">symbols</a></strong> and <strong>vocabularies</strong> — each with its own level of generality and formality.</p><p>Among these, there’s a particular subset of terms that is uniquely foundational and appropriate to our pursuit: the <strong>higher mathematical jargon</strong>. Loosely speaking, these are a set of specialized terms that fall into most — if not all — of the following categories:</p><ul><li>Specific to <strong>higher mathematics</strong></li><li><strong>English-looking</strong> (with a near-technical meaning)</li><li><strong>Frequently-occurring</strong></li><li><strong>Cross-disciplinary</strong> (i.e., not field-specific)</li></ul><p>In brief, these are terms that are generally accessible to most, yet still provide us with a glimpse of the world of non-miniaturized mathematics — and the way their practitioners act and think.

And since such arguments are often highly abstract and long-winded by nature, they are also alternatively referred to as “<strong>general abstract nonsense</strong>” or “<strong>generalized abstract nonsense</strong>“.</p><h2 id="aon"><a href="#toc">Abuse of notation</a></h2><p>The act of inadvertently or deliberately using notations in a way that’s not entirely<strong> syntactically correct</strong> — but which simplifies the exposition and makes the passage easier to understand. For example, one might say that:</p><ul><li>“$\mathbb{R}$ is distributive” — rather than “$(\mathbb{R}, +, \times)$ is distributive.”</li><li>“$3$ is differentiable” — rather than “the function defined by the rule $x \mapsto 3$ for all real $x$, is differentiable.”</li><li>“$a+b+c = c+b+a$” — rather than “$(a+b) + c = (c+b) + a$”.</li></ul><p>In the cases where the context and the assumptions are made clear and well understood, abuses of notation are usually harmless (if not actually desirable). In other cases, however, the same might not be true, and can amount to a <strong>misuse of notation</strong> — which is a faux-pas in mathematics (such as the case of $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=\frac{y}{x}$).</p><h2 id="algo"><a href="#toc">Algorithm</a></h2><p>A finite series of <a href="#welldefined">well-defined</a>, <strong>computer-implementable instructions</strong> to solve a specific set of computable problems. It takes a finite amount of initial input(s), processes them unambiguously at each operation, before returning its outputs within a finite amount of time. Some examples of algorithm in mathematics include:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Euclidean algorithm</strong> (for finding the greatest common factor of two natural numbers)</li><li><a href="https://mathvault.ca/long-division">The <strong>long division algorithm</strong> (and its variants)</a></li><li>The <strong>simplex algorithm</strong> (for finding the optimal solution under a set of linear constraints)</li></ul><p>In essence, algorithms are created to streamline the solution-finding process for a specific set of problems, though it can also remove the necessity of thinking and understanding in the process. For a a series of instructions that are quasi-algorithmic and broader in nature, the term “<strong>general procedure</strong>” is sometimes used (which, like an algorithm, could also involve some element of <a href="#heuristics">heuristics</a> or <a href="#recursion">recursion</a>).</p><h2 id="almost"><a href="#toc">Almost</a></h2><div id="attachment_18414"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18414" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Dart-and-Board.png" alt="Dart and Board" width="225" height="225" srcset="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Dart-and-Board.png 225w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Dart-and-Board-150x150.png 150w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Dart-and-Board-100x100.png 100w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Dart-and-Board-220x220.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" title="Dart and Board" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20225%20225'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Dart-and-Board.png 225w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Dart-and-Board-150x150.png 150w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Dart-and-Board-100x100.png 100w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Dart-and-Board-220x220.png 220w" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Dart-and-Board.png"></p><p id="caption-attachment-18414">Since the actual circumference of the board has area 0, the probability of hitting it is also 0 as well (i.e., almost never).</p></div><p>A handy adverb similar to its usage in English, but can take on specific meanings depending on the context. For example:</p><ul><li>“<strong>Almost all</strong> elements in a set” usually means “all but a finite/countable amount of negligible elements in the set.”</li><li>“<strong>Almost no</strong> integer” usually means “only a finite subset of integers.”</li><li>“A property holds <strong>almost everywhere</strong> (in a measure space)” usually means “everywhere in a set except a subset of<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MeasureZero.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> measure zero</a>.”</li><li>“An event occurs <strong>almost surely</strong>” usually means that “the event has a probability of 1, even though it does not include all of the possible outcomes.”</li><li>“An event occurs <strong>almost never</strong>” usually means that “the event has a probability of 0, even though it does contain some of the possible outcomes.”</li></ul><p>Here, notice that “almost” doesn’t necessarily mean that the <strong>exceptional cases</strong> are “small”, and hence one is perfectly well-justified in making claims such as “almost all real numbers are transcendental” — or that “the dart almost never lands on the circumference of the board.”</p><h2 id="ansatz"><a href="#toc">Ansatz</a></h2><p>A term of German origin meaning “initial placement of a tool at a work piece” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansatz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>), and is used in mathematics to refer to the initial, additional <strong>mathematical assumptions</strong> made to kick start the problem solving process — but which are later confirmed to be parts of the actual solution as well. Some examples of ansatz in mathematics include:</p><ul><li>The adoption of linear regression model to fit the data points (i.e., <strong>linear ansatz</strong>)</li><li>The assumption that the solutions to a differential/recurrent equation take an exponential form (<strong>exponential ansatz</strong>)</li><li>The assumption that the solution to a system of linear equations is expressible in terms of a particular vector (<strong>ansatz of particular solution</strong>).</li></ul><p>Metaphorically speaking, the use of ansatz can be liken to drawing a picture by first establishing a <strong>framework</strong>, in that if it succeeds, then the framework can be reused as an ansatz later on, but if it doesn’t, then it’s usually discarded and marked as an instance of failure.</p><h2 id="arbitrarily"><a href="#toc">Arbitrarily</a></h2><p>An adverb attached to a mathematical adjective X to make clear that something is “<strong>X with little limitation or restraint</strong>.” For example:</p><ul><li>An <strong>arbitrarily large</strong> function is a function capable of assuming values larger than any fixed choice of real number — regardless of the size of the latter.</li><li>An <strong>arbitrarily small</strong> positive sequence is a sequence capable of assuming values smaller than any fixed choice of positive real number — regardless of the “tininess” of the latter.</li><li>An <strong>arbitrarily long</strong> progression is a progression whose number of members can be made to exceed than any choice of natural number — regardless the size of the latter.</li></ul><p>In general, “arbitrarily” is a foundational term in number theory and mathematical analysis, and can also occur in other topics where some form of <strong>degree</strong> and <strong>ordering</strong> are involved (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">polynomial ring</a>).</p><div><p><strong>Caution</strong></p><p>Don’t make the mistake in assuming that “arbitrarily” means “infinitely”! If anything, “arbitrarily” usually carries a sense of being “without bound within the finite realm.”</p></div><h2 id="arbitrary"><a href="#toc">Arbitrary</a></h2><p>An adjective used to refer to a choice made without any specific criterion or restraint (e.g., arbitrary integer, arbitrary division of a set, arbitrary permutation of a sequence). It corresponds to the term “<strong>any</strong>” and the <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/logic-symbols/#Quantifiers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">logical quantifier</a> $\forall$, and hints at an element of generality in the phrase where it’s found (e.g., statement $P$ holds for an arbitrary $n \in \mathbb{N}$).&nbsp;</p><div id=""><p>Arbitrary vs. Random</p><p>While “random” and “arbitrary” are often used interchangeably in informal discourses, in mathematics, “random” — unlike “arbitrary” — usually presupposes that the outcomes follow a <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/probability-statistics-symbols/#Discrete_Probability_Distributions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>probability distribution</strong></a>, and as such might have predictable probabilities even if the outcomes are subject to chance and unpredictability.</p></div><h2 id="axiom"><a href="#toc">Axiom</a></h2><div id="attachment_18546"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18546" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Parallel-Postulate.png" alt="Illustration of Parallel Postulate" width="320" height="240" srcset="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Parallel-Postulate.png 320w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Parallel-Postulate-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" title="Parallel Postulate" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20320%20240'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Parallel-Postulate.png 320w, https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Parallel-Postulate-300x225.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Parallel-Postulate.png"></p><p id="caption-attachment-18546">Pictorial representation of the parallel postulate</p></div><p>Axioms, also known as postulates, are mathematical premises which are assumed to be<strong>&nbsp;true</strong> and along with <a href="#def">definitions</a>, form the foundation of a <a href="#theory">mathematical <span>theory</span></a>.</p><p>In general, axioms can be divided into two types: <strong>logica</strong>l and <strong>non-logical</strong>.

<h2 id="thought-experiments">Thought Experiments</h2>

<p>I hold no dualist notions, and do not find philosophical zombies very convincing either. As such, I am fully prepared to believe that if you were to create a sufficiently-detailed simulation of my brain, and run it inside a sufficiently-powerful computer, it would experience consciousness. There are certainly short- and medium-term practical obstacles to this, in terms of our poor understanding of what is necessary for a sufficiently-detailed brain simulation. But I see no reason this wouldn’t be possible eventually.</p>

<p>Let’s consider what this simulation really is: a program, which generates a series of (very long) numbers. Each number represents the state of the computer’s memory at that point in the simulation. Let’s take the sequence of numbers representing ten simulated minutes of brain time. As the machine’s memory evolves according to these numbers throughout ten minutes, we have a simulacrum of me experiencing consciousness.</p>

<p>What would happen if we evolved the computer’s memory a bit more slowly? Say, instead of holding these numbers in memory at their original rate, we took twice as long—twenty minutes. What does the simulacrum-me experience? Obviously, it still experiences ten minutes of consciousness; it has no frame of reference that tells it that “out there” twenty minutes have passed.</p>

<p>Let’s try something else. What if we got rid of the program simulating the brain, and simply replaced it with a dumb program that read the ten-minutes-of-numbers off disk and loaded them into memory, in sequence. This should be functionally identical; it doesn’t matter whether the memory was computed ahead of time or in real time. The system will still have a conscious experience. It can’t tell whether those numbers came from the CPU or the hard disk.</p>

<p>What if I, the physical human, wrote down all those numbers on pieces of paper in sequence? Does that written-on paper now experience consciousness? It seems like it should; there’s nothing magical about transistors. Remember, no dualism allowed.</p>

<p>Does it make a difference how good my handwriting is?</p>

<p>What if I only wrote down the first such number? Assuming a deterministic universe, there is a set of rules that will evolve that single number forward in time, to live a full life (even beyond the ten minutes we originally ran the computer program for). Maybe I’d need to write down some encoding of those deterministic rules, too—although I’m not sure why. Does that single written-down number experience consciousness?</p>

<p>What if we never involved computers, computer memory, or paper at all? The number still exists, even without me writing it down, as do the rules for evolving it. (Even without humans around to count, the number five still exists.) Does … something … still experience consciousness?</p>

<p>I imagine there are two reactions to this. Perhaps the more common will be to assume I’m performing a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> on the idea of simulating conscious experience. I started from that premise, and came to the conclusion that my (simulated?) consciousness exists and experiences things independent of any physical substrate. Seems absurd, so something must have gone wrong, right?</p>

<p>I don’t think so. Not only is the chain of logic inescapable, but this line of thinking also points toward a sublime solution to some of the biggest questions around. Namely, why does anything exist at all? And, why is mathematics so spectacularly effective at describing the physical universe?</p>

<p>The answer is that the universe itself is simply a timeless mathematical construct. Of what type, we’re not exactly sure yet; it’s looking like it’ll be some kind of mashup of a 3+1-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold with tensor fields obeying certain partial differential equations, plus operator-valued fields on ℝ<sup>4</sup> with certain commutation relations acting on an abstract Hilbert space. But when we do have our theory of everything, plus the initial conditions of the universe, it’s clear to me that within its Platonic mathematical structure lies all of the manifest complexity and consciousness we observe around us.</p>

<p>There’s no need to run a simulation. The mathematical structure exists, independent of human discovery, or of computers to run it. And that’s why you and I exist.</p>

						<blockquote><p>
Human history has an unfortunate record of discrimination and biases against each other that follow us from ancient times. A conscious effort towards developing inclusive and equal social systems is a necessity. In the increasingly automated world, where computers interact with humans, Artificial Intelligence gives us another shot at making the world a fairer place with equal opportunities.</p>
<p>However, machines are built by people. We are obliged to put conscious effort into making sure the AI solutions won’t carry over our mistakes.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The appeal of AI is tremendous: it can search through millions of pieces of data and use it to make forecasts that are often more accurate than ours. Automating processes with AI also seems more objective than relying on subjective (and slower) human analysis. After all, the AI  algorithm will not “dislike” your picture or assume anything based on it, especially when it is taught to ignore it completely.</p>
<p>The problem is, AI algorithms are not necessarily human-bias free. AI is designed and trained on human data, and human thinking is characterized by bias. Therefore bias is also a built-in byproduct of human-designed systems. These AI biases can echo problematic perceptions, such as the perceived superiority of certain groups. Even well-designed AI systems can still end up with a bias, entirely by accident.</p>
<p>The question is: can we prevent AI from being racist and sexist? And if we can, then could machines help us create a fairer society?</p>

<h2> People and biases </h2>
<p>Let’s start from the beginning: before the machines were biased, people were. Why is that? According to the <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/bias" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cambridge Dictionary</a>, bias is <em>“the action of supporting or opposing a particular person or thing in an unfair way, because of allowing personal opinions to influence your judgment.”</em></p>
<p>Biases can be innate or learned. People may develop biases for or against an individual, a group, or a belief. It does not have to be limited to ethnicity and race; it is also gender, religion, sexual orientation, and many other characteristics that are subject to bias. </p>
<h3>Are all biases conscious?</h3>
<p>There are two types of bias: conscious (also known as explicit bias) and unconscious (also known as implicit bias). The <a href="http://perception.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Transforming-Perception.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conscious bias</a> refers to the attitude we have on a conscious level, and most of the time, it arises as to the direct result of a perceived threat.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://diversity.ucsf.edu/resources/unconscious-bias#:~:text=Unconscious%20bias%20is%20far%20more,or%20working%20under%20time%20pressure." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unconscious bias</a> is a social stereotype about certain groups of people that a person form outside their conscious awareness. It is automatic, unintentional, deeply ingrained, and able to influence behavior. Unconscious bias is more prevalent than the conscious one. </p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.apa.org/research/action/speaking-of-psychology/understanding-biases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Psychological Association</a>, <b>only a small proportion of Americans today are explicitly racist</b> and feel hatred towards other ethnicities and races.</p>
<p>But the majority of Americans, because they have grown up in a culture that has been historically racist in many ways and because they’re exposed to the media that are biased, associate violence, drugs, and poverty with specific groups. </p>

<p>People will always be biased to some extent because their opinions are subjective and what is worse – humans tend to generalize. This is partly the fault of the way we are programmed, and partly the failure of the way we programmed our society and culture. Does it mean machines have to be programmed like this as well? </p>
<h2>Want to build a racist AI solution? Just hand it a newspaper</h2>
<p>Obviously, AI solutions have no political agenda of their own, right? It’s not going to be intentionally racist unless it has <em>explicitly</em> been trained to be. It is also not (most of the time, at least) a political agenda of their creators that is the issue. The problem is that it is very easy to train machines to be racist by accident and without even trying. </p>
<p>Here are a few examples of how algorithms can discriminate on different fields based on race: </p>
<ul>
<li> <strong> Image Recognition: </strong> Researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology tested eight image-recognition systems used in self-driving cars, after observing higher error rates for specific demographics. They <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/self-driving-car-crash-racial-bias-black-people-study-a8810031.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found their accuracy proving five percent less accurate</a> on average for people with darker skin. So a self-driving car is more likely to run over a black person than it is to run a white one. </li>
<li> <strong> Healthcare: </strong> An algorithm used in US hospitals to allocate healthcare for patients has been systematically discriminating against black people. A study concluded that the algorithm was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03228-6#ref-CR1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">less likely to refer black people than white people</a> who were equally sick to programs that aim to improve care for patients with complex medical needs. </li>

<li> <strong> Criminal Cases: </strong> In 2016, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ProPublica published</a> an investigation on an ML program that is used by courts to predict future criminals, and they found out that the system is biased against black people. The program learned about who is mostly to end up in jail from incarceration data. And historically, the criminal justice system has been unfair to black Americans. So when an AI program was fed with these historical data, it learned from biased decisions historically made by humans. </li>
<li> <strong> Natural Language Processing (<a href="https://sigmoidal.io/boosting-your-solutions-with-nlp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NLP</a>): </strong> There is a broad spectrum of cases (for example, work/college admissions or even loan applications), where words can serve as an input – the so-called <em>word embeddings</em> represent words as inputs to machine learning. But there is a fairness problem when an algorithm learns the meaning of words from humans. Our opinions are often subjective and biased, so the meaning of the words (e.g., people names) is then biased. A <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6334/183.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> paper in Science from 2017</a> found out that when a computer teaches itself English by crawling the internet, it becomes prejudiced against black Americans and women. For example, when <a href="http://blog.conceptnet.io/posts/2017/how-to-make-a-racist-ai-without-really-trying/http://blog.conceptnet.io/posts/2017/how-to-make-a-racist-ai-without-really-trying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the GloVe news dataset is used</a>, the sentiment (how positive a given sentence is) of simple text starting with ‘My name is…’ is significantly lower when it ends with common names of black people than common names for white people.

<h2> How can we fight it? </h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
Bias-free AI can soon be a powerful tool to tackle social issues – such as enhancing social mobility through fairer access to the financing/healthcare system, mitigating exclusion and poverty through making the judiciary systems more objective, bias-free testing in university admissions, and much more. We should expect fair AI solutions from both technology companies and authorities.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Military and tactics books say that weapons or tactics should always take into consideration the enemy strategy. That is also true for this particular fairness and human dignity fight. In the case of this war, there are also different ways to fight racial bias, depending on the domain (field) and the data used by the algorithm. </p>
<h3> Image Recognition </h3>
<p>In the case of image-recognition systems, the reason for bias is that training data that machines use for learning contain mostly samples gathered from white people. These AI solutions can have problems with recognizing people of different races because it simply did not see enough pictures of them. The effect is doubled when it comes to women of color.</p>

<p>The biggest problem here is that face-recognition systems are widely used by law enforcement and border control.

<p>The solution (our weapon) for this problem is quite simple. Still, it requires more attention during dataset preparation: the equal representation of people of color and gender in training datasets (e.g., face recognition) is crucial for algorithms (like face recognition ones) to work with the same precision regardless of race or gender.</p>
<p>Moreover, from the sociological point of view, those bias problems would be hard to overlook and natural to point out if minority representatives would be more encouraged to be a part of the artificial intelligence team.</p>
<h3> Biases in AI solutions for Healthcare </h3>
<p>The reason millions of black people were affected by racial bias in health-care algorithms? It was based on the historical cost of health care, where higher health-care costs are associated with greater needs. People who did have higher-cost treatment were assumed to need more extensive care, which seemed just about right – or did it?</p>

<p>The biggest problem with this approach was the fact that those less wealthy simply couldn’t afford more extensive treatment, so they chose less expensive options, while their actual needs remain the same as people in the same condition who could opt in the more expensive ones.</p>
<p>The approximation of the healthcare needs by the amount of money spent on treatment was actually an exclusive approach, biased towards more wealthy people.

<h3><em>UNIGE scientists have fine-tuned a neuro-computer model, combining neuronal oscillations and predictive coding, which helps explain how the brain identifies syllables in natural speech.</em></h3>
<h3><img src="https://www.unige.ch/communication/communiques/files/3215/9309/0085/Ondes750x329.jpg" alt="Ondes750x329.jpg" width="750" height="329"></h3>
<p><em>@ DR</em></p>
<div><p><strong>The brain analyses spoken language by recognising syllables. Scientists from the University of Geneva (UNIGE) and the Evolving Language National Centre for Competence in Research (NCCR) have designed a computational model that reproduces the complex mechanism employed by the central nervous system to perform this operation. The model, which brings together two independent theoretical frameworks, uses the equivalent of neuronal oscillations produced by brain activity to process the continuous sound flow of connected speech. The model functions according to a theory known as predictive coding, whereby the brain optimizes perception by constantly trying to predict the sensory signals based on candidate hypotheses (syllables in this model). The resulting model, described in the journal <em>Nature Communications</em>, has helped the live recognition of thousands of syllables contained in hundreds of sentences spoken in natural language. This has validated the idea that neuronal oscillations can be used to coordinate the flow of syllables we hear with the predictions made by our brain.</strong></p><p>“Brain activity produces neuronal oscillations that can be measured using electroencephalography,” begins Anne-Lise Giraud, professor in the Department of Basic Neurosciences in UNIGE’s Faculty of Medicine and co-director of the Evolving Language NCCR. These are electromagnetic waves that result from the coherent electrical activity of entire networks of neurons. There are several types, defined according to their frequency. They are called alpha, beta, theta, delta or gamma waves. Taken individually or superimposed, these rhythms are linked to different cognitive functions, such as perception, memory, attention, alertness, etc. <br>However, neuroscientists do not yet know whether they actively contribute to these functions and how. In an earlier study published in 2015, Professor Giraud’s team showed that the theta waves (low frequency) and gamma waves (high frequency) coordinate to sequence the sound flow in syllables and to analyse their content so they can be recognised.<br>The Geneva-based scientists developed a spiking neural network computer model based on these physiological rhythms, whose performance in sequencing live (on-line) syllables was better than that of traditional automatic speech recognition systems.</p></div>
<p><strong>The rhythm of the syllables</strong><br>In their first model, the theta waves (between 4 and 8 Hertz) made it possible to follow the rhythm of the syllables as they were perceived by the system. Gamma waves (around 30 Hertz) were used to segment the auditory signal into smaller slices and encode them. This produces a “phonemic” profile linked to each sound sequence, which could be compared, a posteriori, to a library of known syllables. One of the advantages of this type of model is that it spontaneously adapts to the speed of speech, which can vary from one individual to another.</p>
<p><strong>Predictive coding</strong><br>In this new article, to stay closer to the biological reality, Professor Giraud and her team developed a new model where they incorporate elements from another theoretical framework, independent of the neuronal oscillations: “predictive coding”. “This theory holds that the brain functions so optimally because it is constantly trying to anticipate and explain what is happening in the environment by using learned models of how outside events generate sensory signals. In the case of spoken language, it attempts to find the most likely causes of the sounds perceived by the ear as speech unfolds, on the basis of a set of mental representations that have been learned and that are being permanently updated.”, says Dr. Itsaso Olasagasti, computational neuroscientist in Giraud’s team, who supervised the new model implementation.<br>“We developed a computer model that simulates this predictive coding,” explains Sevada Hovsepyan, a researcher in the Department of Basic Neurosciences and the article’s first author. “And we implemented it by incorporating oscillatory mechanisms.”</p>
<p><strong>Tested on 2,888 syllables</strong><br>The sound entering the system is first modulated by a theta (slow) wave that resembles what neuron populations produce. It makes it possible to signal the contours of the syllables. Trains of (fast) gamma waves then help encode the syllable as and when it is perceived. During the process, the system suggests possible syllables and corrects the choice if necessary. After going back and forth between the two levels several times, it discovers the right syllable. The system is subsequently reset to zero at the end of each perceived syllable.<br>The model has been successfully tested using 2,888 different syllables contained in 220 sentences, spoken in natural language in English. “On the one hand, we succeeded in bringing together two very different theoretical frameworks in a single computer model,” explains Professor Giraud. “On the other, we have shown that neuronal oscillations most likely rhythmically align the endogenous functioning of the brain with signals that come from outside via the sensory organs. If we put this back in predictive coding theory, it means that these oscillations probably allow the brain to make the right hypothesis at exactly the right moment.”</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A bit more than four years ago I started the <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor">xi-editor</a> project. Now I have placed it on the back burner (though there is still some activity from the open source community).</p>

<p>The original goal was to deliver a very high quality editing experience. To this end, the project spent a rather large number of “novelty points”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rust as the implementation language for the core.</li>
  <li>A rope data structure for text storage.</li>
  <li>A multiprocess architecture, with front-end and plug-ins each with their own process.</li>
  <li>Fully embracing async design.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDT</a> as a mechanism for concurrent modification.</li>
</ul>

<p>I still believe it would be possible to build a high quality editor based on the original design. But I <em>also</em> believe that this would be quite a complex system, and require significantly more work than necessary.</p>

<p>I’ve written the <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor/issues/1187#issuecomment-491473599">CRDT part of this retrospective</a> already, as a comment in response to a Github issue. That prompted good <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19886883">discussion</a> on Hacker News. In this post, I will touch again on CRDT but will focus on the other aspects of the system design.</p>

<h2 id="origins">Origins</h2>

<p>The original motivation for xi came from working on the Android text stack, and confronting two problems in particular. One, text editing would become very slow as the text buffer got bigger. Two, there were a number of concurrency bugs in the interface between the EditText widget and the keyboard (input method editor).</p>

<p>The culprit of the first problem turned out to be the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/SpanWatcher">SpanWatcher</a> interface, combined with the fact that modern keyboards like to put a spelling correction span on each word. When you insert a character, all the successive spans bump their locations up by one, and then you have to send onSpanChanged for each of those spans to all the watchers. Combined with the fact that the spans data structure had a naive O(n) implementation, and the whole thing was quadratic or worse.</p>

<p>The concurrency bugs boil down to synchronizing edits across two different processes, because the keyboard is a different process than the application hosting the EditText widget. Thus, when you send an update (to move the cursor, for example) and the text on the other side is changing concurrently, it’s ambiguous whether it refers to the old or new location. This was handled in an “almost correct” style, with timeouts for housekeeping updates to minimize the chance of a race. A nice manifestation of that is that swiping the cursor slowly through text containing complex emoji could cause flashes of the emoji breaking.</p>

<p>These problems have a unifying thread: in both cases there are small diffs to the text, but then the data structures and protocols handled these diffs in a less than optimal way, leading to both performance and correctness bugs.</p>

<p>To a large extent, xi started as an exploration into the “right way” to handle text editing operations. In the case of the concurrency bugs, I was hoping to find a general, powerful technique to facilitate concurrent text editing in a distributed-ish system. While most of the Operational Transformation literature is focused on multiple users collaboratively editing a document, I was hoping that other text manipulations (like an application enforcing credit card formatting on a text input field) could fit into the general framework.</p>

<p>That was also the time I was starting to get heavily into Rust, so it made natural sense to start prototyping a new green-field text editing engine. How would you “solve text” if you were free of backwards compatibility constraints (a huge problem in Android)?</p>

<p>When I started, I knew that Operational Transformation was a solution for collaborative editing, but had a reputation for being complex and finicky. I had no idea how deep the rabbithole would be of OT and then CRDT. Much of that story is told in the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19886883">CRDT discussion</a> previously linked.</p>

<h2 id="the-lure-of-modular-software">The lure of modular software</h2>

<p>There is an extremely long history of people trying to build software as composable modules connected by some kind of inter-module communication fabric. Historical examples include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCE/RPC">DCE/RPC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Object_Request_Broker_Architecture">Corba</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonobo_(GNOME)">Bonobo</a>, and more recently things like <a href="https://sandstorm.io/">Sandstorm</a> and <a href="https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/modular/module">Fuchsia Modular</a>. There are some partial successes, including <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Binder">Binder</a> on Android, but this is still mostly an unrealized vision. (Regarding Binder, it evolved from a much more idealistic vision, and I strongly recommend reading this 2006 interview about <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/13674/introduction-to-openbinder-and-interview-with-dianne-hackborn/">OpenBinder</a>).</p>

<p>When I started xi, there were signs we were getting there. Microservices were becoming popular in the Internet world, and of course all Web apps have a client/server boundary. Within Google, <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a> was working fairly well, as was the internal process separation within Chrome. In Unix land, there’s a long history of the terminal itself presenting a GUI (if primitive, though gaining features such as color and mouse). There’s also the tradition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blit_(computer_terminal)">Blit</a> and then, of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeWS">NeWS</a> and X11.</p>

<p>I think one of the strongest positive models was the database / business logic split, which is arguably the most successful example of process separation. In this model, the database is responsible for performance and integrity, and the business logic is in a separate process, so it can safely do things like crash and hang. I very much thought of xi-core as a database-like engine, capable of handling concurrent text modification much like a database handles transactions.</p>

<p>Building software in such a modular way requires two things: first, infrastructure to support remote procedure calls (including serialization of the requests and data), and second, well-defined interfaces. Towards the end of 2017, I saw the goal of xi-editor as <em>primarily</em> being about defining the interfaces needed for large scale text editing, and that this work could endure over a long period of time even as details of the implementation changed.</p>

<p>For the infrastructure, we chose JSON (about which more below) and hand-rolled our own xi-rpc layer (based on JSON-RPC). It turns out there are a lot of details to get right, including dealing with error conditions, negotiating when two ends of the protocol aren’t exactly on the same version, etc.</p>

<p>One of the bolder design decisions in xi was to have a process separation between front-end and core. This was inspired in part by <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a>, in which everything is a plugin, even GUI. But the main motivation was to build GUI applications using Rust, even though at the time Rust was nowhere near capable of native GUI. The idea is that you use the best GUI technology of the platform, and communicate via async pipes.</p>

<p>One argument for process separation is to improve overall system reliability. For example, Chrome has a process per tab, and if the process crashes, all you get is an “Aw, snap” without bringing the whole browser down. I think it’s worth asking the question: is it useful to have the front-end continue after the core crashes, or the other way around? I think probably not; in the latter case it might be able to safely save the file, but you can also do that by frequently checkpointing.</p>

<p>Looking back, I see much of the promise of modular software as addressing goals related to project management, not technical excellence. Ideally, once you’ve defined an inter-module architecture, then smaller teams can be responsible for their own module, and the cost of coordination goes down. I think this type of project management structure is especially appealing to large companies, who otherwise find it difficult to manage larger projects. And the tax of greater overall complexity is often manageable, as these big companies tend to have more resources.</p>

<h3 id="json">JSON</h3>

<p>The choice of JSON was controversial from the start. It did end up being a source of friction, but for surprising reasons.</p>

<p>The original vision was to write plug-ins in any language, especially for things like language servers that would be best developed in the language of that ecosystem. This is the main reason I chose JSON, because I expected there would be high quality implementations in every viable language.</p>

<p>Many people complained about the fact that JSON escapes strings, and suggested alternatives such as <a href="https://msgpack.org/index.html">MessagePack</a>. But I knew that the speed of raw JSON parsing was a solved problem, with a number of extremely high performance implementations (<a href="https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson">simdjson</a> is a good example).</p>

<p>Even so, aside from the general problems of modular software as described above, JSON was the source of two additional problems. For one, <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-mac/issues/102">JSON in Swift is shockingly slow</a>. There are <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/rearchitecting-jsonencoder-to-be-much-faster/28139">discussions on improving it</a> but it’s still a problem. This is surprising to me considering how important it is in many workloads, and the fact that it’s clearly possible to write a high performance JSON implementation.</p>

<p>Second, on the Rust side, while <a href="https://serde.rs/">serde</a> is quite fast and very convenient (thanks to proc macros), when serializing a large number of complex structures, it bloats code size considerably. The xi core is 9.3 megabytes in a Linux release build (debug is an eye-watering 88MB), and a great deal of that bloat is serialization. There is work to reduce this, including <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/miniserde">miniserde</a> and <a href="https://github.com/not-fl3/nanoserde">nanoserde</a>, but serde is still by far the most mainstream.</p>

<p>I believe it’s possible to do performant, clean JSON across most languages, but people should know, we’re not there yet.</p>

<h2 id="the-rope">The rope</h2>

<p>There are only a few data structures suitable for representation of text in a text editor. I would enumerate them as: contiguous string, gapped buffer, array of lines, piece table, and rope. I would consider the first unsuitable for the goals of xi-editor as it doesn’t scale well to large documents, though its simplicity is appealing, and memcpy is fast these days; if you know your document is always under a megabyte or so, it’s probably the best choice.</p>

<p>Array of lines has performance failure modes, most notably very long lines. Similarly, many good editors have been written using piece tables, but I’m not a huge fan; performance is very good when first opening the file, but degrades over time.</p>

<p>My favorite aspect of the rope as a data structure is its excellent …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

    <p>Hey bru! I’ve launched 2 apps in the past month which both use the algorithm I’ll discuss today. It’s a line smoothing algorithm which I think is applicable for a variety of applications.</p>

<p>In this post I’ll discuss the algorithm itself and how I implemented it in Flutter.</p>

<p>Just just getting started with Flutter? <a href="https://kangabru.xyz/2020/05/15/zero-to-hero-1.html">Check out my first post here</a>. Also try out my games below to see the algorithm in action!</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="show-me-the-icing">Show me the icing</h2>

<video loop="" controls="" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/704713b752c561b7f557824b1f6a7e7fee5d6aef/86f03/images/posts/2020-06-26/icing.mp4"></video>

<p>Check out the video to see my algorithm in action.</p>

<p>A couple things to notice here:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The icing is buttery smooth. You can draw as rough as you like but the result is a super smooth line</li>
  <li>The icing motion feels a bit ‘sticky’. It feels somewhat like real icing and makes the game more challenging and skilful.</li>
</ul>



<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/c50e733faa4c0d77cef80e43df6ad5d73ffa058a/db698/images/posts/2020-06-26/snek.png"></p>

<p>I also use the algorithm for my snake inspired game Squiggle Snek. It allows me to draw the snake body nice and smooth.</p>

<p>But this is just what I use it for, it has potential for many more uses. In fact I’ve seen similar concepts used by Adobe and various apps/websites around the place.</p>

<p>Enough talk, let’s see how it works!</p>

<h2 id="starting-small">Starting small</h2>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ab5bf7f2de9f69e40b7cd28118671600625a26f6/3976d/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_small_1.jpg"></p>

<p>Imagine you have 3 points in a line like this. How would you go about smoothing it?</p>

<p>My approach was to try average the lines together to flatten the peak. In this case the middle peak is pulled towards the centre of the two connected points at the bottom like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/fe42c623143f4421ed5ad03c473aed7058d2e1d9/8b12e/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_small_2.jpg"></p>

<p>You can see this is done easily by averaging the positions of the bottom points, then averaging <em>that</em> position with the top point.</p>

<p>What would it look like on a longer line?</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/44cdf6a2b74eae933f5f63ba0ab56d43ef5de670/a3691/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_small_3.jpg"></p>

<p>The process is the same, we just have to do it for each point down the line.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/72180015b1b1c5046a9803c7ba8da621cb13d7b2/337f9/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_small_4.jpg"></p>

<p>Sweet, it actually smoothed out! Notice that each point is in the middle of it’s adjacent points.</p>

<p>So far so good but we’re not using many points yet. We need to scale it up.</p>

<h2 id="lets-go-bigger">Let’s go bigger</h2>

<p>Now that we know how to smooth a line, how does it work in the real world?</p>

<p>When you draw a line you get <em>thousands</em> of points that are very close together - often just pixels apart. How would our algorithm perform in this case? Something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/977d66d24bce0f64b73f85c8115fc44909f868bd/b0491/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_small_7.jpg"></p>

<p>Pretty nice right? But there are just a few problem areas which I’ve marked with arrows.</p>

<p>Firstly it’s highly dependant on the distance between points. Smaller gaps will result in less smoothing. Larger gaps will result in <em>over</em> smoothing. Take this example:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/77ed07e4402adfe56cc478289b7bba56aeb5e296/8a9fe/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_norm_1.jpg"></p>

<p>This example is exaggerated but represents a real scenario. When users move really fast the points are further away from each other. When they go slow the points are much closer.</p>

<p>You can see that the algorithm will produce different results for each drawing style. So to ensure that the smoothing is consistent I <strong>normalise</strong> the line so that the gap between points is within a consistent range. I’ll explain more in the next section.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d0b2ed2fd235ab8bda810dc79487591fd2cfb911/07c96/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_small_8.jpg"></p>

<p>Secondly the algorithm as-is is too fine grained. Points only interact with the ones directly next to them so larger line <em>features</em> can still look bumpy.</p>

<p>To combat this I apply a <strong>super smooth</strong> process which I explain later.</p>





<hr>

<h2 id="normalise">Normalise</h2>

<p>As I mentioned before, one issue with the algorithm is that it’s highly affected by how close points are to each other. To combat this I add/remove points to ensure that the gap between points is within a certain range.</p>

<p>Here’s an example - the red dots represent the points. Notice some are far away and some are <em>very</em> close together.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8d196846016bb7229e21f0541b3c3f42a1a230ab/9bdc3/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_norm_4.jpg"></p>

<p>After normalising the line the points would be more evenly distributed. Something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/142821f88b1d98934f2221930ccd995314cbfe32/57c1f/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_norm_5.jpg"></p>

<p>Now when we smooth the line the points behave similarly. Remember our example from before?</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/77ed07e4402adfe56cc478289b7bba56aeb5e296/8a9fe/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_norm_1.jpg"></p>

<p>It would smooth out like this after being normalised:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/25269d0ed7196f083e55b3c77fd34017f8462a2e/96ee1/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_norm_2.jpg"></p>

<p>Now that we can control the gap distance the smoothing will behave consistently regardless of how fast/slow the user draws their line.</p>

<p>This is the basic process of how it’s done:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I step through the line and compare every pair of adjacent points</li>
  <li>I add a new point if the gap is larger than the tolerance range
    <ul>
      <li>The new point is placed in the middle of the two points</li>
      <li>I keep adding points until the gap is within tolerance</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I remove a point if the gap is smaller than the tolerance range
    <ul>
      <li>I keep removing points until the gap is within tolerance</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="super-smooth">Super smooth</h2>

<p>As I mentioned before the algorithm is too fine-grained. Even after we normalise the line we will still see bumps. This is because we’re smoothing out individual <em>points</em>, not bigger line <em>features</em>.</p>

<p>Take this line for example. We can see it has been smoothed out yet it still has bumps. The <em>points</em> have been smoothed, but the bigger <em>features</em> make it look bumpy.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b2a8f3c9153312802cfb8d71a4f59c549dd8237e/67fad/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_xsmooth_1.jpg"></p>

<p>We <em>could</em> remove points but we’ve already normalised the line by now. We don’t want to reduce the amount of information we have to play with.</p>

<p>Instead I adjusted the algorithm slightly. Rather than smooth a point with just it’s direct neighbours, I added the ability to use points further away.</p>

<p>In this example you can see how the smoothing uses the points 2 positions away instead of just 1 like before.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/33e7aa2eb3e3cb48297ccb0b0ebe0af682d3afdc/0a864/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_xsmooth_2.jpg"></p>

<p>Let’s go bigger. Below is the process applied using points 5 positions away. Note that I ran the smoothing process a number of times.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d145f55f7c42484ec970559c5b8234bca9edaab9/2c295/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_band_10.jpg"></p>

<p>And here is another using points that are 10 positions away. Again I ran the process multiple times.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3f8d83df99a4267c1f15ded351559f1eb3422ea4/a9f17/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_band_20.jpg"></p>

<p>Notice something? Yeah it looks crap! You can see that points bunch up to create ugly artefacts.</p>

<p>But at least the points are interacting with a wider spread of neighbouring points. They’re affecting larger <em>features</em> of a line now.</p>

<p>Fixing the artefacts turned out to be quite easy. I simply run the smoothing process with 20, 18, … , 2, 1 positions away in succession. The result looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ecf8d9d9be46368e3504ca1ae69c48d120395ec0/026d1/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_band_smooth.jpg"></p>

<p>Buttery smooth right? So now the algorithm will smooth out the bigger features first, then slowly refine the line into beautiful buttery goodness. The result is a super smooth line 👌</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2e13afce0ffe62ff1c54a85902b94159dd3b88ae/6178f/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_result.jpg"></p>

<h2 id="lets-animate-it">Let’s animate it</h2>

<p>So to turn this algorithm into actual icing I simply run the algorithm live as the user draws. The smoothing gives the icing that ‘sticky’ feeling.</p>

<p>This is the basic idea:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Keep a list of the original coordinates</li>
  <li>When the user starts to draw do this:
    <ul>
      <li>Add new points to the original coordinate list</li>
      <li>Normalise the new points within the list</li>
      <li>Copy the list and run the super smoother process</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The smoothed path is ready to be drawn on screen</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it! You can now implement your very own buttery smooth smoothing algorithm. Go make some icing, snakes, or whatever you can think of. Path smoothing has a lot of uses I reckon.</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>The final step of the process is making this thing performant. You can imagine that if you let the user draw indefinitely the list will get HUGE.</p>

<p>Given that the algorithm loops over the list a lot, you can see that the number of computations scales linearly with the length of the line.</p>

<p>Eventually this will degrade the performance of your app. In practise I found my app to slow down within seconds of drawing.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/142a4be842a3c8c620cf38e6e8ddaeb1614b68d0/c9e8c/images/posts/2020-06-26/alg_cache.jpg"></p>

<p>The combat this I ‘cache’ the smooth portion of the line and only deal with the end.</p>

<p>Notice in the image that the two lines at the end share the same beginning portion. This occurs because the algorithm is proximity based. New points will eventually stop affecting older ones.</p>

<p>Now I only ever have to process a small segment of the line at any time. The result is a fast algorithm that that can run continuously as the user draws.</p>

<p>Baring the actual algorithm implementation, how could we perform this type of processing and render it in Flutter? You know I love them, it’s another mixin!</p>

<p>In this example the <code>PathSmoother</code> class holds my smoothing algorithm logic. I then expose some helper methods to interact with it from a stateful widget.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>'package:flutter/material.dart'</span><span>;</span>

<p>Below is an example of how you would actually use the mixin and interact with it as the user draws.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>'package:flutter/material.dart'</span><span>;</span>

<p>To render the paths I call my custom painter <code>EasyPaint(IcingPainter(paths))</code>. This works as follows:</p>

<p>My Twitter feels like a local library. Each one of my Twitter friends is tending to their own little corner of the internet, sharing their best material, and responding to my random research questions. There are a lot of knowledgable folks out there, but <a href="https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2019/05/01/spreading-threading/[@visakanv](https://twitter.com/visakanv">Visakan Veerasamy</a> is the ultimate librarian. I like to think of him as the crown prince of Nerd Twitter —&nbsp;a writer, creator, and curator who’s so prolific he doesn’t recognize himself. Visa is playing the Twitter game on a whole new level. He’s constructing a digital version of his brain, and his curation style feels like an early iteration of something that might one day go mainstream. It’s a knowledge creation and exploration ethos that feels more true to the original “web” and more fit for how we think.</p>

<p>Inspired by his huge web of knowledge, I sent out a tweet three months ago that said: “I think I would legit pay for @visakanv as a service. $10/mo for him to respond to all of my random musings with his own thoughts, content recommendations, and links to relevant threads. This service would be like Mario racing turbo boost for the mind!”</p>

<p>To my surprise, Visa responded within a few minutes. “Happy to do this,” he said, and shared a link to his <a href="https://www.patreon.com/visakanv">Patreon</a>.</p>

<h3>A brief history of tweetstorms</h3>

<p>Visa’s digital brain is made up of Twitter threads. He didn’t invent the medium, but he’s pushed it to its limits.</p>

<p>When Marc Andreessen started tweeting in 2014, he didn’t let the 140-character limit stop him from posting his thoughts at length. Instead of shortening his tweets, he started stringing them together by replying to himself. Thus was born the tweetstorm. At first, tweetstorms were a hack. And they were mildly <a href="http://expletiveinserted.com/2014/07/02/taming-tweetstorms/">controversial</a>. Gawker once <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/uber-ceo-posts-13-tweet-apology-without-answering-a-sin-1660229634">slammed</a> Travis Kalanick’s use of a tweetstorm, calling it “a series of thoughts that give the illusion of substance and circumspection because they are presented in a numerical order.” Tech blogger/investor M.G. Siegler raged against them in 2014:</p>

<blockquote><p>1/ In theory, 2/ I love Tweetstorms 3/ and have long wanted a feature like this myself. 4/ But in practice, 5/ I f*cking hate them. 6/ They flow in the tweet stream about as nicely as vomit out of an esophagus. 7/ They ruin the experience of the stream by breaking what Twitter is, 8/ a service to share short thoughts quickly 9/ and let others reply to those in some semblance of order.</p></blockquote>

<p>At first, creating tweetstorms was a <a href="https://readwrite.com/2014/08/21/twitter-jargon-illustrated-rt-mt-canoes-darth/">very manual process</a>, and they weren’t very easy to read or share. Fast-forward three years: in 2017, Twitter officially productized tweestorms and rebranded them as “threads.” Suddenly, it was much simpler to string tweets together and share the resulting thread as a unit. This product change created the infrastructure on which Visa and others are currently spinning their webs.</p>

<h3>Resurrecting the Memex</h3>

<p>I found Visa’s threads sometime last year, and I’ve been crawling across them ever since. Whereas Marc Andressen’s threads were mostly self-contained, Visa’s are linked together. They form a giant web of interconnected thoughts. There’s no beginning or ending or map or wayfinding or sense of where you are in his tapestry. There are just threads of threads of threads that seem to extend into infinity —&nbsp;an ever-expanding network of Visa’s ideas and discoveries. At each node, there’s usually a full-on discussion taking place between his followers. Visa has constructed what feels like a whole new medium on top of the bedrock of Twitter. Here’s a representative thread for you to explore:</p>

<blockquote data-lang="en"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I’ve been stewing this theory for 1 year +:</p><p>Just as how the WWE isn’t a wrestling show, but a show ABOUT a wrestling show,</p><p>mainstream media is less about the news than a participatory interactive tv show ABOUT the news</p><p>Cable News Network is really Cable News Entertainment <a href="https://t.co/QZO2t8I9fI">https://t.co/QZO2t8I9fI</a></p></div>— Visa is in SF until May 8! 🌉 (@visakanv) <a href="https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1004190525270851584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 6, 2018</a></blockquote>





<p>Visa’s threads are doing to Twitter what hyperlinks did to dead-tree text. They link things together across time and space. Without thread-webs, most tweets get left behind in the past. A web of tweets allows people to rediscover older thoughts and connect them with newer ones.</p>

<p>These threads bear a family resemblance to the vision of an early 20th-century computer pioneer named Vannevar Bush. In 1945, he wrote a now-famous article called <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As We May Think</a>, which described a knowledge device he called the Memex:</p>

<blockquote><p>Man cannot hope fully to duplicate [his] mental process artificially, but he certainly ought to be able to learn from it. In minor ways, he may even improve, for his records have relative permanency. The first idea, however, to be drawn from the analogy concerns selection. Selection by association, rather than indexing, may be mechanized. One cannot hope thus to equal the speed of flexibility with which the mind follows an associative trail, but it should be possible to beat the mind decisively in regard to the permanence an clarity of the items resurrected from storage … <strong>Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p><img src="https://aaronzlewis.com/images/memex.jpg"></p>

<p>Bush’s vision of associative trails has been realized in some corners of the web, like Wikipedia. But most content is organized in the reverse-chronological stream (also known as the feed or the timeline). Social media sites have made information consumption a very linear process. We scroll down infinitely long pages that are (roughly) organized from newest to oldest. Content that’s more than a week old is fossilized under the endless dump of new posts, links, pictures. On social media, time is the main ordering principle. Creating new content feels like throwing a leaf into a roaring river. It’s not attached to anything — it just floats on by, doomed to be forgotten within a matter of seconds. We don’t really “surf” the web anymore. Unless we’re <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikirace">Wiki-racing</a>, we’re not hopping from hyperlink to hyperlink on a surprising journey across  human knowledge. We scroll, click, scroll click.</p>

<p>I see Visa’s Twitter threads as a response to this boring linearity&nbsp;— an attempt to make things hang together. We’re associative beings. We make sense of things by relating them to other things. As Joshua Foer wrote in his book <em>Moonwalking With Einstein:</em> “It takes knowledge to gain knowledge. Memory is like a spiderweb that catches information. The more it catches, the bigger it grows. And the bigger it grows, the more it catches.”</p>

<h3>The spread of threads</h3>

<p>I’ve noticed that the threading impulse is beginning to expand beyond Twitter. It’s popping up in more and more corners of the web. At Ribbonfarm, Venkatesh Rao is experimenting with a new genre called “<a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/03/21/constructions-in-magical-thinking/">blogchains</a>,” in which a bunch of blog posts are linked together around a single theme. It’s different than a traditional series because it’s “improvised rather than planned, is responsive to salient events in the environment, evolves at a certain tempo, is structurally a way to <em>build over time</em>, is suitable for multi-author collaboration, is capable of supporting an inter-process messaging protocol with adjacent blogchains, has no necessary or scripted ‘ending.’” The blogchain seems like a direct descendant of the Twitter thread — an attempt to experiment with the medium outside the confines of Twitter’s more rigid platform.</p>

<p>At Epsilon Theory, Ben Hunt created what he calls a <a href="https://www.epsilontheory.com/discovery-map-december-31-2018/">Discovery Map</a>. It’s an interactive visualization that displays all 300 of his blog posts as a network graph. The nodes of the network are organized in thematic clusters. Instead of scrolling down a reverse-chronological feed, you can surf across related posts and see connections across time. This feels like a genuinely new way of interacting with blog content, and it serves as an interesting answer to the question “Where should I start?”</p>

<p><img src="https://aaronzlewis.com/images/discovery-map.png"></p>

<p>The most interesting non-linear threading product I’ve discovered is called <a href="http://are.na/">Are.na</a>. It’s like Pinterest, but for nerds. Are.na lets you organize “Blocks” (text, links, photos) into thematic “Channels”. For example, I’m currently collecting material for channels called “<a href="https://www.are.na/aaron-lewis/deep-history-8mjcwnu9nia">Deep history</a>” and “<a href="https://www.are.na/aaron-lewis/culture-wars-2-0">Culture wars 2.0</a>”. Other people can easily add blocks to your channels, and you can include their channels inside your own. Channels can be rearranged, renamed, connected in novel ways. On Are.na, you’re a spider spinning a knowledge web alongside a bunch of other curious spiders. You never know how your webs might connect. I’ve started searching for things on Are.na (instead of Google) because every block lives inside a channel that’s connected to a lot of related content. Whereas a Google search result feels like a dead-end, an Arena block feels like an unexpected beginning.</p>

<p>What’s frustrating about blogging is that each post feels static and final. It’s not very alive as a medium. I wish it were easier for posts to evolve over time, sprout offshoots, find collaborators. The hyperlink is a pretty crude technology for connecting things together. Visa’s threads, Ribbonfarm’s blogchains, Epsilon Theory’s Discovery Map, and Are.na’s channels are all pointing to a model of content creation and consumption that’s more fit for the way our minds actually work. Threads are a more fluid and malleable medium. Finding someone’s thread-web feels like the digital equivalent of perusing the bookshelves in their home. You don’t have to know what you’re looking for, but you’re usually pleasantly surprised by what you find.</p>

<p>For the last few months, Visa has been replying to my tweets with links to his relevant thread-webs. Each random thought I tweet becomes a new entry point into the collection he’s been curating for years. He’d probably do this if I weren’t supporting him on Patreon, but I believe his threading experiment is an extremely valuable service. As the internet grows more complex, we’re going to need people who can string things together across time and …</p></article></section></div>

<p><a href="https://www.oceanvoyagesinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Press-Release_Ocean-Voyages-Institute-Sets-Record-With-Largest-Open-Ocean-Clean-Up-in-History.pdf">(Press Release</a> / <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/l9k6i4oc1az7zqx/AADGpBvLVi2nlaFK1vCoKf7na?dl=0">Photos/Video</a>)</p>



<p>HONOLULU, HI — June 23, 2020 – Ocean Voyages Institute’s marine plastic recovery vessel, S/V KWAI, docked at the port of Honolulu today, after a 48-day expedition, successfully removing 103 tons (206,000 lbs.) of fishing nets and consumer plastics from the North Pacific Subtropical Convergence Zone, more commonly known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch or Gyre.</p>



<p>Establishing its lead in open ocean clean-up, Ocean Voyages Institute has set a new record with the largest at sea clean-up in the Gyre to date, more than doubling its own results from last year.</p>



<p>“I am so proud of our hard working crew,” says <strong>Mary Crowley</strong>, founder and executive director of Ocean Voyages Institute. “We exceeded our goal of capturing 100 tons of toxic consumer plastics and derelict ‘ghost’ nets, and in these challenging times, we are continuing to help restore the health of our ocean, which influences our own health and the health of the planet.”</p>



<p>Crowley adds: “The oceans can’t wait for these nets and debris to break down into microplastics which impair the ocean’s ability to store carbon and toxify the fragile ocean food web.”</p>



<p>Known as the “Ghost Net Buster,” Crowley is renowned for developing effective methods to remove significant amounts of plastics out of the ocean, including 48 tons (96,000 lbs.) of toxic plastics during two ocean clean-ups in 2019, one from the Gyre and one from the waters surrounding the Hawaiian islands.</p>



<p>“There is no cure-all solution to ocean clean-up: It is the long days at sea, with dedicated crew scanning the horizon, grappling nets, and retrieving huge amounts of trash, that makes it happen,” says <strong>Locky MacLean</strong>, a former director at Sea Shepherd and ocean campaigner in marine conservation for two decades.</p>

<p>The GPS satellite trackers used by Ocean Voyages Institute since 2018 are proving Crowley’s theory that one tracker can lead to many nets. The ocean frequently sorts debris so that a tagged fishing net can lead to other nets and a density of debris within a 15 mile radius.</p>



<p>The Pacific Gyre, located halfway between Hawaii and California, is the largest area with the most plastic, of the five major open ocean plastic accumulation regions, or Gyres, in the world’s oceans.</p>



<p>“We are utilizing proven nautical equipment to effectively clean-up the oceans while innovating with new technologies,” says Crowley. “Ocean Voyages Institute has been a leader in researching and accomplishing ocean clean-up for over a decade, granted with less fanfare and attention than others, but with passion and commitment and making meaningful impacts.”</p>



<p>Ocean Voyages Institute will be unloading the record-breaking haul of ocean plastic debris while docked alongside Pier 29 thanks to the support of Honolulu-based Matson, in preparation for upcycling and proper disposal.</p>

<p>“In keeping with our commitment to environmental stewardship, Matson has been searching for a way to get involved in cleaning up the Pacific Gyre,” said <strong>Matt Cox</strong>, chairman and CEO. “We’ve been impressed with the groundbreaking efforts of Ocean Voyages Institute and the progress they’ve made with such a small organization, and we hope our support will help them continue this important work.”</p>



<h3>An Expanded 2020 Expedition</h3>



<p>When the sailing cargo ship, S/V KWAI, arrived in Honolulu today, it completed a 48-day at sea clean-up mission that began at the Hawaiian port of Hilo on May 4, after a three week self- imposed quarantine period to ensure the health of crew members and safety of the mission, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>During the expedition, the KWAI’s multinational crew collected marine plastic pollution with the help of GPS satellite trackers that Ocean Voyages Institute designed with engineer <strong>Andy Sybrandy</strong>, of <a href="https://www.pacificgyre.com/">Pacific Gyre, Inc</a>. These beacons are placed on nets by volunteer yachts and ships. Drones, as well as lookouts up the mast, enable the ship’s crew to hone in on the debris. They then recover the litter, place it in industrial bags, and store it in the ship’s cargo hold for proper recycling and repurposing at the end of the voyage.</p>



<p>S/V KWAI, led by <strong>Captain Brad Ives</strong>, and Ocean Voyages Institute are planning a second voyage to the Gyre departing the end of June to continue clean-up of this area, which is so besieged by toxic debris. The length of a second summer leg will be determined by how successful Ocean Voyages Institute is in securing additional donations.</p>

<p>“Our solutions are scalable, and next year, we could have three vessels operating in the North Pacific Gyre for three months all bringing in large cargos of debris,” says Crowley. “We are aiming to expand to other parts of the world desperately needing efficient clean-up technologies.”</p>



<p>Crowley adds: “There is no doubt in my mind that our work is making the oceans healthier for the planet and safer for marine wildlife, as these nets will never again entangle or harm a whale, dolphin, turtle or reefs.”</p>

<h4>Intro</h4>
<p>Well, it just had to be this pic:)</p>

<h4>The story</h4>
<p>Some time ago, <a href="https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=501">Carrion/Bonzai</a> asked me to fix his SX-64 keyboard. I was like … hell yeah! … I’ve never worked on SX-64 gear. The problem was, at that moment I didn’t know what was wrong with that keyboard … until pics arrived</p>
<p>By the way, <a href="https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=501">Carrion</a> and <a href="https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=29175">Yugorin</a> run an awesome website – <a href="https://c64portal.pl/">c64portal.pl</a> – The website is in Polish and contains lots of valuable info about Polish Commodore demoscene and Commodore in general. Both gentlemen are also the main guys behind the <a href="https://moonshinedragons.party/">Moonshine Dragons party – currently, the largest C64 party in Poland.</a></p>
<p>Since I already agreed that I’ll fix it, there was no excuse. Carrion sent me that keyboard and the party has begun 🙂</p>

<p>I had to remove the original stickers. That was done using a hotair gun set to 100 degrees C</p>

<h4>Plastic welding and reinforcements</h4>
<p>As it turned out, after close inspection, there were way more cracks than I thought.</p>
<p>All these cracks had to be addressed and reinforced – <a href="https://retrohax.net/extreme-refurbishing-episode-2-atari-800-xl-part-one/">this is a lesson that I’ve learned after my Atari 800 XL refurb</a> where joints were not stable enough and resulted in tiny cracks over time.</p>
<p>To achieve a proper result, I’ve welded in a brass mesh to serve as a reinforcement of cracked spots and as a base for resin-based compounds used later to rebuild missing plastic. Obviously, the mesh had to be custom cut.</p>
<p>This is how the process looks.</p>

<p>Once every piece was cut to a proper size, I’ve soldered them together. I’ve also added a thicker copper wire to make the mesh stiffer and less prone to bending.</p>

<h4>Rebuilding missing plastic</h4>
<p>At this stage, I was ready to apply fiber-glass putty. This is a quite messy process and looks kinda ugly. I’ve used some old PCB laminate to get every edge correctly positioned and as close to the original as possible. This part boils down to pretty much three things – putty application, sanding, laminate repositioning … putty application, sanding, laminate repositioning … etc. etc.</p>

<p>Some tools used during the process 🙂</p>

<p>The first corner was nearly ready for finishing touches. I only had to file it down to its original round shape. That was done with the help of a files 🙂</p>

<p>When I finally had a base rebuilt, I had to make a clip sockets in its original places. To do that, I had to cut down a Dremel tool to a proper size.</p>

<p>After making slots, I could start trying on the bottom part against the top. Unfortunately, one of the hooks snapped off during the process 🙁</p>
<p>I had to fix it first. I’ve made it out of a metal paper clip that was cut down to size and welded in a top case.</p>

<h4>Epoxy resin and finishing</h4>
<p>After all the above work was done, I’ve mixed a cup of thin epoxy resin to fill in hard to access gaps and spots. It also helped to smoothen all uneven surfaces. The resin was applied to all spots with brass mesh with a plastic pipette.</p>

<p>Once the resin cured, I’ve applied a layer of spray putty which helped me to spot all minor mistakes and correct them with finishing putty and 400 grit sandpaper.</p>

<p>After another round of putty and sanding, I’ve applied black undercoating which was then wet-sanded with 1000 grit this time.</p>

<p>Finally, I could apply the last two layers of custom made spray paint. This paint color exactly matches the original. These custom spray paints for various computers will be available in my <a href="https://retrohax.net/">webshop</a> soon. The first series of spray paints will include the following colors:</p>
<ul><li> Atari XL Beige</li><li> Atari XE/ST Gray</li><li> Commodore 64C Beige</li><li> Amiga 500 Beige </li></ul>

<h4>Badges and plastics</h4>
<p>Due to its age, paint from a badge chipped off during removal so I had to fix it. I’ve used a standard black marker to cover all these tiny spots. Later, I’ve removed old glue from the rubber base and applied fresh double-sided adhesive tape on both rubber and badge.</p>

<p>I also had to address other scratched plastic parts. That was easily fixed by applying a thin layer of silicone oil.</p>

<h4>Keyboard cleaning</h4>
<p>Obviously, all keycaps had to be clean. This time, I had to remove every single keycap and clean it individually. It took a while to get it done properly 🙂</p>

<p>Don’t ask me why so late but this is the moment when I’ve realized there is a major failure :/</p>
<p>I’ve no idea why I didn’t spot it earlier. After assembly, it turned out that there is a small gap between parts. It is barely visible and only from a side of the case but I was pissed off at myself that I didn’t spot it and fix it before the case was painted.</p>

<p>Obviously, I didn’t have any spray paint left.</p>
<h4>The grand finale</h4>
<p>This restoration was rather time-consuming. It took more or less 15 workdays. This is because I had to wait for chemistry to fully cure before moving on to the next step.</p>
<p>So here it is. Fully restored Commodore SX-64 keyboard for Carrion. Hopefully, he will like it 🙂</p>

With no need to remember a password or prove email ownership, <a href="https://medium.com/@kelvinvanamstel/should-we-embrace-magic-links-and-leave-passwords-alone-c73db7007fc4">many</a> <a href="https://techbeacon.com/security/your-passwordless-future-make-it-sooner-rather-later">people</a> have hailed "Magic Link" as the perfect authentication solution.</p><p>How it works on SnapHabit? After a user enters their enter email address, we direct them to their inbox to tap a link to sign in. Before diving into what went wrong, here's a snapshot of our authentication funnel:</p><ul><li><strong>11% of users</strong> required at least 4 magic-link emails before completing signing up.</li><li><strong>18% of users never finished signup (clicked the magic link)</strong>. On average, these users attempted signup twice, with several users submitting &gt; 10 times.</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="-why-would-you-use-magic-link-anyways">... why would you use magic link, anyways?</h2><p>Friends are core to SnapHabit, so the functionality to send a friend request is critical. Phone number or email felt like the cheapest way to support a unique identifier — as it could be used for both authentication and finding a friend.</p><p>Like most services, we first looked at using "Sign in with Google/Facebook". However, Apple recently adjusted App Store Guidelines... starting June 30, <strong>"apps that use a social login service ... must also offer Sign in with Apple"</strong></p><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-17-at-3.47.00-PM-2.png"><figcaption>App Store Guidelines, June 17, 2020</figcaption></figure><p>Apple Sign In supports <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210425">"Hide My Email"</a>, so many users who sign in with Apple would not have a meaningful email attached to their account. Asking for a user's email after they chose to "hide it" would be a poor user experience.</p><p>So in summary, we had 4 options for account creation:</p><ol><li><strong>Email + Password</strong> ... requires forgot password and users to prove email ownership</li><li><strong>Support all third-party (Apple, Google, Facebook)</strong> ... and add a new unique identifier to allow friends to find each other, given email will not be sufficient</li><li><strong>Phone number magic link</strong> ... we were relying on Expo (previously did not support phone-number auth), and we also felt emails would be a good/cheap tool for communication</li><li><strong>Email magic link</strong> </li></ol><p>Email magic link felt... perfect! &nbsp;We built the login flow, complete with a custom email, instructional webpage, and deep linking. <strong>Hurrah, we had cracked the authentication funnel!</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QoS2-mIuOZw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="what-went-wrong-and-how-we-tried-to-solve">What went wrong and how we tried to solve</h2><p><em>If you're interested in the technical details of how we implemented some of these fixes, let me know and we'll consider publishing.</em></p><h3 id="1-users-clicking-the-link-on-another-device-">1. Users clicking the link on another device.</h3><p>Of 10 users we chatted with who had issues, 4 tried to click the link on another device. There are two routes to solving this:</p><ul><li>technical solution to support this behavior (clicking the link on desktop will authenticate the user on mobile)</li><li>better instructional text</li></ul><p><strong>The latter was simpler, so we started with that:</strong></p><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/06/firstattempt.png"></figure><p><strong>And again.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/06/email.png"></figure><p><strong>And more.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/06/landingpage.png"></figure><h3 id="2-user-confusion-about-clicking-a-link-to-login">2. User confusion about clicking a link to login</h3><p>At least 2 people mentioned they simply did not understand that they needed to authenticate with email. &nbsp;To solve this, we added</p><ul><li>call-to-action to open Apple Mail or Gmail</li><li>disabled the "resend" button for 10 seconds, to encourage users to tap the mail CTA before attempting login again</li></ul><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/06/buttons.png"></figure><h3 id="3-users-entering-the-wrong-email">3. Users entering the wrong email</h3><p>Many users who did not finish finish signing up (eg. did not click email link) had accounts with a ".con" domain. &nbsp;We added an notice to alert users of a possibly unintended typo:</p><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/06/dotcon.png"></figure><h2 id="-what-s-next">... What's next</h2><div><p>Despite attempting to solve 1, 2 and 3, our funnel drop-off is still larger than we'd like (~15% of users do not open the email correctly).</p><p>So after two months of solution hackery, we're cutting our losses and adding sign in with Google, Facebook and Apple options. If we still see users opting for email sign-in and failing to complete, we'll consider making the full-circle shift back to an email/password model.<br><strong><br>I hope our sharing this painful journey can save you from taking a similar path!</strong> &nbsp;Let me know if you have any questions or feedback at <a href="https://snaphabit.app/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="107a717b7550637e716078717279643e7160603e">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></p></div><hr><p><em>Don't have SnapHabit yet?

The release of custom Apple chips, powered by ARM, comes after a long history of using Intel-based chips, for the greater part of the 21st century.</p><p id="0fc0">Modeled after Apple’s use of its own chips on the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, the company is switching to its own chips to give the Mac more performance per watt and better GPU performance.</p><p id="ecaf">Though we won’t go in-depth into the specific implications for machine learning, there’s a lot to be excited about when it comes to the future of ML development on Mac. Inevitably, the enhanced GPU performance will be a boon to machine learning developers, with benefits ranging from faster model training to reduced reliance on transfer learning. It will be interesting to see how ML engineers capitalize on Apple Silicon over time.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="10c8">The Mac, often considered Apple’s flagship lineup, has seen a couple changes in the past. Let’s look at what those changes were and how they’ve contributed to the evolution of the Mac.</p><h2 id="114e">Motorola 68K to PowerPC</h2><p id="d699">One of the earliest transitions in chip architecture was the transition from Motorola 68K chips to IBM and Motorola PowerPC chips. This was an incredible transition, which significantly improved the Mac and played an important role in understanding future transitions.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*gf2Y6U112riltsrAmT6VaA.png?q=20" width="780" height="439" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1560/1*gf2Y6U112riltsrAmT6VaA.png" width="780" height="439" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*gf2Y6U112riltsrAmT6VaA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*gf2Y6U112riltsrAmT6VaA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*gf2Y6U112riltsrAmT6VaA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*gf2Y6U112riltsrAmT6VaA.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>The original iMac with a PowerPC processor.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="ed43">PowerPC to Intel x86</h2><p id="6ac1">The most notable transition was the move from PowerPC chips to Intel processors, which have been used for almost half of the Mac’s history so far. With this transition, Apple announced a developer kit to help with the transition, similar to what they announced in the switch to Apple Silicon.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*YIIun0yR2job_s0MRzSINg.png?q=20" width="1200" height="675" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*YIIun0yR2job_s0MRzSINg.png" width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*YIIun0yR2job_s0MRzSINg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*YIIun0yR2job_s0MRzSINg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*YIIun0yR2job_s0MRzSINg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*YIIun0yR2job_s0MRzSINg.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>A recent, Intel-based MacBook Pro.</figcaption></figure></div></div></section><hr><section></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="4c63">Undoubtedly, a switch to ARM-based Macs has a huge advantage for the performance and usability of Macs. Let’s look at how Apple Silicon will improve the Mac’s experience.</p><h2 id="71ef">Performance per Watt</h2><p id="e98c">Apple Silicon promises a stark improvement in performance per watt, meaning that the Mac could potentially promise desktop-level performance with the power consumption of a notebook computer, as exemplified by Apple’s diagram:</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*485W2PItyV9fz4UiWem0eQ.png?q=20" width="1720" height="953" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3440/1*485W2PItyV9fz4UiWem0eQ.png" width="1720" height="953" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*485W2PItyV9fz4UiWem0eQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*485W2PItyV9fz4UiWem0eQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*485W2PItyV9fz4UiWem0eQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*485W2PItyV9fz4UiWem0eQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Performance per watt for Apple Silicon</figcaption></figure><h2 id="95f4">Native Apps</h2><p id="b37d">Apps that support Apple Silicon natively will perform best on the new ARM-based Macs. Out-of-the-box, Apple’s own apps, including pro apps like Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro, will have native support for Apple Silicon. In addition, through their collaboration with Adobe, the Creative Cloud Suite will also have native support from the get-go. Eventually, Microsoft Office and other widely used programs will be able to take advantage of Apple Silicon’s performance.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*AkSiIGraS55x_sZV5vt6_A.png?q=20" width="1080" height="607" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2160/1*AkSiIGraS55x_sZV5vt6_A.png" width="1080" height="607" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*AkSiIGraS55x_sZV5vt6_A.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*AkSiIGraS55x_sZV5vt6_A.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*AkSiIGraS55x_sZV5vt6_A.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*AkSiIGraS55x_sZV5vt6_A.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Photoshop running natively on an ARM-based Mac.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="2e35">iOS Apps on Mac</h2><p id="3611">Another incredible benefit of using the ARM architecture across iOS, macOS, and watchOS is the ability to run iOS apps natively on Apple Silicon Macs.

By using Universal 2 in Xcode, developers will be able to use the same binary for both Intel-based Macs, while providing a native experience for those who are using a Mac with Apple Silicon.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*4Krp5sFt3beXnXbpuenl9Q.png?q=20" width="3360" height="2100" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/6720/1*4Krp5sFt3beXnXbpuenl9Q.png" width="3360" height="2100" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*4Krp5sFt3beXnXbpuenl9Q.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*4Krp5sFt3beXnXbpuenl9Q.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*4Krp5sFt3beXnXbpuenl9Q.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*4Krp5sFt3beXnXbpuenl9Q.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Universal 2 for the same binary for Intel and ARM-based Macs.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="38e9">Rosetta 2</h2><p id="49cb">An upgrade from their previous version of Rosetta (for the Intel transition), Rosetta 2 provides similar capabilities as its previous counterpart — allowing Intel-based apps to run on Apple Silicon Macs.

The Mac Mini will have 16GB of memory and a 512GB SSD — plenty for development needs. Also, macOS Big Sur and Xcode 12 will come pre-installed on the machine, which will be available for $500 (half the price of the Intel transition kit).</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*hpX5lvJahDiZXZxjGDDLMQ.png?q=20" width="1080" height="607" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2160/1*hpX5lvJahDiZXZxjGDDLMQ.png" width="1080" height="607" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*hpX5lvJahDiZXZxjGDDLMQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*hpX5lvJahDiZXZxjGDDLMQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*hpX5lvJahDiZXZxjGDDLMQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*hpX5lvJahDiZXZxjGDDLMQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Apple’s Mac Mini Based Developer Transition Kit</figcaption></figure><p id="de05">While Apple isn’t completely transitioning to Apple Silicon just yet, the announcement of their ARM-based chip for Mac is a huge step in a two year process to change Mac for the better.</p><p id="04c2">Stay tuned for some great new tutorials on the latest frameworks this week, and get ahead of the crowd by taking use of them before they’re released to the public in the fall.</p><p id="3993">In case you missed it, here’s the Keynote in all its glory:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="6139">Be sure to <strong>smash that “clap” button</strong> as many times as you can, <strong>share this article</strong> on social media, and <strong>follow me on Twitter.</strong></p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="d325"><em>Editor’s Note:</em><a href="http://heartbeat.fritz.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em> </em><strong><em>Heartbeat</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong><em>is a contributor-driven online publication and community dedicated to exploring the emerging intersection of mobile app development and machine learning.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post_body_1565683">

    
      <div><p>Facebook censorship has effectively barred my business from their platform and is materially impacting the livelihood of my customers.</p>
<p>For the past decade, Iâ€™ve run an online portfolio business on the side called <a href="https://foliohd.com/" target="_blank">FolioHD</a>. (You get a subdomain on the platform to host your portfolio, like mine at <a href="http://watilo.foliohd.com/">watilo.foliohd.com</a>.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have no insight into the offending content, and the offending content can be anything from a nippleÂ&nbsp;to now apparently <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jun/23/project-veritas-facebook-sting-moderators-brag-abo/" target="_blank">even a MAGA hat</a>.</p>
<p>Now I am personally blocked on Instagram from liking photos or sending DMs. I canâ€™t sign into my company Instagram account. And Facebook has reached into my Pageâ€™s support inbox and removed private message between myself and customers.<br></p><p><b>How I noticed</b></p><p>A few weeks ago, I was scrolling through my personal Instagram and double-tapped a photo. Instead of seeing a red heart, I received this message.<br></p><p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/3509ecd9-6aeb-4004-b042-0d782cec404c/Screenshot_20200620-0840172.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200627%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200627T171501Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=534498c02cd6adf24abad8b4848915ab86e2fc90c2bc390e986a256de8d3e10f&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Screenshot_20200620-0840172.png%22" title="Image: https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/3509ecd9-6aeb-4004-b042-0d782cec404c/Screenshot_20200620-0840172.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200627%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200627T171501Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=534498c02cd6adf24abad8b4848915ab86e2fc90c2bc390e986a256de8d3e10f&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Screenshot_20200620-0840172.png%22"><br></p><p>Tapping â€œTell usâ€� simply says, â€œThanks for reporting this issue.â€�</p>
<p>In my Instagram bio is a link to my personal portfolio, <a href="http://watilo.foliohd.com/">watilo.foliohd.com</a>. Because of this link, I effectively became completely blocked from interacting with anyone on Instagram.<br></p><p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/9db49566-898e-4743-a776-f38d5d97de0f/Screenshot_20200603-071310.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200627%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200627T171521Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=fe284180ac384a5fcc2a2e80620b1591f6591c68f53de08d85c8379d579c0332&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Screenshot_20200603-071310.png%22"><br></p><p>As the result of a single person sharing a link to a portfolio that Facebook deemed to have offensive content, they have now blocked the entire <a href="http://foliohd.com/">foliohd.com</a> domain.</p>
<p>It even prevented me from sending direct messages with ANY links.<br></p><p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e21b85f5-439c-4956-b8f1-5f3d7af98cc4/Screenshot_20200619-2203122.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200627%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200627T171544Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=7871c844ed24cdd872248679c05a4d8f3839c5a86be8849fe1467fa70036467f&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Screenshot_20200619-2203122.png%22"><br></p><p>In order to restore my personal Instagram account, Iâ€™d have to remove the URL from my bio.</p>
<p>Using Facebookâ€™s Sharing Debugger confirms the URL was blocked on the entire Facebook ecosystem.<br></p><p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/ad2152fc-2508-4d44-af6b-6919b7aa6879/7474EA49-DE9C-431B-AA3B-2FCFCB41C0D6.jpeg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200627%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200627T171615Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=b09b9fa953466ec52e76fe5e106c82fe45b016c76167b551bbc2ef98a7a6da40&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%227474EA49-DE9C-431B-AA3B-2FCFCB41C0D6.jpeg%22"><br></p><p>Of course Facebook has a way to report this issue on their developer site, but we know where those messages go. (A giant black hole.)<br></p><p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/381da3b4-f1cc-43fa-9d47-8eac7fd20337/77F62DF6-5BFE-43BA-BC3D-5A21AC463B26.jpeg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200627%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200627T171640Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=84831d9fcbca7433e84e476e3d8df870cbd7f76029a8940b60466264e883cfeb&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%2277F62DF6-5BFE-43BA-BC3D-5A21AC463B26.jpeg%22"><br></p><p>But the problems donâ€™t end there. Since Instagram has been seamlessly integrated into the Facebook ecosystem, any account containing a blocked URL on Facebook has related consequences on Instagram.</p>
<p>I canâ€™t sign into the FolioHD Instagram account, because Facebook wonâ€™t send a security code by email, presumably because it has <a href="http://foliohd.com/">foliohd.com</a> in the email.<br></p><p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e202aab8-6473-434f-ae77-76d2d35af868/0AEC68F1-F197-4BE2-9DD7-2ECB093730AB.jpeg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200627%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200627T171702Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=604194c7fa9965b2b07f147e2f57aefa4f404cb93aa07187f1fae7bbf69e0f8c&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%220AEC68F1-F197-4BE2-9DD7-2ECB093730AB.jpeg%22"><br></p><p>But it gets worse: Visiting the FolioHD Facebook support inbox has led me to discover that Facebook is removing private messages between customers and myself, because they contain a link to <a href="http://foliohd.com/" target="_blank">foliohd.com</a> inside of them.<br></p><div id="posthaven_gallery[1591206]">

<p>Iâ€™m thankful I donâ€™t rely on the Facebook support inbox, but I do have an auto-reply set up for anyone who sends a message there, directing them to contact support via <a href="http://foliohd.com/">foliohd.com</a>.</p>
<p>Since Facebook is blocking links, that auto-reply no longer gets sent.</p>
<p>Any social posts created through a Buffer-style service, even using a bitly link, gets posted briefly, then removed, with no notice.</p>
<p>And the worst part: there is no way to resolve this.</p>
<p>Now my customers can no longer share links to their websites within the Facebook ecosystem. They had nothing to do with this, and yet their businesses are being affected.<br></p><p><b>My ask</b></p><p>My request to Facebook would be to reconsider how they handle sites with user-generated content, in the same way Google handles it in their index. If a subdomain contains offending content, it shouldnâ€™t poison the root domain and every other subdomain.</p>
<p>And Facebook should probably never weasel their way into private company inboxes to remove content retroactively. You break the trust of any business by pulling these kind of moves. How can we rely on you for anything if your censorship is a moving target?</p>
<p>And if anyone knows how to get Facebook to fix this, please let me know. Short of filing a lawsuit, Iâ€™m not sure how to get this resolved.<br></p></div>

<p>We present a simple to use implementation of networking across ultrasonic frequencies, by making use of Gnuradio and a microphone and speakers. This allows you to use <strong>TCP/IP</strong>,<strong>UDP</strong> across an audio link.</p>



<p>In order to follow this tutorial we recommend you use the LiveDVD release of Gnuradio (which is basically a Ubuntu distribution, with gnuradio already installed). This is easily downloadable from <a href="https://gnuradio.org/redmine/news/31">http://gnuradio.org/redmine/news/31</a>. First of all you will need to download the patch we made to Gnuradio, to a USB stick. You can download the patch from <a href="https://github.com/anfractuosity/ultrasonicnetworking/archive/master.zip">https://github.com/anfractuosity/ultrasonicnetworking/archive/master.zip</a>. In order to use the patch, you need to be root, so type <strong>‘sudo bash’</strong>, then unzip the patch, and simply run setup.sh, by typing <strong>./setup.sh</strong>. The setup file simply patches the Gnuradio packet encoder and decoder, in order to support variable length packets.</p>



<p>After running <strong>setup.py</strong>, you can then initialise Gnuradio, which you need to run as root, so do <strong>sudo gnuradio-companion</strong>. And then load a.grc on your first laptop.</p>



<p><strong>Figure 1</strong> depicts our graph which enables us to perform the ultrasonic networking. We will now describe how the graph functions through each block. The first block in the top left, is the TUNTAP PDU, this allows you to create a virtual network interface, through which we can send and receive packets.</p>



<p>We use the “PDU to tagged Stream” block to convert the packets received from the virtual NIC, into a byte stream for the packet encoder to process. We can’t directly attach the output of the tagged stream to the GFSK modulator, as we need to add a checksum, through the use of CRC and also we need to add a preamble and header onto the packet – this is all achieved through the use of the packet encoder.</p>



<p>A preamble is essentially a series of bits, which can be detected at the receiver end, in order to correctly align bits, to the correct byte boundaries. The packet encoder, also adds a header after the preamble, which states how long the packet is, in bytes.</p>

<p>The GFSK modulator essentially performs Frequency Shift Keying modulation. As you can see in <strong>Figure 2</strong>, the frequency of the modulated signal is lower, when a ‘0’ is being sent, than a ‘1’ being sent. We found that in the context of ultrasonic networking using laptops and microphones, that FSK performed better than PSK (Phase Shift Keying – which uses phase changes, to communicate bits), which is another modulation technique.</p>

<p><strong>Fig. 2 (courtesy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fsk.svg">wikipedia</a>)</strong></p>



<p>A very important aspect of the GFSK block is the number of Samples/Symbol. We set this to a value of 9. This means that for each symbol received by the modulator, 9 samples are generated. The higher this number the more resilient the signal is to noise, but consequentially the lower the baud rate (which essentially means the longer it takes to send packets).<br>Baud rate refers to the number of symbols which are transferred per second.</p>



<p>We then use the rational resampler block, to make the signal further resilient. For every sample in, it generates 320 out.</p>



<p>We use a frequency-translating FIR filter, to translate the frequency of the incoming signal. We shift the signal by -carrier_tx, which is -19kHz in this example. This is so that the signal is just outside of the human range of hearing.</p>



<p>As we have been working with complex signals at this point, we need to convert the complex output into a floating point output for the audio card, we achieve this through the use of a ‘Complex to Real’ block.</p>



<p>The bottom part of the graph, depicts the receiver section of the program. It essentially performs the same functions, but in reverse.<br>However there are two additional blocks after the ‘Float to complex’ block. The multiply const block, allows you to multiply the output from the microphone by a fixed number. The block after this is a bandpass filter, to only allow a small range of frequencies to pass through to the demodulator, this helps remove a large amount of noise which is present from the microphone’s output.</p>



<p>In <strong>Figure 3</strong>, you will see that there are two graphs. The top graph, depicts the output sent to the transmitter and the bottom graph depicts the input received from the microphone (after a bandpass filter has mean applied to it). There is also a slider present at the top which allows you to multiply the signal from the microphone by a specific value. This is useful when using 2 laptops which are a greater distance away from each other.</p>

<p><strong>Fig. 3</strong><br></p>







<p>Figure 4 depicts the full duplex signalling we use. You can see that we transmit in this example at two different frequencies, 19kHz and 18kHz. This allows both laptops to send their own signal simultaneously.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/clip.png"><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/clip.png" alt="clip"></a></figure>



<p><strong>Fig. 4</strong><br></p>







<p>In Gnuradio-companion, you will need to go to Build &gt; Execute, in order to execute the graph. You then need to assign an IP address to the tap0 interface it creates for you. You need to do this through a terminal, typing <strong>sudo ifconfig tap0 192.168.1.10</strong> for instance.</p>



<p>You need to perform the same steps on your second laptop, B, but instead this time loading b.grc, and using <strong>sudo ifconfig tap0 192.168.1.20</strong>.</p>



<p>We found it was best to assign ARP entries manually to each laptop. In order to assign an ARP entry, on laptop A, <strong>arp -s 192.168.1.20 &lt;Laptop B’s MAC address for tap0&gt; -i tap0</strong></p>



<p>The setup script, which you have initialised on both laptops copied the patched files to Gnuradio, as well as modifying TCP options, in order to allow TCP/IP to work across a very laggy network.</p>


<pre title="">echo 100 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syn_retries
echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies
echo 100 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_synack_retries
</pre>


<p>The first line is necessary in order to enable a client side TCP connection to stay open longer than the default of 20 seconds, before closing.</p>







<p>In order to test the network is functioning correctly we recommend using netcat. To test out TCP/IP connectivity Use <strong>netcat -vv -l 10000</strong> on Laptop A, and connect to it from Laptop B, using <strong>netcat -vv 192.168.1.10 10000</strong>. Because we are using the verbose options, netcat will inform you when a connection to Laptop A has been established, you can then send text from either laptop to the other one.</p>







<p>As the packet encoder and decoder provided by Gnuradio only work with fixed amounts of data, it was necessary to modify them to support the reading of stream tags. The “PDU to tagged stream” tags packets from the tap interface with their size. The packet encoder/decoder can’t process these tags normally, so we altered the packet encoder, to read these tags, and generate the appropriate sized packet from the tap0 frame. The packet decoder, then unencapsulates the packet, and tags the resulting data, with its size.</p>







<p>To give you an idea of the latencies involved please click on the image below, which shows you a wireshark screenshot, showing the server side of a TCP/IP connection. You’ll see it’s slow!</p>

<p>If anyone’s got any suggestions for improvements to the Gnuradio patch I’d be most appreciative (the patch itself was done very quickly).</p>







<p>The following video is from a previous experiment I did to simply test whether we could send data at 23kHz .</p>



<figure><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/H0DKRl8XIcU" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></figure>







<p>Minimodem looks like a great program, but as far as I’m aware it supports only FSK. I was keen to try different modulation schemes, which Gnuradio provides many of; I originally tried the setup with PSK.</p>



<p>Also this provided me with an introduction into how some of the techniques used for Software Defined Radio work.</p>

    <div>
        <p>I wanted to publish this blog post as an extension of my PyCon 2020 poster
of the same name with more information than I could fit in the poster.</p>

<p>I've also recently completed a migration of the
<a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-py">Elasticsearch client library</a>
to <a href="https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/async.html">support both sync and async I/O</a>
using some of these techniques.</p>

<p>I hope that my findings will help you on your own journeys :)</p>

<h2>Setting the Stage</h2>

<p>At PyCon 2016 there was a talk named “Building Protocol Libraries The Right Way”
by Cory Benfield that laid out how protocol libraries can be reusable across
projects, more easily verified, and work with both asynchronous and synchronous
I/O by following the sans-I/O design pattern.</p>

<p>Since that talk there have been many protocol implementations using this principle
including HTTP/1.1, 2 and 3, WebSockets, and more. Now that the protocol libraries
are here let’s start developing libraries designed for async and sync I/O!</p>

<h2>Problems You May Run Into</h2>

<p>On the way towards supporting sync and async here is a list of problems
that most projects will run into:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don’t want API differences between async and sync or to maintain two
code-bases of similar code.</li>
<li>Properties and constructors must be synchronous.</li>
<li>Supporting multiple async libraries is a lot of work.</li>
<li>Async functions are different from sync standard library functions.</li>
<li>Classes may be instantiated without a running event loop.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Figure out where I/O Happens in your API</h3>

<p>The first steps are to figure out which parts of your API need
to handle I/O and what that means for the rest of your API.
Any function that handles I/O all the way down the chain will need
to be async. Explore library structure without putting too much work
into filling in details. Make sure that the types of your API match
up with how users would have to interact with the library, think about
async context managers and generators.</p>

<h3>Async not compatible with Constructors or Properties</h3>

<p>When you’re designing your API most functions can be async without issue,
however there is one important one that can’t be: <code>__init__()</code>. This can
cause problems when you have to call an async function as a part of setup.
A way around this is a factory function that can be async or delaying any
setup that requires async until after you're guaranteed to have an active
event loop (like within an async function).</p>

<p>The issue is even trickier because if your API is meant to be instantiated
within the global scope, for example to be used as a client within a web service.
Then you can’t make any async calls on instantiation because you won’t have an active
event loop.</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>from</span> <span>fastapi</span> <span>import</span> <span>FastAPI</span>
<span>from</span> <span>elasticsearch</span> <span>import</span> <span>AsyncElasticsearch</span>

<span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>FastAPI</span><span>()</span>

<span># Most users will want to define their APIs in the</span>
<span># global scope where there isn't a running event loop ...</span>
<span>es</span> <span>=</span> <span>AsyncElasticsearch</span><span>()</span>

<span>@app</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>)</span>
<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>index</span><span>():</span>
    <span># ... so we can delay our async setup until an</span>
    <span># async function called for the first time.</span>
    <span>resp</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>es</span><span>.</span><span>search</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Using @property is also sync-only and so should either be converted to a
function or design your API such that all results are awaited /
populated before using properties.</p>

<h2>Useful Libraries for Async + Sync Support</h2>

<p>Each library solves one of two problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support both async and sync in the same codebase</li>
<li>Support multiple async libraries (Asyncio, Trio)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’d like to view a simple project using all of these tools together
I have created one on GitHub.</p>

<h3>Unasync</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/python-trio/unasync/">Unasync</a>
is a library that tokenizes your Python code, transforms tokens for
async code into their synchronous counterparts, and then re-renders the new
synchronous code into a corresponding file.</p>

<p>See the code examples on the right for some of the tokens that unasync transforms:</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span># Classed prefixed with 'AsyncX...' are helpfully</span>
<span># renamed to 'SyncX...' for simpler imports.</span>
<span>class</span> <span>AsyncClass</span><span>:</span> <span>...</span>   <span># -&gt; class SyncClass: ...</span>

<span># async/await is handled by removing the</span>
<span># async and await keywords.</span>
<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>f</span><span>():</span> <span>...</span>              <span># -&gt; def f(): ...</span>
<span>ret</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>f</span><span>()</span>                 <span># -&gt; ret = f()</span>

<span># Async context managers are transformed</span>
<span># into regular context managers.</span>
<span>async</span> <span>with</span> <span>ctx</span><span>():</span> <span>...</span>           <span># with ctx(): ...</span>
<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>__aenter__</span><span>():</span> <span>...</span>     <span># def __enter__(): ...</span>
<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>__aexit__</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>_</span><span>):</span> <span>...</span>    <span># def __exit__(*_): ...</span>

<span># Async iterators are transformed into</span>
<span># regular iterators.</span>
<span>await</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>__aiter__</span><span>()</span>             <span># -&gt; x.__iter__()</span>
<span>await</span> <span>iter</span><span>.</span><span>__anext__</span><span>()</span>          <span># -&gt; iter.__next__()</span>
<span>async</span> <span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>...</span>           <span># -&gt; for x in y: ...</span>
<span>StopAsyncIteration</span>              <span># -&gt; StopIteration</span>

<span># Typing annotations, notice unasync also</span>
<span># handles forward annotations within strings.</span>
<span>def</span> <span>f</span><span>():</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"AsyncClass"</span><span>:</span> <span>...</span>   <span># -&gt; def f() -&gt; "SyncClass": ...</span>
<span>typing</span><span>.</span><span>AsyncIterator</span>            <span># -&gt; typing.Iterator</span>
<span>typing</span><span>.</span><span>AsyncGenerator</span>           <span># -&gt; typing.Generator</span>
<span>typing</span><span>.</span><span>AsyncIterable</span>            <span># -&gt; typing.Iterable</span>

<span># There are some async statements that don't</span>
<span># have a direct sync counterpart so unasync</span>
<span># can't do anything with them.</span>
<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>__await__</span><span>():</span> <span>...</span>      <span># -&gt; ???</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>After adding support for both sync and async the next step is supporting
multiple async libraries. The libraries commonly used in the Python community
are asyncio, Trio, Twisted, and Curio.</p>

<p>Supporting all of these is a challenge but can be made easier with
the following two libraries:</p>

<h3>Sniffio</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/python-trio/sniffio">Sniffio</a>
is a library that can detect which async library your code is running under.
The package can detect asyncio, Trio, and Curio. By detecting which library is
running you then know which library-specific APIs can be used safely.</p>

<p>This also means you can lazily import ‘trio’ only when Trio is detected as the
current async library. No need to make Trio a direct dependency.</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span> <span>sniffio</span>

<span>try</span><span>:</span>
    <span># Detect the current async library</span>
    <span>async_lib</span> <span>=</span> <span>sniffio</span><span>.</span><span>current_async_library</span><span>()</span>

    <span># Lazily-load so users don't need 'trio'</span>
    <span># installed to use 'asyncio'.</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>async_lib</span> <span>==</span> <span>"asyncio"</span><span>:</span>
        <span>import</span> <span>asyncio</span>
        <span># &lt;asyncio-specific code&gt;</span>
    <span>elif</span> <span>async_lib</span> <span>==</span> <span>"trio"</span><span>:</span>
        <span>import</span> <span>trio</span>
        <span># &lt;trio-specific code&gt;</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>RuntimeError</span><span>(</span>
            <span>f</span><span>"Unsupported async library: </span><span>{</span><span>async_lib</span><span>!r}</span><span>"</span>
        <span>)</span>
<span>except</span> <span>sniffio</span><span>.</span><span>AsyncLibraryNotFoundError</span><span>:</span>
    <span>raise</span> <span>RuntimeError</span><span>(</span>
        <span>"Couldn't detect async library"</span>
    <span>)</span> <span>from</span> <span>None</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>A pattern I’ve found useful is to group all library-specific code into one file
each that all have an identical API. That way you can call sniffio’s detection
one time and know which set of APIs should be used for the duration of the program.</p>

<h3>AnyIO</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/agronholm/anyio">AnyIO</a>
is a library that provides a single interface that can be used
interchangeably from asyncio, Trio, and Curio programs.</p>

<p>For most projects trying to support multiple async libraries this
should be your first stop.</p>

<p>The interfaces that are provided include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Structured Concurrency Primitives</li>
<li>Synchronization Primitives</li>
<li>Networking (TCP / TLS / UDP)</li>
<li>Asynchronous File I/O</li>
<li>Signals and Threads</li>
</ul>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span> <span>anyio</span>

<span># Task Groups</span>
<span>async</span> <span>with</span> <span>anyio</span><span>.</span><span>create_task_group</span><span>()</span> <span>as</span> <span>group</span><span>:</span>

<span>await</span> <span>sock</span><span>.</span><span>receive</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>AnyIO also provides its own pytest plugin ‘pytest-anyio’ that makes
writing test cases for multiple async libraries a breeze.</p>

<p>AnyIO uses Sniffio under the hood to detect which async library is being
used and provide the correct implementation.</p>

<p>You can read AnyIO’s documentation for a list of all features and usages.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>A digital feed is an online stream of content which gets updated as new content is pushed by the feed’s sources. Generally, content is created by users on the social media platform, to be consumed by their followers.</p>
<p>All popular social media platforms feature some type of feed: Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Facebook. Operators of these platforms benefit from increased engagement by their users, so they employ techniques designed to achieve that end. Unfortunately, they often do so at the expense of their users’ well-being. Below are 7 rules to help you retain control over your screen time, without having to leave social media for good, ordered from most important to least important.</p>
<h2 id="rule-1-avoid-non-chronological-feeds">Rule #1: Avoid non-chronological feeds</h2>
<p>On most online platforms, the order of content is determined by an algorithm designed to maximize user engagement, i.e. addict you and keep you looking at ads for as long as possible. Examples: Facebook news feed, Twitter “top tweets”, Instagram explore tab, Tiktok.</p>

<p>Your phone is always within your reach. Access feeds only on your laptop, in order not to condition yourself to constantly check it. Don’t install social media or video apps on your phone.</p>
<h2 id="rule-3-follow-with-purpose">Rule #3: Follow with purpose</h2>
<p>Your digital experience changes with each new person/source you follow. Be mindful about the utility of the information you would obtain before following a new source.</p>
<h2 id="rule-4-limit-the-number-of-peoplethings-you-follow">Rule #4: Limit the number of people/things you follow</h2>
<p>The amount of content you will have to go through increases roughly linearly with the number of sources you follow. You probably won’t see everything your 500 followees share—maybe it’s time to unfollow some of them.</p>
<h2 id="rule-5-schedule-and-limit-your-exposure">Rule #5: Schedule and limit your exposure</h2>
<p>Your brain has a limited capacity to process and hold information. Schedule a certain hour of the day to receive it, and don’t surpass it. Example: No more than 30 minutes of social media, restricted to 10–11 am.</p>
<h2 id="rule-6-block-generously-and-ruthlessly">Rule #6: Block generously and ruthlessly</h2>
<p>If you don’t like what you’re seeing, block or unfollow <em>immediately</em>. This is the hardest when someone posts content that is sometimes useful, but otherwise annoying too. Generally, we put up with it for too long until we block someone.</p>
<h2 id="rule-7-mute-words">Rule #7: Mute words</h2>
<p>Avoid toxic memes by muting related words, e.g. Trump, ISIS. This will filter out any post that contains that word. Click <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/muted_keywords">here</a> to do it on Twitter now—it’s easy.</p>
<p>Follow these simple set of rules, and restore your control over social media and your digital experience in no time.</p>

					<p>I made a little something after encountering a clogged up toilet and a hostel cleaner who looked frustrated. Perhaps you never even considered your toilet paper’s destiny… but should you flush the toilet paper? I made a cool flowchart to help you determine whether to bin it or flush it! Follow these easy steps:</p>
<div id="attachment_2187"><p><img title="Should you?" src="https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flushing-flowchart-410x1024.png" alt="should I flush the toilet paper travel flowchart world map" width="600" height="1500" srcset="https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flushing-flowchart-410x1024.png 410w, https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flushing-flowchart-138x345.png 138w, https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flushing-flowchart.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-lazy-src="https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flushing-flowchart-410x1024.png" data-lazy-srcset="https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flushing-flowchart-410x1024.png 410w, https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flushing-flowchart-138x345.png 138w, https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flushing-flowchart.png 800w"></p><p><em>Want this infographic on your blog/website? Scroll down to find out how!</em></p></div>
<p>But really. Clogged toilets and sewage systems are a huge problem in many parts of the world – and the traveler isn’t helping the cause. I’ve met a few travelers who were proud to announce they would straight up refuse to bin their used toilet paper when there was a sign kindly asking them not to. They thought not flushing it was gross <i title="You know what’s really gross? A toilet that is overflowing with water. A clogged up sewage system that makes you unable to flush a used toilet&nbsp;FOR DAYS. Having to send a person down into the sewer to get rid of the blockage is gross. People who clog up toilets for no good reason but their own comfort are gross. There, I said it."></i> to put it in a bin, and that was that.</p>
<p>Especially in Latin America, there’s written signs in the stalls to kindly ask you to not flush the paper, but not always. Many people think that the absence of a sign means you can flush the paper, but really, it doesn’t. Get into the habit of binning the paper as soon as possible upon arrival to your destination. It’s really just a matter of flipping a switch in your head, but it will go a long way. Being a ‘responsible traveler’ means more than just not disrupting communities, it also means not disrupting people’s (sometimes basic) infrastructure.</p>
<h3>Toilet Paper Flushing World Map</h3>
<p>So you don’t like my flowchart? Well then I went and did the Flying Spaghetti Monster’s work and made a world map using the data of <a href="http://wheredoiputthepaper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Where do I put the Paper?</a>&nbsp;to give you an overview. Conclusion: flushing the toilet paper is rare, very rare.</p>
<div id="attachment_2190"><p><img title="Know your shit." src="https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Final-flush-map-1024x503.png" alt="toilet paper flushing world map where do i put the paper" width="640" height="314" srcset="https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Final-flush-map-1024x503.png 1024w, https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Final-flush-map-345x169.png 345w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-lazy-src="https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Final-flush-map-1024x503.png" data-lazy-srcset="https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Final-flush-map-1024x503.png 1024w, https://mindofahitchhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Final-flush-map-345x169.png 345w"></p><p><em>I think I finally found a topic for my university thesis…</em></p></div>
<p>The <span><strong>green</strong> </span>countries would have you flush the paper, <span><strong>red</strong> </span>forbid it, in&nbsp;<span><strong>orange</strong> </span>countries it <em><strong>highly </strong></em>depends on where you are and <span><strong>icy blue</strong></span> ones don’t have data. <em>Note that this map is purely based on the info provided by the aforementioned website.</em> If the information is lacking/wrong, you’d have to tell the creator&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/mattkitson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Kitson</a>&nbsp;too! Also, Matt, we should drink a beer.</p>
<h3>A Little Back Story</h3>
<p>In my 3.5 years of being on the road I’ve spent about 2.5 of them in regions where you don’t flush used paper. Already <a href="https://mindofahitchhiker.com/nomadcruise-arrival-in-brazil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upon arrival</a> in South America, I knew I had to flip that switch in my head. Of about 500 days of travel in South America, I must have spent about 45 days around dysfunctional toilets, of which the far majority was located in some form of tourist accommodation like a hostel where the toilets have to endure a lot of traffic – more than in hotels. In about 90% of hostels is a sign in each stall asking you not to flush the toilet paper. Every time I saw unflushed toilet paper floating in the bowl where it shouldn’t, I was in a hostel.</p>
<p>Once,&nbsp;<em>only once</em>, have I been to a place in Latin America where the stall had a sign on it “PLEASE FLUSH THE TOILET PAPER, DON’T PUT IT IN THE BIN”. That was in a luxury café called <a href="http://www.refugiodenavegantes.cl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Refugio de Navegantes</a> in Dalcahue, <a href="https://mindofahitchhiker.com/chiloe-archipelago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chiloé Archipelago</a>, Chile – far far away not on any particular route. Everything&nbsp;looked a little futuristic. I had to read the sign three times before I understood its message. I was a little shocked. Then I flushed it all.</p>
<p>Then there’s the countries where people wash not wipe. Some of them give you the choice between toilet paper and water (Argentina and Uruguay), others don’t provide paper and expect you to follow suit by washing. I remember childhood trips to France and laughing at the funny thing in the bathroom which my mom explained was a “butt washer”. I never fully grasped the anatomy and function of a bidet until I googled it <em>in fucking 2016</em>.</p>
<p>On a short trip to Morocco in 2012 I encountered my first “hose” (a.k.a. “bum gun”). On my travels through Iran in 2014 I really learned the way of the hose in combo with squat toilets. This time there was really no way around it, but an 8-year-old going to rural France with my parents, I cried every time the only option was a squat toilet. Toilet paper can be a tough find in some places, but I always carry some backup paper with me.</p>
<p>Where I’m from we always flush everything away through our fancy seat-toilets without a care. For 19 years of my life I had never seen a clogged toilet in my Passport Nation. Their toilets are resilient and its&nbsp;flushes are powerful. That was until I started studying, lived in a shared amenities apartment and the yearly carnival&nbsp;happened. Some visitor tried flushing the unflushable and we all had to suffer the consequences. The next day someone came by to fix it.</p>
<p>Back to Latin America, the situation is a lot more fragile over here. I’ve noticed that it takes up a lot of mental space if I can’t just assume I can go to the <em>b</em><em>año&nbsp;</em>anytime I please. The planning involved takes away the ability to relax about a basic bodily function. I know I’ll never take a functioning toilet for granted again.</p>

					<div><p>America was born middle class.</p><p>Before the Revolution, <a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/06-01-02-0052-0002">John Adams</a> condemned extreme wealth concentration: “Property monopolized, or in the Possession of a Few is a Curse to Mankind. We should preserve not an Absolute Equality – this is unnecessary, but preserve all from extreme Poverty, and all others from extravagant Riches.”</p><p>After the Revolution, <a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-08-02-0534">Thomas Jefferson</a> condemned extreme inequality: “I am conscious that an equal division of property is impracticable. But the consequences of this enormous inequality producing so much misery to the bulk of mankind, legislators cannot invent too many devices for subdividing property.”</p><p>The next generation attested to America’s middling status. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/815/815-h/815-h.htm">Alexis de Tocqueville</a> described equality as America’s defining characteristic: “Amongst the novel objects that attracted my attention during my stay in the United States, nothing struck me more forcibly than the general equality of conditions.”</p><p>Modern research confirms America’s egalitarian origins. <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w18396">Peter Lindert and Jeffrey Williamson</a> concluded that on the eve of the Revolution, “New England and the Middle Colonies appear to have been more egalitarian than anywhere else in the measurable world.”</p><p>The virtues of the middle class have been celebrated since Classical Antiquity. In <em>The Suppliants,</em> <a href="https://anacyclosis.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/EXCERPT-EURIPIDES-SUPPLIANTS-423-BC.pdf">Euripides</a> praised the middle class as the preserver of cities. In <em>The Politics</em>, <a href="https://anacyclosis.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/EXCERPT-THE-POLITICS-ARISTOTLE-350-BC.pdf">Aristotle</a> described the virtues of the middle class in detail, concluding that “the political community administered by the middle class (<em>hoi mesoi</em>) is the best.” America’s founding ethos embodies the middling virtues of industry, honesty, trust, ruggedness, temperance, equity, and modesty found in the yeoman ideal.</p><p>But the middle class is not only about size or virtue. It is also about power. Liberty is not derived from the theoretical ability to <em>give</em> consent. Liberty is rooted in the actual power to <em>withhold</em> consent. Ancient democracy was based on fear of military labor strikes. American democracy was born of a tax revolt.</p><p>It is thus not enough that the middle class be substantial or virtuous. In order to maintain democracy, the middle class must also be financially <em>independent</em>. Without independence, people must rely on patronage to survive. Wards and dependents cannot strike, sustain revolts, or guarantee redress of grievances. A dependent lower class cannot maintain democracy any more than a kindergarten class. Even an informed citizenry is impotent without independence.</p><p>Modern scholars, particularly <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/levitsky/files/lipset_1959.pdf">Martin Seymour Lipset</a> and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/46/1/114/2228262?redirectedFrom=fulltext">Barrington Moore</a>, have confirmed the connection between democracy and the middle class. Unfortunately, modern scholarship also confirms the decline of the middle class. Neither our government nor researchers have settled on a standard definition of “middle class”. But the <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/income-inequality/about/metrics/gini-index.html">Gini</a> index shows plainly enough that America was more egalitarian in 1776 than it is in 2020. The byproduct of this extreme inequality is extreme precarity. Today, roughly half of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Household precarity, in turn, produces household dependency.</p><p>The crisis of the American middle class accordingly has two dimensions. First is quantitative: the middle class is financially declining. Second is qualitative: the financial and political independence of the middle class erodes as households become more precarious and dependent upon subsidies to make ends meet.</p><p>And all this was before the ongoing Covid19 pandemic devastated the economy. Even before the pandemic, however, the American middle class faced other looming threats, the dimensions of which have not yet been fully apprehended: the impact of job-destroying and labor-saving technology, alongside the proliferation of the gig economy. Add these factors to various conventional grievances such as immigration, outsourcing, debt, inflation, and taxation, and the American middle class is being pummeled from all sides.</p><p>So, how do we restore the middle class?</p><p>Republicans advocate deregulation and tax reform, citing the golden age when America enjoyed seemingly unlimited productivity and job creation. These were great ideas, but for a different time. American corporations are no longer American, but global. They now have foreign supply chains and workforces. Furthermore, they have foreign owners and answer to foreign interests. When unregulated, multinational corporations sell out American workers to the lowest foreign bidder to make an extra dime. <em>Laissez faire</em>&nbsp;isn’t a solution, it’s <em>carte blanche</em> to undercut American workers. The last fifty years of unrestrained capitalism is transforming America into a place that resembles the stratified aristocracies of old Europe more than the hopeful egalitarian Republic which our Founding Fathers established.</p><p>Democrats advocate progressive taxation combined with various subsidies to provide immediate relief to struggling households. These are also great ideas, but only for a short time. While subsidies mitigate household precarity, they also aggravate household dependency and undermine productivity. This is not just theory. History’s only other superpower republic – Ancient Rome – never regained its middle class after making its grain dole permanent. Even though <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/tiberius.html">Tiberius Gracchus</a> got many smallhold farmers back on the land, many did not take so well to hard work. Rome learned the hard way that you cannot restore a productive and independent middle class with subsidies, and that the middling virtues are not quickly revived.</p><p>Despite Rome’s example, however, no truly democratic people want to be precarious or dependent upon subsidies. While anyone in a free country may need a helping hand from time to time, no one saved from rough seas wants to carry their life raft around with them forever.</p><p>Therefore, rather than “trickle-down” or “bottom-up” economics, if what we care about is the&nbsp;<em>middle</em>&nbsp;class, shouldn’t we benchmark the economy against the&nbsp;<em>median</em>?</p><p>To accomplish this, we could tether the outcomes of the top households to those of the median households. Going forward, we could – with a slight adjustment to the tax code – cap household net worth at some reasonable multiple of the median net worth (but not tax existing wealth). Thereafter, the very top would enjoy further financial gain only when the median gains. The rationale for this is that when the top is anchored to the median, all energies of pecuniary minds must refocus on the common goal of increasing the median. This approach would align the interests of the billionaire class to the middle class.</p><p>Assuming the largest fortune in 1776 was roughly 1,000x the median household net worth (my own rough extrapolation, this number needs to be confirmed) a multiple of 10,000x (roughly $1 billion today) seems a reasonable place to start the discussion. There are of course arguments for a higher ratio. There are also arguments for a lower ratio. What do you think the ratio should be?</p><p>In restoring the middle class and social mobility, this approach would be more universal and effective in the long-term than a thousand socialist band-aids. Unlike policies which target only one aspect of economic activity, a policy benchmarked against the median household net worth cannot be evaded or manipulated because the calculation of net worth factors the cumulative effects of all economic activity. Every pay cut, tax hike, price increase, hidden cost, layoff, job outsourced, debt, foreclosure, benefit reduction, pay disparity, and machine and algorithm which reduces the wages of a flesh-and-blood American worker – in other words, all forces depressing the median – are computed by the median net worth.</p><p>By contrast, any policy that targets only one of these factors, for example a policy to establish a minimum wage, does nothing to address any of the other factors noted above like taxes. $15.00 an hour does not protect workers from benefit reductions, outsourcing, immigrants, or job-destroying technology. Deploying corporate managers to increase the median household net worth does.</p><p>To avoid further dependency on subsidies, we could use the proceeds of this new tax (which we could name the <em>Patriot Tax</em>) only for appropriations which inure only to the general interest and to no special interest; <em>e.g.</em> veterans’ benefits, infrastructure, national security, social security.</p><p>Enforced with discipline, this approach would rehabilitate an independent middle class, restore by law the modesty and moderation that once prevailed by custom, and promote America’s independence. All with no new subsidies, corporate taxes, or business regulations. It will not happen overnight, but neither Rome nor America was built in a day.</p><p>To restore our independent middle class, we cannot trust to unfettered capitalism or indefinite socialism. We must acknowledge that the fleecing of the American middle class over the past half century – under both parties – has left millions precarious, dependent, and in need in immediate relief. But if we value authenticity in our democracy, productivity in our citizens, and independence for our nation, we must tame both socialism and capitalism with a new and sustainable theory of political economy. Because it advocates the enforcement of ratios to prescribed economic activity, may call this new theory <em>Rationism</em>.</p><p><em>Notice: this piece outlines the first policy concept informed by the Anacyclosis Institute’s research.

<p><span>Initial publication: June 27, 2020</span></p><hr>

<p>
	I've <a href="https://cturt.github.io/ps2-yabasic.html">previously discussed</a> how the PlayStation 2 doesn't have any good entry-point software exploits for launching homebrew. You need to either purchase a memory card with an exploit pre-installed (or a memory card to USB adapter), a HDD expansion bay (not available to slim consoles), open up the console to block the disc tray sensors, or install a modchip. For the best selling console of all time, it deserves better hacks.
</p>

<p>
	My initial attempt to solve this problem was to <a href="https://cturt.github.io/ps2-yabasic.html">exploit the BASIC interpreter</a> that came bundeld with early PAL region PS2s. Although I was successful at producing the first software based entry-point exploit that can be triggered using only hardware that came with the console, the attack was largely criticized due to the requirement of having to enter the payload manually through the controller or keyboard, and limitation of being PAL only. I decided to write-off that exploit as being impractical, and so the hunt continued for a better attack scenario for the PlayStation 2.
</p>

<p>
	The PlayStation 2 has other sources of untrusted input that we could attack; games which support online multiplayer or USB storage could almost definitely be exploited. But unlike say the Nintendo 64, where we don't really have any other choice but to resort to <a href="https://cturt.github.io/shogihax.html">exploiting games over interfaces like modems</a>, the PlayStation 2 has one key difference: its primary input is optical media (CD / DVD discs), a format which anyone can easily burn with readily available consumer hardware. This leaves an interesting question which I've wanted to solve since I was a child:
</p>

<p>
	Is it possible to just burn our own homebrew games and launch them on an unmodified console the same way we would launch official discs (without going through any user interaction like disc swapping or triggering a network exploit in a game)?
</p>



<p>
	Ultimately, I was successfully able to achieve my goal by exploiting the console's DVD player functionality. This blog post will describe the technical details and process of reversing and exploiting the DVD player. Loading <a href="#backup">backups of commercial games is also possible</a>. All of my code is <a href="https://github.com/CTurt/FreeDVDBoot">available on GitHub</a>.
</p>

<p>
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ez0y-hz3VuM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<br>

<h2>DVD video player attack surface</h2>
<p>
	Obviously we can't just burn a disc containing an ELF file and expect the PS2 to boot it; we'll need to exploit some kind of software vulnerability related to parsing of controlled data. The console supports playing burned DVD video discs, which exposes significant attack surface we could potentially exploit to achieve our goal.

<p>
	If we think about what a DVD Video consists of there are quite a few main components, each with the potential for vulnerabilities:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>UDF filesystem</li>
	<li>DVD Video metadata / subtitles</li>
	<li>Audio and video decoding</li>
	<li>Interaction machine</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Whilst the complete DVD Video specification is unfortunately behind a paywall, it is comprised largely of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD-Video#Video_data">open formats like MPEG</a>, just bundled together in a proprietary container format (VOB). For the proprietary aspects there are some freely accessible unofficial references.
</p>

<p>
	The <a href="http://dvd.sourceforge.net/dvdinfo/ifo.html">IFO</a> file format is probably the simplest format used, and is responsible for storing the metadata that links the video files together.
</p>

<p>
	The interaction machine is what allows for interactive menus and games in DVD Videos. It has <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Inside_DVD-Video/Instruction_Set_Details">32 groups of instructions</a>, and is interesting because it could potentially be used to dynamically manipulate internal memory state to prime an exploit, or it could be used to create a universal DVD with a menu which allows you to select your firmware version and trigger the appropriate exploit.
</p>

<br>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>
	Clearly it's not practical to do most of our testing on the real hardware since burning hundreds of test discs would be wasteful and time inefficient. We need an emulator with some debugger support, which is where we hit our first roadblock: the most popular emulator for PlayStation 2, PCSX2, <a href="https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/issues/1981">does not support playing DVD Videos</a>, and no one is interested in adding support.
</p>

<p>
	I'd like to thank krHacken for helping me out with that first roadblock. It turns out that PCSX2 does support the DVD player; it just can't load it automatically since it's located in encrypted storage and PCSX2 does not support the decryption. There are public tools which can <a href="https://github.com/xfwcfw/kelftool">decrypt</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jimmikaelkael/eromdir">extract</a> the DVD player from EROM storage. It can then be repacked into an ELF for easy loading into PCSX2.
</p>

<p>
	Due to the large number of different PlayStation 2 models released, each with slightly different DVD player firmwares (&gt; 50...), I will focus on a single DVD player for the duration of this article: 3.10E (configured with English language in PS2 settings), as it happens to be the firmware for the console I own. Update: apparently the 3.10E exploit described here works on 3.10U console with no changes.
</p>

<p>
	I will continue to use Ghidra for decompilation as I've been using throughout my <a href="https://cturt.github.io/ps2-yabasic.html">previous</a> articles. The DVD player does not contain any symbols so all names in code snippets were assigned by me through reverse engineering.
</p>

<br>

<h2>Disc controlled data</h2>
<p>
	The first file a DVD player will attempt to read is <code>VIDEO_TS.IFO</code>. Searching memory for contents of the file and then setting memory write breakpoints there to track back where it was written we quickly locate the API that reads disc contents used by the IFO parsing code, <code>getDiscByte</code> at <code>0x25c920</code>. It's a stream reader which caches a number of sectors into a RAM buffer, and then automatically seeks more data once needed:
</p>

<pre><code>byte getDiscByte(void) {
	byte ret;
	
	if (currentDiscBytePointer &lt; endDiscBytePointer) {
		ret = *currentDiscBytePointer;
	}
	else {
		currentDiscBytePointer = &amp;buffer;
		setOffset = setOffset + numberOfSectorsRead;
		getDiscByteInternal();
		ret = *currentDiscBytePointer;
	}
	currentDiscBytePointer = currentDiscBytePointer + 1;
	return ret;
}
</code></pre>



<p>
	From searching calls to this, we can also quickly find wrappers that fetch data of larger sizes: <code>getDiscU16</code> (<code>0x25c980</code>), <code>getDiscU32</code> (<code>0x25c9b8</code>), and <code>getDiscData</code> (<code>0x25c9f0</code>), which is the most interesting as it reads an arbitrary length of data:
</p>

<pre><code>void getDiscData(uint size, byte *destination) {
	byte b;
	uint i;
	
	i = 0;
	if (size != 0) {
		do {
			i = i + 1;
			b = getDiscByte();
			*destination = b;
			destination = destination + 1;
		} while (i &lt; size);
	}
	return;
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Large reads</h2>
<p>
	The first thing I did was search for calls to <code>getDiscData</code> in the hope of finding one with controllable size, and no bounds checking.
</p>

<p>
	Sure enough, we very quickly identify about 4 blatant buffer overflow vulnerabilities of this nature. Relating back to the <a href="http://dvd.sourceforge.net/dvdinfo/ifo.html">IFO</a> file format, we can see that there are numerous 16-bit array lengths which are needed to parse the variably sized data structures in the file. The DVD player mistakenly only ever expects the maximum lengths allowed by the DVD specification, and so it is missing checks to reject discs with larger lengths. Since all of the copies are done on statically allocated memory buffers, specifying larger than allowed lengths will cause buffer overflows. For example, below is decompilation for the one at <code>0x25b3bc</code>:
</p>

<pre><code>		large1 = getDiscU16();
		large2 = getDiscU16();
		large3 = getDiscU16();
		ignored = getDiscU16();
		getDiscData(((uint)large1 + (uint)large2 + (uint)large3) * 8, &amp;DAT_0140bdd4);</code></pre>



<p>
	This one is the most interesting because it allows the largest possible copy size (<code>0xffff * 3 * 8 = 0x17FFE8</code> bytes) of all the <code>getDiscData</code> buffer overflows. It copies into the statically allocated buffer at <code>0x0140bdd4</code>, and so by specifying the maximum possible copy size we gain control over the address space from <code>0x140bdd4</code> to <code>0x158BDBC</code> (<code>0x140bdd4 + 0x17FFE8</code>).
</p>

<br>

<h2>Corruption from the large reads</h2>
<p>
	As you can see, we can control quite a large region of memory using the above vulnerability. However, scanning through that memory is initially very disappointing; there are very few pointers, and none of them look particularly interesting to corrupt!
</p>

<p>
	Although there are no interesting pointers in this region, there are some indexes, which if corrupted could lead to further out of bounds memory corruption.
</p>

<p>
	Note that large reads like this won't always copy contiguous data from the IFO file, as sectors will start repeating once we exceed the file size, but generally assume that all data written by a <code>getDiscData</code> call can be controlled as it originates from <i>somewhere</i> on the disc. Also, after writing a certain amount, we may overflow into internal state used by <code>getDiscByte</code> functions, but we will get to this later.
</p>

<br>

<h3>OOB call</h3>
<p>
	At <code>0x25e388</code> we have this call to an entry in a function pointer array, where we can control the 16-bit <code>fpIndex</code> at <code>0x141284a</code> from the overflow:
</p>

<pre><code>(*(code *)(&amp;PTR_LAB_005b9d40)[(uint)fpIndex])(puVar6 + ((uint)DAT_01412841 - 1) * 8);</code></pre>



<p>
	This allows us to jump to the address stored anywhere from <code>0x5b9d40</code> up to <code>0x5b9d40 + 0xffff * 4 = 0x5F9D3C</code>.
</p>

<br>

<h4>Exploiting OOB call</h4>
<p>
	This primitive is not quite ideal, as none of our overflow bugs allow us to control the memory where the jump targets are read from. Worse still, most of this memory region is mapped from a read-only section of the DVD Player, so it's unlikely that we can influence the contents of this memory region without another bug.
</p>

<p>
	After the function pointers, we do some see some addresses for <code>switch</code> <code>case</code> labels, which is slightly interesting because that allows us to jump into the middle of a function and execute its epilogue without having executed its prologue, allowing us to misalign the stack pointer and return to an unexpected value on the stack. I went through all of these and unfortunately I was only ever able to use that to jump to <code>0</code>.
</p>

<p>
	Finally after the code pointers, we see read only string data. Interestingly, this data can be changed by switching languages in the PS2 menu, which gives greater hope for finding at least 1 usable jump target in every firmware version, however it unfortunately comes at the cost of forcing the user to reconfigure their language.

    </a>
</p>



    
<p>Cache-oblivious algorithms seemed incredible to me when I first heard about it in 6.854 (Advanced Algorithms). It’s relatively straightforward to imagine algorithms that utilizes information about page size $B$ and cache size $M$ to create efficient data structures. However, cache-oblivious algorithms are algorithms that achieve similar efficiencies <em>without knowing $B$ or $M$</em>. That means the same cache-oblivious algorithm can be ran on computers with different cache or page sizes and still achieve the same asymptotic efficiency as one that is tailored to that specific cache. The key to many of these algorithms is a recursive, fractal-like idea. I’ll describe a cache-oblivious algorithm for searching in a list of integers.</p>

<p>Here’s the set up. (TLDR at bottom) A program executes on the processor, but the input data resides on the disk. We can think of a disk as a really long linear array of data, but accessing it is really expensive. So, we instead invent this notion of a cache - a layer of memory of $M$ bits that is much smaller, but a lot faster to read/write to. For performance reasons, we will divide the disk and cache into blocks of $B$ bits, called pages, and we will transfer data between cache and disk a page at a time.</p>
<p>This cache sits between the processor and the disk, and the processor will never directly read or write to the disk. When the processor wants to read a piece of data that is not on the cache (this is called a cache miss), it will trigger some mechanism that copies the relevant page from the disk to the cache first, <em>evicting another page if the cache is full</em>, and then read from the cache.</p>
<p>How might this help? Well, trivially, if the entire set of data that the program needs fits in the cache, conceivably the processor could have fetched it all in the cache, paid the one-off cost, and then for the rest of the program the processor will never have to pay the expensive cost of reading from disk. Of course most programs require more data than that, and so we want to design algorithms that minimize cache misses.</p>
<h2 id="cache-management">Cache management</h2>
<p>However, the way computers are set up restricts the tools we have to achieve this. Programs executing on the processor have no explicit control over the cache. Instead, conceptually, programs continue to send read and write requests to the disk as though there is no cache. The processor intercepts these requests, and performs the necessary cache operations to serve the information. In other words, the cache is transparent to programs.  Thus, the task of reducing cache misses decomposes into two orthogonal components: writing efficient algorithms by cleverly ordering or specifying memory accesses, and efficient cache management.</p>
<p>For example, an efficient algorithm might try to shuffle memory accesses around so that memory accesses to a particular memory address are clumped together, increasing the likelihood that there will be a cache hit. In fact, because of the paging system, it would doubly help if memory accesses to the same <em>spatial region</em> are clumped together, because there’s a chance they’ll be on the same page.</p>
<p>On the other hand, efficient cache management entails trying to predict which piece of data to evict from the cache when there is a cache miss and we want to load more data into an already full cache. Since we’re focusing on the algorithm this article, we assume that the cache manager has magic oracle powers that lets it discard <em>optimally</em>, so from the algorithm design standpoint, if there exists a sequence of cache loads/writes that achieves our desired performance, we assume that the cache manager will do it. It turns out that this is not unreasonable, because simple techniques such as the Least Recently Used algorithm work <em>really</em> well. (An exposition on this deserves its own article.)</p>
<p>To summarize, the components of the external memory model are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disk, effectively unbounded in size, stores data in pages of size $B$</li>
<li>Cache, stores $M/B$ pages, each page has size $B$</li>
<li>Processor executes algorithm, also manages cache.</li>
<li>Algorithm runs on the processor. When data is needed, the processor transparently loads the required page into the cache if there’s a cache miss, or serve the cached data if there isn’t</li>
</ul>
<p>There are efficient algorithms that require explicit knowledge of $B$ and $M$, and there cache-oblivous algorithms that are just as efficient, but some how do not. That is to say, the algorithm performs the same actions and requests the same sequence of memory accesses, that works efficiently no matter what size $B$ and $M$ really are. We’ll take a close look at the latter here.</p>

<p>Let’s say we want to scan through a list of $N$ integers, to do some task, say finding the maximum. If the list occupy a contiguous block of memory on the disk, this can be done efficiently by loading pages one at a time, and scanning through the page before loading the next page. This thus takes $O(N/B)$ disk accesses, and is quite clearly optimal.</p>
<p>Suppose the algorithm does not know $B$. It can achieve the same efficiency by simply reading the elements of the list in order. The CPU will then fetch the first page to the cache, containing elements $0$ to $B-1$ and pass it to the program, and then when the program requires element $B$, it’ll read in the next page, which contains elements $B$ to $2B-1$, possibly overwriting the earlier page. This will just continue until all $N/B$ pages are read. This is cache-oblivious, because the algorithm of sequentially reading the elements is the same regardless of what $B$ is.</p>
<p>Note that in this example, it is essential that the list is stored in a contiguous block of memory. Had the elements been scattered around like in a linked-list, each access could potentially trigger a cache miss, since there’s no guarantee that neighboring elements will be on the same page. This may seem obvious, but this is the main mechanism by which we can write efficient algorithms - coming up with efficient layouts of data.</p>

<p>Now, let’s consider the problem of searching for an integer in a list. We’ll examine three ways of doing this.</p>
<h2 id="inefficient-cache-oblivious-algorithm-binary-search">Inefficient cache-oblivious algorithm: Binary search</h2>
<p>Let’s assume the data is sorted in a list, and packed contiguously on the disk. A possible algorithm is then to perform binary search, which typically takes $O(\log N)$ reads. The binary search can be viewed a successively narrowing an interval in which the query value may reside in. However, once the interval that the binary search is narrowing is $O(B)$, the entire interval may reside in a page, and no further page accesses are required. Thus, we require only $O(\log N - \log B)$ page accesses. Notice that this is a cache-oblivious algorithm because the algorithm doesn’t know what $B$ is - to the algorithm, it’s just running a standard binary search.</p>
<h2 id="efficient-but-not-cache-oblivious-b-trees">Efficient, but not cache-oblivious: B-trees</h2>
<p>Suppose we know $B$ ahead of time. We can achieve $O(\log_B N)$ page accesses. We arrange the list in the format of a B-tree, a generalized BST. Similar to a BST, each subtree of a B-tree corresponds to a contiguous subset of the elements of the list when sorted by value. However, each node $V$ of the tree contains not one, but $B$ elements, which splits the interval corresponding to the subtree rooted at node $V$ into not 2, but $B+1$ intervals. Then, we can traverse down the BST, and each time we go down one level we reduce the interval by a factor of $B$. This thus requires only $O(\log_B N) = O(\log N / \log B)$ page accesses. In reality of course, we have to store pointers and possibly other metadata in each node, so we can’t have exactly $B$ elements in each node, but we can definitely split by $\Theta(B)$ each level.</p>
<h2 id="efficient-cache-oblivious-algorithm-van-emde-boas-layout">Efficient cache-oblivious algorithm: van Emde Boas layout</h2>
<p>Now we come to the exciting part. We claim that we can achieve $O(\log_B N)$ page accesses, but without having to know $B$ ahead of time. The data structure we’re using is a good old balanced Binary Search Tree. However, the order in which we store the nodes in memory matters. If we pack the the BST in a regular fashion, say in breadth-first order, we could potentially have a situation where almost every vertex in a BST search path, except for the first few, lies in a different page, and thus we’ll have to use $O(\log N - \log B)$ page accesses. The van Embde Boas layout is basically a clever way of ordering the vertices of a binary search tree in a recursive, fractal-like manner such that each page access will fetch the next few vertices that will be queried, so that the next few accesses will be contained within that page.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For convenience, suppose the binary tree is complete and has height $H=2^K$. The layout is a permutation of the vertices of the binary tree. Denote $T(x, k)$ as the subtree of height $2^k$, rooted at vertex $x$. If the subtree at $x$ is deeper than $2^k$, then $T(x,k)$ will be the subtree truncated to the required depth. Denote $L(x, k)$ as the layout for that subtree. Then, for some root vertex $x$, of a (sub-)tree with height $h=2^k$, $L(x, k)$ is defined recursively as:</p>
<p>$$L(x, k) = L(x, k-1) \circ L(l_1, k-1) \circ L(l_2, k-1) \circ \dots \circ L(l_{n}, k-1)$$</p>
<p>Where, $l_1, \dots, l_{n}$ are the $n=2^{h/2}$ children of the leaves of $T(x, k-1)$, and $\circ$ is just concatenation. One application of this recursion is shown above.</p>
<h3 id="visual-sketch">Visual sketch</h3>
<p>If you didn’t catch that, don’t worry about it. Here’s a walkthrough. Suppose we’re given a complete binary tree of height $h=2^k$, rooted at $x$. We want to compute $L(x, k)$, which is a permutation of the vertices in this binary tree. Here’s how it’s done:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cut all the edges between the $2^{k-1}$-th and $2^{k-1}+1$-th layer. This gives us:
<ul>
<li>$2^{h/2}$ smaller BSTs with height $2^{k-1}$. These are the children subtrees now disconnected from the main subtree, …</li></ul></li></ol></article></div>

                    <p>Doing an internship while working from home? The dream of many students is the bane of remote companies. Internships are a great way to get some more helping hands, while also creating growth and learning opportunities for people who need it. Especially as you, as a remote company, have the ability to give opportunities to <em>anyone</em>, it's definitely something you should look into. How remote companies can structure and create remote internship positions.</p>
<h2>Finding remote interns</h2>
<p>It's easy to get overwhelmed when thinking of all the difficulties and hurdles that <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/hiring-for-remote-positions/">hiring a remote intern</a> could bring with it. The more important that we don't lose our heads and plan for a large pool of potential applications. What seems like a nice problem to have can become overwhelming really fast.</p>
<p>As a remote company, it's not practical to try and get interns from a local university or similar. Instead, you should see if you can leverage <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/where-to-post-your-remote-job-postings/">leading job boards</a> like <a href="https://angel.co/">AngelList</a> and <a href="https://weworkremotely.com/">WWR</a> to get the word out there. This will lead to a larger and more diverse pool of applicants.</p>
<p>As a remote company, you also have more power to give chances to people that would traditionally not get a chance to enter the industry. A good idea is to work together with <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/">communities that are serving underrepresented people</a> in tech and see whether you can work on a location independent internship scheme.</p>
<p>While internships are traditionally something for college students or new grads, it's no shame to see whether you can help career changers or other people from different backgrounds breaking into the industry. As a remote company, you are looking for responsible and self-directed people, which is something that is often built with experience in life and career. Don't shy away from the 'underdogs'.</p>
<p>The gist is, a Stanford grad can get an internship anywhere, so can a student from MIT. As a remote company, a lot of people will want to get an internship that allows you to 'work from home'. It's important to look through the haystack and not shy away from gems, even if they don't fit the traditional internship criteria of FAANG or the Bay Area.</p>
<h2>Selection criteria for remote internships</h2>
<p>As already mentioned, you need&nbsp;<strong>independent, self-starting</strong> people in a remote team, and internships are no different to that. While a talented college student may have these attributes as well, they are often something that develops with experience and time. If you are looking at an application, don't dismiss people with uncommon backgrounds – they often have the experience and expertise to work on something without handholding.</p>
<p>Any intern should still have access to a mentor and receive advice when needed, it's, therefore, better to hire in certain timezone clusters – namely near a mentor with a maximum of +- 4 hours, so at least a half-day of overlap can be arranged. That limits your application pool a lot, depending on where your mentors are located, which can be a good thing if you are totally overwhelmed with applications.</p>
<p>With international school systems and even different national schools running different forms of exams and grading, school grades are usually not something you should look at when it comes to evaluating an intern. If you have a small selection of people,&nbsp;<strong>references</strong> are what you would want to look at instead. Be it from professors, former bosses, coworkers or even people in the larger network – getting a second opinion can be very valuable here.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you are used to only looking at bullet point CVs, you will very quickly realize that there is not much value in those anymore. With interns, you are getting a lot more value from cover letters, questions or even challenges, than you'd get from a CV. A CV is important for context, but the cover letter is what's going to tell you about the person.&nbsp;<strong>Emphasize</strong> the importance of those, as you'll otherwise see different cultures handle the cover letter process differently.</p>
<p>You should also mention and customize your selection process in the case that you are looking at the possibility of full-time employment after. A transition to FTE is not only attractive to applicants, but also a great evaluation time for you to see whether someone is a fit. Again, with candidates that you'd usually not consider, this is a great chance to allow them a foot in the door.</p>
<h2>Onboarding remote interns</h2>
<p>So, you've hired your first intern! That's great, but now the real work begins. <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/onboarding-remote-employees/">Onboarding in a remote team</a> is extremely importand and the first week of an internship is crucial. Depending on your hire, it's their first dip into a career, working life, remote life or a new industry. That's huge, and also anxiety-inducing!</p>
<p>Be sure to have a checklist ready on day number one. It's even better if an intern can do their first few tasks as self service, before the mentor is ready to catch up. You can try something like <a href="https://nohq.co/tools/todoist/">Todoist</a> to share tasks beforehand. It's good practice to have review calls at the end of the first few days with a mentor, to be sure all concerns can be handled properly.</p>
<p>The first week should stand for exploration and getting comfortable with internal workflows. Especially if it's one of their first internships in that industry, a lot of things that can seem trivial will be not as self-explanatory as a think. As a result of that, you should plan a lot more mentorship resources at the beginning of an internship, as you may think.</p>
<p>Before you start with an internship project, it can be a good idea to do something easier instead. That might be <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/why-every-remote-worker-should-be-a-writer/">writing a short article</a>, documenting the onboarding process, fixing a little bug in the code or creating a simple design, anything is up for grabs.</p>
<p>By the end of the first week, you should set eyes on the actual project that the intern is going to work on. There are a lot of best practises for internship projects which aren't exclusive to remote work, but having something that doesn't need to much input from other teams is even more suitable here: It leads to shorter communication cycles and a better end result if the intern is able to concentrate on their core exercises and communication, instead of trying to lift blockers.</p>
<h2>Supervision and mentorship of remote interns</h2>
<p>Mentors are always hard to find, so be sure to have a waterproof mentorship program for your interns. Set goals beforehand, prepare a great project, set up a timeline and agree on a set of milestones.</p>
<p>A mentor isn't supposed to feed solutions to interns, but instead is the connecting point between interns and the rest of the team. Interns may have slightly obvious questions, and a mentor is there to guide them towards finding the solutions for those. A mentor is also a point of contact for concerns and issues. Interns may have difficulties finding their way into different teams, and a mentor can help them with guiding towards the right point.</p>
<p>A key cornerstone of a successful mentorship should be a <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/guide-to-1-on-1-meetings-in-remote-teams/">regularly scheduled 1-on-1 call</a> between intern and mentee. This usually happens on a daily or bi-daily basis during the first few weeks and can be scheduled for once per week in the later stages of the internship. During the 1-on-1, it's good to keep an agenda to go through the most important parts of the internship:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overall feeling</li>
<li>Current status of the project</li>
<li>Blockers and difficulties</li>
<li>New insights</li>
<li>Plan for the next week</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from that, it's a good idea to include interns in regular team discussions. Even though they might not regularly be able to contribute, it's still a good sign to include interns in discussions and give them the same voice as regular employees. It also helps the team form an image of the abilities of each intern.</p>
<p>If interns are regularly collaborating with other members of the teams, try to collect feedback every month or so and compile a review with things that went well, and things that can be improved to help interns shape their abilities in communication to become better team players.</p>
<p>Overall, it's important not to forget about interns. Even if they are working self-directed, it's extra important to see what they like, dislike, which skills they are picking up and how they are collaborating with others. That may not be a full-time job for a mentor, but takes a good chunk of time out of every week.</p>
<h2>How to evaluate remote interns</h2>
<p>An internship usually lasts 3 - 6 months, depending on the time and plans of an intern. At the end of that, it's good to evaluate interns and their time at the company, to make a mental note, but also give final feedback and reference letter to the intern.</p>
<p>There are certain aspects that you can look at here:</p>
<ul>
<li>How did the internship project pan out?</li>
<li>What has been the feedback from the team over the months?</li>
<li>How was the mentor's/supervisor's feeling?</li>
</ul>
<p>If the intern is going back to school or has agreed to take another position, this evaluation can end up in an HR file. If the intern is available for hire, this may end in a hiring decision that the mentor can take with the department heads.</p>
<p>Internships are a great way for young people to break into an industry of their choice. As a remote company, you are in the best position to look for unique and diverse interns from a variety of backgrounds, instead of only taking summer interns of the local universities. Due to the nature of remote, it's also important to keep interns under control, while also leaving them their space to grow. In the end, a good internship program may be the path to a better talent pipeline for your company.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        

      

<div><div><pre><code>NOTE: This is for informational purposes only. This does
not account for all costs of operating. This document
should be used to assist in understanding how to calculate
the cost of deploying this service, not to make budgetary
decisions.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This page outlines how you might estimate the cost of deploying the reference
server for your application. Cost estimates assume the use of Google Cloud,
deployment and use within the US, and uses the
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/pricing">published pricing rates</a> to arrivea at the
estimation. This could be repeated for other regions as well as for other
cloud providers. Please note that for much of this simplifications have been
made. Due to a majority of the expected costs to be incurred due to storage
serving.</p>


<p>There are a number of variables that need to be figured out to determine cost.</p>

<p>Let’s assume that we are calculating the cost of operating for an area with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A population of 10 Million (10,000,000) people.</li>
  <li>An exposure window of 14 days</li>
  <li>50% adoption of an exposure notifications system</li>
  <li>1,250 new cases daily (approximately .01% new cases per day)</li>
</ul>

<p>From which we can derive:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each new set of keys is 448 bytes (14 days * 32 bytes)</li>
  <li>Each daily batch is 1,250 * 448 bytes = .56 MB</li>
  <li>That file is downloaded 5 Million times per day, for (2.8 TB/day downloaded),
84 TB monthly.</li>
</ul>


<p>Due to pricing varying by region, and much of this being scalable, we avoid
speaking about exact pricing for most of it, instead trying to quantify the
magnitude.</p>

<p>To have an idea of the deployment size, this document assumes the defaults
configured for Terraform in
<a href="https://github.com/google/exposure-notifications-server/blob/master/terraform/vars.tf">vars.tf</a>.</p>

<p>The largest cost is likely to be in Network Egress. In this calculation we
assume that <a href="https://cloud.google.com/cdn">Google Cloud CDN</a> is not used but
instead a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage">Google Cloud Storage</a> bucket is
read directly. Please note that using Google Cloud CDN will likely result in
lower cost.</p>

<h2 id="cloud-run-costs">Cloud Run Costs</h2>
<p>https://cloud.google.com/run/pricing</p>

<p>There are multiple containers needed for a complete deployment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Export Cleanup</li>
  <li>Exposure Cleanup</li>
  <li>Export</li>
  <li>Exposure</li>
  <li>Federation In</li>
  <li>Federation Out</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the services run periodically, not constantly. For this reason it is
likely no higher than 6 containers at this scale. Likely, estimating as if 3-4
of these containers would get a reasonable upper limit. The resource limits of
a container are specified in the
<a href="https://github.com/google/exposure-notifications-server/blob/master/terraform/service_federationin.tf#L63">terraform resource limits</a>
as 2 CPU and 1G memory per container.</p>

<p><strong>Projected Monthly Cost: $500 - $750</strong></p>

<h2 id="sql-database-costs">SQL Database Costs</h2>
<p>https://cloud.google.com/sql/pricing</p>

<p>The default size for SQL Database is configured to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>8 vCPU</li>
  <li>30720 MB Memory</li>
  <li>256 GB SSD</li>
</ul>

<p>The cost of this component can vary greatly on the scale is configured to.
Depending on the needed scale of your deployment this could require a different
configuration.</p>

<p>For instance, while the default is <code>db-custom-8-30720</code>, the documentation
mentions that a <code>db-custom-1-3840</code> instance is likely sufficeint for local
development work. This instance should cost around an eighth of the amount.</p>

<p><strong>Project Monthly Cost: $1000 - $1250</strong></p>

<h2 id="storage-costs">Storage Costs</h2>
<p>https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing</p>

<h3 id="data-storage-cost">Data Storage Cost</h3>
<p>The last 14 days of batches are stored with older batches being deleted. This
is a small amount of data storage. 14 days of batches should be around 8 MB.</p>

<p><strong>Projected Monthly Cost: $0 - $10</strong></p>

<h3 id="network-usage-cost">Network Usage Cost</h3>
<p>Each user will download one of the daily batch files. This is a highly variable
cost based on adoption. With sufficient users this could easily be in the tens
of thousands of dollars. Also, network egress varies depending on the region.
Please see the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing#network-egress">pricing</a>
for network usage to determine a more accurate estimate for your use case.</p>

<p>Copied from above:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each new set of keys is 448 bytes (14 days * 32 bytes)</li>
  <li>Each daily batch is 1,250 * 448 bytes = .56 MB</li>
  <li>That file is downloaded 5 Million times per day, for (2.8 TB/day downloaded),
84 TB monthly.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Projected Monthly Cost: $10,000+</strong></p>

<div><div><pre><code>NOTE: Using the Google Cloud CDN is likely less expensive.
Serving costs when using Google Cloud Storage directly are
higher, often by more than 30%, than Google Cloud CDN.
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="operations-cost">Operations Cost</h3>
<p>There are two tiers of operations.</p>

<h4 id="class-a">Class A</h4>
<p>$0.05 per 10,000 operations</p>

<p>Relevant operations from this include <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, and <code>LIST</code>. These
will occur as part of batching of exposure keys. These operations will likely
remain under 10,000 for storage as creation of files is batched.</p>

<p><strong>Projected Monthly Cost: $0 - $20</strong></p>

<h4 id="class-b">Class B</h4>
<p>$0.004 per 10,000 operations</p>

<p>Relevant operations from this include <code>GET</code> requests for key batches.</p>

<p>For each user, there will be a minimum of one <code>GET</code> operation per day.</p>

<p><strong>Projected Monthly Cost: $50 - $100</strong></p>

				<div><p>Bank of Canada research has established that there is a public good aspect to privacy in payments (Garratt and van Oordt 2019). This note outlines what is technologically feasible for privacy in a central bank digital currency (CBDC) system. Privacy in a CBDC goes beyond binary choices of anonymity or full disclosure. System designers have a range of choices around the type of information to keep private and who to keep it private from. Because privacy is not in the sole purview of the Bank, defining it requires consultation with external parties. Our approach in this note is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>develop a framework to evaluate different privacy models</li>
<li>understand the technical tools to enact various privacy models</li>
<li>suggest a design approach for CBDC privacy</li>
<li>list the key risks and trade-offs</li>
</ul>
</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<div><h2>Key messages</h2>
<ul>
<li>There are many cryptographic techniques and operational arrangements for a fine-grained privacy design. These demand knowledge of the detailed requirements around privacy and disclosure.</li>
<li>The Bank could engineer a CBDC system with higher levels of privacy than commercial products can offer—but with trade-offs. Some combinations of requirements will not be feasible or may lead to high operational costs and excessive complexity and risk. Also, the user’s overall privacy will depend on factors such as user behaviour and the privacy policies of other entities in the CBDC ecosystem.</li>
<li>Techniques to achieve cash-like privacy are immature. They have limited deployments, none of which comply with know-your-customer (KYC) and anti–money laundering (AML) regulations. Their risks include hidden vulnerabilities, a lack of scalability and complicated operations.</li>
<li>Maintaining privacy and complying with regulations (the latter which requires disclosure of information) present a dichotomy for a CBDC. This is further complicated by the need for proactive disclosure to prevent fraud.</li>
<li>Public trust in the privacy design the Bank enacts could be enhanced through third-party reviews of CBDC architecture and operations.</li>
</ul>
</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<div><h2>Analysis of system privacy</h2>
<h3>Diverse payment systems with a range of privacy offerings</h3>
<p>The technologies that are or could be used in payment systems are diverse—ranging from cash and debit and credit cards to public and private distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), centralized systems and offline devices. The privacy available to users varies markedly from system to system. For example, most users appreciate that, broadly speaking, cash use is highly private while credit cards offer less privacy. We aim to more precisely categorize this variation in privacy between systems.</p>
<h3>A framework to analyze, compare and define CBDC system requirements</h3>
<p>We consider a CBDC system consisting of holdings and transactions, where a holding has an owner (O) and a balance (B), and a transaction has a payer (Pr), payee (Pe) and amount (A). Privacy is the degree to which holdings and transactions data are hidden from participating entities. The entities are many—the payer’s bank or money services business (MSB), the payee’s MSB, government institutions, payment providers and the general public—each with a varying degree of visibility to holdings and transactions. We present a framework where the privacy profile of a system is a combination of the extent to which details are kept private from each entity. This formulation allows us to compare privacy profiles of diverse technologies.</p>
<p>We summarize the privacy levels of the following representative technologies in <a href="#table1">Table&nbsp;1</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>magnetic stripe credit cards</li>
<li>EMV<a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1" title="EMV originally stood for Europay, Mastercard and Visa, the three companies that created the standard. The standard is now managed by EMVCo, a consortium with control split equally among Visa, Mastercard, JCB, American Express, UnionPay and Discover." aria-labelledby="footnote-label-1">1</a> chip credit cards</li>
<li>electronic transfers</li>
<li>debit cards</li>
<li>permissioned DLT</li>
<li>custodial and advanced use of public DLTs (e.g., Bitcoin)</li>
<li>tiered ledger systems composed of multiple different ledgers</li>
<li>device-based systems using devices assigned either to identified customers as per KYC regulations or to anonymous customers</li>
<li>cash</li>
</ul>
<p>Offline device-based systems (such as PUF Cash, a system based on physically uncloneable functions [see Calhoun et al. 2019]) come closest to achieving cash-like privacy.</p>

<p>Note: Higher/darker values indicate more privacy.</p>
</div>

				<div><h3>Dependence on multiple entities and behaviour</h3>
<p>A system may be more private with respect to one entity (e.g., merchant) and less so for another (e.g., government). Privacy may also vary by user behaviour: for example, paying through an online account may reveal personal details. In designing a CBDC system’s privacy, we must consider many nuanced questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should all transactions be routinely disclosed to the government, or only some (by, e.g., dollar threshold)?</li>
<li>Should law enforcement be able to determine a person’s holdings, even if only approximately?</li>
<li>Should a payer’s identity be hidden from a merchant?</li>
<li>What transaction details should be shown to a payer’s MSB?</li>
<li>Should users be able to transact outside of KYC regulations to some extent?</li>
</ul>
<p>By using a framework to document CBDC privacy requirements, system designers can ensure they cover all entities and use design ideas from systems with similar privacy profiles.</p>
</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<div><h2>Privacy techniques and design</h2>
<h3>Adopting privacy by design</h3>
<p>According to Cavoukian (2011) it is important that privacy with compliance be designed into the system from the outset. Privacy by design is a well-known approach that calls for privacy to be proactively engineered throughout the design process. The alternative, of doing a functional design first and adding privacy and compliance later, carries risks of unnecessary trade-offs.</p>
<h3>Customizing and combining privacy constructs to achieve a desired design</h3>
<p>Privacy design can apply building blocks of varying maturity and trade-offs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Group signatures</strong> (Chaum and van Heyst 1991) allow a set of entities to transact while obscuring their identities, revealing only that “someone in the group” transacted.</li>
<li><strong>Secret sharing</strong> (Shamir 1979) or <strong>multi-signature</strong> (Itakura and Nakamura 1983) schemes can guarantee that sensitive data are disclosed only when an adequate number of entities (e.g., three of five) agree.</li>
<li><strong>Zero-knowledge proofs</strong> (Blum, Feldman and Micali 1988) can prove claims about data without revealing them (e.g., they can prove an account balance is adequate for a transaction without revealing the balance).</li>
<li><strong>Homomorphic encryption</strong> (Rivest, Adleman and Dertouzos 1978) allows mathematical operations on obscured data (e.g., payment of interest on a balance that is encrypted).</li>
<li><strong>Multi-party computation </strong>(Yao 1982) allows several entities to securely contribute their data to a combined dataset for fraud detection while keeping their data private from one another.</li>
<li><strong>Differential privacy</strong> (Dwork and Roth 2014) and <strong>anonymization</strong> are techniques that ensure personally identifiable information cannot be extracted from sensitive datasets. The data are rendered safe and private for uses such as research and data analytics.</li>
</ul>
<p>More techniques not covered here could be explored by system designers for potential use: for example, private information retrieval (Chor et al. 1998) and deniable encryption (Canetti et al. 1997). Most of these are flexible enough to be used across a variety of technology platforms (e.g., centralized, DLT and device-based) and can be combined and customized to achieve fine-grained CBDC privacy goals.</p>
</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<div><h2>Privacy and governance</h2>
<h3>Optimal mix of business model, attributes and platform</h3>
<p>Knowing the CBDC business model, attributes and technology platform is essential to choosing the right constructs and combining them appropriately.</p>
<p>For example, consider a system where private transactions are verified by MSBs. If the business model states that MSBs are highly trusted, then privacy protocols can be simplified by assuming verifiers are honest. If not, the chosen protocols must guard against dishonest verifiers, which entails higher complexity. If amounts are hidden and policy dictates an interest-bearing CBDC, then chosen schemes must support encrypted computations of interest payments.</p>
<p>Further, the selection of privacy techniques will depend on the chosen platform. Typical proof systems are made up of provers (e.g., end-users) who generate proofs and verifiers (e.g., the systems) that check them. In a DLT system, multiple nodes perform verification, so system designers would need to ensure verification protocols are highly efficient. Centralized systems could tolerate slower verification. Another consideration is the trade-off between prover efficiency and proof size—algorithms that achieve fast proof generation generally result in large proofs. This could be a challenge in device-based solutions constrained by limited storage. Device-based solutions must also ensure that selected schemes can operate within the restrictions of sporadic CBDC network connectivity and limited computing capacity.</p>
<h3>The impact of complying with regulations on privacy and techniques</h3>
<p>A CBDC system is required to comply with regulations (e.g., KYC and AML). This can dictate the level of privacy and the selection of privacy techniques. KYC may require entities to store personal data with proper classification. Generally, achieving high levels of privacy while complying with …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote></blockquote><h2 id="wolfenstein-3d">Wolfenstein 3D</h2><p>If you need to know, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D">Wolfenstein 3D</a> is a 24-year-old game that pioneered a genre nowadays known as first-person-shooters. I installed it last weekend, triggered by a high dose of nostalgia caused by reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_Doom">The Masters of Doom</a>. (Thanks for the book recommendation, Robert!)</p><p>The <a href="http://www.bestoldgames.net/stare-hry/wolfenstein-3d.php">zipped shareware version</a> of the game has size of <em>692,526 bytes</em>. Yes, <em>bytes</em>! Roughly <em>676 kilobytes</em>. Unzipped, the game takes double that size, <em>1,409,981 bytes</em>. Roughly <strong>1.34 megabytes</strong>.</p><p>I started <a href="http://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBox</a> and in parallel, out of curiosity, Windows Task Manager. Once started, DOSBox quickly reached <em>71,824 kilobytes</em> of RAM. I loaded Wolfenstein 3D and like in good all days, almost in tears, I proudly announced that “I am Death incarnate”.</p><p><img src="http://thehumbleprogrammer.com/resources/shakespeare-in-the-castle-wolfenstein/wolfenstein-3D-i-am-death-incarnate.jpg" alt="I am Death incarnate"></p><p>The run through the Castle Wolfenstein started. Room after room, door after door, bullet after bullet I was running through the maze eating turkey dinners and dog food on my way to the next level.</p><p>And the DOSBox started asking for more memory, jumping from those <em>71,824 kilobytes</em> to <em>72,904 kilobytes</em> where it settled.</p><p>No matter how many enemy soldiers, secret rooms or other surprises were behind the next door I opened, the memory consumption didn’t go any higher.</p><p>The Task Manager is not the best way of measuring the memory consumption, I know. Especially in this case. But for the purpose of this strong impression I would say that it’s safely to assume that my nostalgic run through the Castle Wolfenstein took <em>72,904 - 71,824 = 1,080 kilobytes</em> of memory. <strong>One megabyte</strong>, roughly.</p><p>There was a lot in that one megabyte.</p><p>3D walls on left and right, with doors and suitable decorations.</p><p><img src="http://thehumbleprogrammer.com/resources/shakespeare-in-the-castle-wolfenstein/wolfenstein-3D-walls-with-decorations.jpg" alt="Walls with decorations"></p><p>Enemy soldiers shooting at me.</p><p><img src="http://thehumbleprogrammer.com/resources/shakespeare-in-the-castle-wolfenstein/wolfenstein-3D-enemy-soldiers-shooting-at-me.jpg" alt="Enemy soldiers shooting at me"></p><p>Actually, plenty of enemy soldiers shooting at me at the same time.</p><p><img src="http://thehumbleprogrammer.com/resources/shakespeare-in-the-castle-wolfenstein/wolfenstein-3D-plenty-of-enemy-soldiers-shooting-at-me-at-the-same-time.png" alt="Plenty of enemy soldiers shooting at me at the same time"></p><p>German shepherds jumping on me.</p><p><img src="http://thehumbleprogrammer.com/resources/shakespeare-in-the-castle-wolfenstein/wolfenstein-3D-german-shepherds-jumping-on-me.jpg" alt="German shepherds jumping on me"></p><p>Vast empty rooms with less going on.</p><p><img src="http://thehumbleprogrammer.com/resources/shakespeare-in-the-castle-wolfenstein/wolfenstein-3D-vast-empty-rooms-with-less-going-on.png" alt="Big spacey rooms with less going on"></p><p>The famous turkey dinner ready for picking up.</p><p><img src="http://thehumbleprogrammer.com/resources/shakespeare-in-the-castle-wolfenstein/wolfenstein-3D-turkey-dinner.jpg" alt="The famous turkey dinner ready for picking up"></p><p>Not to mention hidden treasures.</p><p><img src="http://thehumbleprogrammer.com/resources/shakespeare-in-the-castle-wolfenstein/wolfenstain-3D-hidden-treasure.jpg" alt="Hidden treasures"></p><p>And all that consuming <strong>exactly <em>1,409,981 bytes</em> on my hard drive</strong> and <strong>roughly <em>one megabyte</em> of RAM</strong>.</p><h2 id="atom">Atom</h2><p>It happened that I recently installed <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> as well.</p><p>Atom is a text editor.</p><p>Obviously, you can edit text in it.</p><p>It supports auto-completion.</p><p>And has find and replace.</p><p>And has an integrated file system browser.</p><p>Syntax highlighting, although not being directly advertised on the homepage, is also there.</p><p>Now how cool is that!</p><p>Here is a glimpse on the mentioned “right out of the box” features that you’ll get after downloading and running Atom.</p><p><img src="http://thehumbleprogrammer.com/resources/shakespeare-in-the-castle-wolfenstein/atom-io-editing-mongo-db-source-file.png" alt="Atom.io"></p><p>Not much, compared to the 3D walls with doors and decorations and enemy soldiers and German shepherds and vast empty rooms and turkey dinners and hidden treasures and plenty of other surprises waiting for you in the Castle Wolfenstein.</p><p>Still, the <a href="https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.4.0">zipped Windows version of Atom</a> required me downloading <em>89,397,644 bytes</em> of data. Once unzipped it ate <em>263,518,515 bytes</em> of my hard drive. That’s <strong>roughly <em>263 megabytes</em> or 187 Wolfenstein 3Ds</strong>. For a text editor.</p><p>And it gets even worse.</p><p>Once started Atom spanned five (!?) processes consuming altogether <em>152,172 kilobytes</em> of RAM. That’s <strong>roughly 150 megabytes</strong>. And I even didn’t start writing anything! Neither auto-completing, nor browsing the file system in the integrated browser!</p><p><img src="http://thehumbleprogrammer.com/resources/shakespeare-in-the-castle-wolfenstein/atom-io-memory-consumption-of-an-empty-file.png" alt="Atom.io memory consumption"></p><p>Honestly, I was afraid of typing a single “a” in that “untitled” file opened by default.</p><p>150 megabytes… For what? Plain text editing and auto-completion?</p><p>I couldn’t stop wondering how many more enemy soldiers and walls and vast empty rooms and turkey dinners <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack">John Carmack</a> would have put into Wolfenstein 3D if he has had 150 megabytes of RAM at his disposal. To quote John:</p><blockquote><p>Mmm.</p></blockquote><h2 id="shakespeare">Shakespeare</h2><p>It happened also that I recently downloaded <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/100">The Complete Works of William Shakespeare</a>.</p><p>There is <em>a lot</em> in Shakespeare.</p><p>Romeo and Juliet. Antony and Cleopatra. Hamlet. King Lear. Titus Andronicus, just to mention few I know. Julius Caesar is also there if I remember well. Than Othello. And the Merchant of Venice. A Midsummer Night’s Dream. And all those kings Henrys and Richards.</p><p>And then, there is a lot in each of those plays.</p><p>I watched a premiere of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello">Othello</a> in <a href="http://www.gavella.hr/">Gavella</a>. So, there is that guy Othello secretly marring Desdemona. And than the other guy Iago who hates Othello but Othello is not getting it. And then they all go to Cyprus with plenty of other people. And then Iago gets pretty creative in canalizing his hate toward Othello. And than comes the intermezzo because the play is way too long. And than after the intermezzo plenty of other things happen before everybody dies.</p><p>Later in the theatre’s hallway some lady was complaining that Gavella actually <em>shortened the plot</em>!</p><p>What I’m trying to say is - there is <em>a lot</em> in Othello. And not only in Othello. In Romeo and Juliet as well. And in Antony and Cleopatra for sure. And in Hamlet. In 1987 <a href="http://www.adrianhilton.com/">Adrian Hilton</a>, pictured below, acquired a <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-theatre-performance-individual/">Guinness World Record for longest theatre performance</a>. He was reciting the Complete Works of Shakespeare non-stop for 110 hours and 46 minutes. <strong>That’s 5 days of reciting.</strong> Without sleep!</p><p><img src="http://thehumbleprogrammer.com/resources/shakespeare-in-the-castle-wolfenstein/adrian-hilton-reciting-shakespeare.jpg" alt="Adrian Hilton reciting Shakespeare"></p><p>All those “a lot”s combined together, downloaded from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> and saved in a plain text file take exactly <em>5,560,736 bytes</em>. <strong>5.5 megabytes</strong>, roughly.</p><p>Let me stress this fact once again. <strong>The Complete Works of William Shakespeare takes only 5.5 megabytes in plain text.</strong></p><h2 id="onenote">OneNote</h2><p>Recently I was forced to install the newest Windows update. And like after each update I ran out of space on my C drive. Corporate laptop, corporate C drive. I have very less control over it. This time it reached - literally - 0 kilobytes free.</p><p><img src="http://thehumbleprogrammer.com/resources/shakespeare-in-the-castle-wolfenstein/0-k-free-on-the-C-drive.png" alt="0 kilobytes free on the C drive"></p><p>I have no clue how Windows survived reaching zero kilobytes free. Outlook didn’t, by the way.</p><p>And so I started <a href="https://jam-software.com/treesize_free/">TreeSize Free</a> to see where I could save a gigabyte or two. Which reminded me of the trick I did last time when the C drive run out of space. I moved all my local OneNote documents to the E drive. That saved my apparently <em>17,797,901,002 bytes</em> of data and helped me live in peace for a few months. <em>17,797,901,002 bytes</em> of data. That’s <strong>17 gigabytes</strong>. Or <strong>3200 times more than Shakespeare</strong>.</p><p>I wouldn’t say anything if there was something in those 3200 Shakespeares. But there is literally <strong>nothing</strong> in my exactly six OneNote notebooks. Nothing! My diary, surely less eventful than Othello alone, some high level company’s visions, minutes of meetings and short memos. Altogether roughly of a size of A Midsummer Night’s Dream and King Lear combined. At best. Still, for whatever reason, <strong>OneNote needs 3200 Shakespeares to store it</strong>.</p><p>To quote Carmack again:</p><blockquote><p>Mmm.</p></blockquote><h2 id="back-to-the-bills-quote">Back to the “Bill’s” Quote</h2><blockquote><div><p>I’ve said some stupid things and some wrong things, but not that. No one involved in computers would ever say that a certain amount of memory is enough for all time. […] Meanwhile, I keep bumping into that silly quotation attributed to me that says 640K of memory is enough. There’s never a citation; the quotation just floats like a rumor, repeated again and again.</p><p> Bill Gates, <a href="http://www.wired.com/1997/01/did-gates-really-say-640k-is-enough-for-anyone/">Did Gates Really Say 640K is Enough For Anyone?</a></p></div></blockquote><p>C’mon Bill, even if you did say it - so what? It’s neither stupid, nor wrong, nor silly. 640K is obviously enough for plenty of things. For escaping from Castle Wolfenstein for example. Or carrying a good portion of Shakespeare around. After all, it’s not about how much resources our computers have. It’s about how we use them. Efficient usage makes them sufficient. Inefficient usage makes them insufficient.</p><p>My strong impression is telling me that we, as programmers, can do a much better job in keeping all those gigabytes of RAM and terabytes of hard drives sufficient enough for the time being.</p><h2 id="afterthought">Afterthought</h2><p>Despite the mentioned 150 MB I like <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>. And <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> even more. And I’m looking forward finding some time for trying out <a href="http://lighttable.com/">Light Table</a>. But for some strange reason, I always write my blog posts in the only editor that “is trying to reduce the world carbon dioxide emissions”. The good old <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> :-)</p><div><p>Wow, you've made it this far :-) The chances are you might like my next blog post as well ;-) Should I let you know when it's out?</p></div></div></div>]]>

Essentially, it joins all the continuous points that have the same color or intensity.</p><p id="fb67">This computer vision task is useful for shape analysis, edge detection, and is helpful in scenarios where you need to find similar types of objects in an image.</p><p id="c5f4">Coin detection and segmentation is a fairly common use case in OpenCV, and now by using Vision’s new <code>VNDetectContoursRequest</code>, we can perform the same in our iOS applications easily (without the need for third-party libraries).</p><p id="3973">To process images or frames, the Vision framework requires a <code>VNRequest</code>, which is passed into an image request handler or a sequence request handler. What we get in return is a <code>VNObservation</code> class.</p><p id="4ad5">You can use the respective <code>VNObservation</code> subclass based on the type of request you’re running. In our case, we’ll use <code>VNContoursObservation</code>, which provides all the detected contours from the image.</p><p id="8298">We can inspect the following properties from the <code>VNContoursObservation</code>:</p><ul><li id="a70a"><code><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/vncontoursobservation/3548363-normalizedpath" target="_blank" rel="noopener">normalizedPath</a></code> — It returns the path of detected contours in normalized coordinates. We’d have to convert it into the UIKit coordinates, as we’ll see shortly.</li><li id="5ea7"><code>contourCount</code> — The number of detected contours returned by the Vision request.</li><li id="d7ad"><code>topLevelContours</code> — An array of <code>VNContours</code> that aren’t enclosed inside any contour.</li><li id="803a"><code>contour(at:)</code> — Using this function, we can access a child contour by passing its index or <code>IndexPath</code>.</li><li id="c47a"><code>confidence</code> — The level of confidence in the overall <code>VNContoursObservation</code>.</li></ul><blockquote><p id="b960">Note: Using <code>topLevelContours</code> and accessing child contours is handy when you need to modify/remove them from the final observation.</p></blockquote><p id="fcbd">Now that we’ve got an idea of Vision contour detection request, let’s explore how it might work it in an iOS 14 application.</p></div></div></section><hr><section></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="367c">To start off, you’ll need <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-12-beta-release-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xcode 12 beta</a> as the bare minimum.

We can simplify (or rather reduce) them by pre-processing the image.</p></div></div></section><hr><section></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="066d"><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Core Image</a> is Apple’s image processing and analysis framework. Though it works fine for simple face and barcode detection tasks, it isn’t scalable for complex computer vision use cases.</p><p id="68da">The framework actually boasts of over 200 image filters and is handy in photography apps as well as for data augmentation in your machine learning model training.</p><p id="3f76">But more importantly, Core Image is a handy tool for pre-processing images that are then fed to the Vision framework for analysis.</p><p id="467b">Now, if you’ve watched the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10673" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WWDC 2020 Computer Vision APIs</a> video, you’ve seen that Apple has leveraged Core Image’s monochrome filter for pre-processing, while demonstrating their punchcard contour detection example.</p><p id="49be">In our case, for coin masking, the monochrome effect would not give as good results. Specifically for coins that have a similar color intensity that’s different from the background, using the black and white color filter for masking coins is a better bet.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*oycNP8qYvVZbONbJGnsLWw.png?q=20" width="949" height="768" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1898/1*oycNP8qYvVZbONbJGnsLWw.png" width="949" height="768" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*oycNP8qYvVZbONbJGnsLWw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*oycNP8qYvVZbONbJGnsLWw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*oycNP8qYvVZbONbJGnsLWw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*oycNP8qYvVZbONbJGnsLWw.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div></figure><p id="f4ed">For each of the above pre-processing types, we’ve also set a Gaussian filter to smoothen the image. Take note of how the monochrome pre-processing filter actually gives us significantly more contours.</p><p id="e3dc">Hence, it’s important to pay heed to the kinds of images you’re dealing with when doing pre-processing.</p><p id="c748">The <code>outputImage</code> obtained after the pre-processing is fed to the Vision image request. The block of code for creating and applying Core Image filters is available in this <a href="https://github.com/anupamchugh/iOS14VisionContourDetection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Repository</a>, along with the full source code.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="e6c5">By using the <code>VNGeometryUtils</code> class, we can observe properties like diameter, bounding circle, area perimeter, and aspect ratio of the contour. Simply pass the contour, as shown below:</p><pre><span id="994f">VNGeometryUtils.boundingCircle(for: VNContour)</span></pre><p id="2e4a">This can open up new computer vision possibilities in determining the different kinds of shapes available in an image.</p><p id="02b3">Additionally, by invoking the <code>polygonApproximation(withEpsilon:)</code> method on a <code>VNContour</code>, we can further simplify our contours by filtering out little noisy parts around an edge.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="e09c">Computer vision plays a huge role in Apple’s mixed reality future. The introduction of hand and body Pose APIs, which were a part of the ARKit framework, will open up new kinds of opportunities for building intelligent computer vision applications.</p><p id="1e3a">There’s a lot of exciting stuff that came out of WWDC 2020.

You’re wondering what web development interview questions the interviewer is going to fire off at you. Your mind is playing on your nerves. Tension rising notch by notch. “Am I really ready for that coding interview?” — you start beating yourself up.</p><p id="dd5e">You check your phone — it’s 3:05 pm. No missed calls. Nothing.</p><p id="f93c">You anxiously recheck your phone — 3:15 pm… still nothing.</p><p id="4c5c">You are already 30 minutes under pressure, sweating and silently moaning — your heart races. The latent impostor syndrome arises from the depths. You start freaking out… wondering whether or not you’ve given the wrong phone number… or if they might have forgotten about you.</p><p id="5e62">Your mind is leading a furious battle to overcome your anxious trains of thought. You, filled with a desperate hope, grab your phone with your sweaty pawl and look at it for one last time… and then… it rings.</p><p id="845c">You pick up and say, “Hello,” trying to hide the trembling notes in your voice, the anxious quiver of your lips and fingers, while battling the excruciating jittery inside your mind. You introduce each other and then… kinds of interview questions for web developers thrown at you, catching you off guard, that you can barely give an adequate answer to.</p><p id="d227">You realize that you are completely f*cked up. The overwhelming anxiety is growing deeper and deeper in you. You feel like you have a 200-kg bench press on your chest that you can’t lift. Vertigo comes along, and you suddenly forget. You forget your location, the person you are talking to… everything. Hands so sweaty that you just can’t hold your phone without it slipping through your fingers.</p><p id="a240">You know that the chances of making a good impression are so damn low that you’d have more luck if you were to bet on racing cockroaches.</p><p id="262a">To avoid that, you need strong preparation for the next coding interview. You need to have a grasp of the interview questions for web developers you are being asked. That will boost your confidence and diminish the anxiety before the phone or onsite interview.</p><p id="ab34">In this article, I’ll talk about the principles behind the developer interview process — the most common web developer questions you can expect from interviewers and how to answer them in a fascinating way that will put a WOW expression on their faces (even if they want to rip your head off, rearrange your face, or just clean their shoes ;-) ).</p><p id="a90c">To start off, you need to realize that the web dev interviewing process is more like a negotiation. You’ve been probably taught as a kid that you need to be flawless during interviews and answer every question accurately to make a good impression and get hired.</p><p id="b625">This couldn’t be further from the truth (coming from someone who got hired by sending out a cold message directly to their employer — no official nor traditional interview process).</p><p id="e763">Yes, of course, you need to make a good impression. But if you think that making a good impression comes down to awkwardly staring at your interviewer, frozen, while answering every developer interview question like a robot… you’re highly mistaken my friend.</p><p id="804e">You need to be able to communicate with your future employer freely while at the same time exuding confidence, knowledge, curiosity, and most importantly, enthusiasm.</p><p id="e9be">Here are the main things employers look for when hiring people:</p><ol><li id="c9d8"><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Have-a-Great-Personality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Personality</a>.</li><li id="bc1a"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.codegiant.io/whats-the-difference-between-a-programmer-coder-developer-and-engineer-bd315404de7">Basic qualifications</a>.</li><li id="5b8b"><a href="http://breathehr.com/blog/what-is-cultural-fit-and-why-is-it-important" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Culture fit</a>.</li><li id="e3a7"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.codegiant.io/how-to-become-a-10x-engineer-492fa3f57101">Enthusiasm</a>.</li></ol><p id="c68d">You need to have a fitting personality, meaning, you need to be able to easily communicate with your team without any hassle whatsoever. You need to ask clear and concise questions while at the same time, giving thorough and detailed answers.</p><p id="51b8">Of course, you also need to possess basic qualifications for the job you are applying for. Yet, many people seem to put tons of attention to that one (which is perfectly fine), but it’s just ¼ of the whole equation.</p><p id="61d9">Culture fit — this ties back into your personality. You have to be able to sync with your team and develop a culture that everyone enjoys working in.</p><p id="147b">And finally, have a burning passion and enthusiasm for your job. You’ll be surprised how helpful enthusiasm can be.</p><p id="eee3">For example, you may not have as good a resume as the guy in the next room that’s also being interviewed… but if you display a burning enthusiasm and willingness to go out of your way, you can beat other candidates and win the job. Of course, that may not always be the case. Still, it’s much more likely for an employer to hire you as a hyper enthusiastic person than as an average employee.</p><p id="2cb1">Alright, let’s take a look at some of the most common web developer interview questions (and answers) you may encounter. We’ll first start with professional software engineer behavioral questions and then switch over to more technical questions.</p><p id="6540">Whether you are a front-end, back-end, or full-stack software developer, these common computer science interview questions will help you in your preparation for the next coding interview.</p><p id="0f2d">NOTE: Some of the behavioral questions can also be noticed in web design interviews. So if you are a web designer, this article will highly prepare you for the next web design interview.</p><p id="53af">Most interviewers start off with introductory questions. Just follow the common sense when answering these software engineer interview questions. Try to be as transparent as possible. Tell them what really sparked your interest in coding and why you applied for this job.</p><p id="9720">If you are applying for an entry-level web developer job, interviewers won’t expect years of experience (they may even skip that question) as you’ve probably just graduated or finished a coding boot camp. Yet, if you are applying for a senior software engineer position, you need to have years of experience to back up your application for that web development job.</p><p id="ed12">You need to get familiar with Agile frameworks such as Kanban and Scrum because nowadays companies are adopting Agile practices and moving away from Waterfall methodologies. Interviewers may also ask you questions about the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.codegiant.io/software-development-life-cycle-the-ultimate-guide-2020-153d17bb20fb">SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) process</a>.</p><p id="3aa1">As simple as that. You might want to focus on the specific languages that your web development job will require you to use most frequently.</p><p id="b2b4">Lately, having experience with multiple languages like C++, Java, and Python will definitely widen your interviewer’s eyes in astonishment.</p><p id="588b"><em>Credits to Andrew Mallonee, CEO at </em><a href="https://malloneemedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Mallonee Media</em></a><em>.</em></p><p id="0286">Be transparent and give a thorough explanation.. Sometimes, the interviewer might follow up with, “Do you get excited by using these languages?” but rarely. Obviously, reply with Yes and explain why you feel excited.</p><p id="fb59">It’s more of a soft skill interview question. Software engineering is a job in which you need to always thrive and sharpen your skills. Employers need to know that their developers are on the cutting edge using the latest technologies and constantly honing their skills. So, the answer to that software developer interview question would obviously be “Yes” — but expand further by telling them what interests you the most when it comes to learning new coding skills.</p><p id="14d6">Talk about projects similar to the projects you are going to be working on in the position you are applying for. If not, be genuine (always) and tell them what really sparks your passion for software development.</p><p id="e2fd">Here, interviewers particularly want to hear about severe problems, not many people on your team were able to solve, yet you were. Something important to remember is not to try to impress the interviewer — the scales will fall from his eyes immediately. Instead of making a good impression, you’ll make a desperate one. Be casual when talking about the problem that no one was able to solve except you. You, thus, exude confidence and knowledge. Being humble in the answer of this web dev interview question is key.</p><p id="6399">Another soft skill interview question. Life is about learning from your mistakes. Be as transparent as possible and openly admit the mistakes you’ve made in the past. Talk about the lessons you’ve learned. Basically, explain how you coped with your worst failures and came out stronger.</p><p id="bf9b">Research a lot prior to the interview. Go through all of their social media profiles to find little nuggets of information that would impress your interviewer. Show passion and enthusiasm for the company. Enthusiasm plays a huge role in the interview process.</p><p id="7b49">Same as previous — conduct thorough research and analysis before the interview. Show passion and enthusiasm. Tell the interviewer why you would love to work on those particular projects. They can thus see the reason behind that enthusiasm and wind out the thoughts of all that being a mere fluff.</p><p id="b2c0">These web development interview questions can happen over the phone or onsite.</p><p id="e12a">The following technical interview questions typically happen onsite, but sometimes they can take place remotely. If it’s remotely, the interviewer will ask you to share your screen to watch over your shoulder while you are coding and at the same time answering software development interview questions.</p><p id="c6ea">Keep in mind that the technical questions you are being asked highly depend on the position you are applying for. We’ll try to cover some of the most common software developer interview questions and give you reasonable answers that you can adjust to your situation easily.</p><p id="699b"><em>Credits to Michael Miller, CEO at </em><a href="https://vpnonline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>VPN Online</em></a><em>.</em></p><p id="fc04">There are lots of ways you can write your code, and all of them are correct. The company you want to join probably has a set standard for writing code and will perhaps compare your answer to that standard. Usually, most companies look for developers who take the simplest approach to code and try to weep out those who praise the sophisticated way of coding. That’s because companies want to easily maintain and document their code.</p><p id="3b99">Java developer interview questions are quite common. When interviewers ask you …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

<p>The aim of this project was to display a colour image on a black and white monitor, by overlaying an acetate bayer filter over the monitor and mosaicing a colour image.</p>



<p>I obtained an Eizo B&amp;W monitor from ebay, which I was intending for use viewing B&amp;W photos and was curious if I could replicate an effect similar to <strong>Autochrome Lumière</strong> ( see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autochrome_Lumi%C3%A8re">wikipedia</a> ) where they overlay colour filters over a B&amp;W photographic plate, using starch grains, which creates a colour image.</p>



<p>The following image shows a 500x microscope image of the pixels that make up the B&amp;W LCD display, taken using a very cheap USB microscope.  It looks to me as if each pixel, is represented by 4 sub-pixel elements, please correct me if this appears not be the case.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0007.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0007.jpg 640w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0007-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<p>A pdf was created of the bayer display, with the dimensions 433.1mm x 324.8mm.  The monitor has a resolution of 2048×1536 and I assumed the pixels had the same width as height.</p>



<p>You can see an example of the pdf I created below, where for example a blue element, should be represented by 2×2 pixels from the B&amp;W monitor. </p>

<p>I created 3 pdfs:</p>



<ul><li>bayer_1.pdf  –  each element, is represented by 1 pixel from the display</li><li>bayer_2.pdf  –  each element, is represented by 2×2 pixels from the display (this is the acetate used in the video)</li><li>bayer_4.pdf – each element is represented by 4×4 pixels from the display</li></ul>



<p>The following image shows the printed acetate with the bayer pattern:</p>

<p>The following, is a B&amp;W image with mosaicing applied from the colour image:</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>



<figure><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fig-1-1024x616.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fig-1-1024x616.png 1024w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fig-1-300x180.png 300w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fig-1-768x462.png 768w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fig-1-1536x923.png 1536w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fig-1.png 1898w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The monitor I am using seems to generally be used portrait, to make it landscape on linux:</p>


<pre title="">xrandr --output HDMI1 --rotate left
</pre>


<h2>Image of effect</h2>



<p>As you can see the effect of my attempt is quite slight, but you can see in the centre the different colours of the balloons.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001.jpg"><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<h2>Video of effect</h2>



<p>The effect is also demonstrated in the following video, with the following parameters:</p>


<pre title=""> mpv out.mkv --fullscreen --loop --brightness=10 --contrast=20
</pre>

</p></figure>



<h2>Microscope images of the bayer filter (2×2 scaling)</h2>



<p>2×2 bayer filter, I tried to design it so that for example the ‘red’ square covers 2×2 pixels on the monitor</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001-1.jpg 640w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0001-1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<h2>Chess board </h2>



<p>As suggested by Olivier, I’ve just created 2 chess board images.  Olivier was correct that a single pixel consists of 3 sub-pixels 🙂</p>



<p>1×1 (the white patch is 1 pixel), monitor in landscape, image in correct orientation from microscope (left, towards left monitor, top, towards top of monitor)</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0020.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0020.jpg 640w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0020-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<p>2×2 </p>



<figure><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0002.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0002.jpg 640w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0002-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<h2>Possible improvements</h2>



<p>I wonder if by measuring the exact pixel width/height under a microscope, if the effect could possibly be improved somewhat, as that information could be used when creating the acetate filter.</p>



<p>Alignment is also a key issue, I need to think of ways to improve that possibly using a microscope while aligning the acetate.</p>



<p>I’d be interested in other improvements I could make too!</p>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> is a personal knowledge management and sharing system inspired by <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>, built on <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> and <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>You can use <strong>Foam</strong> for organising your research, keeping re-discoverable notes, writing long-form content and, optionally, publishing it to the web.</p>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> is free, open source, and extremely extensible to suit your personal workflow. You own the information you create with Foam, and you’re free to share it, and collaborate on it with anyone you want.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-foam">How do I use Foam?</h2>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> is a tool that supports creating relationships between thoughts and information to help you think better.</p>

<p><img src="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/assets/images/foam-features-dark-mode-demo.png" alt="Foam kitchen sink, showing a few of the key features"></p>

<p>Whether you want to build a <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">Second Brain</a> or a <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/">Zettelkasten</a>, write a book, or just get better at long-term learning, <strong>Foam</strong> can help you organise your thoughts if you follow these simple rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a single <strong>Foam</strong> workspace for all your knowledge and research following the <a href="#getting-started">Getting started</a> guide.</li>
  <li>Write your thoughts in markdown documents (I like to call them <strong>Bubbles</strong>, but that might be more than a little twee). These documents should be atomic: Put things that belong together into a single document, and limit its content to that single topic. (<a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#principles">source</a>)</li>
  <li>Use Foam’s shortcuts and autocompletions to link your thoughts together with <code>[[wiki-links]]</code>, and navigate between them to explore your knowledge graph.</li>
  <li>Get an overview of your <strong>Foam</strong> workspace using a [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/graph-visualisation" title="Graph visualisation">graph-visualisation</a>] (⚠️ WIP), and discover relationships between your thoughts with the use of [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/backlinking" title="Backlinking">backlinking</a>].</li>
</ol>

<p>Foam is a like a bathtub: <em>What you get out of it depends on what you put into it.</em></p>

<h2 id="whats-in-a-foam">What’s in a Foam?</h2>

<p>Like the soapy suds it’s named after, <strong>Foam</strong> is mostly air.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The editing experience of <strong>Foam</strong> is powered by VS Code, enhanced by workspace settings that glue together [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recommended-extensions" title="Recommended Extensions">recommended-extensions</a>] and preferences optimised for writing and navigating information.</li>
  <li>To back up, collaborate on and share your content between devices, Foam pairs well with <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</li>
  <li>To publish your content, you can set it up to publish to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> with zero code and zero config, or to any website hosting platform like <a href="http://netlify.com/">Netlify</a> or <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: This documentation was researched, written and published using <strong>Foam</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>⚠️ Foam is still in preview. Expect the experience to be a little rough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These instructions assume you have a GitHub account, and you have Visual Studio Code installed.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Use the <a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template">foam-template project</a> to generate a new repository. If you’re logged into GitHub, you can just hit this button:</p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate" data-icon="octicon-repo-template" data-size="large" aria-label="Use this template foambubble/foam-template on GitHub">Use this template</a></p>

    <p>(If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private, or if you don’t want to use GitHub to host your workspace at all, choose <strong>Download as ZIP</strong> instead of <strong>Use this template</strong>.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository">Clone the repository locally</a> and open it in VS Code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When prompted to install recommended extensions, click <strong>Install all</strong> (or <strong>Show Recommendations</strong> if you want to review and install them one by one)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>After setting up the repository, open <code>.vscode/settings.json</code> and edit, add or remove any settings you’d like for your Foam workspace.</p>

<p>To learn more about how to use <strong>Foam</strong>, read the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes" title="Recipes">recipes</a>].</p>

<p>There are [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/known-issues" title="Known Issues">known-issues</a>], and I’m sure, many unknown issues! Please <a href="http://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues">report them on GitHub</a>!</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> doesn’t have features in the traditional sense. Out of the box, you have access to all features of VS Code and all the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recommended-extensions" title="Recommended Extensions">recommended-extensions</a>] you choose to install, but it’s up to you to discover what you can do with it!</p>

<p><img src="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/assets/images/foam-navigation-demo.gif" alt="Short video of Foam in use"></p>

<p>Head over to [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes" title="Recipes">recipes</a>] for some useful patterns and ideas!</p>

<h2 id="call-to-adventure">Call To Adventure</h2>

<p>The goal of <strong>Foam</strong> is to be your personal companion on your quest for knowledge.</p>

<p>It’s is currently about “10% ready” relative to all the features I’ve thought of, but I’ve only thought of ~1% of the features it could have, and I’m excited to learn from others.</p>

<p>I am using it as my personal thinking tool. By making it public, I hope to learn from others not only how to improve Foam, but also to improve how I learn and manage information.</p>

<p>If that sounds like something you’re interested in, I’d love to have you along on the journey.</p>

This analysis is <em>flow-insensitive</em> - it does not depend on the flow of the execution of the program. If an expression is of type <code>int</code> then it will have type <code>int</code> regardless of what was executed before or after it.</p><p>Some program properties do however depend on the execution path taken by a program. Dataflow analysis tracks how a particular value might propagate as the program executes.</p><p>For example, a value might <em>alias</em> - you could have multiple references pointing to that value. Whether two references <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> alias can’t be determined by looking at their assignments in isolation - we need to track the execution to determine if they have the same value assigned to them.</p><div><p><span>alias_example</span></p><div><pre><p><span>let</span><span> x </span><span>=</span><span> someObject</span></p><p><span></span><span>...</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> y </span><span>=</span><span> someObject </span></p></pre></div></div><p>Another example is <strong>liveness analysis</strong> - we say a value is <em>live</em> if some point later in the program it could be used, and <em>dead</em> otherwise.</p><div><p><span>liveness_example</span></p><div><pre><p><span>let</span><span> x </span><span>=</span><span> someValue </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>...</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>x </span><span>=</span><span> someOtherValue </span></p></pre></div></div><p>Why do we care about alias analysis and liveness analysis? Well it turns out that Rust’s <em>borrow-checker</em> uses a combination of these to determine when a reference is borrowed. Bolt has a <em>linear</em> capability in its type system which acts the same.</p><p>Both Rust’s borrow checker and Bolt’s capabilities prevent data races - an explanation why is in <a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt-dissertation/blob/master/dissertation.pdf">my dissertation</a>.</p><p>In a nutshell, Rust works on the principle of <strong>ownership</strong>: you either have one reference (owner) that can read/write (a <em>mutable</em> reference) or you can <em>borrow</em> (aka alias) the reference.</p><p>To enforce this we care about 2 things:</p><ol><li>When is a reference borrowed? (alias analysis)</li><li>For how long is it borrowed? (liveness analysis)</li></ol><p>Let’s elaborate on that second point. When is a reference borrowed? The first version of Rust’s borrow checker said this was whilst an alias was in scope.</p><div><p><span>borrow_example</span></p><div><pre><p><span>let</span><span> x </span><span>=</span><span> something </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> y </span><span>=</span><span> x</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>...</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>y</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>  x </span><span>=</span><span> somethingElse</span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p></pre></div></div><p>That means we cannot reassign <code>x</code> in the example until <code>y</code> is out of scope. This is a “lexical lifetime” - <code>y</code>’s borrow lifetime is determined by its lexical scope. So that means <code>x</code> can’t be reassigned, since it is borrowed at that point. But <code>y</code> isn’t being used so surely <code>x</code> isn’t still borrowed?</p><p>That’s the idea behind <strong>non-lexical lifetimes</strong> - the borrow ends when the value of <code>y</code> is dead - i.e. it is not being used.</p><p>In Bolt, we’ll be tracking the lifetimes of references to <em>objects</em>.</p><p>Let’s get implementing it!</p><h2 id="alias-analysis"><a href="#alias-analysis" aria-label="alias analysis permalink"></a>Alias Analysis</h2><p>The first step is to determine when two values alias. How do we know two references will point to the same object without actually executing the program?</p><p>We use <strong>abstract interpretation</strong>.</p><h3 id="abstract-interpretation"><a href="#abstract-interpretation" aria-label="abstract interpretation permalink"></a>Abstract Interpretation</h3><p>Abstract interpretation is the process of simulating the execution of the program but only storing the program properties we care about. So in our case, we don’t care about what the actual result of the program execution is, we’re just tracking the <em>set of aliases</em>.</p><div><p>Implicit in this is a set of rules for how the program will execute, we call this its <strong>operational semantics</strong>. We will not go into details here, but it’s things like:</p><ul><li>Do we evaluate expressions left-to-right or right-to-left?</li><li>When calling a function, do we fully evaluate the argument expression and then call the function with the value of that argument, or do we just plug in the unevaluated argument expression directly into the function and only evaluate it at the point it is used in the function body? The former is called <strong>call-by-value</strong> and is used in most mainstream languages like Java and Python, the latter is called <strong>call-by-name</strong> and is used in Haskell and Lisp.</li></ul><p>There’s a lot more to say about this - perhaps it’s worthy of its own blog post? Send me a tweet if you would like one!</p></div><p>When do we have aliasing? When a new variable is declared or when it is reassigned. For simplicity (and also because we don’t want the lifetime of the alias to be larger than the original value) we will not allow aliasing via reassigning an existing variable (e.g. <code>x := y</code>).</p><p>So we care about expressions of this form:</p><p>The expression <code>e</code> can <em>reduce</em> to a value when executing e.g. <code>1+2</code> reduces to <code>3</code>.</p><p>If when executing <code>e</code> it reduces to a reference <code>y</code>, then the overall expression would look like:</p><p>And so <code>x</code> would alias <code>y</code>. So let’s write a function that, given an expression, will return the list of identifiers that it could possible reduce to. That’ll tell us what <code>x</code> could possibly alias.</p><p>We’ll store this helper function in an “environment” of helper functions used in the data-race type-checking stage of the Bolt compiler: <code>data_race_checker_env.mli</code></p><p>The type signature of this OCaml function is as we’d expect:</p><p>A reminder of the type of <code>expr</code> defined in the <a href="https://mukulrathi.co.uk/create-your-own-programming-language/intro-to-type-checking/#annotating-our-ast-with-types">previous post</a> - <code>loc</code> encodes the line number and position of the expression - used for error messages.</p><div><p><span><a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt/blob/simple-compiler-tutorial/src/frontend/typing/typed_ast.mli"> <!-- -->typed_ast.mli</a></span></p><div><pre><p><span>type</span><span> identifier </span><span>=</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>Variable</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> type</span><span>_</span><span>expr </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>Var_name</span><span>.</span><span>t</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>ObjField</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> </span><span>Class_name</span><span>.</span><span>t </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>Var_name</span><span>.</span><span>t </span><span>*</span><span> type</span><span>_</span><span>expr </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>Field_name</span><span>.</span><span>t</span></p><p><span></span><span>type</span><span> expr </span><span>=</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>Integer</span><span>     </span><span>of</span><span> loc </span><span>*</span><span> int</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>Boolean</span><span>     </span><span>of</span><span> loc </span><span>*</span><span> bool</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>Identifier</span><span>  </span><span>of</span><span> loc </span><span>*</span><span> identifier</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>Constructor</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> loc </span><span>*</span><span> type</span><span>_</span><span>expr </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>Class_name</span><span>.</span><span>t </span><span>*</span><span> constructor</span><span>_</span><span>arg list</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>Let</span><span>         </span><span>of</span><span> loc </span><span>*</span><span> type</span><span>_</span><span>expr </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>Var_name</span><span>.</span><span>t </span><span>*</span><span> expr</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>Assign</span><span>      </span><span>of</span><span> loc </span><span>*</span><span> type</span><span>_</span><span>expr </span><span>*</span><span> identifier </span><span>*</span><span> expr</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>If</span><span>          </span><span>of</span><span> loc </span><span>*</span><span> type</span><span>_</span><span>expr </span><span>*</span><span> expr </span><span>*</span><span> block</span><span>_</span><span>expr </span><span>*</span><span> block</span><span>_</span><span>expr</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>and</span><span> block</span><span>_</span><span>expr </span><span>=</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>Block</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> loc </span><span>*</span><span> type</span><span>_</span><span>expr </span><span>*</span><span> expr list</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Starting off with the simple cases, it’s clear an integer or a boolean value doesn’t reduce to an identifier, and an identifier expression reduces to that identifier.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I am not going to discuss about whether logging visitors is a good or a bad practice, I am going to assume that this has already been analyzed and decided, and that the final decision is that logging visitors and statics is needed.</p>

<p>With that defined, now comes the question, which logging solution should be used.</p>

<h2 id="some-alternatives">Some Alternatives</h2>

<p>The alternatives comes in two main groups</p>

<h3 id="server-logs-analyzers">Server logs analyzers</h3>

<p>If the site is served from just one server, or if the spread logs can be joined, then those logs can be parsed and analyzed by a specialized software that will show the results in a fancy and readable format. The options are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://awstats.sourceforge.io/">Awstats</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.webalizer.org/">Webalizer</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://goaccess.io/">Goaccess</a></li>
</ul>

<p>All those three are open source, and easy to use, the main advantage is that privacy of the visitor is respected, and no info is going out the website's server.</p>

<h3 id="online-analytics-software">Online analytics software</h3>

<p>The second main set of alternatives are online analytics tools, there are a lot of them, here will be listed the most common ones.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://matomo.org/home/">Matomo</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.openwebanalytics.com/">Open Web Analytics</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/">GoatCounter</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://metrical.xyz/">Metrical</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/">SimpleAnalytics</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Except the first one, all others provide an option to log with no cookies, so, they are cookie GDPR compliant. I really recommend you to stay away from Google Analytics and use any of the other options here listed.</p>

<h2 id="plausible">Plausible</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.garron.blog/images/2020/06/plausible-home-page.png" alt="plausible-home-page"></p>

<p>Plausible is a relatively new service created by <a href="https://twitter.com/ukutaht">Uku</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/markosaric">Marko</a>, the service was created first on Uku's free time at the end of 2018, looking for a tool that can offer 80% of Google Analytics benefits with only 20% of the complexity.</p>

<p>The result was Plausible</p>

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>

<p>As stated above plausible aims at being simple, avoid complexity and be a lightweight alternative to Google Analytics, therefore it is not as feature rich as Google Analytics, but most of GA features are never used anyway, or are inaccurate and thus unusable.</p>

<p><strong>Online Visitors</strong></p>

<p>At the top of its page there is an indicator showing the number of current visitors, this is one of the best features, because it can be used by system administrators to check if the number of online visitors could be related with some service degradation, or the extra load on server resources.</p>

<p><strong>Date Range</strong></p>

<p>The date range can be  selected from the menu at the right top of the screen</p>

<p><img src="https://www.garron.blog/images/2020/06/plausible-date-range.png" alt="plausible-date-range"></p>

<p>The menu offers different pre-sets as seen above, and a custom range from where any range can be selected.</p>

<p><strong>Top referrers</strong></p>

<p>The screen is divided in quadrants with different information for the users, the first one is top-referrers</p>

<p><img src="https://www.garron.blog/images/2020/06/plausible-top-referrers.png" alt="plausible-top-referrers"></p>

<p>At first glance the top nine can be seen, and clicking on <em>more</em> it shows the complete list of referrers, this information is presented for the date rage selected above.</p>

<p><strong>Top Pages</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://www.garron.blog/images/2020/06/plausible-top-pages.png" alt="plausible-top-pages"></p>

<p>At the right of Top Referrer is located Top Pages, and it shows the most visited pages in the selected date range, once again if more is clicked the complete list is shown in the screen.</p>

<p><strong>Countries</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://www.garron.blog/images/2020/06/plausible-countries.png" alt="plausible-countries"></p>

<p>Still in the dashboard, and below Top Referrers, the information of countries from where the visitors to the site are coming is located. The world map is shown, and using color coding the countries that send more visitors are easily identifiable, and if the <em>more</em> button is clicked a complete list of the countries with the percentage of visitors is shown on the screen, but if the mouse pointer is hovered over the map the number of visitors that came to the site in the selected date range is shown.</p>

<p><strong>Devices</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://www.garron.blog/images/2020/06/plausible-devices.png" alt="plausible-devices"></p>

<p>Finally, the last quadrant of the dashboard shows different information about devices.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Size: Shows the size of the screen, it actually says if the visitor  came from a Desktop, laptop, tablet or phone</li>
  <li>Browser: This one shows the browser the visitors were using, and the percentage of users with different browsers</li>
  <li>OS: Finally, this one shows the percentage of visitors using the different Operating Systems when landing on the website.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pricing">Pricing</h3>

<p>Pricing is simple, given the number of visitors to the websites, there is an associated price</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Visitors per month</th>
      <th>Price $us</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>10 K</td>
      <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>100 K</td>
      <td>12</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>200 K</td>
      <td>18</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>500 K</td>
      <td>27</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1 M</td>
      <td>48</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2 M</td>
      <td>69</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5 M</td>
      <td>99</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>10 M</td>
      <td>150</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>There is no extra charge for more sites, any number of sites can be logged, and they only charge for the accumulated number of visitors.</p>

<p>Once subscribed to a plan, they do not charge extra if the number of visitors of the selected package is surpassed, nor the visits stop being logged. But if for two months in a row the limit is surpassed, a higher packages should be selected or the account should be canceled.</p>

<p>There is a discount on any package if yearly is payment is selected.</p>

<h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>

<p><strong>Code size</strong></p>

<p>The javascript snipped that needs to be installed in the webpages to be logged weights less than 1 Kbyte.</p>

<p><strong>Custom Domain</strong></p>

<p>The javascript file can be downloaded from a custom domain, making it more efficient as it is less prone to be blocked by browsers</p>

<p><strong>No Cookies</strong></p>

<p>Plausible takes privacy seriously, no cookies are used to track visitors, their visits are logged when they land on the website and some statistical information is recorded, no visitor is identifiable.</p>

<p>Using Plausible website owners comply with GDPR, CCPA</p>

<p>According to its website, this is the info they collect from visitors.</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>Data point</th><th>Example</th><th>Comment</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Page URL</td><td>https://yoursite.com/pricing</td><td>We&nbsp;&nbsp;track the page URL of each page view on your website. We use this to&nbsp;&nbsp;show you which pages have been viewed and how many times a particular&nbsp;&nbsp;page has been viewed. <p>The hostname and path are collected. Query parameters are discarded, except for these special query parameters: ref=, source= and utm_source=.</p></td></tr><tr><td>HTTP Referer</td><td>https://facebook.com</td><td>We use the referrer string to show you the number of visitors referred to your website from links on other sites.</td></tr><tr><td>Browser</td><td>Chrome</td><td>We&nbsp;&nbsp;use this to show you what browsers people use when visiting your&nbsp;&nbsp;website. This is derived from the User-Agent HTTP header. The full&nbsp;&nbsp;User-Agent is discarded.</td></tr><tr><td>Operating system</td><td>macOS</td><td>We&nbsp;&nbsp;use this to show you what operating systems people use when visiting&nbsp;&nbsp;your website. We only show the brand of the operating system and don’t&nbsp;&nbsp;include the version number or any other details. This is derived from&nbsp;&nbsp;the User-Agent HTTP header. The full User-Agent is discarded.</td></tr><tr><td>Device type</td><td>Desktop</td><td>We&nbsp;&nbsp;use this to show you what devices people use when visiting your&nbsp;&nbsp;website. This is derived from window.innerWidth. The actual width of the&nbsp;&nbsp;browser in pixels is discarded.</td></tr><tr><td>Visitor Country</td><td>United Kingdom</td><td>We&nbsp;&nbsp;look up the visitor’s country using their IP address. We do not track&nbsp;&nbsp;anything more granular than the country of origin and the IP address of&nbsp;&nbsp;the visitor is discarded. We never store IP addresses in our database or&nbsp;&nbsp;logs.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>Even the IP that is used to determine unique visitors is not stored on the database, and it is hashed and then stored, that way no visitor is identifiable.</p>

<p><strong>Open Source</strong></p>

<p>Finally all code is open source, so anyone can check it to be sure privacy is respected.</p>

<p><strong>Self Hosted option</strong></p>

<p>On June 12, 2020 Plausible was made available for self host it. The instructions as well as the code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/plausible/analytics/blob/master/HOSTING.md">Plausible repository</a></p>

<h2 id="last-words">Last words</h2>

<p>Statistics help webmasters and system administrator to better manage websites, it also important for companies to follow any campaign success or failure, but at the same time visitor's privacy should be respected.</p>

<p>Plausible gives enough information to website owners in a clear and easily readable way while respecting visitors privacy.</p>

<p>There are other options, but for me, for the price the simplicity and information given, <strong>Plausible</strong> is the best option.</p>

Distributing Attention
</h3>


<div id="post-body-1881766077254850208">
<p><span><span>Turns out people shouldn't neglect the intrinsic value of the present. On the importance of how we distribute our attention.</span></span><br>
<span><span>All political ideologies are an expression of a policy with an attention distribution.</span></span></p>
<div><p>
The way attention is distributed tells a lot about ideology.</p><table><tbody>
<tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3MOSHVx_d5g/XgXb0LZdYcI/AAAAAAAAWm0/vtJva24F394n-tpoVIiueIQhy6n2rEF1ACK4BGAYYCw/s1600/attention-distribution-curve.png" imageanchor="1"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3MOSHVx_d5g/XgXb0LZdYcI/AAAAAAAAWm0/vtJva24F394n-tpoVIiueIQhy6n2rEF1ACK4BGAYYCw/s1600/attention-distribution-curve.png"></a></td></tr>
<tr><td><span>Attention distribution curves</span></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<br>

<p>
Whereas Moderate (Conservatist) ideologies are focusing their attention on multiple layers of the present (Curve B), Primitive (Immobilist), and Radical (Progressivist) ideologies, focus their attention on the edges of the present (Curve A).</p><p>


Immobilism is about procrastination of expectations.<br>
Conservatism is about prediction of expectations.<br>
Progressivism is about anticipation of expectations.</p><p>

Immobilist and Progressivist ideologies are complementary.</p></div>
<table><tbody>
<tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VbM3qZttnmI/XSIP33QGpUI/AAAAAAAAU-g/EZCC291tUOcp6KAN7CLdmtx9I5PbI_AxQCLcBGAs/s1600/political-ideologies.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="978" data-original-width="977" height="640" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VbM3qZttnmI/XSIP33QGpUI/AAAAAAAAU-g/EZCC291tUOcp6KAN7CLdmtx9I5PbI_AxQCLcBGAs/s640/political-ideologies.png" width="636"></a></td></tr>
<tr><td>Political ideologies and their respective policies.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<div><p>
All political ideologies are an expression of a policy.</p><p>

Whether the policy is about spread, diversity or dependency of attention, whether it is generalisation, specialisation, concentration, diffusion, separation or unification, what makes monarchism different from capitalism and imperialism is how it assumes attention should be distributed.</p><p>

Whereas Moderate Conservatist ideologies are complementary to other Moderate (Conservatist) ideologies, Primitive (Immobilist) ideologies are complementary to Radial (Primitivist) ideologies.</p><p>

Example :<br>
- Populism Primitive Immobilist ideology is complementary to Equalitarianism Radical progressivist ideology.<br>
- Feudalism Radical Progressivist ideology is complementary to Syndicalism Primitive Immobilist ideology.<br>
- Corporatism Moderate Conservatist ideology is complementary to Republicanism Moderate Conservatist&nbsp;ideology.<br>
And so on.</p><p>


There is a state of equilibrium that attention policies can reach and maintain.<br>We can suppose that it is this state of equilibrium that any correctly functioning general&nbsp;intelligence seeks to optimize it's memories for.</p></div>

Turns Out People Shouldn't Try to Learn From Failure. On The Importance of Growing Success 
People often say that failure is the best teacher. But is it really true? </p><p> 
First, let's define a few things :<br>
Growing : It's when there's more of it and more of it and more if it ...<br>
Success : When you expect something and it happens<br>
Failure : When you expect something and it doesn't happen</p><p>
The problem with people who think that they can learn from failure is that they will not pay enough attention to their successes and try to learn from failure and then fail to learn.</p><p>
The only way someone can learn is from success.</p><p>
There is no other way to succeed than to try something often and repeatedly and see if it meets our expectations every time.</p><p>
The greater amount of success you have the greater amount of success you will have, unless...</p><p>
Unless you think that failure teaches anything.</p><p>
Thinking that people can learn from failure is wishful thinking.</p><p>

If getting payed is only a symptom then what causes someone to be a professional?</p><p>
A professional is capable of consistently predicting the outcomes of his actions.<br>
An amateur is capable of consistently surprising everyone, including himself.<br>
It's not sure whether it will be a good outcome, or whether it will be a bad outcome, one thing is sure it's that it's not clear what the outcome will be.</p></div>

                <!-- End Toc -->
                <p>Last year as I kicked off my career entering the professional tech world, I came across the concept of <strong>Objective, Key and Results (OKRs)</strong> at work. I was quite intrigued by the whole concept of OKRs.</p>

<p>In very layman terms —</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Main objective of OKR is to plan out qualitative goals with quantitative results for those with proper time tracking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People do use diary or todo apps for tracking there work. Todo apps usually work for tracking tasks over a shorter duration. You need a framework to plan out for your bigger goal and track your progress towards it.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*bX5Vy1OPJ3LImq9DHIgU5g.png" alt="Personal OKR Header Section"></p>

<p>In this blog, I will try to explain how you can plan and why it is important to have your Personal OKR. Let’s begin!</p>

<h2 id="what">What?</h2>

<p>OKRs is already a very popular term in business, most probably it is being used at your workplace too. It is a <strong>goal-setting framework</strong> that basically covers big and challenging goals with a set of defined measurable results for achieving these goals.</p>

<h3 id="objective">Objective — </h3>

<ul>
  <li>What do you want to achieve over a period of time?</li>
  <li>Objectives should be ambitious, more <strong>inspirational</strong> (which requires more effort of yours), bold and <strong>qualitative</strong></li>
  <li>Your targets should not be something very easily achievable.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Eg.</strong> Improve the financial condition, Get better at reading, etc</p>

<h3 id="key-results">Key Results</h3>

<ul>
  <li>KRs are steps you need to achieve the objective.</li>
  <li>KRs should be <strong>Quantitative</strong> i.e having defined metrics! This should not be vague. Add numbers, avoid terms like “more/less”.<br>
Google uses. a scale of 0–1 for tracking progress for each key result.</li>
  <li>Make KRs <strong>Time-bounded</strong>. This helps you tracking progress over the period and lets you recalibrate your tasks.</li>
  <li>KRs should be <strong>Binary</strong> i.e Complete / Incomplete</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Eg.</strong> Read 3 books on investing, Read 1500 pages monthly, etc</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="personal-vs-work-okrs">Personal vs Work OKRs?</h3>

<p>OKRs are used by both teams and individuals, though mostly in work environments. The concept of OKR is simple and works pretty effectively for personal use as well. It is super important to have separate personal and work OKRs since your work goals are different from personal life and goals.</p>

<p>In personal OKRs, you would want to track things like —</p>

<ol>
  <li>Family time</li>
  <li>Personal finance</li>
  <li>Fitness</li>
  <li>Hobbies</li>
</ol>

<p>Personal OKRs are <strong>literally personal</strong>!<br>
It varies from person to person. It’s good to look for ideas on how people use OKRs, but you should align it for your goals and aspirations which you want to achieve.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Actions — and data — speak louder than words.”<br>
― <strong>John Doerr,</strong> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/54960827"><strong>Measure What Matters</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>OKRs help you plan your goals in a structured and planned fashion, but there is more to it! Let me explain —</p>

<ul>
  <li>Better <strong>Focus</strong> and <strong>Alignment</strong> on what you want to achieve. Since OKRs are limited, you don’t want to waste time and do stuff that doesn’t really help you achieve what you want!</li>
  <li>These give the <strong>Motivation</strong> to work towards your objectives and a sense of urgency to finish them.</li>
  <li>OKRs help in building a <strong>Habit</strong> of planning things in general and following the path to achieving them. Eg. You have an objective of getting better at reading, you start reading 30 pages daily. Now, it slowly builds into your habit to read. Next year, even if you don’t have this objective, you’ll still read :)</li>
  <li><strong>Time Tracking</strong> is super useful and important since they give a timeline for you to work and align your tasks accordingly.</li>
  <li><strong>Metrics</strong> and Numbers help you visualize your progress. When you see 80% completion, you get a psychological motivation to make it 100%</li>
  <li>If you have a <strong>Public OKR</strong>, you get another source to actually work and complete your task.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/benefits-of-okrs/">Measure what matters</a> brings a similar <strong>F.A.C.T.S</strong> showing the benefits of OKRs.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="how">How?</h2>

<p>Now, that you understand the importance of Personal OKRs and are ready to create yours, I’ll show how I personally maintain my OKRs and share resources that might be useful for you!</p>

<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>

<p>There are a lot of tools that you can use to start creating an OKR. I personally being a big fan of <a href="http://notion.so/">Notion</a>, use it to maintain my Personal OKRs. You can use anything from professional notes and trackers like <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, <a href="http://notion.so/">Notion</a>, <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> to simple excel sheet template.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*IOarq_FgPMWWVqohXAMvHg.png" alt="OKR Tracking with Notes"></p>

<p>I usually update my OKRs monthly since I maintain a yearly OKR tracker. You can adjust it according to the timeline you are planning for.</p>

<p>I maintain different tables for each of my Objectives. In the image below</p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong> — Boost Knowledge</p>

<p><strong>Key Results</strong> —</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Read 20 books</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create 2 open source projects</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Time Tracking</strong> — <br>
I maintain time tracking based on which quarter of the year I want this to be completed. I do break these KRs into sub-tasks which are added to my Todolist with a specified timeline.<br>
I use <strong>EOY</strong> (End of Year) in cases when I want that KR to be worked on throughout the year.</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>—</p>

<p>I set my KRs progress to one of the 5 stages. It helps me keep track of what to do next and what is already completed. I sometimes add <strong>At-Risk</strong> tag to denote that this KR is probably not happening. I already added <strong>At-Risk</strong> to my traveling KRs this year credits to corona :(</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*HQJ56kvlk0-mDZiXBrptfw.png" alt="Quarter based timeframe and Status for tracking progress"></p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>  — <br>
These are basically notes/links relevant to KR which I would want to revisit when I come back to this sometime later.</p>

<h2 id="tips-and-tricks">Tips and Tricks</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Avoid changing OKRs</strong>! It is okay to update OKRs when you achieve something or want to divert. Do not remove OKRs just because you are doing something else now, at the end of the timeframe you should know that you failed at this due to XYZ reason, and was it worth it or not?</li>
  <li>You will fail in many Key results! <strong>It is okay to fail</strong>, now you get an idea on what did you miss, how can you improve and rework accordingly.</li>
  <li><strong>Regularly update your KRs status and notes</strong>, this gives you an idea of where you need to focus more in the next few days. A biweekly or monthly review is generally a good time to revisit OKRs. I set up a biweekly reminder in my calendar for this!</li>
  <li>You can <strong>add a score</strong> to each KR to make things more interesting. For the first time, I wanted to keep it simple. Do share if you use some interesting scoring :P</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid setting too many OKRs</strong> instead make the OKRs more challenging.</li>
  <li>Add links to your weekly tasks in notes sections. This helps you view how did you spend your week in the perspective of achieving your OKR results. Even add resources for specific KRs. This helps you increase your knowledge base over a period of time.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep it simple</strong>! Follow what you can maintain. Don’t overcomplicate :)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>by Shalon van Tine</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Postmodernism: A Problem of the Left, or the Right?</em></strong></p>



<p>In his popular self-help book <em>12 Rules for Life</em> and on his personal website, psychologist Jordan Peterson argues that the “postmodernist left” has created a culture where all truth and morality is relative. Blaming the “dominance of postmodern Marxist rhetoric in the academy,” Peterson claims that political correctness and hostility towards men are the results of this so-called postmodernism. Peterson is not, of course, the first to accuse the left of promoting a postmodern agenda. In the 1980s, classicist Allan Bloom feared that left-leaning professors filled young minds “with a jargon derived from the despair of European thinkers, gaily repackaged for American consumption and presented as the foundation for a pluralistic society.” Following suit, conservative pundit Roger Kimball wrote that college students had become “committed to an ethic of cultural relativism,” and that “in order to realize the freedom that postmodernism promises, culture must be transformed into a field of arbitrary options.”<br>Even though conservatives characterized postmodernism as a problem with the left, the rise of “fake news” and media spectacle associated with Donald Trump caused left-leaning thinkers to depict postmodernism as a problem with the right. Literary critic Jeet Heer called Trump “America’s First Postmodern President,” saying that the president “is the product not just of a fluke election or a racist and sexist backlash, but the culmination of late capitalism.” Journalist Ryan Cooper argued that the politics of the right represented “a load of cynical gobbledygook,” and that “if there is any political faction that behaves like the most hysterically exaggerated caricature of postmodernism, it is the current Republican Party.”</p>



<p>That both sides of the political spectrum blame postmodernism for society’s ills points to an issue of definition. Postmodernism is not so much a problem of the left or the right, but rather, the problem lies in its vague terminology and the common theoretical misunderstandings associated with it. In other words, when the left or the right speaks of postmodernism, they usually mean different things. Postmodernism is better understood as an umbrella term that houses a wide range of political, economic, and aesthetic ideas under it. To get to the heart of postmodernism’s consequences, it is first necessary to take a step back and determine what postmodernism actually is.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Postmodernism and Its Relationship to Modernism</em></strong></p>



<p>As its name suggests, postmodernism is often considered the era that comes after modernism. Like postmodernism, modernism is a broad category that contains a collection of twentieth-century ideas, and it is replete with its own contradictions and varying perspectives. In some ways, postmodernism is a reaction against modernism, yet in other ways, postmodernism is an extension of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Put simply, modernism refers to a collection of philosophies and artistic movements that sprouted up in response to the horrors of World War I. Its origins, however, go back a little earlier to the end of the nineteenth century when some key figures uprooted long-held paradigms. Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution is arguably the first major influence on modernist thought, as it demonstrated that humans were not divinely created, but were instead the product of a larger biological and ecological system. Fascinated by Darwin’s assertion that nature was dynamic, Friedrich Nietzsche contemplated the spiritual and philosophical consequences of such a world, and he concluded that the history of philosophy from Plato through Hegel had to be reconsidered when faced with the newfound reality of evolution. Similarly, Karl Marx criticized the idealist notions that dominated philosophy at the time and instead used Darwin’s concepts as the scientific basis for his materialist approach to history. And, also like Darwin, Sigmund Freud asserted that human action is shaped more by one’s environment and subconscious fears and desires rather than one’s conscious, rational thought as the Enlightenment philosophers had declared.&nbsp;</p>







<p><em>“Postmodernism is frequently referred to derogatorily, as if it is a kind of bad philosophy. But this accusation is not only vague—it makes an is/ought error: The postmodern theorists were mainly concerned with describing the current condition of the world, not telling people how to act.”</em></p>



<p>These four evangelists of modernism did not agree on everything, of course, but what is important about them collectively is that they all influenced modernist thought by displacing the enduring myths of the old world with modern ideas. The modern world was now one that could no longer depend on the institutions of the past (the Church, the State, the Individual), but one that could be explained in terms of a system (natural selection, the will to power, class struggle, the unconscious). Hence, at the end of the nineteenth century and beginning of the twentieth, artists and writers rejected tradition (as tradition was no longer justified) and embraced Ezra Pound’s modernist adage to “make it new.” As such, artists created impressionistic and surrealistic works, writers used a stream-of-consciousness technique, and composers broke free from standard tonality. But modernism was not just a change in style but a change in theme. As the most devastating conflict in human history up to that point (in part due to advanced military weaponry), World War I left many searching for larger truths but also skeptical about science and notions of progress. So the modernists simultaneously tried to explain the world through grand narratives, but they were also painfully aware of their limitations in doing so. It is in this tension that the key themes of modernism become apparent: a quest for universal truth or morality, a desire for clear-cut identities, a penchant for seriousness and distinctions between “high” and “low” culture, and an uneasy relationship with technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the end of World War II, most modernist movements had either faded away or evolved into different forms. The world had now become global, and the rise of mass media ushered in the age of mass culture. The amalgam of the mass media and the advertising industry dominated the postwar era, leading to a homogenization of culture propagated by what Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer termed the “culture industry.” These Frankfurt School theorists saw a real danger in the collapsing of serious art into marketable and easily digestible entertainment products not because they were elitists (as they are so often maligned), but because the culture industry posed a threat to both intellectual development and revolutionary potential. In other words, the culture industry pumps out cheap forms of entertainment intended to stimulate consumerism and pacify consumers so they will not rise up against the capitalist system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Frankfurt School theorists formed the field of study known as “critical theory,” which figures like Peterson incorrectly conflate with postmodern thought because of its focus on culture and power. But this error demonstrates a lack of understanding about the relationship between modernism and postmodernism. The critical theorists fit squarely into modernist thought: generally speaking, they combined Marxism and Freudianism, and their analyses of modernity are best seen as early <em>criticisms</em> of the postmodern world developing in front of them. Further, their analyses stemmed from a structuralist perspective, in the broadest sense of the term. Structuralism contends that human experience can be analyzed according to its relationship with an overarching structure. This relationship can be materialist (as in Marxism), symbolic or mythological (as in anthropology), linguistic, psychological, and so on. While structuralist approaches can vary, the main takeaway in this context is that they all rest on the notion that one can objectively analyze a coherent system. Postmodernist approaches, however, would break away from this framework and instead question the possibility or limitations of analyzing a system when one resides within it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is at this crossroads where modernism and postmodernism begin to inhabit distinct spheres. But “postmodernism” as an idea would only get more complicated. To properly define it, postmodernism must be divided into three different but related concepts: postmodernism as an aesthetic movement, postmodernism as a linguistic challenge, and postmodernism as a societal analysis and critique.&nbsp; →</p>

be found in <a href="https://github.com/naggie/dotfiles/">my dotfiles</a>.</p><h2 id="initialisation">Initialisation</h2><p>To start, you’ll need to install <code>ykman</code> and <code>gnupg</code> together with the right
interface software; <code>pcscd</code> and <code>scdaemon</code> on Ubuntu.</p><p>In order to use your Yubikey for everything in this article, it has to contain
the only copy of your GPG private keys; GPG must have the public parts and be
configured to use the Yubikey as an OpenPGP smartcard.</p><p>With OpenPGP/gnupg there are many different possible key topologies and crypto
settings. What you want will depend on what you need the configuration for.</p><h3 id="openpgp-setup">OpenPGP setup</h3><p>I recommend you follow this setup process in livecd session in order to
mitigate the risk of the private keys being intercepted by a bad actor before
they are copied to the yubikey.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><p>GnuPG2 classifies keys by their capability; you’ll notice (some of) the
characters <code>[CSEA]</code> alongside listed secret keys with GnuPG2. Whilst
fundamentally the private keys are just a number of bits, GnuPG2 can earmark
each key with one or more capabilities upon generation such that it can only
ever be used for the allocated purpose thereafter. The key capabilities are:
<code>[C]ertificaiton</code>, <code>[S]igning</code>, <code>[E]ncryption</code> and <code>[A]uthentication</code>.</p><p>As I understand, it is simply good cryptographic practice to have
single-purpose keys; you should not, for instance, use the same key to
authenticate as you should to encrypt. The reasoning behind this is presumably
to mitigate some kind of theoretical attack.</p><p>GnuPG2 historically has in interface designed for (unusual) humans, not
machines; until recently it was difficult to script. Since version 2.2, there
is an interface to generate and set up keys in non-interactive mode. As such I
created a script called
<a href="https://github.com/naggie/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/gpg-keygen">gpg-keygen</a>
to generate the following topology for you:</p><ol><li>One master key (<code>CS</code>) (4096 bit RSA)</li><li><code>S</code> subkey (4096 bit RSA)</li><li><code>E</code> subkey (4096 bit RSA)</li><li><code>A</code> subkey (4096 bit RSA)</li></ol><p>To use it, run the script in an empty directory. The master key has a longer
validity and can be used to revoke compromised keys<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> as well as create new,
certified subkeys. Store it encrypted (with all the other generated files) on a
flash drive in a physical safe a with a backup copy in another safe; it’s
sensitive.</p><figure><a href="https://callanbryant.co.uk/blog/how-to-get-the-best-out-of-your-yubikey-with-gpg/gpg-keygen.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/819b906979383fc3c3ee29679423c767842ac7e5/e44de/blog/how-to-get-the-best-out-of-your-yubikey-with-gpg/gpg-keygen.png" width="558" height="485" alt="Output of gpg-keygen"></a><figcaption>Output of gpg-keygen</figcaption></figure><p>The remaining 3 keys are for signing, encryption and authentication
respectively. They are as big as a Yubikey 5 will allow, and are of the RSA
type as the Yubikey 5 does not support eliptic curves.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p><figure><a href="https://callanbryant.co.uk/blog/how-to-get-the-best-out-of-your-yubikey-with-gpg/files-output.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/fae8136c2207c1f960cf69639969c6dbf0091f96/2d9e8/blog/how-to-get-the-best-out-of-your-yubikey-with-gpg/files-output.png" width="345" height="270" alt="Files generated by gpg-keygen"></a><figcaption>Files generated by gpg-keygen</figcaption></figure><p>Next, you’ll need to copy the contents of <code>gnupghome</code> to <code>~/.gnupg</code> – on the
live session. GnuPG2 should then be able to load and use the keys, though
before use the private subkeys need to be moved to the Yubikey.</p><p>Now is a good time to change the default OpenPGP user and admin pin from
<code>123456</code> and <code>123435678</code> respectively. Steps:</p><ol><li>Run <code>gpg2 --card-edit &lt;email&gt;</code></li><li>Enter <code>admin</code></li><li>Enter <code>passwd</code> – change PIN and admin PIN as prompted</li></ol><p>To move the keys, use <code>gpg --edit-key &lt;email&gt;</code> and enter the following
commands:</p><ol><li><code>toggle</code></li><li>For each key (<code>S</code>,<code>E</code>,<code>A</code>) select one by toggling the asterisk one at a
time with the <strong>key</strong> command (1,2,3 respectively)</li><li>When a key is selected, run <code>keytocard</code> to copy the key to the
correct slot on the yuibkey (there are 3, one each for S,E,A)</li><li><code>save</code> then exit. If you don’t save, the private keys will persist
locally which defeats the purpose of using the yubikey.</li></ol><p>The private keys are now on your yubikey, and no longer exist in <code>~/.gnupg</code>.
The next step is to harvest the public parts of the key to initialise your
target machine.</p><p>In order to use your new identity on the target machine, you’ll need to import
the public keys and give the master key “ultimate trust.” This might sound odd,
but this means GPG will implicitly trust any sub-key certified by your master
key so you can use them.</p><p>I prefer a clean-room approach in this case to ensure that not private keys are
copied to the target machine; in addition it makes it clear what steps are
necessary to set up new machines, too. Bear in mind that if you use the
web-of-trust and intend to keep other peoples public keys in GnuPG, you’ll need
to transfer them separately.</p><p>To make GPG trust your master key ultimately, you’ll need to use the
<code>trusted-key</code> setting in <code>~/.gnupg/gpg.conf</code>. On the live session, you’ll
notice a file called <code>gpg-keyid.txt</code> which contains your master key ID<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. You can
append it to your GPG config file with this scriptable example from my
dotfiles,
<a href="https://github.com/naggie/dotfiles/blob/master/user-configuration-naggie.sh#L39">user-configuration-naggie.sh</a>:</p><pre><code>cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt;&gt; ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
trusted-key 9D37503A7DA6F9B6
EOF
</code></pre><p>Of course you should substitute my key ID for yours.</p><p>Next, you’ll need to import the public portions of your newly generated keys.
These can be found in <code>gpg-pubkeys.asc</code> on the live session in ASCII-guarded
format. It was exported by my <code>gpg-keygen</code> script using <code>gpg2 --export --armor &gt; gpg-pubkeys.asc</code>.
The keys can be piped into <code>gpg2 --quiet --import</code> – see
<a href="https://github.com/naggie/dotfiles/blob/master/user-configuration-naggie.sh#L43">https://github.com/naggie/dotfiles/blob/master/user-configuration-naggie.sh#L43</a> for reference.</p><p>Finally, tt’s important to install a <a href="https://github.com/naggie/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.gnupg/gpg.conf">hardened
gpg.conf</a>
to <code>~/.gnupg/gpg.conf</code>. GnuPG2, by default, will use some relatively weak
ciphers presumably for the sake of compatibility.</p><figure><a href="https://callanbryant.co.uk/blog/how-to-get-the-best-out-of-your-yubikey-with-gpg/gpg-list-secret-keys.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/5d406a02f9836d699e9ba5714912a814aca7e445/1dba8/blog/how-to-get-the-best-out-of-your-yubikey-with-gpg/gpg-list-secret-keys.png" width="522" height="316" alt="The resulting key topology loaded into GnuPG2.

passwords into chat or the terminal all the time). <code>ykpersonalise</code> can do
this, but can become locked out as it relies on OTP mode. To disable OTP
mode: <code>ykman mode FIDO+CCID</code>.</p><p>It’s important to enable touch-to-everything; this is a fundamental concept –

certainly the least expensive as U2F devices are prolific. Using the PIV mode
is a good option of you don’t want to mess with GPG.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p><p>In order to use option (1), after setting up GnuPG as per the previous section you’ll have to:</p><ol><li>Export your <code>authentication</code> public key in SSH format. You can do this with
<code>gpg2 --export-ssh-key &lt;email&gt;</code> and copy it to <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> on
your remote machines as normal.</li><li>Configure your environment to use GnuPG2 as an SSH agent (only locally,
overriding system agent)</li></ol><p>To set up GPG as an ssh agent, I recommend use of the following function in
your <code>.bashrc/</code> or <code>.zshrc</code>. It can even be set as a <code>precmd</code> hook to
automatically update the environment – see the section on Tmux below.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>function</span> _update_agents <span>{</span>

recover an hung agent; unfortunately this is necessary to recover from dead
sockets that happen time to time.</p><p>Note that GPG can ingest regular SSH keys into its own store with <code>ssh-add</code> –
assuming you’re running a GPG agent. However, these keys won’t end up on the
Yubikey.</p><h2 id="gpg-agent-forwarding">GPG agent forwarding</h2><p>If you’re developing on a remote machine, you’re probably familiar with
forwarding your SSH agent to allow the use of Git with local SSH credentials.
GPG is capable of a similar mechanism, allowing commits on a remote machine to
be signed using your local Yubikey. GPG uses a unix socket for the agent
connection, and a special restricted “extra”
socket for remote use. The <a href="https://wiki.gnupg.org/AgentForwarding">official
guide</a> suggests 2 methods, depending on
whether your version of OpenSSH supports unix socket forwarding or not. <em>Both
methods are flawed:</em></p><ol><li>The first method (recommended for OpenSSH older than 6.7) suggests using
<code>netcat</code> to forward the unix socket over a TCP socket. This is insecure,
because anyone else on the remote host could connect to the forwarded TCP
port …</li></ol></div></div>

    <p>Font rasterisation is, in the author’s opinion, one of the most
    interesting fields of computer science. If music is the subjective
    application of physics, then font rasterisation is almost
    certainly the subjective application of computer science. The
    purpose of this article is threefold: firstly, to provide an
    introduction into the various methods available to aid in the
    rasterisation process; secondly, to provide a critical analysis of
    these methods against the needs of desktop applications; and
    finally, to relate this analysis to free software.</p>
    <p>Figures, in the form of bitmap images, are used extensively

    <h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
    <p>Before we start exploring the various methods used in font
    rasterisation, it is important to first understand <em>why</em>
    rasterisation is so difficult. Why should rasterisation on a
    computer screen be any more complicated than on a printer? It all
    comes down to resolution. Or, more precisely, the number
    of <em>dots per inch</em> (DPI).</p>
    <p>Printers typically start at around 300 DPI, with 600 DPI not
    being uncommon. This means that for every inch (2.54cm), there are
    potentially 300+ individual dots. Fonts, however, are not measured
    in dots but instead in <em>points</em>: 1/72 of an inch. A direct
    consequence of this is that a specific font at 10pt will have the
    same <em>physical dimensions</em> irrespective of the DPI at which
    it is rasterised.</p>
    <p>Whereas printers have a relatively high DPI, computer screens
    are typically <em>assumed</em> to be at 96 DPI, over three times
    lower. Herein lies the difficulty with on-screen
    rasterisation. This is best illustrated with an example: Figure 1
    shows the letter ‘M’ in 10pt Times New Roman at 600, 300, and 96
    DPI, respectively. Looking at the figure, it is clear that 96 DPI
    is not sufficient to preserve the shape—or letter-form—of the
    glyph.</p>
    <div>
      <p><img width="137" height="55" alt="M at a low DPI" src="https://freddie.witherden.org/pages/font-rasterisation/images/m-various-dpi.png"></p><p>Figure 1: How 10pt Times Roman looks at 600, 300, and 96
      DPI.</p>
    </div>
    <p>This phenomenon can be explained using <em>information
    theory</em>. Since glyphs contain information it is possible to
    view them as a signal comprised of various frequencies. The
    Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem states that in order to
    accurately reproduce a signal, the sampling rate needs to
    be <em>at least twice the maximum frequency of the
    signal</em>. Should the sampling rate be lower than this, then
    distortions—in the form of aliasing—will be introduced. In the
    case of rasterisation, the sampling rate corresponds directly to
    the DPI of the output device.</p>
    <p>An example of aliasing as a consequence of low DPI can be seen
    in Figure 2.</p>
    <div>
      <p><img width="249" height="12" alt="Aliasing at a low DPI" src="https://freddie.witherden.org/pages/font-rasterisation/images/aliasing.png"></p><p>Figure 2: 10pt Times New Roman at 96 DPI. Note how some stems
      are thicker than others, and how certain features are
      under-/over-emphasised.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Since it is clear that 96 DPI is insufficient for accurate
    rasterisation, we are left with two options. The first is to find
    a way of <em>increasing the effective sampling rate</em> of the
    device, while the second is to <em>reduce the frequency of the
    glyphs to allow the use of a lower sampling rate</em>. All of the
    methods presented in this article fall into one of these two
    categories.</p>
    <h2><a name="font-hinting">Font Hinting</a></h2>
    <p>One of the oldest and mostly widely used techniques for
    improving rasterisation quality is font hinting. Also known
    as <em>grid fitting</em>, hinting involves modifying the shape of
    glyphs in order to ensure they line up with the rasterisation
    grid. By distorting the glyph so that it is aligned with the pixel
    grid, the overall frequency is reduced. An example of font hinting
    can be seen in Figure 3.</p>
    <div>
      <p><img width="257" height="26" alt="Un-hinted vs hinted text" src="https://freddie.witherden.org/pages/font-rasterisation/images/hinting.png"></p><p>Figure 3: 10pt Times New Roman at 96 DPI with (bottom) and
      without (top) hinting. Also note the differing widths between
      the hinted and un-hinted text.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The hinted text is much more consistent than its un-hinted
    counterpart. However, this consistency comes at the price of
    accuracy. An unavoidable consequence of warping glyphs to the
    rasterisation grid is that their dimensions change slightly. These
    small differences quickly add up over a line of text resulting in
    a visible difference—such as that seen in Figure 3. The author
    refers to this phenomenon as <em>character drift</em>.</p>
    <p>The degree of hinting required to produce consistent output is
    dependent on the DPI of the output device; low resolution devices
    require more aggressive hinting than high resolution device. One
    of the consequences of aggressive hinting—necessary as it may
    be—is character drift. At resolutions in excess of 300 DPI, it is
    possible to forego font hinting entirely.</p>
    <h3>Implementation details</h3>
    <p>Font hinting is usually achieved through one of two
    approaches. The first of these puts the font designer in control
    of the hinting process. This is the approach taken by the TrueType
    font specification—without a doubt the most widespread font
    format. In the specification, a virtual machine is used to
    instruct the rasteriser on how to go about rendering a
    glyph. This, in theory, gives designers <em>pixel level</em>
    control over how glyphs are rasterised at various
    sizes <cite><a href="#tur01a">Tur01a</a></cite>. The second
    approach is to leave hinting up to the font rasteriser—so
    called <em>auto-hinting</em>. When rendering non-TrueType
    fonts—such as those in Adobe’s Type 1 format, or those that lack
    hinting instructions—this is often the only
    option <cite><a href="#tur01a">Tur01a</a></cite>.</p>
    <p>In order for a meaningful comparison to be made between these
    approaches, it is first necessary to have an understanding of some
    of the other techniques available for improving rasterisation
    quality.</p>
    <h2><a name="anti-aliasing">Anti-aliasing</a></h2>
    <p>So far, we have been assuming that pixels are bi-level, either
    on or off, black or white. However, modern computer screens are
    capable of displaying millions of colours, including shades of
    grey. Font rasterisers are able to take advantage of this by using
    a technique called <em>anti-aliasing</em>. As the name would
    suggest, anti-aliasing is a means of avoiding the unwanted effects
    of aliasing when sampling a high-frequency signal on a
    low-frequency device. This is done by blurring the signal; its
    effect is to reduce its maximal frequency.</p>
    <p>Pixels of anti-aliased text are multi-level. That is, they can
    be black, white, or a shade of grey. The shade of a pixel depends
    on the percentage of the pixel that is <em>masked</em> by the
    glyph. This concept is neatly demonstrated in Figure 4.</p>
    <div>
      <p><img width="92" height="63" alt="Primitive anti-aliasing" src="https://freddie.witherden.org/pages/font-rasterisation/images/g-anti-aliased.png"></p><p>Figure 4: The letter ‘g’ in 10pt Times New Roman at 672 DPI
      (left) and 96 DPI (right). The right glyph has been rendered
      with a (primitive) anti-aliasing algorithm and scaled by a
      factor of 7.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The effect of anti-aliasing on a line of text can be seen in
    Figure 5. Anti-aliasing does a very good job at preserving the
    shapes of glyphs. Moreover, the anti-aliased text does not suffer
    from character drift. However, this accuracy comes at the
    sacrifice of clarity—the anti-aliased text has a much lower
    contrast than its hinted counterpart.</p>
    <div>
      <p><img width="257" height="41" alt="A comparison of anti-aliased
      text" src="https://freddie.witherden.org/pages/font-rasterisation/images/anti-aliasing.png"></p><p>Figure 5: 10pt Times New Roman at 96 DPI; without
      anti-aliasing or hinting (top), with hinting (middle), with
      anti-aliasing (bottom).</p>
    </div>
    <h2><a name="anti-aliasing-with-hinting">Combining Anti-aliasing
    With Hinting</a></h2>
    <p>Both hinting and anti-aliasing improve the legibility of text
    at low resolutions by making it more consistent. Hinting does this
    at the cost of <em>accuracy</em>, while anti-aliasing does it at
    the cost of <em>contrast</em>. At this point, the logical question
    to ask is “can hinting and anti-aliasing be used in conjunction
    with each other?” The answer is yes—with the appropriate finesse,
    it is possible to hint anti-aliased text.</p>
    <p>In principle, hinting anti-aliased text is exactly the same as
    hinting monochromatic text. However, in practice, a different
    implementation is required in order to produce high-quality
    output <cite><a href="#tur01b">Tur01b</a></cite>. The practicality
    of this depends on the hinting approach taken; it is significantly
    easier when the hinting is performed by the font rasteriser
    instead of a virtual machine. Indeed, naïvely combining TrueType
    hinting with anti-aliasing can often result in a <em>reduction in
    overall consistency</em>! This is most readily observed when
    rendering sans-serif fonts, as can be seen in Figure 6.</p>
    <div>
      <p><img width="263" height="43" alt="Hinting and anti-aliasing
      combined" src="https://freddie.witherden.org/pages/font-rasterisation/images/bytecode-hinting-with-anti-aliasing.png"></p><p>Figure 6: 10pt Arial at 96 DPI; with TrueType hinting (top),
      with anti-aliasing (middle), with TrueType hinting and
      anti-aliasing (bottom).</p>
    </div>
    <p>While the output is legible, it lacks consistency—some
    characters, such as ‘w’ and ‘s’, are anti-aliased, while others,
    such as ‘l’, are not. This causes some characters to appear to be
    heavier than others. These heavier characters are often referred
    to as being <em>dirty</em>. The undesirable characteristics
    apparent in Figure 6 arise because the anti-aliased text is being
    hinted <em>as if it were regular monochromatic text</em>. (Which,
    incidentally, is why the application of anti-aliasing has no
    effect on the overall character drift.) But as was established in
    the previous section, anti-aliased text has a <em>lower
    frequency</em> than monochromatic text. The solution, therefore,
    is to use less aggressive hinting. This is quite difficult to
    accomplish when using TrueType hinting, as the virtual machine
    does not …</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><h2>About GitOps and Terraform in general</h2><p><strong>GitOps</strong> describes the idea that every change to your infrastructure should start with a change in a Git repository. The Git repository is your one source of truth. By doing this, your team and you can jointly propose, agree on and make changes following the same popular pull-request based workflow that has proven invaluable for software development.</p><p>This of course requires, that your infrastructure configuration is described in a format that can be stored in Git and that changes can be automated.</p><p><strong>Terraform</strong> is the leading infrastructure as code solution. Using a declarative domain specific language (HCL) you can define your infrastructure as code. If any change to that infrastructure is needed, Terraform can plan the steps required to change the infrastructure from its current state to the new desired state based on the changes to the code in the repository. And with its remote state support, Terraform is able to do this in an automated way and prevent simultaneous changes from causing issues.</p><p>In theory, this means <strong>GitOps with Terraform</strong> should be straight forward. Simply set up a trigger to run Terraform commands from a CI/CD pipeline every time a change is made to the Git repository. But what seems simple in theory, often turns out to be slightly more complex in the real world.</p><h3>GitOps automation pitfalls</h3><p>There are three pitfalls to avoid to be able to trust your GitOps workflow with triggering automation that makes changes to your mission critical infrastructure.</p><ol><li>Ensure changes are reviewed and tested before they are applied to critical environments.</li><li>Prevent configuration drift between environments from rendering that security ineffective.</li><li>Integrate the GitOps workflow and the automation with the correct triggers and steps.</li></ol><h2>How the Kubestack framework can help</h2><p>What does framework mean in this context? Think of it as Kubestack is to GitOps infrastructure automation, what Spring Boot is to cloud native Java applications.</p><p>The Kubestack framework is designed to help platform teams hit the ground running and avoid common pitfalls the same way an application team benefits from starting with a framework like Spring Boot.</p><p>Application frameworks help with common application requirements, Kubestack helps with common GitOps infrastructure automation requirements.</p><p>So when web application frameworks for example help with request routing or user authentication, Kubestack is a framework that helps with GitOps infrastructure automation. As such it provides reusable Terraform modules for the clusters and surrounding infrastructure and <a href="https://www.kubestack.com/catalog">Kustomize bases for cluster services</a> required before application workloads can be deployed.</p><h3>Everything to get started</h3><p><strong>By starting with the Kubestack framework, platform teams don't just get reusable components. They get a proven, integrated implementation that avoids these common pitfalls.</strong></p><p>Kubestack uses two infrastructure environments called ops-environment and the apps-environment. The purpose of the ops-environment is to validate changes, before they are promoted to the critical apps-environment. Both environments are configured using <a href="https://www.kubestack.com/framework/documentation/inheritance-model">inheritance to avoid configuration drift</a>, which would risk rendering the validation ineffective. The environments and inheritance model fully integrates both infrastructure configuration and Kubernetes cluster services.</p><p>Kubestack's <a href="https://www.kubestack.com/framework/documentation/gitops-process">GitOps workflow</a> is designed to provide reliable automation for teams to jointly maintain clusters and services. It allows teams to:</p><ol><li>Peer review planned infrastructure changes,</li><li>and validate these changes against the ops-environment</li><li>before they are promoted to the critical apps-environment.</li></ol><h3>Designed to be extendable</h3><p>Kubestack is built using Terraform modules and providers. This means Kubestack fully integrates with the entire Terraform ecosystem. Teams have the ability to build upon the framework, extend their infrastructure to meet their specific requirements and integrate it into the wider organization's architecture.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

    <p>It is the fifth time that I try to reboot this exact blog, and no doubt this is the most successful attempt, I have consecutive 12 posts written, including this one. But all previous attempts failed, only 3 articles in 7 years, and years ago I have even shut down this blog for a long period. I can’t recall what makes me this decision of closing blog, maybe most posts are programming related and become obsolete because technology evolves fast.</p>

<p>However, I decided to reboot my blog and written <a href="https://vec.io/posts/those-lost-years">an article to summarize past years</a>. That time I also removed the Google Analytics tracking code because I was never that naive boy who would trust a monopoly any more. The analytics from cloudflare still make me shocked that my old blog have about 200 unique daily visitors, and dramatically increased to about 1,000 this time when I started writing every day. And my visitors are also very diverse in countries.</p>

<p><img src="https://vec.io/images/2020/06/27/blog-visitors.png" alt="blog visitors"></p>

<p><img src="https://vec.io/images/2020/06/27/blog-countries.png" alt="blog countries"></p>

<p>But that’s almost the only article for that reboot, I ask myself what prevented me from writing in those previous reboots,  were there any obstacles? I don’t think so. What differed this time from previous ones? I can come up with nothing, because this time I even begin with a similar post <em>“<a href="https://vec.io/posts/hello-world-again">Hello World Again</a>“</em>.</p>

<p>Maybe decisions will only work if you make them many times, make the same decision again and again, until you can finally put your efforts in. I always decide to write because I believe writing is a skill, and a skill would be improved a lot if practiced enough times. Programming is the first skill that I’m confident I’m in some top levels, which I don’t think come as a gift, it’s after hundreds of thousands of lines of code.</p>

<p>After writing 12 posts continuously every day, I have felt much easier to organize ideas and publish it faster. Another improvement is that I’m capable of expressing opinions instead of plain technology tutorials only.</p>

<p>For years now I have been fascinated by prediction markets. The source of excitement is the idea is that you can use financial markets to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference">inference</a> — just like machine learning.</p>
<p>A famous example of such prediction markets are the orange futures. The orange futures market is one that allows entities
to buy oranges in advance.
How it works, is that one can pay $1,000 to receive 1,000 oranges that will be delivered next year.
An interesting side effect of this orange futures market is how it <a href="https://selectabstracts.wordpress.com/2011/11/16/can-orange-juice-help-forecast-the-weather/">accurately predicts temperatures in certain locations</a> more specifically, the temperature of the locations where the oranges are from.</p>
<p>But how is information on temperature reflected in the market meant for selling oranges? Well, what actually happens, is that the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/orange-juice-futures-soar-as-weather-turns-cold-1416604154">orange futures prices rise towards cold weather</a> and drop towards warm weather.</p>
<p>This phenomenon can be easily explained by the fact that cold weather reduces orange yields thus causing prices to rise (reasoning from the perspective of supply &amp; demand).
This explanation however doesn’t account for the fact that the market prices start reacting to temperature changes
<em>before</em> they occur. It is as if the market knew what the temperature would be <em>in the future</em>. Hence the name prediction markets.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-to-buy-information-from-the-future">How to buy information from the future</h2>
<p>In the example above, predicting temperatures was just a side effect of the orange futures market.<br>
But how do we design a market to predict an explicit event? For example, say you want to know if it will
rain tomorrow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Declare an event that will reveal this information  —  Say you want a market that can predict the weather.
For the rain example we can declare the event “It will rain tomorrow”.</li>
<li>Step 2: Define events outcome  —  Formalize the outcomes of the event. The event “It will rain tomorrow” has two out comes <em>Yes</em> and <em>No</em>.</li>
<li>Step 3: Sell betting tickets  —  Sell tickets for the event outcomes “It will rain tomorrow”. Buyers of the tickets have two options
<em>Yes</em> tickets and <em>No</em> tickets at equal prices. Buyers are allowed to trade tickets with each other.
<ul>
<li>If it <em>does rain tomorrow</em>, those with <strong>Yes</strong> tickets receive money 2 times the price of the tickets &amp; those with <strong>No</strong>
get nothing.</li>
<li>If it <em>does not rain</em>, those with <strong>Yes</strong> tickets get nothing &amp; those with <strong>No</strong> tickets get money 2 times the price
of the ticket.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Loosely following assumptions made by prediction market theory, the true information on the event outcome for “It will rain tomorrow” will be
reflected reflected in the prices at which buyers are trading the tickets. <em>The ticket with the highest price is the event outcome that is most likely to occur</em>. If <strong>Yes</strong> tickets are selling for <em>$2</em> &amp; <strong>No</strong> tickets are selling for <em>$1</em>. Then we would assume that it will probably rain tomorrow.</p>
<h2 id="the-assumptions-of-prediction-markets">The assumptions of prediction markets</h2>
<p>Prediction markets operate upon 3 main assumptions. The first assumption is that markets are made up exclusively of 3 types agents.
A classification of these agents is as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The pure gambler</strong>, this one doesn’t have the necessary meteorological information. He/She is simply betting at random.</li>
<li><strong>The accurate information trader</strong>, these traders have information they think points to the fact that it will rain &amp; they are right.</li>
<li><strong>Inaccurate information traders</strong>, have information they think points to the fact that it will rain. <em>But</em> they are wrong.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second assumption, is that <strong>The Information is predictable</strong>, this means that amongst all the market participants, at least agent is an <strong>Accurate information trader</strong>.</p>
<p>The last assumption is that people in these market agents will perform a <strong>Rational participation</strong>. Rational participation means that, speculators will always prefer to place bets on event outcomes which they think they will make money &amp; they will decline from participating in bets where they think they will lose money. For instance, a rational person should not be a pure gambler because they have higher chances of making money by betting on information they know at least something about.</p>
<p>The accurate information trader on the other hand will flourish in this market as they will always have the edge in the market &amp; thus make money off clueless gamblers &amp; people signaling wrong information. Meanwhile, agents that always bet on wrong information will go bust or switch to markets where they do better. This is what makes prediction makers so resistant to market manipulation, <em>it’s a system where agents signaling wrong information actively subsidizes people signaling correct information.</em></p>
<p>In theory, markets that repeat themselves should improve with every iteration (since most agents that signal wrong information are bust).
Provided all agents have access to finite amounts of money.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-break-a-prediction-market">How to break a prediction market</h2>
<p>Prediction markets may be highly resistant to manipulation, but that does not mean they cannot break.
For a market to continue doing correct inference (accurate predictions), the sum of money held by the<br>
class of <strong>Accurate Information traders</strong> should always be greater than the sum of money collectively owned by the rest of the agents.
This is because all agents have finite amounts of money. And it will not be possible to offset noise incorporated into the market by
agents with bad information.
This may however improve in subsequent iterations of the market (agents signaling wrong information go bust) thus giving prediction markets a self healing like property.</p>
<p>It is often mentioned that prediction markets are based on “The wisdom of the crowds” &amp; that creates a false analogy where people this it works for the same reason democracy does, but they are actually based on the wisdom of the rationals, <em>a system where people don’t talk about what they don’t know</em>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="inner_content-74-2180"><section id="section-2-306"><div><div id="inner_content-3-306">
<p>[In less than 30 days my wife and I are packing up our few belongings and driving up into Colorado, Utah, and/or Montana. We haven’t decided where yet, but we’re going to be renting somewhere, exploring places to live longer-term. Below is my vague dream vision motivating this migration adventure. If you’re interested in these ideas and want to chat via email or you live in these areas and want to have a drink, <a href="https://theotherlifenow.com/contact/">you should message me</a>.]</p>



<p>This pandemic lockdown is making me think extra hard about where, with whom, and how I want to live.</p>



<p>I suspect I’m not the only one.</p>



<p>It just so happens that, when the lockdown struck, I was (and still am) living with my wife and two friends in a spacious home that my friends own in New Mexico. I suspect that the discomfort and inconvenience we are experiencing is drastically less than average, because we're locked up with other smart and interesting people.</p>



<p>It also just so happens that, a year ago, I <a href="https://theotherlifenow.com/tag/jumping-ship/">jumped ship</a> from a traditional career in a brick-and-mortar institution for an unorthodox career based on the internet. This is the other reason why the pandemic lockdown has been relatively pleasant and productive for me.</p>



<p>My wife and I find ourselves thinking more creatively than ever about how, exactly, we’ll choose to settle down. I’m 33, my wife is 29. We don’t have kids yet but we really want to have one soon. In my post-academic transition, we’re still a bit below median income for a married couple, but growth looks good and now my upside is unlimited so I’m pretty confident.</p>



<p>The inaccessibility of traditional home ownership for many Millennials is another factor that will intersect with the pandemic-induced appetite for lifestyle innovation.</p>



<p>There are many ways you could imagine young adults architecting arrangements far superior to their status quo. Personally, just to get the discussion going, I suspect the ideal collective unit will be both <em>federated</em> (autonomous units with a council) and <em>digital:</em> </p>



<ul><li>Money comes primarily from high-leverage internet work</li><li>Internal governance processes automated to the max, minimizing politics</li></ul>



<p>I think the ideal would be a very large property (~50 acres) somewhere cheap but beautiful (Appalachia? Montana?), with multiple independent households in a federal governance structure. Communal houses are just not attractive to most intelligent and high-functioning people. People just like privacy, and control. Also communal houses are not robust because one bad apple can rapidly ruin the whole bunch. My “federated town” model gives every family complete autonomy and privacy, except for whatever mutual obligations are decided. But multiple properties, like in the traditional suburb, provide only the weakest incentives for communal investment. When every household owns an equity stake in one property, you lock in the real forces of real community (if the ship goes down, everyone goes down).</p>



<p>Let’s run the numbers on a hypothetical scenario. As I wrote about previously, there was recently up for sale <a href="https://theotherlifenow.com/on-reality-patchwork-and-neo-feudal-techno-communism/">a whole town in the state of Georgia.</a> It cost $1.7 million.</p>



<p>First, have a look at this video of what comes with our purchase of Tombsboro. Keep in mind this is only an example we’re using to fix ideas; there are actually many abandoned towns all over the USA, so exact location could be negotiated. But seriously, how cool is this?</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Toomsboro Promotional Video" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L7JYCo6ZeR4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In that video, I tallied <em>at least</em> 15 buildings suitable for stand-alone, private, family homes. And that’s being very conservative, because I’m not even counting the hotel and bank and such! Let’s be even more conservative for maximum planning realism and assume we could only have 10 families living here.</p>



<p>If we obtained a 30-year mortgage at a 3% interest rate, we could expect monthly payments of about $7,167. And assuming a 20% down payment we would need $340k up front. An abandoned ghost town might need a little work, but I’m assuming the initial group would be intrepid with modest needs and we could do it fixer-upper style after we move in and over time. So let’s just increase that figure by a completely made-up amount and say we’d need $500k up front to buy a ghost town and make it livable enough for 10 not-insane adults to tolerate it. Then we’d need to pay $7,167 every month, starting immediately.</p>



<p>First, let’s solve the down payment. Either the initial group is moderately wealthy people (~10 households each of which have $50k lying around), or a few are quite wealthy (~4 people each have about $125k lying around), or everyone is like me or poorer (I have about $20k liquid) and the rest we make up with private investment from the few kind and visionary readers of my blog who occasionally tell me they want to invest (I usually just say no thanks because I don’t really need or want capital, but after you receive a few of these offers you start to think about what you could do with it). 10 families each with $20k to invest would require an additional $300k to set-up shop in our ghost town. I’m not sure but my gut feeling is that if I found 10 responsible households that were seriously ready to roll, I could scrape together $300k investment from my personal networks on the internet. If only because it’s crazy enough that it would get a ton of buzz, which would bring a lot of people out of the woodwork.</p>



<p>Next, how are we going to pay $7,167/month and have enough to regularly improve and maintain the town? It’s easy to think of many plausible schemes that could work at some point (e.g. rent rooms in the hotel) but honestly I’d rather not count on anything at all speculative.</p>



<p>The easiest and most fail-proof way to solve this problem is to have 10 households that already have a good, stable income through remote work.</p>



<p>This is another reason why the pandemic is a game changer. The number of people who meet this requirement just increased to… everybody. And even if you think post-pandemic workplace norms revert 90% back to pre-pandemic norms (unlikely in my view), that’s still thousands of new people who could potentially do what I’m envisioning. Think about how many smart and productive, married Millenial couples there must be, wanting to have their first baby but postponing because their professional work requires them to live somewhere too expensive and too atomized to build a family. The employers of these couples formerly believed that face-to-face interaction was necessary; they are now learning it is not, and remote workers are cheaper. Thus, when the pandemic is over there will be at least a few thousand Millenial married couples who have both the resources and the newfound freedom to build the community of their dreams. I only need to find 9 of them!</p>



<p>$7,167/month split among 10 households is only $716 a month! Obviously you’d have to add for interest paid to investors, add for developing the properties, add for taxes and a bunch of other things. But as a starting figure, that aint’ bad!</p>



<p>No point getting more specific since these are extremely rough estimates. But remember, I handicapped the estimates very conservatively. You could fit way more people in a whole town; find a cheaper town; luck out with a donor instead of an investor—many ways this could turn out easier and better than I estimate here. As a back-of-the-napkin exercise, it’s enough to convince me something like this is very possible.</p>



<p>The real bottleneck is not financial, I suspect. It’s psychological and sociological. Are there 10 smart, capable, married couples who are weird enough to try something like this? Historically, no. But historically we’ve never been constrained to our neighborhood for weeks on end… And historically 30-year-olds already own homes and have babies. So maybe now is when the truly smart and truly capable Millennials realize their holistic life prospects look much better as desperados...</p>



<p>Personally, if there was a viable opportunity to settle down into a weird and novel lifestyle arrangement that might be risky in some regards but highly anti-fragile to catastrophic threats, my wife and I are probably more favorably disposed than we’ve ever been. By “viable opportunity” I just mean actual, capable people who seem cool, in my inbox, seriously interested in figuring out something like this.</p>



<p>By the way I’m not saying I would never do this with single people, and no disrespect to single people. It’s just that I’m married so it would make the most sense for everyone else to be married.</p>



<p>I’m guessing we’re not the only ones who think about this kind of stuff. A few other data points here… <a href="https://indiethinkers.org/">IndieThinkers.org</a> now has a notable contingent of people interested in, or already working on, unorthodox lifestyle designs. I’ve also been contacted by at least three people in the past few months who expressed — unsolicited — a desire to invest financially in some kind of collective project related in some way to lifestyle design. A recent edition of my <a href="https://theotherlifenow.com/newsletter/">Signs of Life</a> newsletter was entitled, “<a href="https://ckarchive.com/b/d0ueh0h80qd0">If I bought 8 studio apartments, would you visit?</a>” I got a few replies saying yes… Also, the success of Based Mansion seems to <a href="https://theotherlifenow.com/review-of-based-mansion/">further validate</a> the hypothesis of high interest in — and the financial viability of — seemingly weird IRL arrangements.</p>



<p>I know that there’s always been widespread romantic interest in such things; my argument is only that the pandemic may, at the margin, kick some people from the romantic-dreamer category into the fuck-it-let’s-go category.</p>



<p>If anything in this post resonates with you, <a href="https://theotherlifenow.com/contact/">you should at least say hi</a>. My wife and I are just crazy enough to really consider something like this…</p>

New research from scientists at the University of California, Davis suggests that traffic-related air pollution also significantly alters brain growth and development.</p><p>Previous research links air pollution to neurodevelopmental disorders <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.studyfinds.org/air-pollution-may-increase-autism-risk-78-percent-children/" target="_blank">such as autism</a>. Yet few studies examine precisely how air pollution affects brain development, and how these changes may lead to abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p><h2>Rat model reveals red flags</h2><p>To determine how traffic-related air pollution impacts brain development, UC Davis researchers set up a rat housing facility next to a <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.studyfinds.org/daily-exposure-traffic-noise-increase-obesity-risk/" target="_blank">busy traffic</a> tunnel in Northern California. They then exposed one group of rat pups to polluted air from the tunnel, and another group of rat pups to filtered air that was free of pollutants.</p><p>“This approach was a creative way to get at the question of what impacts air pollution has on the brain in the absence of confounding factors such as socioeconomic influences, diet, etc.,” lead researcher Pamela Lein explains in a <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/air-quality-impacts-early-brain-development" target="_blank">media release</a>. “It’s important to know if living close to these roadways poses a significant risk to the developing human brain.”</p><p>After exposing the rat pups to either polluted or filtered air, the researchers compared the brains from each group. They found that rat pups exposed to <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.studyfinds.org/pollution-rush-hour-traffic/" target="_blank">traffic-related air pollution</a> had abnormal brain growth and increased neuroinflammation. In particular, they point to abnormal cell growth in a region of the brain known as the hippocampus, which plays a critical role in learning and memory.</p><h2>Air pollution and abnormal brain development</h2><p>These findings are notable for several reasons. First, the majority of previous air pollution studies have looked at the effects of concentrated air pollution <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.studyfinds.org/office-hazards-inhaling-printer-toner-may-cause-genetic-metabolic-changes/" target="_blank">particles</a> or diesel exhaust. Both of these are components of air pollution, but do not mimic the complexity of real-world air pollution exposures. By collecting air from a highly trafficked tunnel, the UC Davis researchers created a realistic air pollution exposure scenario.</p><p>Second, the researchers found abnormal brain development when air pollution levels were within current regulatory limits. This finding suggests that low levels of air pollution have the potential to negatively impact brain development.</p><p>“What we witnessed are subtle changes,” first author Kelley Patten explains. “But we are seeing these effects using air pollution exposures that fall within regulatory limits. With the backdrop of other environmental and genetic risk factors in humans, this may have a more pronounced effect. This exposure also contains very fine particulate matter that isn’t currently regulated.”</p><p>In the future, the researchers hope to determine which components of <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/air-pollution" target="_blank">air pollution</a> are responsible for the neurodevelopmental effects they observed.</p><p>“We have managed to build a unique and talented team and taken advantage of our built environment to bring us closer than we’ve been before to achieving these objectives,” says co-author Keith Bein. “Increasingly, these types of efforts are required to continue advancing the field, thereby informing policymakers and stakeholders about how best to protect human health.”</p><p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-020-0845-3" target="_blank">study</a> is published in <i>Translational Psychiatry.</i></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/StudyFindsorg/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Like studies?

Under the Rain-Making Control Act (1967) you are advised that it is an offence to <a href="http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/LTObject_Store/ltobjst8.nsf/DDE300B846EED9C7CA257616000A3571/9D788B5BB4776F24CA257C3100008D44/$FILE/67-7637aa016%20authorised.pdf" target="_top" rel="noopener"><u>"carry out unauthorised rain-making operations"</u></a>. </p><p id="viewer-5hc95">Getting a measure of how many laws there are in Australia is not easy, but one practitioner's resource <a href="https://legal.thomsonreuters.com.au/products/the-laws-of-australia/" target="_top" rel="noopener"><em><u>The Laws of Australia</u></em></a> proudly lists over 40,000 legal propositions across 320 specific topics and 36 broad topic areas. Despite the legal maxim that ignorance of the law is no excuse, it is clear that it is impossible for even an interested reader to have a full and complete knowledge of the law - let alone a disinterested reader. </p><p id="viewer-eodrf">In the Design of Everyday Things, Donald Norman describes two crucial principles for a useful object: <em>Discoverability</em> and <em>Understanding</em>. It should be easy to learn how an object works, and clear to see how to use it. For the vast majority of laws, this is not the case: a typical Act may run for many hundreds of pages, define case-specific jargon, refer to rules set out in external pieces of legislation, involve ambiguities, internal inconsistencies, or simply poor writing (the 528 page <a href="https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/act-2001-071" target="_top" rel="noopener"><u>Duties Act in Queensland</u></a> is a prime example).</p><p id="viewer-8n06i">In part, this is nature of the beast: the administrative structure for a law to be changed is a complicated and multi-staged affair, involving a parliament which will not seek to amend a law unless it serves for political capital. Repairing cracks in the sidewalk is necessary, but it's nothing you want to turn into a press statement. As a result law is updated only sporadically, and often in response to the most vocal and focal failures rather than being optimised. </p><p id="viewer-ekgl9">There are moves to improve this process. One of the more interesting is being led by the CSIRO <a href="https://data61.csiro.au/en/Our-Research/Our-Work/Future-Cities/Optimising-service-delivery/RaaP" target="_top" rel="noopener"><em><u>Regulation as a Platform</u></em></a><em> </em>project which recommends converting regulatory rules into machine readable logic which can be quickly checked for internal consistency, and clearer ways this may communicated to the public or automated for simple administrative tasks. Advances in natural language processing may additionally aid in users being able to ask for clarification for a legal rule, and receive general advice from a machine.</p><p id="viewer-ci8o1">The idea <a href="https://theconversation.com/csiro-wants-our-laws-turned-into-computer-code-heres-why-thats-a-bad-idea-130131" target="_top" rel="noopener"><u>has received pushback</u></a> due to concern that an algorithmic approach to law removes the human element and the role of discretion. Moreover the stink of Robodebt scandal makes some leery of outsourcing application of the law too far to machines. However the idea has some merit - not only in terms of directly using new tools for searching or interpreting the law; but also conceptually, using programming concepts to better understand how law may be better designed to run efficiently and user-friendly. </p><p id="viewer-dlmsk">In many ways a law is a program which runs on society rather than on circuits: wet, squishy humanware rather than hardware. It involves a system of logic and operation. Functions which are defined and acted upon in a systematic order, with constraints provided which restrict the operation of a system. The analogy is particularly clear for administrative law applied by rote. However, it also applies for laws which require the application of discretion or decision-making (the decision maker is simply a sub-operation requiring a person). </p><p id="viewer-6vdkf">In code, there is the concept of algorithmic efficiency - how resources (time and storage) vary with the size of an operation. This is measured by reference to the cost of a base operation (e.g. adding up two numbers, or plucking out an item from a list). The common measure is the worst case running time: a constant operation <em>O(1)</em> runs the same time no matter the size of the input; a linear operation <em>O(N) </em>runs as the sum of the base operations; and polynomial operations [e.g. <em>O(N^2)</em>],<em> </em>and exponential operations [e.g. <em>O(2^N)</em>] run increasingly less efficiently with the size of the input. Designing an efficient algorithm is understandably a goal for a good program that will run fast and easily with little overhead. </p><p id="viewer-dshb6">In principle the idea of algorithmic complexity also applies to law. Here we have additional forms of resources: costs of implementation (the cost of administrative public servants), costs of interpretation (the cost of understanding the law, e.g. employing external legal advice, reading legislation, or checking informal explainers), and costs in terms of error correction (the judicial system, including the many barriers to entry). While less tangible, these are similar to those borne by computers in algorithmic complexity: they represent the cost of resources required to run a particular process, which may be comprised of many smaller processes or required actions. </p><p id="viewer-4kiqo">As a result programming principles can be applied to make law more efficient and user-friendly. The aim is to minimise the total costs of operation while sufficiently achieving the desired legal aim. Looking at the regular individual operations involved in a procedure, including complex, expensive, or repeated operations, is the first step in improving the efficiency of a law. Beyond thinking about law in terms of algorithmic complexity, there are a number of core programming techniques that lend themselves to direct analogies in legal design. Many of the rules outlined in The Pragmatic Programmer (outline <a href="http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/inst/ag-se/teaching/K-CCD-2014/Pragmatic-Programmer-summary.pdf" target="_top" rel="noopener"><u>here</u></a>) are directly applicable - particularly ideas around orthogonality (reducing cross-dependencies), maintaining single unambiguous definitions, and building in exception handling are all good concepts. </p><p id="viewer-1pb16">It's no coincidence that the authors of The Pragmatic Programmer turned to legal analogies when outlining concepts for programmers. As is often the case when two fields share conceptual links learnings from the two domains can flow in both directions, and legal professionals and policy designers would be advised to learn and take from design techniques in computer science where they can. </p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article id="body"><h2>👁👄👁</h2><h2>WHAT IT REALLY IS</h2><p>JUNE 26TH, 2020</p><p>You’re probably wondering what this is. Well, it started off as just what it is.</p><p>A group of us changed our Twitter names to include <span>👁👄👁"</span> because we thought it was a funny trend from TikTok. People started noticing the change on their timelines, noting the creepiness of the emojis in particular. For a brief period of time, everyone who added the emojis to their name was added to a giant Twitter group conversation. From there, things unfolded.</p><p>What started out as a meme in our small group chat grew bigger than we ever imagined. So we thought about how to make use of the hype cycle we’d stumbled upon. But honestly, we didn’t have to think too hard: in this moment, there’s pretty much no greater issue to amplify than the systemic racism and anti-Blackness much of the world is only beginning to wake up to. We’re excited that we could use our newfound platform to drive action towards a few causes that are doing important work towards racial justice: <a href="https://thelovelandfoundation.org/loveland-therapy-fund/">Loveland Foundation Therapy Fund</a>,<a href="https://www.theokraproject.com/">The Okra Project</a>,<a href="https://www.innocenceproject.org/">The Innocence Project</a>, and others.</p><p>We’ve done pretty well for a non-existent product. <span>👁👄👁.fm</span> was the top product of the day on Product Hunt (Theranos who?). The website accumulated 20,000 email signups and thousands of tweets sharing the link. We were covered in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/face-emoji-twitter-it-is-what-it-is-promo-a9587351.html">The Independent</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paularmstrongtech/2020/06/26/what-is--oh-it-is-what-it-is/amp/?__twitter_impression=true">Forbes</a>. We got shoutouts from <a href="https://constine.substack.com/p/what-does-mean-well">Josh Constine</a> and <a href="https://wfh.substack.com/p/the-6-builders-who-will-thrive-in">Brianne Kimmel</a>. Some folks on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/hg26ip/whats_the_deal_with_this_it_is_what_it_is_app/">Reddit</a> puzzled over who we were. <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1276585276626726913?s=20">Andrew Chen</a> of Andreessen Horowitz, <a href="https://twitter.com/shannonpurser/status/1276631647157235712">Shannon Purser</a> of Stranger Things, and <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1276418907968925696">Elon Musk</a> may have subtweeted us? The <a href="https://twitter.com/itiseyemoutheye">@itiseyemoutheye</a> Twitter and accounts of our teammates were inundated with invite requests. Most importantly, we raised over $65,000 in donations from people who signed up for our email list. Two anonymous donors have agreed to match the first $60,000 and $75,000, bringing the total to $200,000. We would love to work with anyone else who wants to match. Please DM us! </p>In a strange way, this sort of became an anti-statement against what we’d all seen on tech Twitter. We’re a <a href="https://xn--mp8hai.fm/demographics.png">diverse</a>, ragtag group of young technologists tired of the status quo tech industry, and thought that we could make the industry think a bit more about its actions. Despite calls-to-action like that “<a href="https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/">It’s Time to Build</a>” essay we’ve all read, most of the industry (from product teams to VC) still stays obsessed with exclusive social apps that regularly ignore — or even silence — real needs faced by marginalized people all over the world, and exclude these folks from the building process. As an industry, we need to do better.<p>We sincerely thank you for spreading the word and donating to these important causes. In conclusion, it is what it is: a meme that leveraged the relentless hype of exclusive apps and redirected it towards a critical social need. Thank you, and remember that unlike <span>👁👄👁</span>, #BlackLivesMatter and other social movements aren't trends or hype cycles. Let’s keep giving back as best as we can.</p><p>Signed,</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/itiseyemoutheye/following">The 👁👄👁 Team</a></p><p><a href="https://shop.itiswhatitis.fm/">We do have merch though.</a><br>All proceeds are donated to organizations that support Black lives.</p></article></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="783e">Railway time was the first joint element that united India. Madras/Chennai was the first place to transmit time to entire India.</h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://interestinghistoryforall.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/413ad-0wpivc8ss5r3ztwoj.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Indian Railway.Source-Financial express</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I’m always fascinated by the way my dad conveyed time. He prefers the 24 hours format. Many of his friends use the same, but in other walks of life in India, people stick to the 12hr time format. My dad worked in Indian railways, and in many parts of India, a 24 hours format came to be known as Railway Time. How did it the 24-hour format got the name railway time, and who gave India time? Let’s ponder on that question.</p>



<h2 id="c26f">Asia’s first-time zone:</h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://interestinghistoryforall.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/2fd24-0gbrmluypyr0km7jb.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Madras Observatory.Source-Wikipedia</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The need to have a standard time zone was the need due to Industrialisation. Prominent Astronomers across the world gathered in the USA for the World Meridian conference to conclude the center of the earth for timezone definition in 1884. The astronomers agreed that Greenwich, where British astronomical society is located will be the centerline for the time zone. Countries will calculate their time based on Greenwich meridian.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://interestinghistoryforall.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/e08af-0h_a52u42pru5n1cy.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>John Goldingham working. Source-Wikipedia</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>British India set up a survey office in Nungambakkam, Madras to gather data on the landscape around Madras(Modern day Chennai). John Goldingham was the first Astronomer to land in Chennai and set up the first metrological station in Asia in Madras in 1742. He mapped the stars to set Madras at 80° 17’21 “E. He predicted India is 51/2 hours ahead of GMT. The time zone was fixed as Madras’s time probably the first Asian official timezone. His successor Thomas Glanville Taylor mapped 11,000 stars and published “Madras Catalog.”</p>



<p>As Industrialization gripped India, it was the need of the hour to keep uptime. Indian railways started to connect the nook and corner of India. Indian railways had three time zones, namely Bombay/Mumbai time zone, Calcutta/Kolkatta time zone, and Madras/Chennai time zone. After a few years, Madras’s time was adopted as Indian railways official time as Madras observatory had a telegraph office that can synchronize time across India. Also, Madras’s time was the closest to GMT. The Madras Merdian is marked by a granite pillar that stands to this day in the spot. The small telegraph office in Madras controlled the time of entire India until independence.</p>



<h2 id="b907">Railway time:</h2>



<p>Indian railways weaved across Indian culture and were part and parcel of everyday activity for millions of Indians. When Indian railways adopted standard time, it took the time with it throughout India. Divided by 567 princely states which even the British can’t penetrate, Indian railways brought them together at the same time. Most railway employees like my dad speak in 24 hours format as they are used to it. Madras’s time was the official time of India until independence.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>These are some of the common myths about Patents and Trademarks in startups.</p><h3 id="i-have-a-startup-idea-i-need-to-protect-it-with-a-patent">I have a startup idea, I need to protect it with a patent</h3><p>It’s natural to feel defensive about our <a href="https://hitstartup.com/startup-ideas-vs-problems/" target="_blank">startup idea</a>, but patents are for invention/innovation and not for a startup idea; even if we get nightmares about <a href="https://hitstartup.com/faang-will-steal-my-idea/" target="_blank">FAANG stealing our startup idea</a>.</p><h3 id="i-have-an-innovative-app-idea-i-need-to-protect-it-with-a-patent">I have an innovative app idea, I need to protect it with a patent</h3><p>Most countries don’t allow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200213051434/https://www.wipo.int/sme/en/documents/software_patents_fulltext.html" target="_blank">patent for a software</a>. Economic theories, methods of doing business, mathematical methods or computer programs&nbsp;as such&nbsp;are not patentable inventions in several countries.</p><h3 id="my-patent-attorney-said-they-are-patentable">My patent attorney said they are patentable</h3><p>Did you read all the clauses in the agreement you signed with your patent attorney? The decision to award a patent to an invention/innovation lies solely with the patent examiner of the country. By the time a patent application is filed, till it comes to examination, several years and thousands of dollars would have been spent.</p><p>Although ethically, a patent attorney should explicitly convey their doubts on patentability of an invention, few rarely do. Even when Prior Art Search(Searching for conflicting patents) is conducted by the patent attorney, they are not always successful in bringing up the conflicting patents because our patent application is not drafted yet.</p><p>But, when the Govt. patent examiner does the Prior Art Search while examining our patent application, they will likely find conflicting patents if it exists.</p><h3 id="i-have-paid-my-patent-attorney-explained-my-invention-now-all-i-have-to-do-is-just-sit-tight-for-a-patent">I have paid my patent attorney, explained my invention, now all I have to do is just sit tight for a patent</h3><p>An average patent attorney drafts patent for anything from innovation in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidet" target="_blank">bidet</a> to quantum computers, so they are experts in using language to define an invention but they are rarely an expert in any field of invention.</p><p>So, this requires utmost care from the inventor to work along with the patent drafter to articulate their invention with appropriate vocabulary.</p><p>Unfortunately, patent attorneys tend to force the inventor to not to be specific in describing their invention in the patent application in order to exploit the loop holes in patent examination; This may help in getting the patent, but it also enables someone else to exploit the same loop holes to file a patent for the copy of our invention by just changing the grammar/vocabulary because our patent was too generic.</p><h3 id="i-have-filed-for-a-patent-no-one-would-copy-my-innovation-invention">I have filed for a patent, no one would copy my innovation/invention</h3><p>Examination of patent takes several years, although in the meantime we could use ‘patent-pending’ tag if our patent application gets published, finding someone who is copying our invention takes proactive approach. If the copied invention is being applied for patent, we need to detect it from published journal of the patent office and raise a concern.</p><p>All these takes extraordinarily focused effort and budget.</p><h3 id="i-have-applied-for-a-patent-via-pct-i-will-receive-patent-for-all-countries">I have applied for a patent via PCT, I will receive patent for all countries</h3><p><a href="https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/" target="_blank">PCT - Patent Cooperation Treaty</a> simplifies the process of applying for a patent in several countries who are part of the PCT treaty, but the process of obtaining a patent depends upon the individual country’s patent laws.</p><p>Even during filing PCT, the second phase i.e. national phase involves filing documents for patent application in the respective individual countries requiring working with the patent attorney’s of those countries resulting in thousands of dollars of expense for each country we wish to apply for via PCT.</p><p>We can extrapolate the same process for patent examination in each of those countries.</p><p>Then there are certain countries which even while being part of the PCT, doesn’t enforce patent protection for inventions of other countries in order to protect their local businesses which copies our invention.</p><h3 id="i-have-received-my-patent-it-would-prevent-someone-from-copying-my-invention">I have received my patent, it would prevent someone from copying my invention</h3><p>Like any law, existence of a law doesn’t prevent someone from violating it; enforcement and judicial process should uphold that law. Similarly, existence of patent doesn’t prevent someone from copying our invention.</p><p>We need to find the violator, pursue an often lengthy and expensive judicial process to claim our right to the invention protected by the patent.</p><h3 id="i-m-the-inventor-in-the-patent-i-can-do-anything-with-it">I’m the inventor in the patent, I can do anything with it</h3><p>Unless the inventor in the patent is the owner of the patent, the inventor has no right to the patent. This is often the case when businesses file patents, where the business is the owner in the patent and the employee is the inventor in the patent.</p><h3 id="patents-are-only-for-protecting-my-invention">Patents are only for protecting my invention</h3><p>The main reason to protect the invention is to reap the value of the invention if needed. Patents offer commercial and strategic value to businesses.</p><p>So, patents are often used for trading them for money or for other patents in organizations apart from using it for protecting their inventions.</p><h3 id="patents-make-me-look-cool">Patents make me look cool</h3><p>Not necessarily, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/05/new-low-bad-patent-patent-troll-sues-ventilator-company" target="_blank">patent trolls</a> have left a bad taste in the inventor/innovator community; so much so that many are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsIihrcqJYA" target="_blank">choosing not to file patent for their invention</a>.</p><p>Expenses, effort, lengthy unfair judicial trials has made several startups to not pursue patent for their invention in favor of capital efficiency.</p><h3 id="open-source-projects-doesn-t-need-patents">Open-source projects doesn’t need patents</h3><p>Open-source projects might need patents to <a href="https://golang.org/PATENTS" target="_blank">protect itself from getting sued for patent infringement</a>. Open-source projects protected by patents can prevent large organizations from stealing our project <a href="https://keivan.io/the-day-appget-died/" target="_blank">without due credit</a>.</p><h3 id="i-have-a-startup-product-name-i-need-to-trademark-it">I have a startup/product name, I need to trademark it</h3><p>Unless the startup/product has created value for its customers, so that a counterfeiter is using that startup/product name for forgery; trademarks for startup/product names are useless. Besides, in most countries just <a href="https://hitstartup.com/when-to-register-our-startup/" target="_blank">incorporating/registering our startup as a company</a> would prevent anyone else from using the same name for their company.</p><h3 id="trademark-automatically-applies-to-the-name-and-the-logo">Trademark automatically applies to the name and the logo</h3><p>Trademarking the name and logo are separate process namely wordmark and device mark respectively. Device mark might include text when it’s alongside the logo.</p></div></div>]]>

With more than <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/11/12/million-americans-live-rvs-meet-modern-nomads/">1 million people living in RVs</a>, the lifestyle has become more popular than ever.</p><p>If you’re <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/lists/camping/13-tips-perfect-campervan-camping-trip/">planning an RV or van trip</a> in the U.S. and looking for a once in a lifetime experience, look no further than Harvest Host.

In exchange, you are expected to spend a minimum of $20 at the business you stay at, but it is not required.</p><p>All classes of RVs are allowed including Class A, B, and C. This also includes motor coaches, fifth wheel campers, travel trailers, toy haulers, camper vans, truck campers, and towed vehicles. Tents and/or sleeping in your car are not allowed.</p><p>In order to see which businesses are a part of the Harvest Hosts program, and in which locations, you need to sign up for a membership on the <a href="https://harvesthosts.com/">HarvestHosts.com</a> website.</p><p>There are currently two plans available, one for $79/year and another for $119/year.</p><p>Harvest Hosts offers a membership program for seasoned RVers, full-timers, part-timers, and newbies. Harvest Host has been in business since 2015 and they’re growing every year.</p><p>Harvest Host is a great alternative to boondocking and wallydocking in between full service campsites. Self contained RVers can spend a night at Harvest Host sites which can include wineries, distilleries, farms and even golf-courses.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="51" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1592674192969_20660"><div>

If you’re looking for an alternative to parking at Walmart, or an RV campground, then Harvest Host is a good solution.</p><p>For a small membership fee, you can park at farms and wineries across North America. The membership program currently includes unlimited free overnight stays at more than 400 wineries, more than 100 breweries and distilleries, and hundreds of other farms, museums, golf courses, and more.</p><p>Harvest Host is available at:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>More than 400 vineyards and wineries</p></li><li><p>More than 100 breweries &amp; distilleries</p></li><li><p>More than 200 farms</p></li><li><p>More than 200 museums &amp; other attractions</p></li><li><p>More than 300 golf courses &amp; country clubs (on the pro plan)</p></li></ul><p>So for people who would prefer not to stay at a RV campground, you get to stay somewhere unique and have a more local experience.</p><p>The only thing that is not usually includes is hook-ups - you probably won’t have water, electric, sewer, or restrooms. Some hosts do provide electric and water, so it’s up to the host, and it’s not guaranteed.</p><h2>What if you don’t have an RV?</h2><p>RVs and vans can cost a lot to purchase, and they take up space. So it’s understandable if you don’t own one yourself, but renting is a great alternative.

Harvest Hosts RV locations are located in all states except Hawaii, but the number of locations per state varies.</p><p>Below I’ve included screenshots of the Harvest Host website for each state, so you can see how many locations are available by state and where in the state they’re located.</p><p>To view the Harvest Hosts map with all of the locations and to view the address of each location, you will need to <a href="http://harvesthosts.refr.cc/pamela1">sign up for Harvest Hosts</a>.</p><p>Harvest Hosts has more than 1000 available places to stay in every US State as well as in Canada, Alaska, and even Baja California.

(Note: only download the app after signing up on their <a href="http://harvesthosts.refr.cc/pamela1">website</a> first).</p><p>Here’s some real user reviews I found online for Harvest Host:</p><blockquote><p>“If I could give 10 stars I would!!! My husband &amp; I just finish a 3 week trek from Arizona all around New Mexico &amp; back to AZ without a plan. We stayed at 3 different Vineyards which all 3 took our breath away &amp; the owners we absolutely accommodating. We also stayed at an alpaca farm &amp; that was amazing!!!! The owners were sooo nice and the alpaca were so cute. It was a fantastic experience. I highly recommend HH to RV'ers.”</p><p>“Last summer I went from Toronto to Houston staying mainly at HH. Incuded an orchard, a museum, a winery, a distillery, a golf course (my old home course), and another winery. In the middle I enjoyed a State Park stay to change out and charge up my water and electrical systems. A lot of fun and met very interesting and helpful people. Also added a few bottles to my collection. Well done and thank you to HH. You make RVing fun.”</p><p>“Thanks to our hosts Dave and Diane for a wonderful shaded spot to spend our evening. Upon arrival Diane greeted and invited us for a wine tour by Meg who was very knowledgable and explained much of the local history including Bacon’s Castle and Hog Island. Dave joined us and took us on an extended tour of the farm and wine making facility. The goats entertained us with their antics of climbing the goat tower getting ready to retire for the evening. After having a large lunch earlier that day we opted for a simple dinner of baggette, cheese, snacks and Hampton Roads Winery wine purchased from their shop. The next day we took Meg’s suggestion and visited Bacon’s Castle followed by lunch at Surry Seafood. We also took a few bottles of Bacon’s Castle Red and other wines home with us. Our first Host experience was very positive!

June 26, 2020 | https://blog.sudo.ws/posts/2020/04/sudo-1.9-accessing-terminal-data-from-python/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.sudo.ws/posts/2020/04/sudo-1.9-accessing-terminal-data-from-python/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Sudo 1.9 is now feature complete. One of the new features is Python support, meaning that you can easily extend sudo functionality using Python scripts. It supports the very same APIs as the regular C plugin API, only the language is different. One of the more interesting APIs is the IO logging API, which provides access to terminal data in real-time, both input and output. This way you can check if a sudo user is accessing data that he should not, or analyze the commands entered and terminate a session before a disaster occurs.
In this blog you will find two simple examples for the above use cases. Both are over simplified but functional. You can use them to test out the new functionality, or as a basis for your own code.</p>

<p>In order to test sudo’s Python support, you will need both the sudo 1.9.0 package and the new sudo-python package.  Sudo binary packages are available for many platforms, but the sudo-python package is currently only distributed for Linux.  If you are using a different platform you will need to compile sudo yourself. It has a few dependencies, but the process is relatively easy and straightforward. I described it for RHEL / CentOS in my <a href="https://blog.sudo.ws/posts/2020/01/whats-new-in-sudo-1.9-python/">previous blog</a> in depth. In addition to the version number, another important thing has changed: Python support is now available as a sub-package. Once you have installed the packages, you are almost ready to begin testing the new features. Before you begin, make sure that you can login as root without using sudo. Yes, even on Ubuntu. When you are experimenting it is easy to create a configuration, or broken Python code, that prevents sudo from working correctly.</p>

<p>Any data appearing on the terminal of a sudo session can be accessed from Python code. Our first example is a very simple one. Sudo sends data to the Python code in small chunks, sometimes even character by character, as it appears on the terminal. In this case we will list a directory, so data is sent in larger chunks to the Python code.  Thus there is no need to concatenate the incoming data.</p>
<p>Setting up the test environment is easy. Login as root (or use “su”, just make sure that you can become root without sudo). Create a new directory under root’s home, and create an empty file in it:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir /root/DoNotEnter
touch /root/DoNotEnter/MySecret
</code></pre><p>Now, open your favorite text editor and create a new Python plugin. It can be anywhere on the file system, but must be readable only by root. For simplicity’s sake I created it under the <code>/root/</code> directory, which is accessible only by root, and gave it the name kick.py as it terminates the session (kicks the user out) if a given text string appears on the terminal.</p>
<pre><code>import sudo

class MyIOPlugin(sudo.Plugin):
    def log_ttyout(self, buf):
        if "MySecret" in buf:
          sudo.log_info("Don't look at my secret!")
          return sudo.RC.REJECT
</code></pre><p>As you can see, the script starts by importing the sudo module. This does not exist as a separate file on your file system, only within the sudo Python plugin itself.</p>
<p>Next, we define a class. You can name it however you like, the only important thing is that it is inherited from the sudo.Plugin class. You will use the name of the class in the <code>sudo.conf</code> file, where you configure sudo plugins.</p>
<p>The IO Plugin has many methods. For this example we are only concerned with <code>log_ttyout()</code>. For a complete list, see the documentation at <a href="https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.9.0/sudo_plugin_python.man.html">https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.9.0/sudo_plugin_python.man.html</a>. The <code>log_ttyout()</code> method is called by sudo any time when new data appears on the terminal. This data is available in the <code>buf</code> parameter of the method. Any time the method is called, it checks if <code>MySecret</code> appears in <code>buf</code>. If it is there, sudo prints a message on screen and terminates the session by returning <code>sudo.RC.REJECT</code>.</p>
<p>Next, open <code>/etc/sudo.conf</code> in your favorite text editor and add the following line to it:</p>
<pre><code>Plugin python_io python_plugin.so ModulePath=/root/kick.py ClassName=MyIOPlugin
</code></pre><p>Of course, make sure that ModulePath matches your actual setup.</p>
<p>Now, let’s login as a user and start a shell using sudo. Change to the <code>/root/</code> directory and list it. You can see an interesting looking directory name: <code>DoNotEnter</code>. Obviously, you enter it and try to list it to see why it has this name. Boom. Your session is terminated, even before <code>MySecret</code> could appear on the terminal. Here is what you should see:</p>
<pre><code>[czanik@centos7sudo ~]$ sudo -s
Password: 
[root@centos7sudo czanik]# cd /root/
[root@centos7sudo ~]# ls
DoNotEnter        kick.py
[root@centos7sudo ~]# cd DoNotEnter/
[root@centos7sudo DoNotEnter]# ls
Don't look at my secret!
                        Hangup
</code></pre>
<p>Unless you copy and paste large chunks of text to your terminal, checking user input is a bit more complicated. Input arrives character by character, as the user types it, so you need to concatenate it before checking the content.</p>
<p>Note: The following sample code is a very naive implementation, as it only does exact matches. As soon as someone uses backspace to fix a spelling mistake or uses a different order of command line parameters, it cannot detect the command.</p>
<p>Lacking creativity I saved the following code in <code>/root/kick_v2.py</code> (see the previous section for an explanation):</p>
<pre><code>import sudo

class MyIOPlugin(sudo.Plugin):
    def __init__(self, version: str, plugin_options, **kwargs):
        self.collected_buf = ''
        
    def log_ttyin(self, buf):
        self.collected_buf += buf
        if "rm -fr" in self.collected_buf:
          sudo.log_info("\n\nOops. 'rm -fr' is dangerous! Kicking you out...")
          return sudo.RC.REJECT
        # drop all the string until last enter:
        last_enter_pos = self.collected_buf.rfind("\n")
        if last_enter_pos &gt;= 0:
          self.collected_buf = ''
</code></pre><p>As you can see, the script starts by importing the sudo module. This does not exist as a separate file on your file system, only within the sudo Python plugin itself. Next, we define a class. Name it however you like, the only important thing is that it is inherited from the sudo.Plugin class. You will use the name of the class in the <code>sudo.conf</code> file, where you configure sudo plugins.</p>
<p>Here we use the <code>log_ttyin()</code> method of the IO Plugin, but first I initialize a variable in <code>__init__()</code> to collect the keystrokes. When the <code>log_ttyin()</code> method receives data from sudo, it first appends it to <code>collected_buf</code>. Next, it checks, if <code>rm -fr</code> appears in the variable. If it is present, a warning message is displayed and the session is terminated by returning <code>sudo.RC.REJECT</code>. When you hit the Enter key, the content of <code>collected_buf</code> is reset.</p>
<p>Next, open <code>/etc/sudo.conf</code> in your favorite text editor and add the following line to it:</p>
<pre><code>Plugin python_io python_plugin.so ModulePath=/root/kick_v2.py ClassName=MyIOPlugin
</code></pre><p>Now let’s login as a user and start a shell using sudo. Start to enter <code>rm -fr</code> on the command line. You should be kicked out before the final “r” appears on the screen:</p>
<pre><code>[czanik@centos7sudo ~]$ sudo -s
Password: 
[root@centos7sudo czanik]# rm -f

                                Oops. 'rm -fr' is dangerous! Kicking you out...
                                                                               Hangup
[czanik@centos7sudo ~]$ 
</code></pre>
<p>From this blog you can learn the basics of dealing with terminal input and output from Python code. Before going on to write your own Python code, I recommend reading the sudo plugin documentation. Both:</p>
<ul>
<li>C API: <a href="https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.9.0/sudo_plugin.man.html">https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.9.0/sudo_plugin.man.html</a></li>
<li>Python specific: <a href="https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.9.0/sudo_plugin_python.man.html">https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.9.0/sudo_plugin_python.man.html</a></li>

In an age where your personal data is being shared with far more companies than you can imagine, the folks at <a href="https://techpolicyinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Prince_Wallsten_How-Much-is-Privacy-Worth-Around-the-World-and-Across-Platforms.pdf" target="_blank" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Ftechpolicyinstitute.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F02%2FPrince_Wallsten_How-Much-is-Privacy-Worth-Around-the-World-and-Across-Platforms.pdf&amp;hash=493602e26ad60bf36acbdc1d6d52c624" rel="nofollow noopener">Tech Policy Institute</a> decided to take a poll. The general public was asked how much money they believe they should be paid by data amalgamators in exchange for their browsing habits, location history, etc. The answers from U.S. respondents ranged from caring almost not at all to just see ads, to demanding $10 for data collectors to see total bank account balances.</p><p>

Across all of the activities covered, Americans would only demand about $3.50/month on average to have each individual piece of personal data shared. A figure far too low when digital advertising revenue eclipsed $100 billion in 2019.</p><p>

As it stands now, the public is being paid $0 for all of the personal information which they choose to share, and for the information which they may not even know is being collected. That information is being used to build data profiles on an individual level which are then repackaged as “targeted advertisements” through ad networks. It’s why you can be searching for something on Google on your desktop and 6 hours later you see multiple ads on Facebook for the same thing for which you were searching on a different machine earlier.</p><p>

VPNs can help cut down on much of the data we unwittingly share, though you’re still going to end up sharing some information if you log into the same accounts across multiple networks or devices.</p><p>

Big Data has, unfortunately, creeped into our lives and is further entrenching itself as time goes on. What’s scary is that Americans, for the most part, do not seem to be concerned about it. Until legislation is passed limiting what can and cannot be collected, there isn’t a lot that can be done about data amalgamation on the macro level. On an individual level, taking care to opt-out of sharing whenever possible, using a VPN and limiting the number of apps on your phone can protect you to some degree.</p></div>

  <p><time datetime="2020-06-09T09:45:00-0400">Tue, Jun 9, 2020</time></p><p>In the <a href="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/posts/hp712-nextstep-part-1">last post of this series</a>, I set up NeXTstep on an HP PA-RISC <a href="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/pizzaboxes/hp712">workstation</a>. Today, I’m going to get down to business: configure networking, install system patches, outfit it with developer tools, and install some useful software!</p>
<p>As with the previous post, I’ve also made a YouTube video that covers roughly the same topics! If video is your speed, I’d love for you to check it out!</p>
<p>

</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My goal is to end up with a capable machine that I can use like it might have been when new, and learn from the experience.</p>
<h2 id="foreshadowing-networking-woes">Foreshadowing networking woes</h2>
<p>While it is possible to transfer files from SCSI drives (or even floppies!), <strong>getting a pizzabox on my home network makes loading software much easier</strong>.
I first tried out NeXTstep on this workstation a couple years ago. The OS installed OK, but I ran in to trouble with networking. I was initially optimistic that I would figure it out:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think I'm done for the day but soon if I can fight with NFS and NetInfo (lolololol) I can get screenshots off it and software on</p>— cron mom (@sophaskins) <a href="https://twitter.com/sophaskins/status/962427825608429568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2018</a></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<p><strong>NARRATOR</strong>: she did not soon win the fight with NFS and NetInfo</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hang on a second: NeXTstep is a workstation-focused Unix operating system from the 80s-90s - <strong>how could it be difficult to get it on a network</strong>? The answer is a thing called NetInfo.</p>
<p>In a surprise to exactly no one, NeXTstep, being from a company founded by Steve Jobs, had it’s own NeXT-only ecosystem of tools that fit together amazingly well. <strong>The cornerstone of NeXTstep networking was NetInfo</strong>. If you had a collection of NeXT computers on a network, NetInfo gave you a system to:</p>
<ul>
<li>manage user accounts that would work across all machines</li>
<li>configure file sharing</li>
<li>control permissions around access to network resources</li>
<li>assign IP addresses and hostnames</li>
<li>quickly bring new machines in to the network</li>
<li>serve this information in a highly-available manner</li>
</ul>
<p>which is to say: NetInfo is a “directory services” system. That’s all well and good - in the early 1990s that space had many competitors and a “right path” hadn’t yet been established, but…<strong>I don’t <em>want</em> my machine to be part of a directory</strong>, **I just want it to be on my existing TCP/IP network.</p>
<h2 id="starting-a-simple-network">Starting a “simple” network</h2>
<p>With that in mind, I (naively) attempted to use the “SimpleNetworkStarter” application.</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/simple-network-starter-1.png" alt="SimpleNetworkStarter">

      <figcaption>
          <p>SimpleNetworkStarter</p>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>The SimpleNetworkStarter window has three “steps”:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>how we’ll integrate</strong> with an existing NetInfo network (since I don’t intend to interact with one at all, I have to choose “Provide the services specified below”, a sort of catch-all)</li>
<li>Specify <strong>my hostname and IP address</strong> - if I were connecting to an existing NetInfo network, I might not have to do this. “Network Options” lets me set more granular IP settings like netmask and gateway; “NetInfo Options” lets me choose how to integrate with existing domains (if relevant).</li>
<li>Setup <strong>network services</strong>: for my setup I don’t really want <em>any</em> of these things, but as a standalone NeXTstep system, I do have to “Maintain the master copy of network administrative data” (aka, the NetInfo database).</li>
</ol>

<p>So far, this feels like a really good start, but will it let me fetch files from an NFS share?</p>
<h2 id="networking-woes">Networking woes</h2>
<p>I immediately tried connecting to my NAS over NFS - after all, the main point of setting up networking was making it easier to transfer files. Unfortunately, it didn’t work - I could set up the NFS mount with NFSMananger (more on how to do that later), but the mountpoint would always be empty. Here you can see me attempting to reach it by IP address:</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/failing-nfs-mount.png" alt="a failing NFS mount">

      <figcaption>
          <p>a failing NFS mount</p>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>So I had <em>some</em> sort of problem. To narrow down potential issues, I ran a few tests:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>attempting to ping my NAS</strong> from the workstation - this turned out to not work because NeXTstep doesn’t seem to have any <code>ping</code> command. There are probably ways to accomplish something equivalent with the tools it <em>does</em> have, but I just moved on</li>
<li><strong>attempting to ping the workstation</strong> from elsewhere on my network. This worked - I was able to ping it from my laptop!</li>
<li><strong>attempting to connect to my NAS with FTP</strong> - one of the few network tools NeXTstep <em>does</em> seem to have is FTP, so I gave it a shot. To my surprise, this works!</li>
</ul>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/ftp-by-ip.png" alt="connecting to my NAS via FTP (successfully)">
    </p>
    <a href="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/ftp-by-ip.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a>
      <figcaption>
          <p>connecting to my NAS via FTP (successfully)</p>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>It did not work via hostname, though, which points to at least some trouble with DNS. Taking a deeper look at the “NeXTstep 3.3 Network and
System Administration Manual” section on “<a href="http://www.nextcomputers.org/NeXTfiles/Docs/NeXTStep/3.3/nsa/11_MixedNet.htmld/index.html">NEXTSTEP Computers in a Mixed Network</a>” (which I probably should have done earlier) shows that <strong>I need to manually configure DNS</strong>. There’s no GUI options for it, you just have to write out an <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>:</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/resolv-conf.png" alt="editing /etc/resolv.conf in vi">

      <figcaption>
          <p>editing /etc/resolv.conf in vi</p>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>After rebooting, I was able to access the NAS via FTP by hostname:


</p><div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/ftp-by-hostname.png" alt="connecting to my NAS via FTP (successfully) by hostname">

      <figcaption>
          <p>connecting to my NAS via FTP (successfully) by hostname</p>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>But still couldn’t use NFS. What gives? I have network connectivity in both directions, and DNS is also now working! I believe this is as far as I got a few years ago, and man I was FRUSTRATED.</p>
<p>Eventually I thought to look in the system log (<code>/usr/adm/messages</code>) for hints:</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/dmesg.png" alt="an error from autonfsmount">
    </p>
    <a href="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/dmesg.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a>
      <figcaption>
          <p>an error from autonfsmount</p>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>and there it was:</p>
<pre><code>autonfsmount: Can't get my address
</code></pre><p>Can’t get…<em>my</em> address? Doesn’t the computer know its own address? While I don’t know <em>why</em> it has to do this (googling has provided me a couple of <a href="https://rute.gerdesas.com/node31.html">quick asides</a> mentioning it, but not much detail), <strong>mounting an NFS server requires working <em>reverse</em> DNS for your IP</strong>.</p>
<p>I do have a real-ish DNS server for my home network, and it populates based on DHCP leases and IP reservations. This workstation, though, was just <strong>using an IP that I habitually hardcode for pizzaboxes (192.168.1.200)</strong>. I double-checked the DHCP server config, and it was indeed set up with a different host for that IP, and not set up at all for this hostname. I replaced that entry with one for <code>hp712</code> at <code>192.168.1.200</code> for the MAC address of my workstation, and crossed my fingers.</p>
<p>It worked! I could browse my NAS from the file-browser.</p>

<p>After all that rigamarole, the right way to configure a remote NFS mount goes through the NFSManager.app. While NFSManager lets you configure both “exports” (local directories I share with others) and “imports” (remote directories I want to mount locally).</p>

<p>That’s it? A lot of struggle got me to this point, but <em>finally</em> I can transfer files.</p>
<h2 id="patch-tuesday">Patch Tuesday</h2>
<p>The first order of business is to <strong>run system updates</strong>. NeXTstep 3.3 was released in mid-1995, and it had three patch updates: the <a href="https://www.nextop.de/NeXTAnswers/2066.html">first</a> at the end of 1995, and the second and <a href="http://www.nextcomputers.org/NeXTfiles/Software/NEXTSTEP/Patches/NEXTSTEP_3.3_User_Patch_3/nextstep3.3_patch_3_overview.pdf">third</a> in late 1999. Since NeXT were acquired by Apple in 1997, this patch was made by Apple to address Y2k bugs and other longstanding issues. Thanks, Apple! <a href="https://youtu.be/gaI6kBVyu00?t=28"><em>Thapple</em></a>.</p>
<p>The third patch is a cumulative update, so that should be all I need. Nextcomputers.org generously <a href="http://www.nextcomputers.org/NeXTfiles/Software/NEXTSTEP/Patches/NEXTSTEP_3.3_User_Patch_3/">hosts</a> the patch for download. Because I’m using an HP PA-RISC machine, I need <code>NS33RISCUserPatch3.tar</code>. System updates need to be installed as the <code>root</code> user, and if you run them as <code>me</code> (the default user) NeXTstep doesn’t prompt to escalate privilges, it just gives an error. Thus, I need to log in as <code>root</code> directly. In order to do that, I need to give the <code>me</code> user a password so the system will stop automatically logging in at boot (giving me a chance to log in as <code>root</code>). To set a password, you go to Preferences.app and navigate to the lock icon.</p>

<p>After a reboot, I’m on the most recent version of NeXTstep for PA-RISC, and ready for the year 2000!</p>

<p>What’s next for making a usable system? Developer tools! <strong>NeXTstep came on two sets of discs - “User” for the main operating system, and the optional “Developer” disc</strong> with compilers, GUI building tools, libraries, and documentation. While there were separate versions of NeXTstep User for CISC (m68k and i386) and RISC (PA-RISC and SPARC) platforms, the Developer disc is “quad-fat” - it contains binaries for all four platforms.

<b>Abstract.</b> ACM's 2018 A.M. Turing Award was about
<em>deep learning</em> in artificial neural networks.
ACM lauds the awardees for work based on algorithms
and conceptual foundations first published by other researchers 
whom the awardees failed to cite
(see </a><a href="#exec">Executive Summary</a>
and Sec. 
<a href="#I">I</a>,
<a href="#V">V</a>, 
<a href="#II">II</a>,
<a href="#XII">XII</a>,
<a href="#XIX">XIX</a>, 
<a href="#XXI">XXI</a>,
<a href="#XIII">XIII</a>, 
<a href="#XIV">XIV</a>,  
<a href="#XX">XX</a>, 
<a href="#XVII">XVII</a>).
ACM explicitly mentions "astonishing" deep learning breakthroughs in 4 fields:
<a href="#A"> (A) speech recognition</a>, 
<a href="#B">(B) natural language processing</a>, 
<a href="#C">(C) robotics</a>, 
<a href="#D">(D) computer vision</a>,
as well as "powerful" new deep learning tools in 3 fields: 
<a href="#VII">(VII) medicine, astronomy, materials science</a>.
Most of these breakthroughs and tools, however, were directly based on 
the results of my own labs in the past 3 decades 
 (e.g., Sec.  
<a href="#A">A</a>,
<a href="#B">B</a>,
<a href="#C">C</a>,
<a href="#D">D</a>,
<a href="#VII">VII</a>,
<a href="#XVII">XVII</a>,
<a href="#VI">VI</a>,
<a href="#XVI">XVI</a>). 
I correct ACM's distortions of deep learning history (e.g., Sec. 
<a href="#II">II</a>,  
<a href="#V">V</a>, 
<a href="#XX">XX</a>,
<a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a>) 
and also 
mention 8 of our direct priority disputes 
with Bengio &amp; Hinton (Sec.  <a href="#XVII">XVII</a>, <a href="#I">I</a>).

<em>This document (~11,000 words)
reuses and expands some of the material in my <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html">Critique of the 2019 Honda Prize</a> <a href="#HIN">[HIN]</a> (~3,000 words). 
It has several layers of hierarchical abstraction:

<p>We must stop crediting the wrong people for inventions made by others.
Instead let's heed the recent call in the journal <em>Nature</em>:
<b>"Let 2020 be the year in which we value those who ensure that 
science is self-correcting"</b> <a href="#SV20">[SV20]</a>.
Like those who know me can testify, finding and citing original sources of scientific and technological innovations is important to me, whether they are mine or other people's <a href="#DL1">[DL1]</a> <a href="#DL2">[DL2]</a> <a href="#HIN">[HIN]</a> <a href="#NASC1">[NASC1-9]</a>. The present page is offered as a resource for computer scientists who share this inclination. 
By grounding research in its true intellectual foundations and crediting the original inventors, 
I am not diminishing important contributions made by popularizers of those inventions. 
My goal is to encourage the entire community to be more scholarly in its efforts, to recognize the foundational work that sometimes gets lost in the frenzy of modern AI and machine learning,
and to fight plagiarism in all of its more or less subtle forms. 
I am also inviting others to contribute additional relevant 
references (send them to <em>juergen@idsia.ch</em>). 



</p><p> I will focus on 
contributions praised by
ACM's official justification <a href="#T19">[T19]</a> of the 
2018 A.M. Turing Award for Drs. Bengio &amp; Hinton &amp; LeCun  <a href="#R1">[R1]</a> 
 published in 2019.
After the <a href="#exec">Executive Summary</a>,
ACM's full text <a href="#T19">[T19]</a> is split into 21 parts  
labeled by "<b>ACM:</b>" 
<a href="#I">I</a>, 
<a href="#II">II</a>, 
<a href="#III">III</a>, 
<a href="#IV">IV</a>,

<a href="#XVII">XVII</a>,
<a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a>,
<a href="#XIX">XIX</a>,
<a href="#XX">XX</a>,
<a href="#XXI">XXI</a>.
Each part is followed by a critical "<b>Comment</b>." 
Most of the comments are based on references to original papers and other material from
 recent 
blog posts <a href="#MIR">[MIR]</a> <a href="#DEC">[DEC]</a>  <a href="#HIN">[HIN]</a>.
<b>I'll point out 
that  highly cited publications of the awardees ignored fundamental 
relevant prior work—this may be the reason for some of  ACM's misattributions.</b>
Since ACM's text is a bit repetitive and redundant, so are the partially overlapping
sections of  my critique.

Executive Summary (~1000 words, with links to details)

</a></h2><a name="exec">

</a><p><a name="exec">
While Drs. LeCun &amp; Bengio &amp; Hinton (<b>LBH for short</b>)  
have made  useful improvements of algorithms for 
artificial neural networks (<b>NNs</b>) 
and deep learning (e.g., </a><a href="#I">Sec.  I</a>), ACM lauds
them for more visible 
work based on fundamental methods whose inventors they did not cite,
not even in later surveys
(this may actually explain some of  ACM's misattributions). I correct ACM's distortions of deep learning history.
Numerous <a href="#References">references</a> can be found under the relevant section links I-XXI 
which adhere to the sequential order of ACM's text <a href="#T19">[T19]</a>
(while this summary groups related sections together).


</p><p>
<b>Sec. <a href="#II">II</a>:</b> 
In contrast to ACM's claims, 
NNs for pattern recognition etc. were introduced long before the 1980s. 
 <b>Deep learning with multilayer perceptrons started in 1965</b> through Ivakhnenko &amp; Lapa
long before LBH who have never cited them, not even in recent work.
<b>In the 1980s,</b> "modern" gradient-based learning 
worked only for rather shallow NNs,
<b>but it became really deep in 1991 in my lab,</b>
first through 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%201">unsupervised pre-training of NNs</a>, 
then through 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204">supervised LSTM</a>.
<b>Sec.  <a href="#I">I</a></b> contains 4 subsections 
<b><a href="#A">A</a>, <a href="#B">B</a>, <a href="#C">C</a>, <a href="#D">D</a></b>
on <b>the  4 deep learning "breakthroughs" explicitly 
mentioned by ACM</b>. ACM does not mention that they were 
mostly based on deep learning techniques of my team:

</p><p>
<b>Sec.
<a href="#A">A: Speech Recognition</a></b> (see also <a href="#VI">VI</a> &amp; <a href="#XI">XI</a> &amp; <a href="#XV">XV</a>): The first superior end-to-end neural speech recognition 
combines two methods from my lab: <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204">LSTM</a> (1990s-2005) and CTC (2006), applied to speech in 2007. 
Hinton (2012) and Bengio (<a href="#XV">XV</a>)
still used an old hybrid approach of the 1980s and 90s;
Hinton et al. (2012) did not compare it to 
our revolutionary CTC-LSTM (<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/impact-on-most-valuable-companies.html">which was soon on most smartphones</a>).

</p><p>
<b>Sec. <a href="#B">B: Natural Language Processing</a></b> (see also  <a href="#VI">VI</a> &amp; <a href="#XI">XI</a> &amp;  <a href="#XVI">XVI</a>): 
The first superior end-to-end neural machine translation  
(<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/impact-on-most-valuable-companies.html">soon used for several billions of
translations each day by the big platform companies</a>)
was also based on our <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204">LSTM</a>.

</p><p>
<b>Sec. <a href="#C">C: Robotics</a></b>.
Our LSTM trained by <b>Reinforcement Learning</b> (RL) was also the core of the 
most visible breakthroughs in robotics and video games.

</p><p>
<b>Sec. <a href="#D">D: Computer Vision</a></b>
(see also   
<a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a> &amp; <a href="#XIV">XIV</a>  &amp; <a href="#XI">XI</a>  &amp;  <a href="#VI">VI</a>)
was revolutionized by <b>convolutional NNs</b> (CNNs).
The basic CNN architecture is due to Fukushima (1979). 
NNs with convolutions were later (1987) combined by Waibel with backpropagation and weight sharing, 
and applied to speech. <b>All before</b> LeCun's CNN work  (<a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a>).
We showed twice (1991-95 and 2006-10) that 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2019">deep NNs 
don't need unsupervised 
pre-training</a> (in contrast to Hinton's claims). Our team (Ciresan et al.)  
made CNNs fast &amp; deep enough for  
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/computer-vision-contests-won-by-gpu-cnns.html">superior computer vision  in 2011</a>,
<b>winning 4 image recognition contests in a row
before Hinton's team won one</b>. ResNet (ImageNet 2015 winner)
is a special case of our earlier <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/highway-networks.html">Highway Nets</a>.

</p><p>
<b>Sec.  <a href="#XIV">XIV:</a></b>
Again ACM recognizes work that failed to cite the pioneers.
Long before Hinton (2012), Hanson (1990) had a variant of <b>dropout</b>, 
and v. d. Malsburg (1973) had <b>rectified linear neurons</b>; Hinton did not cite them.
Already in 2011,
our deep &amp; fast CNN  more than <b>"halved the error rate for object recognition"</b> (ACM's wording) 
in a computer vision contest 
(<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/superhumanpatternrecognition.html">where LeCun participated</a>), 
long before Hinton's similar CNN (2012). 
<b>Sec. <a href="#XI">XI</a>:</b>  ACM mentions GPU-accelerated NNs

        <p>With Apple’s recent announcement that they are moving away from Intel X86 CPU’s to their own ARM CPU’s for future laptops and desktops I thought it would be a good time to take a look at the some differences that can affect systems programmers working in Rust.</p>

<p>One of the key areas where ARM CPU’s differ from X86 is their memory model. This article will take a look at what a memory model is and how it can cause code to be correct on one CPU but cause race conditions on another.</p>

<h2 id="memory-models">Memory Models</h2>

<p>The way loads and stores to memory interact between multiple threads on a specific CPU is called that architecture’s Memory Model.</p>

<p>Depending on the memory model of the CPU, multiple writes by one thread may become visible to another thread in a different order to the one they were issued in.</p>

<p>The same is true of a thread issuing multiple reads. A thread issuing multiple reads may receive “snapshots” of global state that represent points in time ordered differently to the order of issue.</p>

<p>Modern hardware needs this flexibility to be able to maximize the throughput of memory operations. While CPU clock rates and core counts have been increasing with each new CPU iteration, memory bandwidth has struggled to keep up. Moving data from memory to operate on is often the bottle neck in the performance of applications.</p>

<p>If you’ve never written multi-threaded code, or only done so using higher level synchronization primitives such as <code>std::sync::Mutex</code>, you’ve probably never been exposed to the details of the memory model. This is because the CPU, despite whatever reordering it’s memory model allows it to perform, always presents a consistent view of memory to the current thread.</p>

<p>If we look at the below snippet of code that writes to memory and then reads the same memory straight back, we will always get the expected value of <code>58</code> back when we read. There is never the case that we’d read some stale value from memory.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>fn</span> <span>read_after_write</span><span>(</span><span>u32_ptr</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>u32_ptr</span><span>.write_volatile</span><span>(</span><span>58</span><span>);</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>u32_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>u32_ptr</span><span>.read_volatile</span><span>();</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"the value is {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>u32_value</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>I’m using volatile operations because if I used normal pointer operations the compiler is smart enough to skip the memory read and just prints the value <code>58</code>. 
Volatile operations stop the compiler from reordering or skipping our memory operation. However they have no affect on hardware (or the compiler re-ordering relative to non-volatile memory operations).</em></p>

<p>Once we introduce multiple threads, we’re now exposed to the fact that the CPU may be reordering our memory operations.</p>

<p>We can examine the snippet below in a multi-threaded context:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>fn</span> <span>writer</span><span>(</span><span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>.write_volatile</span><span>(</span><span>58</span><span>);</span>
    <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>.write_volatile</span><span>(</span><span>42</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>fn</span> <span>reader</span><span>(</span><span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>(</span><span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>.read_volatile</span><span>(),</span> <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>.read_volatile</span><span>())</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we initialize the contents of both pointers to <code>0</code>, and then run each function in a different thread, we can list the possible outcomes for the reader. We know that there is no synchronization, but based on our experience with single threaded code we think the possible return values are <code>(0, 0)</code>, <code>(58, 0)</code> or <code>(58, 42)</code>. But the possibility of hardware reordering of memory writes affecting multi-threads means that there is a fourth option <code>(0, 42)</code>.</p>

<p>You might think there are more possibilities due to the lack of synchronization. But all hardware memory models guarantee that aligned loads and store up to the native word size are atomic (u32 or a 32-bit CPU, u64 on a 64-bit CPU). If we changed one of our writes to <code>0xFFFF_FFFF</code>, the read will only ever see the old value or the new value. It will never see a partial value like <code>0xFFFF_0000</code>.</p>

<p>If the details of the CPU’s memory model are hidden away when using regular memory accesses, it seems like we would have no way to control it in multi-threaded programs where it affects program correctness.</p>

<p>Luckily Rust provides as with the <code>std::sync::atomic</code> module containing types that gives us the control we need. We use these types to specify exactly the memory ordering requirements our code needs. We trade performance for correctness. We place restrictions on what order the hardware can perform memory operations, taking away any bandwidth optimizations the hardware would want to perform.</p>

<p>When working with the <code>atomic</code> module, we don’t worry about the actual memory models of individual CPU architectures. Instead the operation of the <code>atomic</code> module works on an abstract memory model that’s CPU agnostic. Once we’ve expressed our requirements on the loads and stores using this Rust memory model, the compiler does the job of mapping to the memory model of the target CPU.</p>

<p>The requirements we specify on each operation takes the form of what reordering we want to allow (or deny) on the operation. The orderings form a hierarchy, with each level placing more restrictions the CPU. For example <code>Ordering::Relaxed</code> means the CPU is free to perform any reordering it wants. <code>Ordering::Release</code> means that a store can only complete after all proceeding stores have finished.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how atomic memory writes are actually compiled, compared to a regular write.</p>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we look at the <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/uVQM8T">X86 assembly</a> for the above code, we see the first three functions produce identical code. It’s not until the stricter <code>SeqCst</code> ordering that we get a different instruction being produced.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_write:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>],</span> <span>58</span>
        <span>ret</span>

<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_relaxed:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>],</span> <span>58</span>
        <span>ret</span>

<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_release:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>],</span> <span>58</span>
        <span>ret</span>
        
<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_consistent:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>eax</span><span>,</span> <span>58</span>

        <span>ret</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The first two orderings use the <strong><code>MOV</code></strong> (<strong>MOV</strong>e) instruction to write the value to memory. Only the strictest ordering produces a different instruction, <strong><code>XCHG</code></strong> (atomic e<strong>XCH</strong>an<strong>G</strong>), to a raw pointer write.</p>

<p>We can compare that to the <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/wWQo8P">ARM assembly</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_write:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>58</span>
        <span>str</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>x0</span><span>]</span>
        <span>ret</span>

<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_relaxed:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>58</span>
        <span>str</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>x0</span><span>]</span>
        <span>ret</span>

<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_release:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>58</span>
        <span>stlr</span>    <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>x0</span><span>]</span>
        <span>ret</span>
        
<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_consistent:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>58</span>
        <span>stlr</span>    <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>x0</span><span>]</span>
        <span>ret</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In contrast we can see there is a difference once we hit the release ordering requirement. The raw pointer and relaxed atomic store use <strong><code>STR</code></strong> (<strong>ST</strong>ore <strong>R</strong>egister) while the release and sequential ordering uses the instruction <strong><code>STLR</code></strong> (<strong>ST</strong>ore with re<strong>L</strong>ease <strong>R</strong>egister). <em>The <strong><code>MOV</code></strong> instruction in this disassembly is moving the constant <code>58</code> into a register, it’s not a memory operation.</em></p>

<p>We should be able to see the risk here. The mapping between the theoretical Rust memory model and the X86 memory model is more forgiving to programmer error. It’s possible for us to write code that is wrong with respect to the abstract memory model, but still have it produce the correct assembly code and work correctly on some CPU’s.</p>

<h2 id="writing-a-multi-threaded-program-using-atomic-operations">Writing a Multi-Threaded Program using Atomic Operations</h2>

<p>The program we’ll be exploring builds upon the concept of storing a pointer value being atomic across threads. One thread is going to perform some work using a mutable object it owns. Once it’s finished that work it’s going to publish that work as an immutable shared reference, using an atomic pointer write to both signal the work is complete and allow reading threads to use the data.</p>

<h2 id="the-x86-only-implementation">The X86 Only Implementation</h2>

<p>If we really want to test how forgiving the X86’s memory model is, we can write multi-threaded code that skips any use of the <code>std::sync::atomic</code> module. I want to stress this is not something you should ever actually consider doing. In fact this code has undefined behavior due to not guarding against possible compiler instruction re-ordering (however in Rust 1.44.1 the compiler doesn’t re-order so the code “works”). This is an learning exercise only.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>It is common knowledge that parent-child interactions have a significant effect on the success of any child. But which features of this interaction are most important- quality or quantity?</p><h2><strong>Study Background</strong></h2><p>We find various studies that track the relationship between the frequency of parent-child communication and their academic achievements. Similarly, studies have found positive relationships between the effectiveness and trust in these communications and child’s achievements. Another group of studies has developed the stance that these interactions lead to a strong and healthy self-concept in children and, as a result, lead to higher chances of success at life in children.</p><p>However, there is another hypothesis indicating children’s perceived lack of autonomy that comes with increased frequency of these interactions among parents and children. These research conclude that increase in the quantity of parent-child interaction can lead to adverse impacts on the performance of youngsters. This controversy leads many parents to question the approach they should take to communicating with their children. Should they be more involved or should they appear&nbsp;<em>cool</em>&nbsp;parents?</p><p><a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01203" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The study under observation</a>&nbsp;claims that it’s not the quantity of this interaction that should remain the primary focus of parents rather they should focus on quality.</p><h2><strong>Research Question</strong></h2><p>This study looked at different aspects of communication among parents and children to determine if the communication quality or quantity affected children’s self-concept more. In the end, it defined the correlation between this self-reported self-concept among subjects and their academic achievement.</p><h2><strong>Method</strong></h2><p>Researchers selected 1815 eighth-graders from Early Childhood Longitudinal Study- Kindergarten (ECLS-K). They selected only those middle-schoolers who didn’t change school during the middle school years. They represented different family structures, parents’ educational levels, and ethnic backgrounds.</p><p>They, and their parents, filled out surveys about frequency, scope, environment, and trust of their communications.</p><p>Furthermore, the students reported about their self-concept. The study gathered data about academic performance from the ECLS-K dataset.</p><h2><strong>Results</strong></h2><p>As expected, the quality of communication among parents and children showed a positive correlation with the academic performance of the former. But a novel result of this study appeared when the relationship between the quantity of these communication and academic performance was evaluated. This positive association was a result of a positive impact on children’s self-concept that comes from a higher quality of communication between parents and children.</p><p>The results indicated that an increase in the quantity of these communications could lead to deterioration in the academic achievement of these students. (The researchers explain this finding stating that teens and pre-teens view an increase in communication as a tool to surpass their autonomy.) However, the study found no impact on the frequency and time of communication self-concept of these kids.</p><p>Other findings include a positive relationship between parents’ academic achievements and children’s academic performance and no effect of family structure on students’ performance.</p><h2><strong>Take Away</strong></h2><p>If you are worried about the time you are spending with your kids, this study is for you. It shows that as long as you are using the right communication environment and emotions, the time you spend investigating their interests and lives doesn’t matter.</p><p>The key to parent-triggered success does not lie in repeated and long-lasting conversations. It lies in mutual trust, understanding, and acceptance.</p><p>Reference: Zhang, Y. (2020).

<h2 id="theory">Theory</h2>

<p>There are 13 address pins (A15-A3) connected between the Dreamcast’s SH-4 CPU
and its SDRAM.  Two, A15 and A14, are used to select the SDRAM bank address.
The row and column addresses are multiplexed on the other 11 pins.</p>

<p>Years ago there was <a href="https://www.assembler-games.com/threads/sega-dreamcast-system-ram-16mb-jtag-hack.41785">a discussion on ASSEMbler
Games</a>
about how to access additional address pins on the SH-4 so that more memory can
be addressed.  Unfortunately, the A16 address pin is not connected, and it also
happens to be on an interior row of a BGA chip, so the only ways to access it
would be by drilling into the PCB from the back or by removing the chip and
reflowing it back on with a wire attached to the A16 ball.  I’m not sure if
anyone has succeeded with that yet.</p>

<p>But reading that thread got me thinking about how memory addresses are
multiplexed on the SH-4 bus, and it turns out that it’s possible to address
more memory by changing how the existing address bus is utilized.</p>

<p>Let’s look at some of the SDRAM address multiplexing options available.</p>

<h3 id="512k-x-32-bit-x-4-sdrams">512K x 32-bit x 4 SDRAMs</h3>

<p>The Dreamcast comes with two 512K x 32-bit x 4 SDRAMs for a total of 16MB.</p>

<p>64-bit data (32 bits from each SDRAM) is addressed by 11-bit row addresses and
8-bit column addresses.  The SH-4’s address multiplexing is controlled by the
AMX2-AMX0 pins of the MCR (see Section 13 (Bus State Controller (BSC)) of the
SH7750 Hardware Manual for more details).  The Dreamcast BIOS sets AMX very
early in the boot process, before it copies itself to SDRAM.  An unmodified
Dreamcast uses AMX 4.</p>

<p>Here’s how AMX 4 works (from Appendix F of the SH-7550 manual):</p>

<p>(A12 and A11 on the SDRAM are BA1 and BA0, respectively)</p>

<p><img src="https://tsowell.github.io/assets/posts/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade/amx13.png" alt="AMX 13"></p>

<h3 id="1m-x-32-bit-x-4-sdrams">1M x 32-bit x 4 SDRAMs</h3>

<p>The ASSEMbler Games thread considers replacing those with 1M x 32-bit x 4
SDRAMs for a total of 32MB.  These SDRAMs have an additional address pin (A11)
and use 12-bit row address and 8-bit column addresses.  Setting the 12th row
address bit would require connecting the SH-4’s A16 which is not easily
accessible, but here’s how the address multiplexing would look:</p>

<p><img src="https://tsowell.github.io/assets/posts/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade/amx9.png" alt="AMX 9"></p>

<h3 id="2m-x-32-bit-x-4-sdrams">2M x 32-bit x 4 SDRAMs</h3>

<p>Another approach is to use 2M x 32-bit x 4 SDRAMs because they have 12-bit row
addresses and <strong>9</strong>-bit column addresses.  The SH-4 can still only drive 11
bits of the row address, so it can only address half of the available 64MB of
RAM, but it can still use the extra column address bit to address 32MB.</p>

<p>One nice property of these SDRAMs is that if you tie the A11 pin to ground,
they behave exactly like the original 512K x 32-bit x 4 SDRAMs and can be used
with an original AMX 4 BIOS.  Only 16MB can be addressed in this configuration,
but it provides a way to verify that the SDRAMs are working after you install
them but before you rewire them and switch to an AMX 3 BIOS so that 32MB can be
addressed.</p>

<p>Here’s AMX 3, the address multiplexing mode for 2M x 32-bit x 4 SDRAMs:</p>

<p>(A13 and A12 on the SDRAM are BA1 and BA0 now)</p>

<p><img src="https://tsowell.github.io/assets/posts/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade/amx11.png" alt="AMX 11"></p>

<p>The Dreamcast is still wired for AMX 4, so the above is not actually how things
are connected.  In reality, the SH-4’s A16 is unconnected, the SH-4’s A15 is
connected to the SDRAM’s A13/BA1, and the SH-4’s A14 is connected to the
SDRAM’s A12/BA0, like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://tsowell.github.io/assets/posts/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade/amx11_actual.png" alt="AMX 11 actual"></p>

<p>That configuration won’t work because the SH-4 will change the bank address
during the CAS cycle by pulling the SH-4’s A14 low.</p>

<p>But it will work if you tie the SDRAM’s A12/BA0 and the SDRAM’s A13/BA1
together (so that both are driven by the SH-4’s A15) and attach the SH-4’s A14
to the SDRAM’s A11:</p>

<p><img src="https://tsowell.github.io/assets/posts/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade/amx11_works.png" alt="AMX 11 works"></p>

<p>To achieve this in practice, you just need to scoot a couple of pins over: bend
pin 22 and solder it to pad 23, then bend pin 21 and solder it to pad 22, like
this:</p>

<p>(Pins 22 and 23 are both soldered to pad 23.  Pin 21 is the only pin soldered to
pad 22.)</p>

<p><img src="https://tsowell.github.io/assets/posts/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade/amx11_rewire.png" alt="AMX_11_rewire"></p>

<p>The BIOS needs to be modified to use AMX 3 in order to use the SDRAMs in this
configuration.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Dreamcast modded with a writable BIOS.  I used a VA1 and haven’t tested
other revisions.</li>
  <li>Two pin-compatible 86-pin TSOP2 (2M x 32-bit x 4) SDRAMs with 9-bit column
addressing.  I used two IS42S32800J-6TL SDRAMs, but I don’t see a reason why
the slower -7 and -75 speed grades wouldn’t work as well.</li>
  <li>~30 AWG wire (optional but recommended).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="tools">Tools</h4>

<ul>
  <li>A hot air rework station</li>
  <li>A soldering iron, flux, flux cleaner, solder wick</li>
  <li>Tweezers and pliers for lifting and straightening IC pins</li>
  <li>A multimeter for checking for shorts</li>
</ul>

  <li>Using hot air to remove surface mount ICs from a PCB</li>
  <li>Soldering surface mount (0.8mm pitch) ICs</li>
  <li>Patching binaries using a hex editor</li>
  <li>Flashing BIOS images using Dreamshell</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>I recommend installing the new SDRAMs in AMX 4 mode so that you can test them
with an original BIOS before rewiring them for AMX 3.  In my case this paid off
because at first, my Dreamcast didn’t boot with the new SDRAMs in AMX 4 mode,
and I had to go back and touch up the soldering to get it to work.</p>

<p>If you are more confident in your rework/soldering skills, steps 4, 5, and 7
are optional if you do step 6 ahead of time.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Remove the motherboard and use a hot air station to remove the original
SDRAM chips.</li>
  <li>Bend up pins 21 and 22 on both SDRAMs.</li>
  <li>Solder the new SDRAMs to the motherboard.  For each SDRAM, bend pin 22 down
enough so that you can solder it to pad 22.  Leave pin 21 lifted and
disconnected.</li>
  <li>Solder a wire from pin 86 (VSS) to pin 21 (A11) on each SDRAM.</li>

<h3 id="step-by-step-instructions">Step-by-step instructions</h3>

<h4 id="1-remove-the-original-sdrams">1. Remove the original SDRAMs</h4>

<p>Disassemble the Dreamcast and remove the motherboard.  Identify the system
SDRAM chips (IC102 and IC103).  Your SDRAMs may have different a different part
number and manufacturer as several different parts were used.</p>

<p><img src="https://tsowell.github.io/assets/posts/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade/original_sdram.jpg" alt="Photo of Dreamcast motherboard hightlighting IC102 and IC103 with red
boxes"></p>

<p>Use a hot air station to remove the original SDRAMs and clean up the pads with
solder wick and flux cleaner.</p>

<p><img src="https://tsowell.github.io/assets/posts/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade/no_sdram.jpg" alt="Photo of Dreamcast motherboard showing bare pads where IC102 and IC103 have
been removed"></p>

<h4 id="2-bend-up-pins-21-and-22-on-the-new-sdrams">2. Bend up pins 21 and 22 on the new SDRAMs</h4>

<p>I prefer to lift and straighten the pins at this point before the chips are
soldered down.</p>

<p>You can use the motherboard silkscreen as a guide to identify the pins.  The
silkscreen marks every 5th pad with a white dot.  Line up the SDRAMs with the
IC103 pads:</p>

<p><img src="https://tsowell.github.io/assets/posts/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade/lined_up.jpg" alt="Photo through microscope of an SDRAM chip aligned with the 1st solder
pad" height="50%" width="50%"></p>

<p>Use the white dots to identify pins 21 and 22:</p>

<p><img src="https://tsowell.github.io/assets/posts/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade/pins_to_lift.jpg" alt="Photo through microscope of an SDRAM chip with pins 21 and 22 highlighted and
labeled in red" height="50%" width="50%"></p>

<p>Then bend both of them up with tweezers so they are at a 90 degree angle from
the rest of the pins and straighten them with pliers:</p>

<p><img src="https://tsowell.github.io/assets/posts/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade/lifted_pins.jpg" alt="Photo through microscope of an SDRAM chip with pins 21 and 22
lifted" height="50%" width="50%"></p>

<h4 id="3-solder-the-sdrams-to-the-motherboard">3. Solder the SDRAMs to the motherboard</h4>

<p>On each SDRAM, leave pin 21 (the left lifted pin) unconnected, but bend pin 22
(the right lifted pin) back down enough so that you can solder it to pad 22.
You will lift it up again in step 8.</p>

<p><img src="https://tsowell.github.io/assets/posts/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade/soldered.jpg" alt="Photo of Dreamcast motherboard showing two SDRAM chips with pin 21
lifted"></p>

<h4 id="4-solder-a-wire-from-pin-86-vss-to-pin-21-a11-on-both-sdrams">4. Solder a wire from pin 86 (VSS) to pin 21 (A11) on both SDRAMs</h4>

<p>This is temporary, so it doesn’t have to be pretty.</p>

<p><img src="https://tsowell.github.io/assets/posts/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade/wired.jpg" alt="Photo of Dreamcast motherboard showing two SDRAM chips with pin 21 lifted and
attached by black wires to pin 86"></p>

<h4 id="5-reassemble-the-dreamcast-and-verify-that-it-still-works">5. Reassemble the Dreamcast and verify that it still works</h4>

<p>At this point only 16MB will be available, but this will verify that the SDRAMs
have been installed properly.  You should be able to use the BIOS menu, run a
program from a disc, etc.</p>

<h4 id="6-flash-an-amx-3-dreamcast-bios">6. Flash an AMX 3 Dreamcast BIOS</h4>

<p><em>EDIT: darc has created a <a href="https://dreamcast.wiki/32MB_RAM_expansion">Dreamshell image with 32MB-patched versions of many
BIOS images</a></em></p>

<p>I modified <a href="https://blog.japanese-cake.io/index.php/2016/06/20/release-custom-bootrom-v1-032/">v1.032 of japanese-cakes’ excellent Custom
BootROM</a>
(SHA1 ec42875983f33cefafe8616eb9152cf0172136ae) to use AMX 3.</p>

<p>The two values this BIOS uses to load the MCR are stored at addresses 0x005074
and 0x005078.  To modify the BIOS to use AMX 3 instead of AMX 4, use a hex
editor change these two bytes from 0x24:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>00005070: 1101 1101 240e 0a80 240e 0ac0 9001 94ff  ....$...$.......
                    ^^        ^^                                   
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To 0x1c:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>00005070: 1101 1101 1c0e 0a80 1c0e 0ac0 9001 94ff  ....$...$.......
                    ^^        ^^                                   
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The end result, an AMX 3 BIOS, should have SHA1 sum
cf64d6509aadde812500db0f7571fd51e0ff85bb.</p>

<p>Use Dreamshell to flash the AMX 3 BIOS.  You won’t be able to boot from the AMX
3 BIOS just yet.</p>

<h4 id="7-remove-the-motherboard-again-and-remove-the-wires-you-added-in-step-4">7. Remove the motherboard again and remove the wires you added in step 4</h4>

<p>Don’t skip over this step just because I don’t have anything more to say about
it.</p>

<h4 id="8-remap-pins-22-and-23-on-each-sdram">8. Remap pins 22 and 23 on each SDRAM</h4>

<p>On each SDRAM, lift pin 22, bend it to the right so that it touches pin 23, and
solder it to pin 23.  Also on each SDRAM, bend pin 21 to the right and solder
it to pad 22.</p>

<p>The result should be that pins 22 and 23 are soldered together, and pin 21
should be the only pin soldered to pad 22.</p>

<p>Here’s the finished IC102:</p>

pads to their right" height="50%" width="50%"></p>

<p>The finished IC103:</p>

<p>And a bird’s eye view of the finished product.  It’s difficult …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>This will be a 2 post guide, where we will scrape this website on <code>Page Title</code>, <code>URL</code> and <code>Tags</code>, for blog posts, then we will ingest this data into Elasticsearch. - <a href="">This Post</a></p>
<p>Once we have our data in Elasticsearch, we will build a Search Engine to search for these posts, the frontend will consist of Python Flask, Elasticsearch Library and HTML, which will be coverend in <a href="https://sysadmins.co.za/building-a-search-engine-for-our-scraped-data-on-elasticsearch-part-2/">Part 2</a></p>
<p><strong>Notice:</strong></p>
<p>Always ensure that you are scraping for the right reasons, in this example, I will use my own blog site as the target, and I won't be scraping the websites data, but only Page Title, URL and Tags, so that we have enough data for our search engine.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>For this example I am using Ubuntu 16.04, and we will need some dependencies to install for our Python Script:</p>
<pre><code>$ apt udpate &amp;&amp; apt upgrade -y
$ apt install python python-dev python-setuptools python-lxml openssl libssl-dev python-pip
$ pip install requests
$ pip install bs4
$ pip install elasticsearch
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Python Scraper:</strong></p>
<p>Here is our Python Scraper that will scrape the data from a <code>sitemap.xml</code> and ingest the data into Elasticsearch:</p>
<pre><code>import re
import time
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

es_client = Elasticsearch(['http://10.0.1.10:9200'])

drop_index = es_client.indices.create(index='blog-sysadmins', ignore=400)
create_index = es_client.indices.delete(index='blog-sysadmins', ignore=[400, 404])

def urlparser(title, url):
    # scrape title
    p = {}
    post = title
    page = requests.get(post).content
    soup = BeautifulSoup(page, 'lxml')
    title_name = soup.title.string

    # scrape tags
    tag_names = []
    desc = soup.findAll(attrs={"property":"article:tag"})
    for x in xrange(len(desc)):
        tag_names.append(desc[x-1]['content'].encode('utf-8'))

    # payload for elasticsearch
    doc = {
        'date': time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
        'title': title_name,
        'tags': tag_names,
        'url': url
    }

    # ingest payload into elasticsearch
    res = es_client.index(index="blog-sysadmins", doc_type="docs", body=doc)
    time.sleep(0.5)

sitemap_feed = 'https://sysadmins.co.za/sitemap-posts.xml'
page = requests.get(sitemap_feed)
sitemap_index = BeautifulSoup(page.content, 'html.parser')
urls = [element.text for element in sitemap_index.findAll('loc')]

for x in urls:
    urlparser(x, x)
</code></pre>
<p>This scraper will grab all the posts from the <code>sitemap.xml</code> then loop through each post, with the given logic, ingest the data into elasticsearch.</p>
<p><strong>Running the Python Scraper:</strong></p>
<pre><code>$ python scraper.py
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Verify Documents in Elasticsearch:</strong></p>
<p>After you have executed the python script, have a look at elasticsearch to confirm if the documents were ingested into Elasticsearch:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl http://10.0.1.10:9200/_cat/indices/scrape-sysadmins?v
health status index            uuid                   pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
green  open   blogs-sysadmins gyHONBcwTmaVjZVRj6dYew   5   1         80            0    289.6kb        144.8kb
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see we have ingested 80 documents, having a look at one of our documents:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl http://10.0.1.10:9200/blogs-sysadmins/_search?pretty -d '{"size": 1}'
{
  "took" : 5,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 5,
    "successful" : 5,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : 80,
    "max_score" : 1.0,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "blogs-sysadmins",
        "_type" : "docs",
        "_id" : "AV6j3bZEzCREvIW7N4yt",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "date" : "2017-09-21",
          "url" : "https://sysadmins.co.za/bash-script-setup-a-3-node-hadoop-cluster-on-lxc-containers/",
          "tags" : [
            "LXC",
            "Hadoop",
            "Scripting",
            "LXD"
          ],
          "title" : "Bash Script setup a 3 Node Hadoop Cluster on LXC Containers"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Next Steps:</strong></p>
<p>In my <a href="https://sysadmins.co.za/building-a-search-engine-for-our-scraped-data-on-elasticsearch-part-2/">next post</a>, I will guide you through the steps on setting up a Search User Interface that will be our search engine to search from blog posts that is stored in Elasticsearch.</p>
