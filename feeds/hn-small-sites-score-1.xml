            <p>“My language is better because it has a strong type system!” screams Dave, your colleague developer, trying to push the programming language Cobol for the next micro-service of your company.</p>
<p>Among developers, discussions about programming languages and their type systems can get quickly emotional. During these discussions, we often hear the words “type systems”, “data type”, “type inference”, “static typing”, “weak typing”, “coercion”, and more.</p>
<p>The goal of this article is to see the meaning of all these words with examples, for you to have good foundations and understand the type system of your favorite programming language. More precisely, we’ll see:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are types and why we need them.</li>
<li>When type checking occurs.</li>
<li>What are primitive types, composite types, and Abstract Data Types (ADT).</li>
<li>Type declaration and changing types can be implicit or explicit.</li>
<li>Types and functions.</li>
<li>What is type strength.</li>
<li>What is type safety.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll use two different languages to illustrate the ideas, Golang and PHP. If you don’t know them, don’t worry! The examples are straightforward and easy to understand.</p>
<p>I encourage you to use some <a href="https://repl.it/languages/php_cli" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PHP interpreter online</a> and the <a href="https://play.golang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go playground</a> while reading, to play and experiment by yourself. This will help you understand the different concepts.</p>
<p>I won’t go into the gory details here. As you’ll see, it’s difficult to generalize something which is specific to a programming language. Yet, this article will give you a good overview of the usual properties of most type systems.</p>
<p>We’ll go progressively from clear waters to the muddy ideas, so take your rubber boots, get ready for the swamp, and let’s go!</p>
<h2 id="whats-a-type">What’s a Type?</h2>

</picture>



<p>A type system is made of types. I know, it’s mind-blowing. These types are also called <em>data types</em>. What are they?</p>
<h3 id="syntax-and-semantics">Syntax and Semantics</h3>
<p>First, let’s clarify the difference between the <em>syntax</em> and the <em>semantics</em> of a programming language.</p>
<p>For example. the syntax of your mother tongue is the set of rules dictating the structure of the sentences. For many spoken languages, you’ll need a subject and a verb for your sentence to be correct. Programming languages have instead different constructs like <em>expressions</em>, <em>control structures</em>, or <em>statements</em>.</p>
<p>For example, for a <em>if</em> statement to be syntactically correct in PHP, you’ll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A condition.</li>
<li>Some parenthesis.</li>
<li>Some curly brackets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Something like that: <code>if (1 == 1) { echo "I knew it!"; }</code>.</p>
<p>The semantics, on the other hand, is the meaning behind the constructs. For example, the semantics of an <em>if</em> statement can be explained as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The condition is executed.</li>
<li>If the condition is true, the body of the statement is executed.</li>
<li>If the condition is false, the body of the statement is not executed.</li>
<li>The execution continues.</li>
</ol>
<p>Why do we need syntax and semantics? It’s meant to communicate with two different kinds of entities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your colleagues developers need to understand what the heck you did.</li>
<li>The computer needs to “understand” the instructions to execute them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="definition-of-a-type">Definition of a Type</h3>
<p>To come back to our subject, a type can attach semantics to data. For example, in PHP:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php</span>
<span>$integer</span><span>;</span>

<span>echo</span> <span>gettype</span><span>(</span><span>65</span><span>)</span> <span>.</span> <span>"</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>// =&gt; integer
</span><span></span>
<span>$integer</span> <span>=</span> <span>65</span><span>;</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>gettype</span><span>(</span><span>$integer</span><span>)</span> <span>.</span> <span>"</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>// =&gt; integer
</span></code></pre></div><p>In Mathematics, 65 is part of the set of integers, so PHP consider the value 65 as type integer. Your variable <code>$integer</code> has the value 65 too, so it’s an integer, too.</p>
<p>When you assign 65 to the variable <code>$integer</code>, you give it a semantics it didn’t have when we declared it, on the second line. This semantics will let you know what you can do with the variable.</p>
<p>We can conclude that:</p>
<ul>
<li>A type gives semantics to a piece of data.</li>
<li>A type is a set of value. For the type integer, it will be a range of decimals. For the type string, it will be a range of possible strings.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-types">Why Do We Need Types?</h2>
<h3 id="representation-and-semantics">Representation and Semantics</h3>
<p>When you declare a variable and assign it a value, the memory hold this value in <em>binary</em>. Our counting system is <em>decimal</em>, which means that the numbers we know and use everyday are very different in binary:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php</span>

<span>$integer</span> <span>=</span> <span>65</span><span>;</span> <span>// Decimal notation
</span><span></span>
<span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Binary notation of %d: %b </span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>$integer</span><span>,</span> <span>$integer</span><span>);</span>
<span>// =&gt; Binary notation of 65: 1000001 
</span></code></pre></div><p>Binary is just another way to represent numbers, <em>and only numbers</em>.</p>
<p>Dave, your colleague developer, is full of questions while reading these lines. “How does a character, such as ‘A’, is saved in memory?”, he wonders. “It’s not a number! It can’t be represented in binary!”.</p>
<p>Dave is right. The character has to be converted first into a decimal number, following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ASCII standards</a>. Then, this <em>ASCII code</em> is saved in memory.</p>
<p>Now, let’s try this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php</span>

<span>$integer</span> <span>=</span> <span>65</span><span>;</span>
<span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Binary representation: %b </span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>$integer</span><span>);</span>
<span>// =&gt; Binary representation: 1000001
</span><span></span>
<span>$character</span> <span>=</span> <span>'A'</span><span>;</span>
<span>$ascii</span> <span>=</span> <span>ord</span><span>(</span><span>'A'</span><span>);</span> <span>// Ascii code of 'A'.
</span><span></span><span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Ascii code: %d </span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>$ascii</span><span>);</span>
<span>// =&gt; Ascii code: 65
</span><span></span>
<span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Binary representation: %b </span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>$ascii</span><span>);</span>
<span>// =&gt; Binary representation: 1000001 
</span></code></pre></div><p>The integer 65 and the string ‘A’ have the same binary representation in memory!</p>
<p>Dave is confused. In despair, he asks the sky: “How the hell our program knows that <code>$integer</code> is equal to 65, and <code>$character</code> is equal to <code>'A</code>’? How?”. Indeed, in memory, the two values of <code>$character</code> and <code>$integer</code> are exactly the same: <code>1000001</code>. When we use these two variables in our code, the type system of our language will <em>interpret</em> the two values in memory, and it will decide what is a character and what is an integer.</p>
<p>This is important to understand, since this interpretation is not always accurate for some types, like floating point numbers.</p>
<p>A type will determine as well how you store a value in memory. For a character and an integer, we saw that they are stored the same way. The way to store floating point numbers, for example, is quite different.</p>
<p>The memory storage is nicely abstracted by the type system for us, developers, not to think about these confusing 0 and 1. You can then focus on more important problems, at least when the abstraction doesn’t leak. If you’re not sure what’s an abstraction, I wrote <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/abstraction-software-development/">a detailed article about it</a>.</p>
<h3 id="a-set-of-rules">A Set of Rules</h3>
<p>A type system is as well a set of rule, more or less strict. You can’t do everything you want with some types.</p>
<p>Let’s take another example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php</span>

<span>printf</span><span>((</span><span>3</span> <span>+</span> <span>"Hello World!"</span><span>)</span> <span>.</span> <span>"</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
<span>// =&gt; PHP Warning:  A non-numeric value encountered in /home/myusername/phpgoodies/test.php on line 3
</span><span>// =&gt; 3
</span><span></span>
<span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"The execution continue!"</span><span>);</span>
<span>// =&gt; The execution continue!
</span></code></pre></div><p>This code makes little sense. I try to reinvent Mathematics by adding the integer 3 to a string. PHP will throw a warning, but it will still give a result, <code>3</code>. When you violate the rules of a type system, the outcome can range between these two extremes:</p>
<ol>
<li>The interpreter or compiler will silently try to fix the problem and continue.</li>
<li>The interpreter or compiler will throw an error and stop.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the case of our example, PHP will throw a warning, but the execution will still continue. You can even get rid of the warning in the infamous <code>php.ini</code>.</p>
<p>To compare with another language, let’s take the exact same thing in Golang:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="golang"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> <span>(</span>
	<span>"fmt"</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>3</span> <span>+</span> <span>"Hello World"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>// =&gt; invalid operation: 3 + "Hello World" (mismatched types untyped int and untyped string)
</span><span></span>    <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>"The execution continue!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p><em><a href="https://play.golang.org/p/2JEY0GmHnYF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Playground</a></em></p>
<p>The compiler will grant you with an error and your program won’t even be compiled.</p>
<h2 id="built-in-types-vs-our-own-abstractions">Built-in Types vs Our Own Abstractions</h2>
<p>Programming languages, more often than not, have a whole set of types you can use, out of the box. These types are called <em>primitive types</em>. For example: <code>integer</code>, <code>boolean</code>, <code>float</code>, and more.</p>
<p>Often, you’ll be able to use as well <em>composite types</em>, a type containing multiple values, and possibly multiple primitive types. It’s what we call more commonly <em>data structures</em>.</p>
<p>For example, an array is a composite type:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php</span>

<span>$integerArray</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>];</span>
<span>$multipleTypeArray</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>"two"</span><span>,</span> <span>5.4</span><span>];</span>

</code></pre></div><p>The rules attached to these data types are imposed by the compiler (or the interpreter) of your language of choice.</p>
<p>Since the raise of the <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.136.3043&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abstract Data Types</a> (ADT), you have the power, in high level programming languages, to create your own types. For example, in PHP:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Shipment</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>function</span> <span>send</span><span>()</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>echo</span> <span>"Send powerful shipment!"</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>$shipment</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Shipment</span><span>();</span>
<span>$shipment</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>send</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div><p>When you write <code>$shipment = new Shipment()</code>, you create an instance of the class <code>Shipment</code>. The object <code>$shipment</code> can be considered as well of type <code>Shipment</code>.</p>
<p>When you think about it, a type can be seen as a set of possible values, a category, or a group. A class has the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/class" target="_blank" rel="noopener">same definition (see entry 3)</a>.</p>
<p>We can say as well that the object <code>$shipment</code> is an abstraction of its class, and its interface (the way you interact with the abstraction) is the method <code>send()</code>.</p>
<p>We created some rules for our new type:</p>
<ul>
<li>The only interface available is the method <code>send()</code>.</li>
<li>The method <code>send()</code> return a string, not an integer.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Golang, you don’t have classes, but you can create custom types, too:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="golang"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> <span>(</span>
	<span>"fmt"</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>type</span> <span>minute</span> <span>int</span>

<span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>m</span> <span>minute</span><span>)</span> <span>second</span><span>()</span> <span>int</span>  <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>int</span><span>(</span><span>m</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>60</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>var</span> <span>min</span> <span>minute</span>
	<span>min</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
	<span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"%d minutes are %d seconds"</span><span>,</span> <span>min</span><span>,</span> <span>min</span><span>.</span><span>second</span><span>())</span>
    <span>// 2 minutes are 120 seconds
</span><span></span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p><em><a href="https://play.golang.org/p/rm1aRW2vZip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Playground</a></em></p>
<p>In that case, the new type <code>minute</code> gets the same set of rules as the type <code>int</code>. Then, you can attach methods to this new type <code>minute</code>, like the method <code>second()</code>.</p>

<p>If types push us to respect some rules, a programming language need an algorithm to check if we respect them. This is called <em>type checking</em>.</p>
<p>Even if type systems can be very similar or very different, depending on the programming language, we are humans, so we need to group these disparate things in categories to understand them.</p>
<p>There are two important categories of type checking: <em>static type …</em></p></section></article></div></div>

Of course every product is different, and there are many more, but following the 80% rule I think most ideas can be caught with the following:</p><p data-reactid="66">First, look at the history of the product it's based upon or one it's similar to. Did it come out of an already huge company? If not, how did it evolve as it scaled? Did it keep roughly the same manifestation and business model, or did these change substantially? Be skeptical if so.</p><p data-reactid="67">Second, does it have network effects? These are obvious in B2C, less so in B2B. Be skeptical if you have a per-seat pricing model and your strategy is bottom-up expansion within organisations starting from a few accounts. Be extra skeptical if these accounts are free.</p><p data-reactid="68">Third, how synchronous and mission critical is it? Be skeptical if it going down would cause interruption to workflows that couldn't be worked around or deferred. Be incredibly skeptical if this is true round the clock and on weekends. That kind of service level implies significant and robust automation and support, which require scale.</p><p data-reactid="69">Fourth, how much does the business model depend on volume? Losing a bit of money on first customers as you bootstrap and learn is not an issue. Be skeptical, though, if this would need to be sustained to bootstrap your way to some required volume which is quite a way beyond those first few customers.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p><em>This article is part of a series on </em><a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/"><em>managing managers</em></a><em>.</em></p>



<p>I was flicking through my dusty copy of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0679762884/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=theengineerin-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0679762884&amp;linkId=55cbb1fa3c7f4f01825f17dd1de06990">High Output Management</a> recently and I was reminded of this fantastic piece of advice. On reflection, I’ve realized that I’ve been using this approach without explicitly remembering where I learned about it, so it was pleasant to be reminded of its provenance.</p>



<p>A common route for a manager to become a <em>manager of managers</em> is through rapid growth in the size of a company. This can happen because of venture capital investment, through mergers or acquisitions, or, if you’re lucky, through good old organic growth.</p>



<p>During these periods of time, more engineers get hired into existing teams in order to get things moving faster. However, there’s a limit to the number of direct reports that any given manager can reliably have, and the rule of thumb is usually around 5-8, depending on who you ask, and on the preferences of the person doing the managing. When thinking about the limit, you can sometimes replace a direct report with a major initiative, such as being part of a project, guild or committee, if you’re thinking about how to balance your effort between individual contribution and people management.</p>



<h2>Splitting the atom</h2>



<p>So, what tends to happen when a manager starts to get too many direct reports? Well, the answer is usually quite straightforward: try to split the team in order to create two smaller teams. That makes a lot of sense. So what might happen next? Well, our manager could create two smaller teams and promote or hire two new Engineering Managers (EMs) to run those teams, reporting to them. It might look something like this.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/m_eKv80I74rQrmic1Y2gBT6GBoWa5svTX1oJ-z9fm5LYy5kO9EPaBTdZ1DmBDfCYj0p1DPKAbn3uejgJksPyQsb_NAv-RwMDLpgHK0sgBkd1kDWoKkF3oTZc7J8ppUZSheEq-V-K" alt=""></figure>



<p>But wait! This is actually quite bad. Why?</p>



<ul><li><strong>Our new Director of Engineering has made themselves redundant.</strong> By going from managing too many people to just 2, they’ve delegated all of their responsibility without the existence of other impactful activities that they can fill their time with. They’ve entered <em>on the job retirement.</em> It’s not a good place to be in, especially in the future if there are cuts or redundancies on horizon.</li><li><strong>They have no way of getting involved with their teams effectively.</strong> Either they’re going to have to work very closely with the teams – which would be <em>meddling</em>, since they already have EMs running those teams – or they’re going to have to stay quite far away, which means that they can’t have much impact other than coaching the two EMs.</li></ul>



<p>Assuming growth doesn’t continue indefinitely, our Director of Engineering is going to find themselves bored, frustrated or leaving the company – or even all three! What can they do?</p>



<h2>A better solution</h2>



<p>In order to not make themselves redundant, the manager that is splitting the team should instead promote or hire one EM to run one of the sub-teams, then <em>run the other team themselves</em> by <em>acting</em> as the EM even though they’ve moved up into a Director of Engineering role. That would look something like this.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/w8fbDxpLaSn8MEt7vW7nVcP806J2LC2DNNZooGPD3HxX_-LbYYck0I6ybq9wB5Z54l0oRDXgi_J8bH6-PlStVVIMutb7xf4tVjZDwhP-59vqgQKumna5Ju0c6zo0Eb8DCRfiPlw7" alt=""></figure>



<p>This is much better! What it means is:</p>



<ul><li><strong>The Director of Engineering still has enough direct reports to remain productive and impactful.</strong> In the example above, assuming the new EM was promoted, they’ve gone from 9 direct reports to 5 – from around the maximum to the minimum – whilst still having the responsibility of running one team themselves.</li><li><strong>By</strong> <strong><em>acting</em></strong><strong> as an Engineering Manager, it doesn’t cause imbalance in the org chart.</strong> By representing the role as “<em>acting as”, </em>the org chart looks like two teams reporting to two EMs, rather than one team being demoted a layer beneath another one. This keeps everyone happy.</li><li><strong>Our new manager of managers only has to ramp up one new manager at a time, rather than two.</strong> It’s hard enough to do just one, after all. This means that the right time and energy can be devoted to the task, whilst giving one of the teams their familiar, existing manager.</li></ul>



<p>Although this approach may seem like common sense, it’s surprising just how many times you see the initial, bad pattern happening in growing organizations. It introduces way too much change at once, resulting in too many new managers needing to learn the ropes at a given time and thus disrupting multiple teams, and encourages bad managerial behaviours such as meddling and on the job retirement. The latter is most worrisome, since your emerging leader may begin pushing themselves out of the organization.</p>



<p>By adopting the second pattern instead, you get smoother transitions during growth phases and better retention of momentum when teams split, and most importantly, if you’re the manager doing the splitting, you stay needed, impactful and productive.</p>

The meta-information in a Java JAR file - the manifest - follows a proprietary format. But Java EE designers built it from the ground up on XML: meta-information of all artifacts is in XML format <em>e.g.</em> <code>web.xml</code>, <code>ejb-jar.xml</code>, <code>application.xml</code>, etc.</p> <p>Java EE is one example I experienced personally. But XML was everywhere in the enterprise world at the time. Its prevalence manifested itself in two areas: configuration and data transfer.</p> <p>Ever since then, it would be an euphemism to say XML has been losing in popularity. Other formats, such as JSON and YAML, have replaced it in the hearts of developers. In this post, I’d like to:</p> <ul><li><span>Explore some of the reasons why the mighty XML has fallen</span></li><li><span>Raise some downsides of the popular alternatives</span></li><li><span>And describe how XML already solved those problems</span></li></ul> <div> <h2 id="the-downfall-of-xml">The downfall of XML</h2> <div> <p>I think there are several reasons that led to the downfall of XML. It’s not a single one, but the conjunction of them that led to the current state.</p> <div> <h3 id="associated-with-enterprise">Associated with "Enterprise"</h3> <p>I’m afraid the worst flaw of XML is its close association with the enterprise world. As everybody knows, Enterprise is notoriously bad - by definition: bloated, heavy, not nimble, etc. And yes, that’s sarcasm if you wondered.</p> <p>In general, perception trumps truth. Developers are no different in that regard. In the end, that’s how Hype-Driven Developers - and most developers, perceive XML nowadays.</p> </div> <div> <h3 id="lack-of-integration-with-front-end">Lack of integration with front-end</h3> <p>One of the main usages of XML was in the realm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOAP web services</a>. Let’s be frank about it: the ease of consuming those web services from JavaScript and/or the browser is not spectacular.</p> <p>It' no wonder that JavaScript Object Notation, <em>aka</em> JSON became a <em>de facto</em> standard. JSON brought <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REST</a> along with it. As its name implies, JSON is JavaScript native, while XML is not.</p> </div> <div> <h3 id="steep-first-steps">Steep first steps</h3> <p>JSON is quite easy to start with, YAML even more so. Even with bare XML, one has the concept of namespaces, which are not beginner-friendly. XML allows one document to use elements from different namespaces. On the flip side, it makes designing simple documents more complicated.</p> <p>XML has a lot of powerful features, but all this power can be confusing to beginners. I willingly admit that they make easy things more complex than they should.</p> </div> <div> <h3 id="performance">Performance</h3> <p>I’ve stumbled upon the performance "argument" a couple of time. This is usually "proven" by using a sample describing the same in XML, JSON and YAML. Because of its opening <strong>and</strong> closing tags, the writer shows that XML is quite noisy compared to the other two.</p> <p>IMHO, this argument is shallow, as all 3 formats are text-based. Thus, you can - and should - compress files. Parsing might be a bit slower, but it depends a lot on the exact parser (and the associated technology stack). In the end, the overhead of transmitting and parsing in XML - if any - is negligible compared to the total time in the whole use-case.</p> <p>People who favor YAML over JSON use the same reasoning: less characters.</p> </div> <div> <h3 id="abuse">Abuse</h3> <p>The above reasons are more or less congruent with XML. Yet, I’m more than willing to admit architects have been abusing XML. I’ve personally seen SOAP webservices with payload in the order of several megabytes. At that time, you might imagine the performance of such design was not stellar.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="failings-of-alternatives">Failings of alternatives</h2> <div> <p>JSON, YAML &amp; al. all have their own failings. Here’s a sample of them:</p> <ul><li><span>JSON has no comments. The most usual fallback is to use the <code>"_comment"</code> property.</span><div> <div> <pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"foo"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"_comment"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"My important comment"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"bar"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span></code></pre> </div> </div></li><li><span>YAML has no governing body. Individuals manage the specification.</span></li><li><span>YAML has <strong>22 ways to write booleans</strong> - no less!</span></li></ul> <div> <div> <div> <blockquote> <p>Anyone who uses YAML long enough will eventually get burned when attempting to abbreviate Norway.</p> </blockquote>  </div> </div> </div> <div> <div><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>YAML is to config syntaxes what Python is to programming languages.

Issues arise when the provider changes the data format:</p> <ol><li><span>How to make clients aware that the format changed?</span></li><li><span>What information to communicate to the client about the format change?</span></li><li><span>How to keep validation synchronized across clients?</span></li></ol> <p>XML has this issue solved since the beginning by providing a <strong>grammar</strong>. A grammar plays the same role for a XML document as constraints and types in a SQL database. The most important difference is that you can externalize the grammar.</p> <p>Several XML grammar implementations are available: <a href="https://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec-report-19980910.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Document Type Definition</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XML Schema</a>, <a href="https://relaxng.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Relax NG</a>, etc. The most widespread one is XML Schema. Since a XML Schema is also written in XML format, a web server can host it. Then you can reference it by a publicly-accessible URL.</p> <p>This approach solves the above issues: when a client receives an XML document, the former looks at the XML Schema URL. It can then fetch it, and check that the data conforms to the schema.</p> <p>Changing the data format is as simple as versioning the XML Schema file, and publishing it under a new URL.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="other-benefits-of-xml">Other benefits of XML</h2> <div> <p>In this section, I’d like to list a couple of benefits of using XML.</p> <div> <dl> <dt>Public open stewardship</dt> <dd> <p>XML is not under the stewardship of a single person or a company, but of a <abbr title="Non-Governmental Organization">NGO</abbr>, namely the <a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">W3C</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I started reading <a href="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/">Node.js Design Patterns</a> this week. I got the Third Edition, and have not spent any time looking into what's changed from prior editions. The first 6 chapters cover fundamental knowledge, before getting into the meaty named Design Patterns, so these notes are from that first "half" of the book.</p>
<section>
  <h2 id="1-libuv-and-the-reactor-pattern"><a href="#1-libuv-and-the-reactor-pattern">1. <code>libuv</code> and the Reactor Pattern</a></h2>
  <p><code>libuv</code> is something I've often heard about as a low level Node.js library, but now I have a glimpse of what it does for us. As the book says:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Libuv represents the low-level I/O engine of Node.js and is probably the most important component that Node.js is built on. Other than abstracting the underlying system calls, libuv also implements <strong>the reactor pattern</strong>, thus providing an API for creating event loops, managing the event queue, running asynchronous I/O operations, and queuing other types of task.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern">Reactor pattern</a>, together with demultiplexing, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ">event queues and the event loop</a>, is core to how this works - a tightly coordinated dance of feeding async events into a single queue, executing them as resources free up, and then popping them off the event queue to call callbacks given by user code.</p>

<section>
  <h2 id="2-module-design-patterns"><a href="#2-module-design-patterns">2. Module Design Patterns</a></h2>
  <p>I am superficially familiar with the differences between CommonJS modules and ES Modules. But I liked the explicit elaboration of 5 module definition patterns in CommonJS:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Named exports: <code>exports.foo = () =&gt; {}</code></li>
    <li>Exporting a function: <code>module.exports = () =&gt; {}</code></li>
    <li>Exporting a class: <code>module.exports = class Foo() {}</code></li>
    <li>Exporting an instance: <code>module.exports = new Foo()</code> which is <em>like</em> a singleton, except when it is not because of multiple instances of the same module.</li>
    <li>Monkey patching other modules (useful for <a href="https://github.com/nock/nock">nock</a>)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In ES Modules, I enjoyed the explanation of "read-only live bindings", which will look weird to anyone who has never seen it and has always treated modules as stateless chunks of code:</p>
  <pre><code><span>// counter.js</span>
<span>export</span><span> </span><span>let</span><span> count </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span>
<span>export</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>increment</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>   </span><span>count</span><span>++</span><span> </span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// main.js</span>
<span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>count</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>increment</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>./counter.js</span><span>'</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(count) </span><span>// prints 0</span>
<span>increment</span><span>()</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(count) </span><span>// prints 1</span>
<span>count</span><span>++</span><span> </span><span>// TypeError: Assignment to constant variable!</span>
</code></pre>
  <p>This mutable module internal state pattern is endemic in <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1221586490674696193?s=20">Svelte and Rich Harris' work</a> and I enjoy how simple it makes code look. I don't know if there are scalability issues with this pattern but so far it seems to work fine for ES Modules people.</p>
  <p>The last important topic I enjoyed was ESM and CJS interop issues. <code>ESM</code> doesn't offer <code>require</code>, <code>__filename</code> or <code>__dirname</code>, so you have to reconstruct them if needed:</p>
  <pre><code><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>fileURLToPath</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>url</span><span>'</span>
<span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>dirname</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>path</span><span>'</span>
<span>const</span><span> __filename </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>fileURLToPath</span><span>(</span><span>import</span><span>.</span><span>meta</span><span>.</span><span>url) </span>
<span>const</span><span> __dirname </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>dirname</span><span>(__filename)</span>

<span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>createRequire</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>module</span><span>'</span>
<span>const</span><span> require </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>createRequire</span><span>(</span><span>import</span><span>.</span><span>meta</span><span>.</span><span>url)</span>
</code></pre>
  <p>ESM also cannot natively import JSON, as of the time of writing, whereas CJS does. You can work around this with the <code>require</code> function from above:</p>
  <pre><code><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>createRequire</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>module</span><span>'</span>
<span>const</span><span> require </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>createRequire</span><span>(</span><span>import</span><span>.</span><span>meta</span><span>.</span><span>url) </span>
<span>const</span><span> data </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>./data.json</span><span>'</span><span>) </span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(data)</span>
</code></pre>

  <p>APIs are usually either sync or async in Node.js, but TIL you can design APIs that are <em>both</em>:</p>
  <pre><code><span>function</span><span> </span><span>createFileReader</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>filename</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>listeners</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> [] </span>
<span>  </span><span>inconsistentRead</span><span>(</span><span>filename</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>value</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>listeners</span><span>.</span><span>forEach</span><span>(</span><span>listener</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>listener</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)) </span>
<span>  </span><span>}</span><span>)</span>
<span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>onDataReady</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>listener</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>listeners</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>listener</span><span>) </span>
<span>  </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
  <p>This looks innocent enough, except when you use it as async and then sync:</p>
  <pre><code><span>const</span><span> reader1 </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>createFileReader</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>data.txt</span><span>'</span><span>)  </span><span>// async</span>
<span>reader1</span><span>.</span><span>onDataReady</span><span>(data </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>   </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`</span><span>First call: </span><span>${</span><span>data</span><span>}`</span><span>)</span>
<span>   </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>reader2</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>createFileReader</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>data.txt</span><span>'</span><span>)  </span><span>// sync</span>
<span>   </span><span>reader2</span><span>.</span><span>onDataReady</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>     </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`</span><span>Second call: </span><span>${</span><span>data</span><span>}`</span><span>) </span>
<span>   </span><span>}</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span>
<span>// only outputs First call - never outputs Second call</span>
</code></pre>
  <p>This is because module caching in Node makes the first call async and the second call sync. <a href="https://blog.izs.me/2013/08/designing-apis-for-asynchrony">izs famously called this "releasing Zalgo"</a> in a blogpost.</p>
  <p>You can keep Zalgo caged up by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>using direct style functions for synchronous APIs (instead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style">Continuation Passing Style</a>)</li>
    <li>make I/O purely async by only using async APIs, using CPS, and deferring synchronous memory reads by using <code>process.nextTick()</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The same line of thinking can also be done for EventEmitter Observers as it is for Callbacks.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Callbacks should be used when a result must be returned in an asynchronous way, while events should be used when there is a need to communicate that something has happened.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>You can combine both the Observer and Callback patterns, for example with the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob"><code>glob</code> package</a> which takes both a callback for its simplier, critical functionality and a <code>.on</code> for advanced events.</p>
  <p>A note on ticks and microtasks:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>process.nextTick</code> sets up a microtask, which executes just after the current operation and before any other I/O</li>
    <li>whereas <code>setImmediate</code> runs after ALL I/O events have been processed.</li>
    <li><code>process.nextTick</code> executes earlier, but runs the risk of I/O [starvation] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation_(computer_science)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation_(computer_science)</a>) if takes too long.</li>
    <li><code>setTimeout(callback, 0)</code> is yet another phase behind <code>setImmediate</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="4-managing-async-and-limiting-concurrency-with-async"><a href="#4-managing-async-and-limiting-concurrency-with-async">4. Managing Async and Limiting Concurrency with <code>async</code></a></h2>
  <p>It's easy to spawn race conditions and accidentally launch unlimited parallel execution bringing down the server, with Node.js. The <a href="https://github.com/caolan/async">Async</a> library gives battle tested utilities for defining and executing these issues, in particular, queues that offer limited concurrency.</p>
  <p>The book steps you through 4 versions of a simple web spider program to develop the motivations for requiring managing async processes and describe the subtle issues that present themselves at scale. I honestly cant do it justice, I didn't want to just copy out all the versions and discussions of the web spider project as that is a significant chunk of the book, you're just gonna have to read thru these chapters yourself.</p>

  <h2 id="5-streams"><a href="#5-streams">5. Streams</a></h2>
  <p>I've often commented that <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1201528574236217345">Streams are the best worst kept secret of Node.js</a>. Time to learn them. Streams are more memory and CPU efficient than full buffers, but they are also more <em>composable</em>.</p>
  <p>Each stream is an instance of <code>EventEmitter</code>, streaming either binary chunks or discrete objects. Node offers <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_api_for_stream_consumers">4 base abstract stream classes</a>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>Readable</code> (where you can read in <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_two_reading_modes">flowing (push) or paused (pull) mode</a>)</li>
    <li><code>Writable</code> - you're probably familiar with <code>res.write()</code> from Node's <code>http</code> module</li>
    <li><code>Duplex</code>: both readable and writable</li>
    <li><code>Transform</code>: a special duplex stream with two other methods: <code>_transform</code> and <code>_flush</code>, for data transformation</li>
    <li><code>PassThrough</code>: a <code>Transform</code> stream that doesnt do any transformation - useful for observability or to implement late piping and lazy stream patterns.</li>
  </ul>
  <pre><code><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>PassThrough</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>stream</span><span>'</span>
<span>let</span><span> bytesWritten </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span>
<span>const</span><span> monitor </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>PassThrough</span><span>() </span>
<span>monitor</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>data</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>chunk</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>  </span><span>bytesWritten</span><span> </span><span>+=</span><span> </span><span>chunk</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span> </span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span>
<span>monitor</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>finish</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span>
<span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`${</span><span>bytesWritten</span><span>}</span><span> bytes written</span><span>`</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span>
<span>monitor</span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Hello!</span><span>'</span><span>) monitor</span><span>.</span><span>end</span><span>()</span>

<span>// usage</span>
<span>createReadStream</span><span>(filename)</span>
<span> </span><span>.</span><span>pipe</span><span>(</span><span>createGzip</span><span>())</span>
<span> </span><span>.</span><span>pipe</span><span>(monitor) </span><span>// passthrough stream!</span>
<span> </span><span>.</span><span>pipe</span><span>(</span><span>createWriteStream</span><span>(</span><span>`${</span><span>filename</span><span>}</span><span>.gz</span><span>`</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre>
  <p>izs recommends <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/minipass">minipass</a> which implement a PassThrough stream with some better features. Other useful stream utils:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/maxogden/mississippi">https://github.com/maxogden/mississippi</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/streamx">https://www.npmjs.com/package/streamx</a></li>
    <li>You can make streams lazy (create proxies for streams, so the stream instance isn't until some piece of code is consuming) with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/lazystream">lazystream</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Although the authors do recommend that piping and error handling be best organized with the native <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_stream_pipeline_source_transforms_destination_callback">stream.pipeline</a> function.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <h2><span>Overview</span></h2>
<p>Starting September 27, Zoom will require that all meetings have a Passcode or a Waiting Room enabled for accounts with a single licensed user, Pro accounts with 2 or more licenses, and Business accounts with 10-100 licenses. For more information, contact your Customer Success Manager or <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_self">Zoom support</a>. You’re in control of your meeting security selections, and we have designed the options with security and ease of use in mind.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Meeting passwords (passcodes) are already <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360042647952" target="_self">enforced for all free accounts</a>. F<span>or Zoom for Government accounts with fewer than 100 licenses</span>, Passcodes or Waiting Rooms will be required on October 18, 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span>Frequently asked questions</span></h2>
<p><strong>What is the difference between a Password and a Passcode?</strong><br>As part of this change, we are making the distinction of calling the codes that are unique to your meetings “Passcodes” and will no longer be referring to them as “Passwords.” Passcodes are meant to be shared with your invited meeting participants along with the meeting ID for access.</p>
<p>“Passwords” will refer to your Zoom account login credentials. Best practice security guidelines tell users to never share passwords.</p>
<p><strong>What if I don’t have a Waiting Room or Passcode enabled by September 27?<br></strong>If neither is enabled, Zoom will enable a Waiting Room for your meetings.</p>
<p><strong>How will this affect Zoom for Government customers?</strong><br>Zoom for Government customers with fewer than 100 licenses will be required to have a Passcode or Waiting Room enabled on October 18, 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If I already have a Passcode or Waiting Room enabled, will anything change?</strong><br>No, your settings will remain the same for your current selection. You or your administrator can change your security preference at any time.</p>
<p><strong>How will this affect my calendar invitations when scheduling meetings?</strong><br>If you already have a Passcode or Waiting Room on, there will be no change to how you schedule meetings.</p>
<p>If Passcodes are added to existing meetings, calendar invites need to be resent to include the Passcode. If Passcodes are added to new meetings, the Passcode will automatically be embedded into the meeting link (unless you have specifically disabled this feature)</p>
<p>Enabling Waiting Room for new or existing meetings does not affect calendar invitations.</p>
<p><strong>What are Waiting Rooms and how do they work?</strong><br>The Waiting Room feature allows the host to control when a participant joins the meeting by placing participants in a Waiting Room prior to joining the session. It is recommended that you review your Waiting Room selections and <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/202828525" target="_self">options for ‘join before host</a>’ (not pictured) and which participants to place in the Waiting Room.<br><img src="https://assets.zoom.us/images/en-us/web/account-management/account-settings/waiting-room.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For a detailed overview of how to allow domains to bypass the Waiting Room and other Waiting Room features, <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000332726" target="_self">please see this support article</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How do I enable Waiting Rooms or Passcodes?</strong><br>Admins and users can log into their Zoom web portal and go into settings to enable a Passcode or Waiting Room at the account level.<br>If choosing to enable Passcodes on your account see this detailed <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360033559832" target="_self">support article</a>. <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: If you add Passcodes to an existing meeting, calendar invites will need to be resent to include the Passcode.<br>If choosing to enable Waiting Rooms on your account see this <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000332726" target="_self">support article</a>.</p>
<p>If choosing to enable Waiting Rooms at the meeting level, you can either start the meeting and use the <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360041848151" target="_self">in meeting security controls</a> to enable a Waiting Room or if Waiting Rooms have been enabled on your account, edit the individual meeting to add a Waiting Room.</p>
<p><strong>How will Passcodes affect participants joining the meeting via web, desktop or mobile client?</strong><br>If you have selected Passcodes as your security method, a Passcode will be embedded into the meeting link automatically (unless you have specifically disabled this feature). With a single click, your meeting participants can join the meeting. If someone manually enters the meeting ID, they will also need to manually enter the Passcode.</p>
<p><strong>How will Passcodes affect participants joining the meeting by phone?</strong><br>Your security selection for meetings will not affect phone Passcode requirements unless you select “Require a Passcode when joining by phone.”</p>
<p><strong>How will Waiting Rooms affect participants joining the meeting by phone?</strong><br>For meetings with Waiting Rooms, participants will dial in as they normally do. They will hear a prompt that they are in the Waiting Room and the host will have to admit them.</p>
<p><strong>How will Waiting Rooms affect the host joining the meeting by phone?</strong><br>If the meeting has Waiting Rooms enabled and ‘join before host’ is disabled, then the host will be able to start the meeting and disable the Waiting Room by entering their host key. The host will hear audio prompts indicating that the Waiting Room has been disabled, all attendees will be admitted, and they can lock or unlock the meeting by pressing * 5.</p>
<p><strong>How will Passcodes affect participants joining the meeting with Conference Room Connector (CRC)?<br></strong>For SIP/H.323 devices managed by Conference Room Connector, if you’ve selected Passcodes, the Passcode is automatically embedded into the meeting information and one-touch join calendar meeting link (unless this feature is specifically disabled). Participants will see the meeting listed in the CRC and simply click to join.</p>
<p>For unmanaged SIP/H.323 devices as well as instant meetings, users will be prompted to enter the Passcode.</p>
<p><strong>How will Waiting Rooms affect participants joining the meeting with a Conference Room Connector (CRC)?</strong><br>If you’ve selected Waiting Rooms as your security method, participants joining the meeting via SIP/H.323 devices will be placed in the Waiting Room until you admit them. You can <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000332726" target="_self">customize who is put in the Waiting Room</a> in your settings.</p>
<p><strong>How will Passcodes affect participants joining my meeting with Zoom Rooms?</strong><br>If you’ve selected Passcodes - Zoom Rooms and controllers running versions 4.5.0 or higher that have calendar integration and “Bypass the Passcode when joining meetings from meeting list” enabled can join a meeting from the meeting list, without needing to manually enter the meeting Passcode.</p>
<p>If you’ve selected Passcodes and room participants join by entering the meeting ID, they will be asked for a Passcode before entering the meeting and will need to manually enter it.</p>
<p><strong>How will Waiting Rooms affect participants joining my meeting with Zoom Rooms?</strong><br>If you’ve selected Waiting Rooms as your security method, participants joining the meeting via Zoom Rooms will be placed in the Waiting Room until you admit them. You can <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000332726" target="_self">customize who is put in the Waiting Room</a> in your settings.</p>
<p><strong>How do these changes affect Webinars?</strong><br>There is no change with the September 27 release. Passcodes are already enabled by default for Webinars, but admins and users have the ability to disable passcodes for Webinars.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if my administrator locks the Passcode for existing meetings?</strong><br>For existing meetings, a Passcode will automatically be generated and applied to every meeting, and your existing invitations need to be resent to include the new Passcodes.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if my administrator locks the Passcode for new meetings?</strong><br>For new meetings, a Passcode will automatically be generated and applied to every new meeting and invitation.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if my administrator locks the Waiting Room?</strong><br>A Waiting Room will be added to all meetings. You will have to admit guests into the meeting from the Waiting Room. You can <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000332726" target="_self">customize who is put in the Waiting Room</a> in your settings, unless your administrator has locked that capability.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if my administrator locks both Waiting Room and Passcode?</strong><br>For existing meetings, a Passcode and Waiting Room will be enforced on all meetings. The Passcode will automatically be embedded into the meeting link, and existing invitations need to be resent to include the new Passcode. Meeting participants who cannot bypass the Waiting Room based on your settings will have to wait to be admitted into the meeting. You can&nbsp;<a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000332726" target="_self">customize who is put in the Waiting Room</a> in your settings.</p>
<p>For new meetings, a Passcode and Waiting Room will be enforced on all meetings. The Passcode will automatically be embedded into the meeting link, and included in your meeting information. Meeting participants who cannot bypass the Waiting Room based on your settings will have to wait to be admitted into the meeting. You can&nbsp;<a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000332726" target="_self">customize who is put in the Waiting Room</a> in your settings.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if my admin locks a selection?</strong><br>You cannot disable your admin’s selection. This feature has not changed.</p>
<p><strong>Can I see which of my meetings have Waiting Rooms or Passcodes enabled?</strong><br>Yes. Users can log into their web portal, and in the “Meetings” tab see a list of meetings that have been scheduled without a Passcode. This is indicated with a red warning icon.<br><img src="https://assets.zoom.us/images/en-us/web/my-meetings/denotes-no-password.png" width="172" height="29"></p>
<p><strong>How can I configure approved domains for the Waiting Room bypass feature?</strong><br>Unless your admin has locked the Waiting Room settings,&nbsp;<span>you can</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000332726" target="_self">c<span>onfigure a list of approved domains, whose users can bypass the </span><span>Waiting Room</span></a>&nbsp;here.</p>
<h2>For admins</h2>
<p><strong>Will my Passcode/Waiting Room selection affect all users?</strong><br>Yes. You can define a default setting at the account or group level. This will impact new meetings for those users but they can still customize the setting on a user or meeting level. You can lock a setting if you'd like all future and previously scheduled meetings to have a particular setting. All meetings must have either a Passcode or Waiting Room, so if a meeting has neither, Zoom will enable a Waiting Room.</p>
<p><strong>Can I see which meetings on my account currently have Waiting Rooms or Passcodes enabled? </strong><br>Yes. Admins of paid accounts can find meetings that are scheduled without a Passcode by <a href="https://zoom.us/account/report/meetingdetails/list" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pulling the following report</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Can I lock my selection for all users? For only certain users?</strong><br>Yes, you can lock at the account or group level. <strong>Note</strong>: if you are making a selection that you want to apply to all your users meetings, you must lock the setting.</p>
<p><strong>What if I don’t lock my selection?</strong><br>Users can change their settings to enable either Passcodes, Waiting Rooms, or both. All meetings must have a Passcode or Waiting …</p></div></div>

<p><a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2020/Dates">Accept-or-reject decisions for the NeurIPS 2020</a>&nbsp;conference are out, with 9454 submissions and 1900 accepted papers (20% acceptance rate). Congratulations to everyone (regardless of acceptance decision) for their hard work in doing good research!</p><p>It's common knowledge among machine learning (ML) researchers that acceptance decisions at NeurIPS and other conferences are something of a weighted dice roll. In this silly theatre we call "Academic Publishing"&nbsp; -- a mostly disjoint concept from <i>research</i>&nbsp;by the way --,&nbsp; reviews are all over the place because each reviewer favors different things in ML papers. Here are some criteria that a reviewer might care about:&nbsp;</p><p><b>Correctness:&nbsp;</b>This is the bare minimum for a scientific paper. Are the claims made in the paper scientifically correct? Did the authors take care not to train on the test set? If an algorithm was proposed, do the authors convincingly show that it works for the reasons they stated?&nbsp;</p><p><b>New Information:</b>&nbsp;Your paper has to contribute&nbsp;<i>new</i>&nbsp;knowledge to the field. This can take the form of a new algorithm, or new experimental data, or even just a different way of explaining an existing concept. Even survey papers should contain some nuggets of new information, such as a holistic view unifying several independent works.</p><p><b>Proper Citations:&nbsp;</b>a&nbsp;related work section that articulates connections to prior work and why your work is novel. Some reviewers will reject papers that don't tithe prior work adequately, or isn't sufficiently distinguished from it.</p><p><b>SOTA results:</b>&nbsp;It's common to see reviewers demand that papers (1) propose a new algorithm and (2)&nbsp; achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) on a benchmark.&nbsp;</p><p><b>More than "Just SOTA":&nbsp;</b>No reviewer will penalize you for achieving SOTA, but some expect more than just beating the benchmark, such as one or more of the criteria in this list. Some reviewers go as far as to bash the "SOTA-chasing" culture of the field, which they deem to be "not very creative" and "incremental".&nbsp;</p><p><b>Simplicity:&nbsp;</b>Many researchers profess to favor "simple ideas". However, the difference between "<i>your&nbsp;</i>simple idea" and "<i>your </i>trivial extension&nbsp;to someone else's simple idea" is not always so obvious.</p><p><b>Complexity: </b>Some reviewers deem papers that don't present any new methods or fancy math proofs as "trivial" or "not rigorous".</p><p><b>Clarity &amp; Understanding:&nbsp;</b>Some reviewers care about the mechanistic details of proposed algorithms and furthering <i>understanding </i>of ML<i>, </i>not just achieving better results. This is closely related to "Correctness".</p><p><b>Is it "Exciting"?:&nbsp;</b>Julian Togelius (AC for NeurIPS '20)&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/togelius/status/1309711892798205957?s=20">mentions</a>&nbsp;that many papers he chaired were simply not very exciting. Only Julian can know what he deems "exciting", but I suppose he means having "good taste" in choosing research problems and solutions.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--qbza-nVoCM/X2_u3yLjNcI/AAAAAAAAdic/j8JWkNElZhkMihQhjtthZkPxwDF_3tbRwCNcBGAsYHQ/s836/Capture2.PNG"><img data-original-height="836" data-original-width="579" height="640" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--qbza-nVoCM/X2_u3yLjNcI/AAAAAAAAdic/j8JWkNElZhkMihQhjtthZkPxwDF_3tbRwCNcBGAsYHQ/w445-h640/Capture2.PNG" width="445"></a></p><p><b>Sufficiently Hard Problems</b>: Some reviewers reject papers for evaluating on datasets that are too simple, like MNIST. "Sufficiently hard" is a moving goal post, with the implicit expectation that as the field develops better methods the benchmarks have to get harder to push unsolved capabilities. Also, SOTA methods on simple benchmarks are not always SOTA on harder benchmarks that are closer to real world applications. Thankfully my&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01144">most cited paper</a>&nbsp;was written at a time where it was still acceptable to publish on MNIST.</p><p><b>Is it Surprising? </b>Even if a paper demonstrates successful results, a reviewer might claim that they are unsurprising or "obvious". For example, papers applying standard object recognition techniques to a novel dataset might be argued to be "too easy and straightforward" given that the field expects supervised object recognition to be mostly solved (this is not really true, but the benchmarks don't reflect that).&nbsp;</p><p>I really enjoy papers that defy intuitions, and I personally strive to write surprising papers.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of my favorite papers in this category&nbsp;do not achieve SOTA&nbsp;or propose any new algorithms at all:</p><ol><li><a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkfMWhAqYQ">Approximating CNNs with Bag-of-local-Features models works surprisingly well on ImageNet</a></li><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530">Understanding Deep Learning Requires Rethinking Generalization</a>.</li><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08505.pdf">A Metric Learning Reality Check</a></li><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12359">Challenging Common Assumptions in the Unsupervised Learning of Disentangled Representations</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02774">Adversarial Spheres</a></li></ol><p><b>Is it Real? </b>Closely related to "sufficiently hard problems". Some reviewers think that games are a good testbed to study RL, while others (typically from the classical robotics community) think that <a href="https://gym.openai.com/envs/Ant-v2/">Mujoco Ant</a>&nbsp;and a real robotic quadruped are entirely different problems; algorithmic comparisons on the former tell us nothing about the same set of experiments on the latter.</p><p><b>Does Your Work Align with Good AI Ethics? </b>Some view the development of ML technology as a means to build a better society, and discourage papers that don't align with their AI ethics. The required "Broader Impact" statements in NeurIPS submissions this year are an indication that the field is taking this much more seriously. For example, if you submit a paper that attempts to infer criminality from only facial features or perform autonomous weapon targeting, I think it's likely your paper will be rejected regardless of what methods you develop.</p><p>Different reviewers will prioritize different aspects of the above, and many of these criteria are highly subjective (e.g. problem taste, ethics, simplicity). For each of the criteria above, it's possible to come up with counterexamples of highly-cited or impactful ML papers that don't meet that criteria but possibly meet others.</p><h2>My Criteria</h2><p>I wanted to share my criteria for how I review papers. <b>When it comes to recommending accept/reject,</b>&nbsp;<b>I mostly care about Correctness and New Information.</b>&nbsp;Even if I think your paper is boring and unlikely to be an actively researched topic in 10 years,&nbsp;I will vote to accept it as long as your paper helped me learn something new that I didn't think was already stated elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><p>Some more specific examples:</p><ul><li>If you make a claim about humanlike exploration capabilities in RL in your introduction and then propose an algorithm to do something like that, I'd like to see substantial empirical justification that the algorithm is indeed similar to what humans do.</li><li>If your algorithm doesn't achieve SOTA, that's fine with me. But I would like to see a careful analysis of why your algorithm doesn't achieve it and why.</li><li>When papers propose new algorithms, I prefer to see that the algorithm is <b>better</b>&nbsp;than prior work. However, I will still vote to accept if the paper presents a factually correct analysis <i>of why </i>it doesn't do better than prior work.&nbsp;</li><li>If you claim that your new algorithm works better because of reason X, I would like to see experiments that show that it isn't because of alternate hypotheses X1, X2.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Correctness is difficult to verify. Many metric learning papers were proposed in the last 5 years and accepted at prestigious conferences, only for&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ericjang11/status/1259174316970618881?s=20">Musgrave et al. '20</a>&nbsp;to point out that the experimental methodology between these papers were not consistent.</p><p>I should get off my high horse and say that I'm part of the circus too. I've reviewed papers for 10+ conferences and workshops and I can honestly say that I only understood 25% of papers from just reading them. An author puts in tens or hundreds of hours into designing and crafting a research paper and the experimental methodology, and I only put in a few hours in deciding whether it is "correct science". Rarely am I able to approach a paper with the level of mastery needed to rigorously evaluate correctness.</p><p>A good question to constantly ask yourself is: "what experiment would convince me that the author's explanations are correct and&nbsp;not due to some alternate hypothesis? Did the authors check that hypothesis?"</p><p>I believe that we should accept all "adequate" papers, and more subjective things like "taste" and "simplicity" should be reserved for paper awards, spotlights, and oral presentations. I don't know if everyone should adopt this criteria, but I think it's helpful to at least be transparent as a reviewer on how I make accept/reject decisions.&nbsp;</p><h2>Opportunities for Non-Traditional Researchers</h2><p>If you're interested in getting mentorship for learning how to read, critique, and write papers better, I'd like to plug&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.evjang.com/2020/06/free-office-hours-for-non-traditional.html">my weekly office hours</a>, which I hold on Saturday mornings over <a href="https://meet.google.com/">Google Meet</a>. I've been mentoring about 6 people regularly over the last 3 months and it's working out pretty well.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone who is not in a traditional research background (not currently in an ML PhD program) can reach out to me to book an appointment. You can think of this like visiting your TA's office hours for help with your research work. Here are some of the services I can offer, completely <i>pro bono</i>:</p><ul><li>If you have trouble understanding a paper I can try to read it with you and offer my thoughts on it as if I were reviewing it.</li><li>If you're very very new to the field and don't even know where to begin I can offer some starting exercises like reading / summarizing papers, re-producing existing papers, and so on.</li><li>I can try to help you develop a good taste of what kinds of problems to work on, how to de-risk ambitious ideas, and so on.</li><li>Advice on software engineering aspects of research.

September 28, 2020 | https://www.ximedes.com/2020-09-17/role-based-authorization-in-ktor/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ximedes.com/2020-09-17/role-based-authorization-in-ktor/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><h5>Joris Portegies Zwart</h5><h6>September 17, 2020</h6></p></div><div><p><span><p><a href="https://ktor.io/">Ktor</a> is an open source framework for creating HTTP servers and clients. Its use of non-blocking I/O and asynchronous design (using Kotlin's coroutines) make it an ideal framework for writing servers that remain performant and responsive even when serving many clients at once.</p>
<p>Ktor itself is rather bare-bones, using a plugin model based on <em>Features</em> to extend its functionality. Even rather fundamental server features such as routing, session management and serving static content are optional, and require installing and configuring the corresponding features in your Ktor application to enable them.</p>
<p>While Ktor comes with a standard feature for <em>authentication</em> (i.e. protecting routes by requiring a user to be logged in), it currently lacks a standard feature for <em>authorization</em>, i.e. protecting routes by checking if a logged-in user has the proper privileges to acces them.</p>
<p>Recently I was asked to implement role-based authorization in one of our Ktor-based applications. Implementing it was an interesting journey into the inner workings of Ktor, which is documented in this blog post. If you want to jump straight into the source code you can find a working example <a href="https://github.com/ximedes/ktor-authorization">here on Github</a>.</p>
<h2>Session-based authentication</h2>
<p>Before we talk about authorization, let's setup authentication first. For our demo, we will use form-based login to authenticate the user. After authentication, the user's name and assigned roles are stored in a server-side session.</p>
<p>The user's session is modeled as data class implementing the <code>Principal</code> marker interface to mark it as the principal in our authentication scheme:</p>
<div data-language="kotlin"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>class</span> <span>UserSession</span><span>(</span>
    <span>val</span> name<span>:</span> String<span>,</span>
    <span>val</span> roles<span>:</span> Set<span>&lt;</span>String<span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>emptySet</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>)</span> <span>:</span> Principal</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, we model a user's assigned roles as a set of <code>String</code> values.</p>
<p>Session management is a feature that needs to be installed separately in Ktor. We configure it to store our session in memory, and assign it a session ID that is stored between requests in a browser cookie:</p>
<div data-language="kotlin"><pre><code><span>install</span><span>(</span>Sessions<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    cookie<span>&lt;</span>UserSession<span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>"ktor_session_cookie"</span><span>,</span> <span>SessionStorageMemory</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we configure the actual <code>Authentication</code> plugin. We need to provide it with two functions: a <code>validate</code> function that defines how we extract a <code>Principal</code> from a session, and a <code>challenge</code> function that defines what to do when a non-authenticated request is made to a protected URL. In our case, the session <em>is</em> the principal, so we can just return it as-is. The challenge function redirects the user to <code>/login</code> which will show our login form.</p>
<div data-language="kotlin"><pre><code><span>install</span><span>(</span>Authentication<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    session<span>&lt;</span>UserSession<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        validate <span>{</span> session<span>:</span> UserSession <span>-&gt;</span>
            logger<span>.</span><span>info</span> <span>{</span> <span>"User <span><span>${</span>session<span>.</span>name<span>}</span></span> logged in by existing session"</span> <span>}</span>
            session
        <span>}</span>
        challenge <span>{</span>
            call<span>.</span><span>respondRedirect</span><span>(</span><span>"/login"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, we set up the routes for our demo app. On the root path <code>/</code> we show a simple homepage. (Note that the code below has been edited to show the essential structure. Our <a href="https://github.com/ximedes/ktor-authorization">Github repo</a> has the complete working demo.) A <code>GET</code> request to <code>/login</code> will serve our login form. The form's action is a <code>POST</code> request to <code>/login</code>. The handler of that request checks the provided credentials and, if correct, stores the principal in the session.</p>
<div data-language="kotlin"><pre><code>routing <span>{</span>
    <span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    <span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"/login"</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    <span>post</span><span>(</span><span>"/login"</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span>correctUsernameAndPassword<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            
            call<span>.</span>sessions<span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>UserSession</span><span>(</span>username<span>,</span> roles<span>)</span><span>)</span>
            call<span>.</span><span>respondRedirect</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
            
            call<span>.</span><span>respondRedirect</span><span>(</span><span>"/login"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, with all this in place, protecting an endpoint from access by an unauthenticated user is as simple as wrapping the route in an <code>authenticate</code> block:</p>
<div data-language="kotlin"><pre><code>routing <span>{</span>
    authenticate <span>{</span>
        <span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"/login-required"</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Routes, pipelines, phases, and interceptors</h2>
<p>Ignoring authentication and authorization for now, let's see what happens when we setup routes as in the example below:</p>
<div data-language="kotlin"><pre><code>routing <span>{</span>
    <span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    <span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"/login"</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    <span>post</span><span>(</span><span>"/login"</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Ktor's routing feature parses this configuration into a tree of <code>Route</code> instances. At the top of the tree is the root node, and every route can have zero or more child routes.</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="ktor routes" title="ktor routes" src="https://www.ximedes.com/static/ff99d1c5908c6f774b684b698f031970/8ff1e/ktor-routes.png" srcset="https://www.ximedes.com/static/ff99d1c5908c6f774b684b698f031970/9ec3c/ktor-routes.png 200w,

    </span></p>
<p>Note that not every route node maps to a path segment of the URL. As can be seen in the diagram above, separate HTTP methods are modeled as separate routes, possible targeting the same URL (as in <code>/login</code> below.)</p>
<p>Every <code>Route</code> is also a <code>Pipeline</code>. In Ktor, a pipeline is a collection of <em>interceptors</em>, grouped in one or more ordered <em>phases</em>. Interceptors are similar to servlet filters; each can perform custom logic before and after processing the request, or decide to stop processing and create a response directly.</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="ktor pipeline" title="ktor pipeline" src="https://www.ximedes.com/static/396cdccb89062aeb6f215a25d870140f/8ff1e/ktor-pipeline.png" srcset="https://www.ximedes.com/static/396cdccb89062aeb6f215a25d870140f/9ec3c/ktor-pipeline.png 200w,

    </span></p>
<p>Interceptors are executed first in order of their phase, then by the order in which they were added to the phase.</p>
<p>By default, Ktor defines the following phases (taken from the official <a href="https://ktor.io/docs/lifecycle.html#applicationcallpipeline">documentation</a>):</p>
<div data-language="kotlin"><pre><code>
<span>val</span> Setup <span>=</span> <span>PipelinePhase</span><span>(</span><span>"Setup"</span><span>)</span>

<span>val</span> Monitoring <span>=</span> <span>PipelinePhase</span><span>(</span><span>"Monitoring"</span><span>)</span>

<span>val</span> Features <span>=</span> <span>PipelinePhase</span><span>(</span><span>"Features"</span><span>)</span>

<span>val</span> Call <span>=</span> <span>PipelinePhase</span><span>(</span><span>"Call"</span><span>)</span>

<span>val</span> Fallback <span>=</span> <span>PipelinePhase</span><span>(</span><span>"Fallback"</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Features usually add interceptors at certain points, either in existing phases or in newly defined phases inserted at a specific point in the chain.</p>
<p>Every route is also a pipeline, with its own set of phases and interceptors. At runtime, before a request is handled all the applicable pipelines are <em>merged</em> into a single request pipeline. The resulting pipeline contains all phases defined in the route pipelines, and every phase contains the combined set of interceptors defined in every instance of this phase. For example, suppose a <code>GET</code> request for <code>/foo</code> comes in. The figure below shows the result of merging the different pipelines into one:</p>
<p><span>

    </span></p>
<h2>Authenticating routes</h2>
<p>Now that we have discussed the basics of routes and pipelines, we can understand how the authentication feature works. Consider the following route configuration:</p>
<div data-language="kotlin"><pre><code>routing <span>{</span>
    authenticate <span>{</span>
        <span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"/login-required"</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As a result of this configuration, an extra <code>Route</code> node is added between the routes for <code>/</code> and <code>/login-required</code>. The new intermediate route, called <code>/(authenticate "default")</code>, adds two custom phases to the default pipeline, called <code>Authenticate</code> and <code>Challenge</code> respectively:</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="ktor authenticated route" title="ktor authenticated route" src="https://www.ximedes.com/static/431fa05ea5afd72775f1db910f42e826/8ff1e/ktor-authenticated-route.png" srcset="https://www.ximedes.com/static/431fa05ea5afd72775f1db910f42e826/9ec3c/ktor-authenticated-route.png 200w,
https://www.ximedes.com/static/431fa05ea5afd72775f1db910f42e826/c7805/ktor-authenticated-route.png 400w,
https://www.ximedes.com/static/431fa05ea5afd72775f1db910f42e826/8ff1e/ktor-authenticated-route.png 800w,
https://www.ximedes.com/static/431fa05ea5afd72775f1db910f42e826/6ff5e/ktor-authenticated-route.png 1200w,
https://www.ximedes.com/static/431fa05ea5afd72775f1db910f42e826/2f950/ktor-authenticated-route.png 1600w,
https://www.ximedes.com/static/431fa05ea5afd72775f1db910f42e826/bd97e/ktor-authenticated-route.png 1830w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p>
<p>The interceptors in these phases perform the authentication logic, including executing the <code>validate</code> and <code>challenge</code> functions we configured earlier. If a principal is found in the session, the pipeline proceeds as normal; if not, processing is stopped short by our <code>challenge</code> function responding with a redirect to <code>/login</code>.</p>
<h2>Authorizing routes</h2>
<p>Now we are ready to discuss our actual goal - adding authorization checks to routes. Suppose we want to make sure that some route <code>/role-abc-required</code> is only available to users with the role <code>ABC</code>. We want to keep our API in line with the way authentication works:</p>
<div data-language="kotlin"><pre><code>routing <span>{</span>
    authenticate <span>{</span>
        <span>withRole</span><span>(</span><span>"ABC"</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"/role-abc-required"</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To authorize a route, we wrap it in a <code>withRole</code> block, which itself should be wrapped in an <code>authenticate</code> block to ensure there is a valid principal whose roles we can check. The <code>withRole</code> function takes a variable list of roles that the principal needs to have in order to access the underlying route.</p>
<p>The result of this configuration should be a tree of routes with an extra intermediate route to handle the role checks:</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>

    </span></p>
<p>Our authorization solution adds an <code>Authorize</code> phase, and configures an interceptor in that phase that checks if the current principal has sufficient privileges to access the underlying route. Since we can only perform this check if there actually is a principal defined for the current call, our phase needs to be inserted after the <code>Challenge</code> phase of the authentication feature. This means that even though we don't actually add interceptors to the <code>Challenge</code>, we do need to add it to our authorization pipeline to be able to define the correct position of the <code>AuthorizationPhase</code>:</p>
<div data-language="kotlin"><pre><code>pipeline<span>.</span><span>insertPhaseAfter</span><span>(</span>Features<span>,</span> ChallengePhase<span>)</span>
pipeline<span>.</span><span>insertPhaseAfter</span><span>(</span>ChallengePhase<span>,</span> AuthorizationPhase<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The upshot of all this is that after merging the pipelines of all routes, our authorization logic will take place <em>after</em> authentication.</p>
<p>A simplified implementation of <code>withRole</code> is shown below - the full version can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/ximedes/ktor-authorization">Github repository</a></p>
<div data-language="kotlin"><pre><code><span>fun</span> Route<span>.</span><span>withRole</span><span>(</span><span>val</span> role<span>:</span> String<span>,</span> build<span>:</span> Route<span>.</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> Unit<span>)</span><span>:</span> Route <span>{</span>
    
    <span>val</span> selector <span>=</span> <span>AuthorizedRouteSelector</span><span>(</span><span>"authorize (<span>$role</span>)"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>val</span> authorizedRoute <span>=</span> <span>createChild</span><span>(</span>selector<span>)</span>

    
    <span>val</span> feature <span>=</span> application<span>.</span><span>feature</span><span>(</span>RoleBasedAuthorization<span>)</span>
    feature<span>.</span><span>interceptPipeline</span><span>(</span>authorizedRoute<span>,</span> role<span>)</span>

    
    authorizedRoute<span>.</span><span>build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> authorizedRoute
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>First, we create a child <code>Route</code> in the parent from which we are called. This will be the route that will contain our authorization interceptors. (Attached to each route is a selector, which is used when matching a request to possible routes.)</p>
<p>Then we add the actual phases and interceptors, using Ktor's <em>feature</em> mechanism that we will discuss more below.</p>
<p>And finally, we proceed with building the rest of the routing tree by invoking the supplied <code>build</code> function on our newly constructed route.</p>
<h2>RoleAuthorization feature</h2>
<p>So, what do these lines actually do?</p>
<div data-language="kotlin"><pre><code><span>val</span> feature <span>=</span> application<span>.</span><span>feature</span><span>(</span>RoleBasedAuthorization<span>)</span>
feature<span>.</span><span>interceptPipeline</span><span>(</span>authorizedRoute<span>,</span> role<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let's look at <code>interceptPipeline</code> first, then discuss the how and why of the feature itself. (Just as before, this is a simplified version of what's on <a href="https://github.com/ximedes/ktor-authorization">Github</a>.)</p>
<div data-language="kotlin"><pre><code><span>fun</span> <span>interceptPipeline</span><span>(</span>pipeline<span>:</span> ApplicationCallPipeline<span>,</span> role<span>:</span> String<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    pipeline<span>.</span><span>insertPhaseAfter</span><span>(</span>Features<span>,</span> ChallengePhase<span>)</span>
    pipeline<span>.</span><span>insertPhaseAfter</span><span>(</span>ChallengePhase<span>,</span> AuthorizationPhase<span>)</span>

    pipeline<span>.</span><span>intercept</span><span>(</span>AuthorizationPhase<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>val</span> principal <span>=</span> call<span>.</span>authentication<span>.</span>principal<span>&lt;</span>Pr…</code></pre></div></span></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>September 28, 2020</p><p>If you have ever contributed to an open source project, chances are you have opened a pull request on GitHub or a similar platform to present your code to the maintainers. While this is a very approachable way of getting your code reviewed, some projects have decided against using pull requests and instead accept patches via email.</p><h2 id="an-introduction-to-patches"><a href="#an-introduction-to-patches"></a>An introduction to patches</h2><p>A patch is essentially a git commit expressed in plain text. It describes what commit the change is based on, and what has changed. A basic patch looks like this:</p><div><pre><p><span>From 92132241233033a123c4fa833449d6a0d550219c Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001</span></p><p><span>From: Bob &lt;bob@example.com&gt;</span></p><p><span>Date: Tue, 25 May 2009 15:42:16 +0200</span></p><p><span>Subject: [PATCH 1/2] first change</span></p><p><span>---</span></p><p><span> test.txt |    1 +-</span></p><p><span> 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)</span></p><p><span>diff --git a/test.txt b/test.txt</span></p><p><span>index 7634da4..270eb95 100644</span></p><p><span>--- a/test.txt</span></p><p><span>+++ b/test.txt</span></p><p><span>@@ -1 +1 @@</span></p><p><span>-Hallo Bob</span></p><p><span>+Hallo Alice!</span></p></pre></div><p>As you can see, it is very readable for both the reviewer and the machine.</p><h2 id="sending-and-receiving-patches"><a href="#sending-and-receiving-patches"></a>Sending and receiving patches</h2><p>The easiest way you can generate a patch from a commit is to use <code>git-format-patch</code>:</p><p>This will generate a <code>.patch</code> file, that can be embedded into an email and sent to the maintainers. Oftentimes they will then reply to your mail with some inline comments about your code.</p><p>To simplify this process further, git has the <code>send-email</code> command, which let’s you send the patch directly to someone without needing to embed it manually. I won’t go into details about this, but there is a <a href="https://git-send-email.io/">well written guide</a> on how to set it up.</p><p>If you have received a patch from someone, you can apply it to your tree with the <code>am</code> (apply mail) command:</p><div><pre><p><span>git am &lt; 0001-first-change.patch</span></p></pre></div><p>check your <code>git log</code> to see the patch in form of the latest commit.</p><h2 id="why-even-bother"><a href="#why-even-bother"></a>Why even bother</h2><p>You might think that this is just a silly and outdated approach to collaborative development. “Why not simply open a pull request?” you might ask. Some projects, especially low-level oriented ones like the Linux kernel, do not want to rely on third-party platforms like GitHub to host their code, with good reasons:</p><ol><li>Everyone can participate! You don’t need to register an account on some proprietary website to collaborate in a project that uses a patch-based workflow. You don’t even have to expose your identity, if you don’t want to. All you need is an email-address, and frankly most of us have one.</li><li>It’s plain simple! Once you get used to generating and applying patches on the command line, it is in fact easier and faster than opening a pull request in some clunky GUI. It doesn’t get simpler than plain text.</li><li>It is rewarding! Once you have submitted a patch to a project, there is no better feeling than getting a simple “Applied, thanks!” response from a maintainer. And if it’s a response that contains feedback rather than an approval, it feels even better to submit that reworked code again and get it eventually applied.</li></ol><h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The patch-based workflow is an alternative way to collaborate with developers. If it helps you in your day to day business depends on the projects you are contributing to, but in the end it is always good to have many tools under your belt.</p></div></div>]]>

September 27, 2020 | https://blog.nlogn.co/designing-scalable-instagram-architecture-system-design | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.nlogn.co/designing-scalable-instagram-architecture-system-design">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>The prerequisite for learning the Instagram architecture design is, how to design a URL Shortner Service like a tiny URL. Please read it <a target="_blank" href="https://nlogn.in/designing-a-realtime-scalable-url-shortening-service-like-tiny-url/">here…</a></p>
<h2 id="1-what-is-instagram">1. What is Instagram?</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://instagr.am/">Instagram</a> is a free photo &amp; video-sharing and social networking service that is very popular. In this tutorial, we will learn to design a simple architecture of Instagram that enables users to share photos, follow other users and create a unique "NewsFeed" for each user consisting of top photos from accounts they follow.</p>
<h2 id="2-design-goals">2. Design Goals</h2>
<p>Our service should provide the following features to a user:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mandatory Features</strong><ol>
<li>Users should be able to upload and view photos.</li>
<li>Users can perform a search based on photo titles.</li>
<li>A user can follow other users.</li>
<li>Create a unique NewsFeed for each user, consisting of top photos from all people/accounts the user follows.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Optional Features</strong><ol>
<li>The service should be highly scalable.</li>
<li>High <a target="_blank" href="https://nlogn.in/what-is-cap-theorem-and-where-is-it-used/">Consistency</a></li>
<li>High reliability i.e. any uploaded data should never be lost.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="3-capacity-estimation">3. Capacity Estimation</h2>
<p>The important thing to note here is, the number of reading requests will be 100 times more than the number of uploads (writing) requests. Suppose we are going to have 500 Million users registered to our platform with 1 Million daily active users. Let's assume 5M (million) photos are uploaded every day, then the number of photos uploaded in 1 second is:</p>
<p><span>1 sec = 5M / (24<em>60</em>60) ≈ <strong>57 photos</strong></span></p>
<p>If the average photo size is 150 KB, then storage usage in a day:</p>
<p><span> 5M * 150KB = 716 GB</span></p>
<p>Assuming our service runs continuously for 10 years, the space required will be:</p>
<p><span> 716GB <em> 365 </em> 10 ≈ 2553TB ≈ <strong>2.6PB</strong></span></p>
<h2 id="4-database-design-choice">4. Database Design Choice</h2>
<p>The database design will help us to understand the data flow among various components in the Instagram architecture. We need to store the data about users, their uploaded photos, people they follow. Note - calculating the likes, and comments on a photo uploaded by a user are out of the scope of this tutorial. </p>
<p><strong>Data related to user</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>User ID (Primary key):</strong> A unique user id to make users globally distinguishable.</li>
<li><strong>Name:</strong> The name of the user.</li>
<li><strong>Email:</strong> The email id of the user</li>
<li><strong>Password:</strong> Password of the user to facilitate the login feature.</li>
<li><strong>Creation Date:</strong> The date on which the user was registered.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Data related to photos</strong> </p>
<p>Since we are storing here actual photos and size limit for each photo size is 150KB. As calculated above if service runs for 10 years, we will end up accumulating 2.6 PB of data, which is too much to be stored in a database. Hence we will Object Storage service such as <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">AWS S3</a>.</strong></p>
<p>So, the flow will be as follow: We will store the actual photo in the S3 bucket and store the photo-path(URL) in the database.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>PhotoId (Primary Key):</strong> A unique 10B photo id to uniquely identify each photo.</li>
<li><strong>UserId:</strong> The id of a user who uploaded the photo.</li>
<li><strong>Path:</strong> The path/URL of object storage where the photos are stored.</li>
<li><strong>Latitude &amp; Longitude:</strong> We will store this information to find the location of the photo.</li>
<li><strong>Date &amp; time:</strong> The date &amp; timestamp at which the photo was uploaded.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/5rvnr4oon0qe2vkztbqx.png" alt="Instagram architecture design"></p>
<p><strong>Data related to users following &amp; followers</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Following</strong> - UserId of all the users followed by the current user.</li>
<li><strong>Followers</strong> - UserId of all the people following the users.</li>
</ol>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://nlogn.in/designing-instagram-architecture-system-design/following-table-2/"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/nlogn/image/upload/v1601141476/following-table-1_2571b7ed6.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p> If we closely look at the above table, both the followers and the following columns will contribute to the primary key. </p>
<p>If we want to find all the people followed by user1, it can be found by querying the following column and to find all followers of user 1, we will query the followers' row with a condition stating that they are following user1. </p>
<p>Followers of user 1 -&gt; user 2, user 3 user 1 following -&gt; user 2, user 3, user 4 We have two different choices of databases: 1) Relational Databases(MySQL) 2) NoSQL Databases(<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cassandra">Cassandra</a>). </p>
<p>In general, Relational Databases are good if we have lots of complex queries involving joins, but they are slow. NoSQL databases are pathetic at handling the relationship queries but they are faster. Now, we don’t really need lots of relationships among data, but we do need a fast read and write speed. Hence we will <strong>choose NoSQL Database</strong>. The key for each row can be the short URL because it is going to be globally unique.</p>
<h2 id="5-component-design">5. Component Design</h2>
<p>Our system supports photo upload(writes) and view(read) feature. Since uploading is a slow process, hence few users uploading photos at the same time can consume all the available bandwidth at once. Hence the reading or view photo won't be possible. Even if we assume our web server can support 1000 active connections simultaneously and with a 20:80 read-write ratio, 200 connections will be occupied for writing, and writing(uploading) is going to keep the connection open for a long time.<a target="_blank" href="https://nlogn.in/designing-instagram-architecture-system-design/singe-server/"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/nlogn/image/upload/h_266/w_528,h_266/w_528,h_266/w_528,h_266/v1601132610/singe-server_25627d849.png" alt="Instagram architecture design"></a> </p>
<p>To overcome this problem we dedicated servers for reading and different dedicated servers for writing. Also, separating photos’ read and write requests will allow us to scale and optimize each of these operations independently. The following diagram aptly defines how the read-write will work. <a target="_blank" href="https://nlogn.in/designing-instagram-architecture-system-design/two-servers/"></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://nlogn.in/designing-instagram-architecture-system-design/two-servers/"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/nlogn/image/upload/h_242/w_543,h_242/w_543,h_242/w_543,h_242/v1601132637/two-servers_256364bb1.png" alt="Instagram architecture design"></a></p>
<h2 id="6-news-feed-generation">6. News Feed Generation</h2>
<h4 id="1-generating-news-feed">1. Generating News Feed</h4>
<p>One of the most critical requirements of Instagram type service is designing the unique newsfeed for every user, containing the latest post from each user he/she is following. For simplicity let's assume each user all followers combined uploads 200 new unique photos every day. Hence a user newsfeed will be a combination of these 200 unique photos and after that reputation of past uploads. So, for generating a news feed for a user we will first fetch the metadata(likes, comments, time, location, etc) of the latest 200 photos and pass it to the ranking algorithm and ranking algorithm will determine which how the photos should be arranged in the newsfeed based on metadata. The major challenge with the above newsfeed generation approach is it requires querying lots of tables simultaneously and then ranking them using predefined parameters, hence this approach will result in higher latency i.e. it will take a lot of time to generate newsfeed. </p>
<p><strong>Pregenerating News Feed -</strong> To overcome the challenges with the above news feed generating algorithm we will create a server dedicated to generating the newsfeed unique to each user beforehand and storing it in a separate newsfeed table. With this approach whenever the user needs to see the updated newsfeed we will simply query this table.</p>
<h4 id="2-serving-the-news-feed">2. Serving the News Feed</h4>
<p>Now we have seen the way of creating a news feed. The next major challenge in Instagram architecture design is how will we serve the resulting newsfeed to the user. </p>
<p><strong>Push -</strong> One way is whenever a new photo uploaded by a user we will notify of all of his/her followers. For this, we can use Long-Pooling. A possible problem with this approach is, a user who follows a lot of people or celebrities, in this case, the server has to push updates/ send notifications quite frequently. </p>
<p><strong>Pull -</strong> Users will refresh their newsfeeds(make a pull request to the server), whenever they want to see the fresh content. The problem with this approach is that the new post will not be visible until users don't refresh also most of the refresh will result in empty results.</p>
<p> <strong>Hybrid Approach</strong> - The hybrid approach will involve applying the Pull-Based approach for all the users with lots of followers(celebrities) and the PULL based approach and normal users to the Push-Based approach.</p>
<h2 id="7-load-balancing">7. Load Balancing</h2>
<p>To overcome the problem of limited network bandwidth and single point of failure in Instagram type service architecture design, we will use <a target="_blank" href="https://nlogn.in/what-are-load-balancers-and-how-load-balancing-is-done/">Load Balancers</a>. Load Balancer does its magic by diving the traffic among a group of servers thus resulting in improved response and availability of a website or application. Read more <a target="_blank" href="https://nlogn.in/what-are-load-balancers-and-how-load-balancing-is-done/">here…</a> </p>
<p>To distribute the load among servers we will use the <strong>Least Bandwidth Method. </strong>This algorithm will choose the server currently serving the least amount of traffic, measured in megabits per second (Mbps). We can place the Load Balancers between:</p>
<ol>
<li>The client and the server.</li>
<li>The server and the database.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is how we will design the Instagram architecture that will scale in realtime.</p>

September 27, 2020 | https://underjord.io/live-server-push-without-js.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://underjord.io/live-server-push-without-js.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<small>2020-09-25</small><!-- RSS:2020-09-25T17:00:00Z -->
<p>
    So in my post <a href="https://underjord.io/is-this-evil.html">Is this evil?</a> I covered a way of tracking users with CSS. While
    thinking about those weird ways of using the web I also started thinking about pushing live data to clients
    without JS. Or at least maintaining a connection.
    So WebSockets requires JS. WebRTC requires JS. Even HLS (video streaming), which would otherwise
    be super cool, with captions for accessibility. But no. Or rather, maybe on Apple platforms. Eh. Not good enough.
</p>
<p>And then it hit me. From some old Nerves projects I'd seen, that there is a standard for just sending a stream of
    JPEG frames as a video. MJPEG. Did you know about MJPEG? Lots of people don't. It is used by lots of webcams and
    security cameras. Common option for Raspberry Pi hacks as well. MJPEG is super simple which is its big advantage.
</p>
<p>But video is what we expect. I was going for something else. So this could be used for a CI status light, showing
    any amount of visual status information. I use it for this:</p>
<p><img alt="live visual readership indicator" loading="lazy" src="https://count.underjord.io/"></p>
<p>That's live. Or dead if my server falls over.</p>
<p>So how does MJPEG work. Well, you take an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag and you shove an MJPEG URL into it. Done.</p>
<p>Okay, that's how you use it. Not how it works. I implemented it in Elixir, Elixir is quite good at keeping state and
    serving updates. Links are below. But basically the browser opens the connection, receives some headers and some
    chunks of data and then realizes it is dealing with MJPEG. It wil then just expect the chunks to keep coming.
    Indefinitely. Because this is live video. Frame by frame of JPEG.</p>
<p>The basic code for the MJPEG headers and chunking was lifted from a pi camera repo made by the Nerves team. It had a
    lot of Frank Hunleth and Connor Rigby in it so kudos to those guys as always. This is what I did with it: <a href="https://github.com/lawik/mjpeg/blob/master/lib/mjpeg.ex">lawik/mjpeg</a></p>
<p>My server implementation is here and uses the above code: <a href="https://github.com/lawik/mjpeg_example/blob/master/lib/mjpeg_example.ex">lawik/mjpeg_example</a></p>
<p>So I receive the connection and then that calls my MjpegExample GenServer to persist the connection and keep track of
    how to notify that connection about new data. It also triggers an update to notify everyone already connected.</p>
<p>This is not polished, it is hammered together and I'm curious to see if it falls over the next time I get a decent
    amount of traffic.</p>
<p>I really like this approach because it is a fun hack that simply happens to work across browsers and quite well at
    that. I like how it is just an img element and no frills. I added lazy loading because that works more nicely with
    things like Google Lighthouse scores and the loading experience (your browser doesn't spend a few seconds thinking
    about loading the image).</p>
<p>Unfortunately it is absolutely a poor choice to actually use aside from fun and hacky stuff. There is no good way of
    doing accessibility with it. You can update the pixels and that is it. Unless you can chunk-stream a txt-file in an
    iframe.
    Haven't tried that yet...</p>
<p>So, don't use it. But isn't it pretty neat?</p>
<p>Of course, much like the CSS tracking, this can be used for evilish things. You can absolutely keep track of how long
    someone keeps receiving your frames and use that for your analytics. I also find it neat that it lets me know
    concurrent users. I just log the number along with sending it out because I want to know at what number it breaks
    and out of curiosity but you can probably do some mildly untoward things with this. Oh.. Wait. You could serve
    rotating ads with this. You know what the last frame you sent was so if you get a click on it you can direct that
    particular user to the right thing. New title: Ad placement entirely without JS, ugh, no thanks. Moving on.</p>
<p>If you know how to make this more dirty, hacky and fun or even more useful or accessible feel free to get in touch at
    <a href="mailto:lars@underjord.io">lars@underjord.io</a> or on
    Twitter where I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a>.</p><p><img alt="live visual readership indicator" loading="lazy" src="https://count.underjord.io/"></p>

September 27, 2020 | https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2020/09/26/why-you-should-write-up-your-own-incident/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2020/09/26/why-you-should-write-up-your-own-incident/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>You shouldn’t write up your own incident if you can avoid it. To write up an incident well, you need to be able to capture the perspectives of the different people who were involved. If the write-up author was also one of the responders, then the writeup will be biased towards their perspective, at the expense of capturing the perspectives of the other engineers who were engaged.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, most organizations haven’t committed the resources  to support doing independent incident investigations. I happen to privileged enough to work at a company that has hired specialists who are skilled at doing independent incident investigations (<a href="https://twitter.com/jpaulreed">J. Paul Reed</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ubergeekgirl">Jessica DeVita</a>), Once upon a time (last year, to be precise), I was one of those independent incident investigators, before I transitioned back to being a software engineer.</p>



<p>However, even at my employer, we don’t have the resources to do an independent investigation for every single operational surprise that happens, and so the common case is still that a team has to investigate its own operational surprises.</p>



<p>Recently, I was one of the responders to one of these operational surprises. And, since I’m an advocate of teams putting in the effort to write up their operational surprises and share them with the org, I committed to doing that for my team. </p>



<p>During the operational surprise, we identified that certain database rows weren’t being updated, but we struggled to identify why they weren’t being updated. In the moment, We suspected the problem was somehow related to <a href="https://github.com/spinnaker/keel/blob/46f729b68b6ca5214e7de2bf6dc36a98f2f54dbc/keel-sql/src/main/kotlin/com/netflix/spinnaker/keel/sql/SqlArtifactRepository.kt#L521-L574">this function</a>, which is responsible for updating those database rows. We believed (correctly, in hindsight) that the function was being called, because a log statement immediately preceding that function invocation appeared in the logs. But, somehow, the database updates weren’t taking effect.</p>



<p>In the moment, I was looking into whether there was something about the database itself that was preventing writes: perhaps some sort of database lock that was blocking updates? To investigate that, I manually translated the code from <a href="https://www.jooq.org/">jOOQ library calls</a> to raw SQL so I could run the queries directly against the database and see what happened.</p>



<p>In the end, it turned out that the problem was not related to the database itself, but to <a href="https://github.com/spinnaker/keel/blob/46f729b68b6ca5214e7de2bf6dc36a98f2f54dbc/keel-sql/src/main/kotlin/com/netflix/spinnaker/keel/sql/SqlArtifactRepository.kt#L560">Kotlin code</a> inside that function that was throwing an exception. It was erroring because the code made certain assumptions about the format of version strings, and those assumptions had become invalid over time. When this code hit a version string it couldn’t process, it threw an exception and triggered a transaction rollback.</p>



<p>After we remediated, when I looked back on the events of the day, I thought  “<em>Boy, I sure did waste a big chunk of time manually translating that code to SQL, when the problem wasn’t related to the database at all.</em>“</p>



<p>Later on, when I put my incident investigator hat on and pored over the Slack messages, I discovered something. While I was working to understand the code to translate it, I discovered that <a href="https://github.com/spinnaker/keel/pull/1493">one of the queries in that function was too broad</a>. Under normal circumstances, the broadness of the query wasn’t impacting the correctness of the function (the query after it was narrower) or the performance, but during the operational surprise it was increasing the blast radius of the issue. Narrowing the scope of that query was an important part of remediating the incident.</p>



<p>The thing is, until I was investigating the incident, I didn’t realize that <strong>I had learned about the broad query issue because I was working to translate the code into SQL.</strong> That work I did had real value: it helped us resolve the issue.</p>



<p>Ever since I’ve been bitten by the <em>learning from incidents</em> bug, I’ve been a believer in the value of using an independent investigator. But this is the first time I really had this first-hand experience of <strong>I learned something new about my own work in resolving the incident, even though I was there, because of the post-incident investigation work</strong>. It was quite a visceral realization.</p>



<p>And so, while you really should take advantage of independent investigators if resources permit, if you’ve worked as an independent investigator and then transition to a role which includes incident response, I recommend trying to write up one of your own incidents, at least once. It really reinforces how much more can be learned from an incident by doing a good investigation.</p>

<!--more--><p>As part of an upcoming episode of <a href="https://glitch.com/glimmer/podcasts/shift-shift-forward">Shift Shift Forward</a> I answered a few questions about incident response. The description of the episode is:</p><blockquote>  <p>We’ve all experienced it before – you go to your favorite website, but it’s not loading. Or you try clicking on a link to complete a transaction, but your browser times out and you get an error message. It can be frustrating to deal with outages and similar issues from a user perspective, but let’s see what it looks like from the other side. What happens when these incidents occur, and what does it take to get everything running smoothly again?</p></blockquote><p>The Shift Shift Forward team interviewed the SREs and our manager at Glitch - as well as a lot of other people - and asked a bunch of great questions.</p><p>The question I liked the best was “What are you feeling during incident response” or something to that effect. I wasn’t able to give a good answer in the moment but thought it was such a good question that it wrote down some quick notes after and did a quick recording.</p><p>Here’s the notes of what points I intended to make - it’s a bit different from what I ended up saying, but that’s usually how it goes for me 😅 I think I like the audio version better, so if you want to hear me clumsily work through the notes I’ve included the <a href="http://mads-hartmann.com/uploads/feelings-during-incident-response.mp3">audio recording</a> as well 😉</p><hr><p><audio controls="">  <source src="https://mads-hartmann.com/uploads/feelings-during-incident-response.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">  Your browser does not support the audio tag.</audio></p><p>As for the feeling you experience during incident response, for me, I go through almost the full spectrum of feelings, not just the bad ones as you might think.</p><ul>  <li>    <p>When I first get paged there’s a short time where I’m feeling <strong>dread</strong>, or at least a bit <strong>afraid</strong> - I’m worried it might be an actual incident that will affect our users.</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>If it turns out it is an incident, then you go into incident response mode, you’re very <strong>focused</strong>. You assemble a team, so that means picking a scribe to take notes, and a communicator that’s responsible for keeping the rest of the company updated as we work through the indent.</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>Once the incident response it going it can be very <strong>exciting</strong> - it’s still extremely <strong>stressful</strong> - but it can be quite <strong>fun</strong>. You’re trying to figure out what’s going wrong, coming up with hypotheses and trying to prove, or disprove, them together with the team. That is extremely <strong>challenging</strong> and can be very fun. You also learn more about your systems by looking at them when they’re broken than when they’re happy.</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>Finally, once the incident is over and you can mark the incident as resolved, that is extremely <strong>fulfilling</strong>. At that moment I’m always feeling extremely <strong>proud</strong> of the team that worked on the incident, and I’m feeling really proud of myself for not breaking down.</p>  </li></ul><p>I think that’s what makes it <strong>worthwhile</strong> to be part of the on-call rotation, it’s not just stress and dread, it can also be very exciting, challenging, fulfilling, and fun.</p><p>Eventually, as you get more experience with incident response, the bad feelings take up less space.</p><hr><p>The episode airs on May 13 - while this little clip might not be included in it I know it’s going to be a great episode, so <a href="https://glitch.com/glimmer/podcasts/shift-shift-forward">head</a> over an subscribe 😉</p>

Biden Jr</a></em></strong>., <strong><em>the Democratic presidential nominee</em></strong>, said in <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_North_Carolina">Wilmington</a></em></strong>, Del., that the method wont to evaluate &amp; approve a vaccine would need to be <strong><em>â€œ<a href="https://totallytransparent.tumblr.com/">totally transparent</a>â€�</em></strong> to win public confidence. He has said that Mr. Trumpâ€™s involves companies and regulators to hurry the method have shaken the publicâ€™s faith in vaccines, which politics has no place in vaccine development.</p><p>Researchers especially are urging vaccine makers to share the detailed blueprints of their studies in order that outside experts can evaluate them. a minimum of one expert, after reading the plans, has already raised questions on the way the trials were designed.</p><p>â€œI want to acknowledge an honest deed done,â€� said <strong><em><a href="https://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/editorial-staff/peter-doshi">Peter Doshi</a></em></strong>, who is on school at the <strong><em><a href="https://www.pharmacy.umaryland.edu/">University of Maryland School of Pharmacy in Baltimore</a> &amp; editor with The <a href="https://www.bmj.com/">BMJ</a>, a medical journal</em></strong>. He previously requested the plans from Moderna &amp; Pfizer. â€œThey have opened , for the 1st time, the power for researchers not involved in trial to make their own independent judgment about the planning of this study.â€�</p><p>Until now, none of the <strong><em>9 companies</em></strong> that are testing vaccines in large clinical trials had released this level of detail.</p><p><strong><em><a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/moderna-shares-covid-19-vaccine-trial-blueprints-pfizer-follows-2297212">Moderna</a>, <a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/">AstraZeneca</a> &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfizer">Pfizer</a></em></strong>, which is collaborating with the <strong><em><a href="https://biontech.de/">German company BioNTech</a></em></strong>, are among the front-runners in global race to produce &amp; supply a vaccine to fight the pandemic.</p><p>A spokeswoman for AstraZeneca said the corporate intended to publish its protocol shortly. Novavax, which is predicted to start out a big, advanced clinical trail test later this year, also didn’t comment. <strong><em><a href="https://www.jnj.com/">Johnson &amp; Johnson</a></em></strong>, which has said it plans to start a big trial this month, said it might have <strong><em>â€œmore information to shareâ€�</em></strong> when trial starts.</p><p>AstraZenecaâ€™s trial was stopped temporarily due to serious illness in participant. it’s resumed in <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">Britain</a> &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil">Brazil</a></em></strong>, but not in <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">US</a></em></strong> .</p><p>Earlier studies of both vaccines in small numbers of individuals found that after  the second shot, they developed so-called <strong><em><a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/What-are-Neutralizing-Antibodies.aspx">neutralizing antibodies</a></em></strong>, which may inactivate the virus in lab tests. The vaccines also produced a positive response involving <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell#:~:text=A%20T%20cell%20is%20a,receptor%20on%20the%20cell%20surface.">T-cells</a></em></strong>, another part of <strong><em><a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/immune-system#:~:text=The%20immune%20system%20is%20a,it%20enters%20the%20body%20again.">immune system</a></em></strong> .</p><p><strong><em><a href="https://usaindiachamber.org/Dr-Tal-Zaks.php">Dr. Tal Zaks</a></em></strong>, chief medical officer for Moderna, the 1st coronavirus vaccine maker to release its detailed plan, said pharmaceutical companies were usually reluctant to try to do so, for competitive reasons.</p><p>â€œIâ€™m pleased with doing that,â€� he said in an interview. â€œI donâ€™t think thereâ€™s much there that weâ€™re disclosing that hasnâ€™t already been spoken to, but let the general public be the judge of that.â€�</p><p>Dr. Zaks said Moderna had consulted an outdoor ethics expert who advised the corporate that single way to win trust was to be <strong><em>â€œtransparent to the point of discomfort.â€�</em></strong></p><p>In a statement, Pfizer said it didn’t usually didn’t release its protocols, adding, â€œWe recognize, however, that the <strong><em><a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">coronavirus pandemic</a></em></strong> may be a unique circumstance and therefore the need for transparency is obvious .â€�</p><p><strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Topol">Dr. Eric Topol</a></em></strong>, a clinical test expert at Scripps Research in <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego">San Diego</a></em></strong> , gave Moderna <strong><em>â€œbig kudosâ€�</em></strong> for sharing its plan but said that he was disappointed that Moderna intended to incorporate in its data people that had developed relatively mild cases of COVID-19. He said more compelling evidence of the vaccineâ€™s effectiveness would be produced if the corporate counted only moderate to severe cases.</p><p>Modernaâ€™s plan also allows for the likelihood of stopping the trial early after a comparatively small number of cases, potentially resulting in an exaggerated perception of the vaccineâ€™s efficacy &amp; missing safety problems that would end up to be significant later if the vaccine given to million of people, he said.</p><p>Dr. Topol was more critical of Pfizerâ€™s plan because it allowed even milder cases than Modernaâ€™s to be counted &amp; provided more opportunities to prevent the trial early supported few cases, which he called troubling.</p><p>â€œTake the time, the additional weeks,â€� Dr. Topol said. â€œNo shortcuts. Nobody will regret it. Iâ€™ve been doing clinical trials for many years . I donâ€™t know if thereâ€™s ever been a more important one than this one. Iâ€™d wish to see it done right, and not stopped early.â€�</p><p>In both Modernaâ€™s &amp; Pfizerâ€™s studies, half the participants receive the vaccine, and half receive a placebo shot consisting of salt water, with neither the volunteers nor the doctors treating them knowing who gets which. <strong><em>2 shots</em></strong> are needed, <strong><em>4 weeks</em></strong> apart for Moderna &amp; <strong><em>3 weeks</em></strong> apart for Pfizer. The participants are then monitored to ascertain if they develop symptoms of COVID-19 and test positive for the virus.</p><p>Side effects of the vaccines also are tracked. In earlier studies, both vaccines have caused transient reactions sort of a sore arm, fever, chills, muscle &amp; joint pain, fatigue &amp; headaches.</p><p>To determine the vaccineâ€™s efficacy, Moderna counts COVID-19 cases if they occur <strong><em>2 weeks</em></strong> after the <strong><em>2nd shot</em></strong>. Pfizer starts counting them <strong><em>7 days</em></strong> after the second shot.</p><p>A total of <strong><em>151 cases of COVID-19</em></strong> from among the tens of thousands of individuals participating in trial â€” spread between the vaccine &amp; placebo groups â€” would be enough to find out whether the Moderna vaccine is <strong><em>60% effective</em></strong>. Pfizerâ€™s case count for <strong><em>60% efficacy is 164</em></strong>. The Food and Drug Administration has said any coronavirus vaccines must be a minimum of <strong><em>50% effective</em></strong>.</p><p>Many outside researchers are expecting details about how the trials might be stopped early, given the push to bring a vaccine to market ASAP.</p><p>That could happen only outside panels of experts examine the info while the trials are underway. If the vaccine is extremely effective, they might stop the trial because it might be unethical to continue giving some participants a placebo.</p><p>The panel, called a data-safety monitoring board, will perform its 1st analysis of Modernaâ€™s efficacy data once <strong><em>53 cases of COVID-19</em></strong> are diagnosed. Pfizerâ€™s 1st analysis are going to be done after <strong><em>32 cases</em></strong>.</p><p>The board could recommend stopping the Moderna trial after <strong><em>53 cases</em></strong> if it had been found to be <strong><em>74% effective</em></strong>. In case of Pfizer, the effectiveness would wish to be better than about <strong><em>77%.</em></strong></p><p>Moderna has 2 more analysis points; Pfizer has 4.</p><p>Dr. Topol said studies often allowed just one look at the info partway through, and he had sharp words for Pfizerâ€™s use of 4 .</p><p>â€œItâ€™s programming the trial to possess numerous looks that it might stop early,â€� he said.</p><p>Modernaâ€™s chief executive, <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St%C3%A9phane_Bancel">StÃ©phane Bancel</a></em></strong>, said the corporate would report publicly on the results of the 1st so-called <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interim_analysis#:~:text=In%20clinical%20trials%20and%20other,continual%20process%20staggered%20in%20time.">interim analysis</a></em></strong>, and therefore the next one, once they are conducted. Pfizer has said that it’ll share information about the analysis only if decision is made that trial should be stopped, either because it’s very effective or because it doesn’t appear to be working.</p><p>The safety board also can put the trial on hold if there’s evidence that a participant may are harmed, as occurred recently in <strong><em><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/09/08/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-study-put-on-hold-due-to-suspected-adverse-reaction-in-participant-in-the-u-k/">AstraZenecaâ€™s vaccine study</a>.</em></strong></p><p>Dr. Zaks &amp; Mr. Bancel said in interviews that the 1st analysis would probably not happen before November. In theory, the vaccine might be found effective at that time , though the chances of that aren’t high, Dr. Zaks said.</p><p>If the info aren’t conclusive, the panel would look again after there had been a total of <strong><em>106 cases</em></strong>. If there have been still no answer, subsequent and end would occur after <strong><em>151 people</em></strong> had contracted coronavirus.</p><p>How long it takes to succeed in any of these case counts depends on the trajectory of the pandemic &amp; how the likely participants are to be exposed to coronavirus.</p><p>Whether or not the vaccine is effective, the participantsâ€™ health are going to be monitored for <strong><em>2 years</em></strong> after the second shot, the plan stated.</p><p>M…</p></div></div>

                    <p>Back in late 2016, I started <a href="http://www.armory.io/">Armory </a>in my garage (pictured above) with my two co-founders. We also applied to Y Combinator. I often have founders ask me if YC is worth it right around now, during YC application season. </p><p>The short answer is <code>Yes, you should at least apply to see if you get in.</code> The longer answer is <code>It depends a lot more on <em>you </em>than YC (kind of like asking "is exercise worth it?").</code> Armory participated in the Winter 2017 batch, as well as the Fall 2019 Growth program.</p><p>YC is not just one thing. It's a series of people, experiences and resources that scale with your company as it grows. Here's a detailed look into what's been valuable, and what you can do to get full value from YC:</p><h2 id="optimizing-our-initial-w17-yc-batch-experience-">Optimizing our initial W17 YC &nbsp;batch experience:</h2><ul><li>YC's biggest initial benefit is that it creates intense focus in a short period of time, and at the end of the program, YC has nailed product-market-fit to help you pick up a good sized initial investment via Demo Day. If you hit it hard, you won't have any problem raising money. That alone is very valuable in the early stages of a startup's life, and it's a self-reinforcing cycle: The more initial traction you have, the more investment you can quickly pick up (and vice versa).</li><li>We secured several million dollars in SAFE notes in the span of a couple of days after demo day – and we could have picked up more if we'd wanted to. More on that below. It helps to be organized because you'll have to prioritize and manage a lot of investor interest in a short period of time. </li></ul><blockquote>I'd recommend using a Trello board like the one below to manage investor interest (you can <strong><a href="https://trello.com/b/jsHJLVMB/ycombinator-demo-day/drodio/recommend">make a copy of it here</a></strong>). This board is also valuable for future rounds; I used a variation of it for Armory's Series A and B as well <em>(that's a whole other blog post; LMK if you'd like me to write it).</em></blockquote><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><img src="https://p-qkfvwn.b3.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/xQuL5Bz9/Screen%20Recording%202020-09-11%20at%2003.41.17%20PM.mp4" width="800"></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><ul><li>If you decide to apply to YC, the #1 piece of advice I can provide is <code>Show, Don't Tell.</code> The more you can show YC that you've already got early traction, the more likely it is that your application will be accepted for an interview, and that you'll get in (or at least invited back for a 2nd interview.) And it's good practice to focus on getting early, external validation, because that's what you'll be doing non-stop once you get into YC. Nicolae has <a href="https://medium.com/@nicolaerusan/modeling-what-startup-growth-actually-looks-like-73cc4720230e">a good breakdown here</a> of the 5% to 6% <em>weekly</em> growth that you should be targeting. The YC batch experience is an intense experience where you identify your top growth metric, focus on optimizing it, measure your results, and then do <em>whatever it takes </em>to unblock that growth. Rinse and repeat each week with all the founders around you doing the same thing. &nbsp;</li><li>You're more likely to be accepted if you are not a solo founder. I personally like the "hacker and hustler" combo for the fastest growth iterations &amp; unblocking. If you're afraid of getting strong external signals of validation for an MVP product, you won't do well in YC. One of my favorite sayings is <code>perfectionists are <em>imperfect </em>with their time.</code> And time is in short supply, with the Demo Day clock looming from the very first day of the program. A few other very appropriate sayings: <code>Build the right thing fast, instead of the wrong thing right,</code> and <code>There's <em>always </em>one more thing you can do [to increase growth]. And after that, there's <em>one more thing</em>.</code> I find that often, people are their own enemies when it comes to the headspace you need to be in to be a successful YC founder. Don't doubt yourself. Believe in your ability to create value. And don't be shy about being relentless in pursuing that external validation to prove it.</li></ul><p>Below is Armory's Demo Day video from 2017. I've blurred out some of our early customer names, but other than that, it's the full video. This is the first time it's been shown publicly. We spent the YC batch program getting our first customers to sign contracts (the "hustler" piece) while we built out the first version of Armory's platform (the "hacker" piece), which is built using an open source continuous software delivery project called <a href="http://www.spinnaker.io/">Spinnaker</a>. By the time Demo Day rolled around, we had multiple paid customer commitments and could articulate a long-term vision for Armory<em> (which has remained largely unchanged since our early days in the garage – that's also a whole other blog post!).</em> I've heard people say there's $100 Billion worth of VC funds in the room for YC Demo Day. I can believe that, and I wouldn't be surprised if it's well over that. </p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IvZjbN2kil0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><ul><li><strong>Other things we did well: </strong>YC has guest speakers come speak once weekly at dinner during the program, and there are really valuable nuggets of wisdom shared during those dinners. For example, Lyle Fong, the founding CEO of Lithium, gave a talk at a dinner about how he had to educate CMOs on the kind of social media platform Lithium was, so he made a maturity model diagram. That sparked Armory's creation of this "<a href="http://go.armory.io/stages">Stages of Software Delivery</a>" diagram, which we've used extensively to help Global 2,000 enterprises understand what their future pain points will be as they adopt the cloud, as well as the benefits they can expect to garner.</li><li><strong>Things we could have done better: </strong>We've never utilized YC Office Hours as effectively as we could have. There are YC partners and domain experts that make themselves available to talk through challenges a business is having. I recommend leaning into that more than we did.</li></ul><h2 id="optimizing-yc-s-growth-program-ycg-f19-">Optimizing YC's Growth Program (YCG F19):</h2><figure><img src="https://drodio.com/content/images/2020/09/0CC9DBF0-5451-4BDD-8F7F-2F1BEDA3D330.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://drodio.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/0CC9DBF0-5451-4BDD-8F7F-2F1BEDA3D330.jpeg 600w, https://drodio.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/0CC9DBF0-5451-4BDD-8F7F-2F1BEDA3D330.jpeg 1000w, https://drodio.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/0CC9DBF0-5451-4BDD-8F7F-2F1BEDA3D330.jpeg 1600w, https://drodio.com/content/images/2020/09/0CC9DBF0-5451-4BDD-8F7F-2F1BEDA3D330.jpeg 2388w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>In the fall of 2019, I participated in the "graduate" YC program, for YC companies that are scaling. I consider this program to be even more valuable than the initial YC batch experience. It's more intimate – our group was about 15 CEOs – and everyone is dealing with (or has just dealt with) the same types of issues. If the first YC batch experience is about figuring how to drive relentless early traction and growth, the YC growth program is about figuring out how to scale that growth, in every sense of the word – how to scale your functions, your executives, your culture, your size, your<em>self</em>. And the vibe is entirely different: In the early YC batch days, you're just trying to make your startup <em>become relevant and survive.</em> But in the Growth program, it's clear that all the startups who have made it this far are solving a real problem for the world, and have a lot of growth in front of them. And the problems are much more abstract – more about how to align <em>people and processes </em>to scale the magic that's made the business get this far. I've made some incredible, true friendships from this group, and we continue to help each other via WhatsApp and meet on a regular basis. </p><ul><li>My #1 tip is to capture as much of the content as you can to share in permissioned ways with your executive team and managers. By the time you participate in this program, your company will have grown well beyond just the founders. Many of the great tips you'll hear will come from the dinners you attend, as well as how your fellow CEOs have managed similar issues. I highly recommend <a href="http://go.armory.io/Otter">installing Otter.ai on your phone</a> so you can ask the person sharing pro-tips if you can record it and make an auto-transcript to share with your execs. I did this a bunch during the program <em>(Oleg, I'm looking at you, buddy!).</em></li></ul><p>If you have the chance to do the YC Growth program, you should absolutely do it. <em>(I'll invite the CEOs from our batch to leave more thoughts in the comments below).</em></p><h2 id="the-big-thing-to-understand-about-yc-before-you-join-">The big thing to understand about YC <em>before </em>you join:</h2><p>So yes, YC is very much worthwhile. What you get out of YC will very much be dependent on what you put into it. I haven't even mentioned the internal YC forum (cheekily called "BookFace") where several thousand YC alums serve as a resource for each other, as well as YC's <a href="https://www.workatastartup.com/">Work at a Startup</a> recruiting tool, the private VC resource rating directory, YC's <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/ycs-series-a-guide/">Series A program</a>, and other similar resources. &nbsp;</p><p>Here's the main thing you need to understand before you apply: YC has <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/deal/">a "standard deal"</a> where they take a 7% stake in your company. YC also gets pro-rata rights in future funding rounds. If your company is really successful, you may find yourself in a position where you need to negotiate some of those pro-rata rights in order to make the round work (i.e., make enough room to accomodate new new investor demand). While YC will do its best to work with you based on your specific situation, you need to understand that you're signing up for a standard deal up-front, and that early seed-stage commitment may upset other investors. Other angel/seed/Series A investors can become unhappy when having to live on a cap table alongside YC.</p><p>Hope that helps! Feel free to ask any questions in the comments – and if you're also a YC alum, please share your pro-tips as well!</p>

    <p>Sometimes, I feel more like a discount-attorney than a software engineer. The utopian vision of a world where anyone with a computer can create a business from scratch is certainly real, but there are <em>some</em> barriers to entry besides writing the code. This is perfectly fine, but it doesn’t align with the career I expected – I’m not “a programmer,” but rather “a problem-solver who often programs.”</p>
<p>A few years ago, I specialized in Objective-C iOS app development. I worked for a few agencies at first, but after my side-project got acquired, I had the financial cushion to become a freelance app developer for some early-stage startups in the DC area. I used to joke, back then, that I was a professional App Store rules explainer, because in every role, I was constantly explaining to peers, managers, and clients why we couldn’t build X because it violated Apple’s terms &amp; conditions. I just wanted to build what our users wanted, but instead we debated endlessly about what Apple might allow. Even then, we’d still occasionally be punished by a frivolous rejection, moving us to the back of the app-review line.</p>
<p>But Apple isn’t the villain here – this is a large industry trend. The entire internet is increasingly burdened by various governments, corporations, and everything in-between. Users can already feel the pain to some extent – every time we dismiss another GDPR pop-up or navigate to Amazon’s website (not their iOS app) to buy a Kindle book, we can feel hints of bureaucracy adding arbitrary hurdles to our technology. But as a developer… that’s where it hurts.</p>
<p>In-app purchases. Email verification w/ various “unsubscribe” options. Sign-in with X. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/D-U-N-S/">DUNS</a> numbers. Applying for AWS Service Limit increases to send any emails. These “table-stakes” features are a real drag on productivity because… well, because they’re no fun to develop! It’s energizing to solve real problems, and draining to solve fake problems. Early in my career, I was less picky – the arbitrary app-store rules were the only reality I had ever known, so I built all kinds of solutions that elegantly pushed the constraints to their bleeding edge… but then the underlying frameworks shifted, the rules changed, and my work was suddenly obsolete.</p>
<p>The joy of creation that comes from building <em>anything</em> is co-dependent on overcoming challenges. However, now that I’ve been burned by arbitrary rule-changes a few times, I recognize solutions layered with workarounds to artificial constraints for the fickle systems they are. I’m increasingly sensitive to this – I even experience a slightly hopeless, spinning-my-wheels feeling when explaining the implementation details of cookies &amp; local storage to other developers.</p>
<p>The good news is, nobody is stopping us from building whatever we want. The pure, for-the-joy-of-it engineers are safe, and these constraints only exist when you want to make money, or to build on enormous black-box abstractions (like web browsers or smartphone SDKs). Even then, it’s not like these constraints are unsolvable. We have options!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Build a custom solution. This is possible, but it’s no fun, which means we’ll build it slowly &amp; suffer an outsized productivity hit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buy it from a vendor. Even if it’s cheap, it still introduces 3rd-party systems &amp; black-box abstractions into critical pieces of your software. It sometimes means that your user’s data is being sent all over the internet, and it can still have a big drag on your productivity. There’s some death-by-a-thousand-cuts phenomenon that happens when you want to implement feature “X”, but every time you’re about get into flow &amp; write code, you have to go read 3rd-party documentation for yet another dependency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Live without the regulated feature. This basically never happens at real companies, but I’ve been exploring it more in my personal side-projects. This is strategically difficult for typical tech-startups (the kind that want to be “unicorns”), because things like user-accounts and private data are minimum-requirements to answer VC-101 questions, like “How does this widget become a monopoly?” We’re now at a later stage of this monopoly game, where a few companies have correctly answered that question.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I think we’re approaching the <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/the-end-of-the-beginning/">end-of-the-beginning</a>, where the tech giants are as entrenched as car companies; their disruption will no longer be the norm, but the exception. The infrastructure around cars actually makes it <em>harder</em> to implement a fundamental improvement to transport, not easier. There are all kinds of tiny companies building car accessories, but how many car-companies get funded each year? I can only think of 1 in my lifetime.</p>
<p>In the same way, most new tech companies tend to work in the small, forgotten crevices of the big tech players rather than competing against them. Most startups build products using Google or Apple SDKs (for smartphone apps), host their entire infrastructure in Amazon or Microsoft or Google data centers, and advertise through Facebook &amp; Google. I’ve seen more startups building SalesForce add-on widgets than new CRMs. Even duck-duck-go didn’t actually build a search engine – they rely on Microsoft’s Bing API for the search results.</p>
<p>This gradual centralization &amp; regulation has been happening for several years, and it’s a double-edged sword. It’s bad for attracting a particular personality of programmer to certain types of companies, but some rules are necessary as the software industry matures &amp; becomes more influential in the lives of billions of people. It’s also a small price to pay in exchange for access to the best product-distribution network ever… However, it’s still important to articulate this changing reality, if only to inform prospective engineers.</p>
<p>Many young developers are unhappy in their high-paying software jobs, often because of unrealistic expectations. Universities don’t enroll prospective CS students by promising a career focused on explaining technical constraints to non-technical stakeholders – that sounds more like how a doctor works with patients, or an attorney works with clients &amp; juries.</p>
<p>Many of my programmer-friends feel as if they’re somehow in the wrong job, and they have an intentional aversion to developing certain soft-skills, as if it will put them on the wrong path, leading more towards BS &amp; further away from real engineering. This fear is actually based in truth, but it’s exaggerated. Specialization is rewarded, but so is well-roundedness, or the combination of multiple skills. For the record, I vastly prefer a society of well-balanced citizens.</p>
<p>I love the job market, capitalism, America, all of it – but I also think there is room for improvement, and this area is worth discussing. It saddens me when salespeople are <em>proudly</em> ignorant of the technical details, or when some engineers opt-out of the social fabric of their community. I think the root issue is that we call them “salespeople” or “engineers”, and they’re just living up to the expectations attached to those labels.</p>
<p>People mostly think in terms of “How can I sell my labor?” This causes an oversimplification of skillsets to fit into certain categories that employers expect, and tragically, people get used to defining themselves by these narrow categories &amp; and the traits associated with them. You can work as a programmer, or a plumber, or whatever… but that’s just a job, not an identity.</p>

<p>But I have to warn you that this is the word–‘politics’–that nerds use whenever they feel impatient about the human realities of an organization.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <div><article>  <p>It's common to hear engineers muttering "cryptography is scary" or "oh no its a cert problem."</p> <p>The topic is a dense one full of maths, mailing lists, and vulnerabilities which quite literally shock the world. It's understandable how a lot of engineers put learning about the topics to another day.</p> <p>In my career I have been asked to build two different certificate signing backends for IoT purposes. These tasks provided the opportunity to work with authentication, encryption, and cryptography at a lower level then typical.</p> <p>This post will outline the bare minimum engineers should understand before working with authentication and encryption systems.</p> <h2>Part 1: Conceptual Overview</h2> <p>This section will provide a gentle introduction to authentication and encryption. These topics are to be read as a conceptual overview and not as literal implementation details.</p> <h3>Authentication and Encryption</h3> <p>Cryptography can lend itself to many utilities but as software developers our usage centers around authentication and encryption.</p> <p>Authentication is the act of identification. Cryptography can guarantee authentication and thus provide trust that the subject you are communicating with is indeed who they say they are. Authentication is implemented by cryptographic signing.</p> <p>Encryption is the act of concealing communications from unintended audiences. When a communication is encrypted it is guaranteed to be viewable only by the intended party.</p> <p>Authentication and encryption are used together to device a notion of trust in our applications and on the internet.</p> <h3>Cryptographic Signing</h3> <p>Cryptographically signing a message proves authentication in a single direction. It works like so:</p> <ul> <li>Sender: constructs a message to be sent.</li> <li>Sender: constructs a key to sign the message with.</li> <li>Sender: uses a signing algorithm to sign the bits of the message with the constructed keys.</li> <li>Sender: sends message along with signature to client.</li> <li>Receiver: receives the message and signature.</li> <li>Receiver: retrieves the sender's key.</li> <li>Receiver: uses the sender's key to sign the received message.</li> <li>Receiver: compares the sender's signature with the one computed by the receiver itself.</li> </ul> <p>If the receiver sees both signatures as equal and knows it can trust the key used to create the signature, the receiver can trust the message is from the sender.</p> <p>The various ways to securely transfer the sender's key to the receiver will be covered a bit later in the post.</p> <p>Typical signing algorithms are:</p> <ul> <li>HS256 - HMAC with SHA256</li> <li>RSA256 - RSA Signature with SHA256</li> </ul> <h3>Cryptographic Encryption</h3> <p>While similar in procedure, cryptographic encryption serves a separate purpose. It works like so:</p> <ul> <li>Sender: constructs a key</li> <li>Sender: construct a message to send</li> <li>Sender: run the message bits and the key through an encryption algorithm, producing unintelligible ciphertext.</li> <li>Sender: sends cipher text message to receiver.</li> <li>Receiver: receives the message</li> <li>Receiver: retrieves the sender's key</li> <li>Receiver: runs the message's ciphertext and the retrieved key through the same encryption algorithm, producing an intelligible message.</li> </ul> <p>In the above scenario the key is being utilized on every message to encrypt the message and conceal its contents.</p> <p>Typical encryption algorithms are:</p> <ul> <li>DES &amp; 3DES</li> <li>RSA</li> <li>Blowfish</li> <li>AES</li> </ul> <h2>Part 2: Applied Technologies</h2> <p>Several widely used technologies apply signing and encryption in practice. We will cover the following:</p> <ul> <li>Private Key Infrastructure And x509 Certificates</li> <li>TLS (SSL)</li> <li>JSON Web Tokens / JSON Web Signatures</li> </ul> <h3>Private Key Infrastructure And x509 Certificates</h3> <p>Private key infrastructure, or PKI for short, is a grouping of technologies, protocols, and policies. This grouping can be used in tandem to ensure both authentication and encryption and securely transfer keys between parties.</p> <p>PKI is based on a private/public key model. In this model a private key is used for signing or encryption while the public key is used for verification or decryption.</p> <p>*aside: Often the terms "asymmetric" and "symmetric" encryption come up. When the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt a message, this is known as "symmetric" encryption. When a key is used to encrypt a message as a different key is used to decrypt the message, this is known as "asymmetric" encryption. Public/Private key encryption is considered "asymmetric".</p> <p>The private key is kept secret and used to sign data while the public key can verify what the private key signs. The public key can never be used to derive the private key and this is mathematically proven.</p> <p><em>aside: PKI infrastructure will typically use RSA public and private keys. We dig into this more later in the post.</em></p> <p>In our examples above the sender would sign a message with its private key, make its public key available to the receiver, and the receiver would verify the message utilizing the sender's public key.</p> <p>PKI is called an 'infrastructure' because it provides a trust policy in addition to authentication and encryption.</p> <p>In PKI the trust policy takes the form of a tree. At the root of the tree is the "root CA", where CA is short for certificate authority. The root can create one or more "intermediate CA(s)" by creating and signing their certificate with its own private key, providing authenticity that the intermediate CA was created by the root. This creates a chain of trust as I can confirm an intermediate is signed by its root by obtaining the root's public key and verifying the certificate's signature.</p> <p>The intermediate CA is then kept online while the root CA is kept offline. This is for security purposes, if the intermediate CA private keys are compromised they can be revoked and the collateral damage can be managed. If the root CA's key is compromised all certificates created by any CA in the tree must be revoked.</p> <p>A diagram can help provide a visual aide.</p> <p><img alt="pki hierarchy diagram" src="https://www.ldelossa.is/pki_hierarchy_diagram.png"></p> <p>Each node in the chain has both a private key and a certificate.</p> <p>PKI utilizes a standardized certificate model specified in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2459">rfc-2459</a>.</p> <p>A certificate is an envelope containing metadata and the public key of the owner. It may be used as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Sender: Signs a message with it's private key.</li> <li>Sender: Sends message to receiver.</li> <li>Receiver: Receives message.</li> <li>Receiver: Obtains the sender's certificate.</li> <li>Receiver: Verifies the certificate's authenticity by following the certificate trust chain.</li> <li>Receiver: Extracts public key from certificate and verifies message.</li> </ul> <p>Note that it is not enough to simply extract the public key and verify the message. The receiver must verify the encountered certificate was indeed signed by the issuer's private key. This is typically performed by the receiver having a local copy of popular root and intermediate certificates, extracting the public key from the one matching the issuer of the encountered certificate, and verifying the signature.</p> <p>It is worthwhile to take a pragmatic look at setting up a root CA, intermediate, and signing client certificates. A wonderful tutorial can be found <a href="https://jamielinux.com/docs/openssl-certificate-authority/">here</a></p> <h3>TLS</h3> <p>TLS utilizes PKI to implement encryption over HTTP also known as "HTTPS". TLS guarantees that every bit of data between two HTTP clients is encrypted and unintelligible to any other parties which may route the traffic.</p> <p>TLS is a protocol which exchanges asymmetric keys, generates symmetric keys, and uses the symmetric keys to encrypt data between parties.</p> <p>When a browser connects to an HTTPS website a handshake occurs. Within this handshake the server's certificate is verified and a set of symmetric keys are crafted. All communication on this secure channel is now encrypted and decrypted with the symmetric keys.</p> <p>The reason symmetric keys are used is for performance. Encrypting and decrypting with a private/public key can be expensive due to key size. Encryption and decryption can occur quicker with smaller symmetric keys.</p> <p>TLS also provides authentication.</p> <p>Each https server is assigned a client certificate. From our PKI diagram, client certificates are the leafs. When a user requests information from a server, the user's browser will check the server's certificate. If the browser cannot prove the certificate was created by a trusted root or intermediate CA the connection will fail.</p> <p><em>aside: if you ever had to install a certificate bundle to a server because ssl was failing you are installing a well known set of trusted root and intermediate certificates. This is used in the above verification process.</em></p> <p>With TLS comes maintenance. TLS certificates expire over time and must be kept up to date. Traditionally a server TLS certificate would be purchased from a well known root CA such as DigiTrust. Today, "let's encrypt" has paved the way for free certificates, albeit these certs expire much sooner then ones you can purchase from a trusted root ca.</p> <h3>JSON Web Tokens and JSON Web Encryption</h3> <p>JSON Web Tokens or JWT for short has become a popular form of authentication in modern web applications. When coupled with JSON Web Encryption both authentication and encryption can be utilized.</p> <p>The ubiquity of JWT and JSE is due to it's simplicity and ease of use. Both specifications use JSON to transfer a signed and optionally encrypted token between parties.</p> <p>This token can optionally contain claims, key/value information potentially useful for the receiving party along with several other "sections" which are base64 encoded and signed. The full details of generating a token can be viewed <a href="https://jwt.io/introduction/">here</a>.</p> <p>The flow of jwt interaction follows:</p> <ul> <li>Sender: generates the header and the payload for the JWT.</li> <li>Sender: generate the signature for the JWT utilizing a key.</li> <li>Sender: places the token in an "authorization" http header.</li> <li>Receiver: parses the "authorization" header and retrieves the token.</li> <li>Receiver: retrieves the sender's key.</li> <li>Receiver: verifies the signature portion with the sender's key.</li> </ul> <p>JWT alone provides no key transfer facilities and the token's data is in plain text. However, with JSON Web Encryption (JWE) it becomes possible to piggyback off PKI and retrieve public keys via the public key infrastructure.</p> <p>More than a high level overview is further then this post would like to go.

The choke point isn’t necessarily at the knowledge going into a model, but at the processing.”</p><p>Climate risks are important to planners, builders, government officials and businesses. The probability of a potential event combined with the severity of the event can determine things like whether it makes sense to build in a given location.</p><p>The researchers report online in <i><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.journals.uchicago.edu%2Fdoi%2F10.1086%2F711501&amp;t=NTg5ZmIyMjQxMzZmNjgyZTRkMWM1OWYzNTAzNmFkNjA5ZDQwYmNiZSxnT2UzbHMyMw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F630458526626611200%2Fsimpler-models-climate-risks&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1601469150">Philosophy of Science</a></i> that “there is a trade-off between a model’s capacity to realistically represent the system and its capacity to tell us how confident it is in its predictions.”</p><p>Complex Earth systems models need a lot of supercomputer time to run. However, when looking at risk, uncertainty is an important element and researchers can only discover uncertainty through multiple runs of a computer model. Computer time is expensive.</p><p>“We need complex models to simulate the interactions between Earth system processes,” said Vivek Srikrishnan, assistant research professor, Earth and Environmental Systems Institute. “We need simple models to quantify risks.”</p><p>According to Klaus Keller, professor of geosciences, multiple model runs are important because many events of concern such as floods are, fortunately, the exception, not what is expected. They happen in the tails of the distribution of possible outcomes. Learning about these tails requires many model runs.</p><p>Simple models, while not returning the detailed, complex information of the latest complex model containing all the bells and whistles, can be run many times quickly, to provide a better estimate of the probability of rare events. </p><p>“One of the things we focus on are values embedded in the models and whether the knowledge being produced by those models provides decision makers with the knowledge they need to make the decisions that matter to them,” said Nancy Tuana, DuPont/Class of 1949 Professor of Philosophy and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies.</p><p>Determining an appropriate model that can address the question and is still transparent is important.</p><p>“We want to obtain fundamental and useful insights,” said Keller. “Using a simple model that allows us to better quantify risks can be more useful for decision-makers than using a complex model that makes it difficult to sample decision-relevant outcomes.”</p><p>Srikrishnan added, “We need to make sure there is an alignment between what researchers are producing and what is required for real-world decision making.”</p><p>The researchers understand that they need to make both the producers and users happy, but sometimes the questions being asked do not match the tools being used because of uncertainties and bottlenecks.</p><p>“We need to ask ‘what do we need to know and how do we go about satisfying the needs of stakeholders and decision makers?’” said Tuana.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.psu.edu%2Fstory%2F633011%2F2020%2F09%2F24%2Fresearch%2Fsimpler-models-may-be-better-determining-some-climate-risk&amp;t=ODhkNmI5YTBkNmNmOTgwZDA5OWUwNmM3NDE5MzlhMDU5YmFjMWEyMCxnT2UzbHMyMw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F630458526626611200%2Fsimpler-models-climate-risks&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1601469150">Penn State</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“Why Simpler Computer Simulation Models can be Epistemically Better for Informing Decisions”,&nbsp;<i>Philosophy of Science</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1086%2F711501&amp;t=YzcxYjVjNDBkYWQwYzVmYmMyOGU0M2E0NGU4YjJhNzk0OGJmM2RmZCxnT2UzbHMyMw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F630458526626611200%2Fsimpler-models-climate-risks&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1601469150">https://doi.org/10.1086/711501</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/612636652193611776/heat-stress-2100">Heat stress could affect more than 1.2 billion people per year by 2100</a></p>

September 27, 2020 | https://risto.codes/blog/2019-10%20Object%20Oriented%20Programming | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://risto.codes/blog/2019-10%20Object%20Oriented%20Programming">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The kind of object-oriented programming most people are familiar with is usually in the style of
Java. It's unfortunate because the original concept of object-oriented programming didn't work
that way â€” it's really just a subset of functional programming.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>It's important to know a bit about the history of Erlang in order to understand why some of the
design decisions were made. Erlang was designed at Ericsson for their work on telephony switches.</p>
<div>

<blockquote>
<p>The best example is the often reported nine nines (<strong>99.9999999%</strong>) of availability offered on the Ericsson AXD 301 ATM switches, consisting of over <em>1 million</em> lines of Erlang code.  </p>
<p><em>- Learn You Some Erlang</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://risto.codes/static/images/hello-mike.png" alt="Erlang The Movie - Hello Mike"></p>
</div>

<p>All of it's features were designed with practicality in mind, since they were dealing with real
world problems: transparent distribution (horizontal and vertical scaling), code hot-swapping,
asynchronicity, soft realtime, granular supervision, fault tolerance, load balancing, live
debugging, etc.</p>
<p>Erlang is viewed as a functional language because all data structures are immutable (immutability
greatly simplifies concurrent programming), pattern matches on messages, and has first class
functions. But it's actually multi-paradigm. Some argue that the real benefit of object
oriented programming was the message-passing/actor paradigm that came from Smalltalk and Erlang.</p>
<h2 id="actors">Actors</h2>
<p>Actors are the Erlang style of object oriented programming. They are treated as black boxes â€” no
actor can mess with the internals of another actor. Instead actors communicate with other actors
asynchronously via message passing.</p>
<p>The Erlang engineers came to a lot of great insights about distributed programming, but two really
stick out: transparent distribution and fault tolerance.</p>
<h3 id="transparent-distribution">Transparent Distribution</h3>
<p>What they realized was that processes are distributed along multiple machines in large-scale real
world applications. Even if they are co-located on the same machine, often times they are basically
a black box because it's closed source, or essentially closed source because it's unknown code, or it
might migrate to another machine eventually.</p>
<p>This is where the idea of <em>transparent distribution</em> comes from. They realized that they could
greatly simplify scalability this way, as it doesn't matter if an actor is on your machine or on a
remote machine, or if it's a small thing, or if it grew into a large thing.</p>
<p>This is where the concept of <em>encapsulation</em> in object oriented programming came from. The contents
are kept hidden because <em>you can't see</em> those things, they're on another machine! and even if you
<em>could</em> see it today, <em>you might not be able to see it</em> tomorrow as things scale.</p>
<p>This is also why actors communicate asynchronously via message passing as well â€” you might be
tempted to do things syncronously when everything is on the same machine today because latency is
virtually non-existent, but tomorrow that might not be the case. It's bad news if you need to
redesign everything as things start to scale.</p>
<h3 id="fault-tolerance">Fault Tolerance</h3>
<p>Another major insight the Erlang engineers had was that in computing, especially distributed
computing, <em>things fail</em>. Types won't help you at all if the hardware fails, or someone trips
on a wire, or a solar storm happens, or a hurricane â€” you get the idea.</p>
<p>Erlang's approach to fault tolerance is inspired by Common Lisp's conditions and restarts system
(I'll cover Lisp in another blog post). Erlang errors are propagated across actors as signals, and
these signals can be actual UNIX signals like <code>SIGINT</code> and <code>SIGTERM</code>. Some of these signals won't
kill an actor, they can be safely ignored, while some of them such as exit signals will. This is
just like Common Lisp conditions.</p>
<p>In order to prevent an actor from getting killed by an exit signal, the exits (errors) need to be
trapped (caught). Trapping converts the signal into an actual message that the actor can handle.
These are like restarts in Common Lisp.</p>
<p><a href="https://learnyousomeerlang.com/errors-and-processes#its-a-trap">Learn You Some Erlang - It's a trap</a>:</p>
<pre><code><span>1&gt; </span>process_flag(trap_exit, true).
true
<span>2&gt; </span>spawn_link(fun() -&gt; linkmon:chain(<span>3</span>) end).
&lt;<span>0.49</span>.<span>0</span>&gt;
<span>3&gt; </span>receive X -&gt; X end.
{<span>'EXIT'</span>,&lt;<span>0.49</span>.<span>0</span>&gt;,<span>"chain dies here"</span>}</code></pre>
<p>It's very important to understand that this is <em>not</em> like exception handling in more mainstream
languages like Java. When an exception is caught in Java, the block continues off at a <em>lower</em> point
in the call stack, so exception handling is mostly there just to gracefully die or to completely
restart a part of the program from scratch.</p>
<p>Restarts in Common Lisp and Erlang are different. They allow you to restart at the <em>highest point
possible</em> of the program and resume with all of the state still intact! In Common Lisp, it resumes
at the stack frame <em>and</em> place where it errored with all the state still there. In Erlang, restarts
are resumed at the highest point of the program, as a message to be read by the mailbox, and also
with all the state because it's treated like a regular message by the actor.</p>
<h4 id="erlang-processes">Erlang Processes</h4>
<p>There is another feature of Erlang, <em>fast restarts</em> â€” when things go down, they should be quick to
spin back up for maximum reliability. Erlang's virtual machine, BEAM, has a construct specially
designed for that: erlang processes.</p>
<p>These aren't like OS processes or threads, but more like something in between. You can't share state
between them except via message passing, and they have unique identifiers that can span across
machines â€” sort of like a super OS process, but they're like threads in that they're lightweight
and really fast to spin up.</p>
<h4 id="supervisors">Supervisors</h4>
<p>The Erlang engineers realized that a lot of common patterns with similar solutions keep coming up,
so they created a set of libraries collectively called <strong>OTP</strong> to work well with a set of given
common patterns called behaviors (which are similar to interfaces).</p>
<p>They also realized that while trapping signals is a great technique, sometimes processes fail for
unforseen reasons, or they're better off failing entirely and restarted from scratch. Supervisors
come from OTP, and they're meant to address this. A supervisor actor can supervise one or more child
actors and perform some action(s) if they fail. Stacking supervisors on top of each other (a
supervisor supervising supervisors, etc) creates a supervision tree. This is how Erlang creates
highly fault tolerant systems.</p>
<p><a href="https://learnyousomeerlang.com/supervisors">Learn You Some Erlang - Supervisors</a>:</p>
<pre><code><span>-module</span><span>(band_supervisor)</span>.
<span>-behaviour</span><span>(supervisor)</span>.

<span>-export</span><span>([start_link/<span>1</span>])</span>.
<span>-export</span><span>([init/<span>1</span>])</span>.

<span><span>start_link</span><span>(Type)</span> -&gt;</span>
  supervisor:start_link({local,?MODULE}, ?MODULE, Type).






<span><span>init</span><span>(lenient)</span> -&gt;</span>
  init({one_for_one, <span>3</span>, <span>60</span>});
<span><span>init</span><span>(angry)</span> -&gt;</span>
  init({rest_for_one, <span>2</span>, <span>60</span>});
<span><span>init</span><span>(jerk)</span> -&gt;</span>
  init({one_for_all, <span>1</span>, <span>60</span>});</code></pre>

<p>Ocaml has mutable objects similar to Java except that mutation is more principled and explicit. And
most Ocaml engineers use modules instead, which are like a more powerful expressive objects, to
codify similar patterns.</p>
<h2 id="mutable-objects">Mutable Objects</h2>
<p>Mutable values in Ocaml objects have to be defined explicitly using the <code>mutable</code> keyword:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> stack init = <span>object</span>
  <span>val</span> <span>mutable</span> <span>value</span> = init

  <span>method</span> pop =
    <span>match</span> <span>value</span> <span>with</span>
    | hd :: tl -&gt;
      <span>value</span> &lt;- tl;
      <span>Some</span> hd
    | <span>[]</span> -&gt; <span>None</span>

  <span>method</span> push hd =
    <span>value</span> &lt;- hd :: <span>value</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre>
<p>Mutability is also more disciplined in Ocaml â€” the <code>mutable</code> value in the above example can't spill
out of the object, it can only live inside the object instance. This is like Clojure's
<a href="https://clojure.org/reference/transients">transients</a> but for objects.</p>
<h3 id="refs">Refs</h3>
<p>Another similar construct is <code>ref</code>s. This is also more principled and disciplined than mutation in
Java because <code>ref</code> is a boxed type â€” an <code>int ref</code>, for example, can't be passed to a function that
expects <code>int</code>, it has to be dereferenced first. This way mutation doesn't accidentally spill out
into the rest of your program, it's only where it's supposed to be:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> hi: <span>string</span> <span>ref</span> = <span>ref</span> <span>"hello"</span>

<span>let</span> f (x: <span>string</span>) = print_endline x

(* <span>This</span> won't compile:

<span>let</span> _ = f hi

  <span>It</span>'ll error <span>out</span> <span>with</span>:

  <span>This</span> has <span>type</span>:
    <span>string</span> <span>ref</span>
  <span>But</span> somewhere wanted:
    <span>string</span>
*)

(* <span>Dereferencing</span> hi <span>with</span> an ! will take <span>out</span> the value *)
<span>let</span> _ = f !hi
</code></pre>
<p>Type signatures are optional in Ocaml, they're only annotated in the example for clarity.</p>
<h2 id="immutable-objects">Immutable Objects</h2>
<p>Objects don't need to be mutable, even in Java. However, without the right language constructs it'll
feel really awkward:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> immutable_stack init = <span>object</span>
  <span>val</span> <span>value</span> = init

  <span>method</span> pop =
    <span>match</span> <span>value</span> <span>with</span>
    | hd :: tl -&gt; <span>Some</span> (hd, {&lt; <span>value</span> = tl &gt;})
    | <span>[]</span> -&gt; <span>None</span>

  <span>method</span> push hd =
    {&lt; <span>value</span> = hd :: <span>value</span> &gt;}
<span>end</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>{&lt; ... &gt;}</code> is syntax that produces a copy of the current object with the specified fields
updated. Immutable objects are interesting but rarely used because Ocaml has such a powerful module
system.</p>
<h2 id="module-system">Module system</h2>
<h3 id="what-its-not-for">What it's not for</h3>
<p>You can implement the same mutable stack example from earlier, but this isn't really what modules
are good at:</p>
<pre><code>module<span> type </span>INIT = sig
 <span> type </span><span>'a t and a
  val value : a t
end

module type STACK = sig
  type '</span>a t <span>and</span> a
  val pop : unit -&gt; a option
  val push : a -&gt; unit
end

module Stack (Init: INIT with<span> type </span><span>'a t = '</span>a list):
  STACK with<span> type </span>a = Init.a <span>and</span><span> type </span><span>'a t = '</span>a Init.t = struct
 <span> type </span><span>'a t = '</span>a Init.t <span>and</span> a = Init.a
  let value = ref Init.value
  let pop () =
    match !value with
    | hd :: _ -&gt; Some hd
    | [] -&gt; None
  let push hd =
    value := hd :: !value
end</code></pre>
<p>It's possible just more verbose. There are some advantages where modules allow you to express more
complex polymorphic mutable containers that regular objects can't do, but these are advanced
situations and rare. If you need to implement a stack you're better off using objects.</p>
<h3 id="for-code-organization">For code organization</h3>
<p>The module system is very useful for code organization:</p>
<pre><code>module Swatch = struct
  module Color = struct
   <span> type </span>foreground = [ `white | `lightgrey ]
   <span> type </span>background = [ `black | `darkgray ]
  end

  module Size = struct
    let small = `px 12
    let medium = `px 16
    let large = `px 24
  end

  module Font = struct
   <span> type </span>value = [ `fira_sans | `fira_code ]
   <span> type </span>t = [ `font of value ]
    let main = `font `fira_sans
    …</code></pre></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Reality is mysterious &amp; complex, and humans can’t possibly consider all of the nuance in every situation. Instead, we hastily label everything we come in contact with, pattern-matching it to an existing category that’s easy to reason about.</p>
<p>These labels create simplified ideas, or abstractions. Really, every part of our understanding is an abstraction – I don’t understand what an atom <em>is</em>, or even what I myself am (or if there is even an “I” in the singular sense). Time itself is an abstraction, yada yada yada…</p>
<p>Anyways, these abstractions are never quite perfect, and we tend to layer them on one another. I often wonder if this is what the infamous Tower of Babel story is really about. As individuals, we’ve become very specialized in our labor &amp; identity, intertwining the fabric of our society with an increasingly specific set of assumptions about our environment.</p>
<p>We’re several generations removed from the original creators of our environment (America, homo-sapiens, planet earth, the universe… take your pick). We’re all in this specific world, with amazing characteristics, and we’re forced by necessity to take most of it for granted. Nobody has time to constantly ponder the nature of money, and oxygen, and the spinning of the planet… We just agree to call it a “day” and then go about seizing it.</p>
<p>In the biblical version of the Tower of Babel, humans were rising too high, so God intervened by confusing the people’s language. They stopped understanding each other, and because they were unable to cooperate, they scattered outwards instead of building upwards. I often wonder about the nature of that intervention, because today, the result just seems inevitable.</p>
<p>Consider, metaphorically, if the tower represents a human society where each generation builds a single floor. The first floor is built by visionaries who know how hard life was on the ground, so they come together to create a foundation for their descendants to live better lives.</p>
<p>Twenty generations later, the tower looks different. People start to specialize in specific areas (plumbing, framing, decorating, etc…). Citizens rarely leave the tower to walk on bare ground.</p>
<p>Forty generations later, people have become used to these specialist products. The architects design the floors with the assumption of more specialized plumbing &amp; stronger materials. Innovation is rampant; the tower is in a golden age.</p>
<p>Sixty generations later, the tower is quite tall. Plumbers spend their entire lives specializing in a particular nuance of one small feature of the plumbing system, and the architects each design only a small corner of the overall floor. Due to a lack of general knowledge, the specialized products are the only ones available. Even though the new floors are marginally nicer, they are significantly less efficient to build due to the high price of the specialist labor.</p>
<p>Eighty generations later, the specialists have learned a new trick. They intentionally conceal the details of their designs, so that no other specialists can replicate &amp; compete with them. Initially, this only seems to accelerate the golden-age of the tower, because innovations are rewarded more generously. The only tiny side-effect is that less knowledge is available to spread… but, everyone is specialized anyways, so it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to floor 147. It’s decadent, and the specialized laborers are extremely comfortable. However, the central column of floor 92 is weakening, and its internal design is a mystery. Nobody has the exact schematics or drawings for it, and every attempt to inspect or strengthen it just makes the problem worse. One merchant used to sell a product that would strengthen it, but that merchant died, and nobody can make or source the product. A small group of people start to question the real need for the tower &amp; romanticize life on the ground…</p>
<p>If these people’s entire lives &amp; economies are built on the assumption of a tower to build, and nobody understands the floors below, then the tower’s collapse will hurl society into a Dark Age. For those lucky enough to survive, the means of production &amp; cooperation have vanished. They will be in the situation of the first-floor founders, but ill-equipped for ground life &amp; with worldviews forged in an economy that no longer exists.</p>
<p>I often wonder what floor of the tower I’m working on. Most of my code is built on mountains of abstraction. I never consider the electrons switching specific transistors – I usually don’t even know what type of computer it’s running on, or where the server is physically located. But I’m just piling on more abstraction, obeying the business incentives that reward 2 things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Encourage people to become dependent on the abstraction that my software creates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guard my intellectual property, so that users have no means to build a similar tool for themselves</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that the free software movement is really important, because it defends against incentive #2. It ensures that, when there’s trouble on floor 92, the people of 147 can at least poke &amp; prod &amp; try to make some changes. And yet, I still write a lot of non-free software, because I’m a citizen of the Tower, and that’s just what we do. This conflict is classically illustrated by Richard Stallman’s <a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/201cthe-printer-story201d-redux-a-testimonial-about-the-injustice-of-proprietary-firmware">printer story</a>.</p>
<p>It seems to me that mankind has some inherent drive to build up the world around us. While the universe tends towards entropy &amp; decay, we seek to build &amp; establish order. The humans before us have provided tools to live longer, learn faster, and build more. However, our best intentions are often distorted into means of destruction, and our pride causes us to hide the nature of our discoveries, creating dependence on our tools rather than freedom from our problems.</p>
<p>It is critically important that, as we create more tools for short-term improvement, we also include the knowledge &amp; stories necessary for long-term sustainability.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finished products are for decadent minds. His was an evolving mechanism…</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Trade offs are present in all our activities. Maybe you have heard the so called "No free lunch theorem" in Machine Learning. The theorem states that there is no silver bullet when it comes to machine learning models, but in fact, there is never a silver bullet when it comes to anything. And that is not a computer science principle but an economics principle.</p>
<p>If you have written code for more than one month is almost sure you have experienced the necessity of trade offs when programming or at least have heard about it. Sometimes you sacrifice performance in the name of security, security in the name of scalability, beauty and readability in the name of performance, and so on. Don't forget you also sacrifice parties and fun in general on the name of programming so make it worth it.</p>
<p>In the specific case of algorithms, the main resources are time and memory, so the trade offs always involve those resources. It's common to find several solutions for the same problem because one of them is faster, but the other one is cheaper when it comes to storage. Off course there are other factors like implementation, simplicity, and security. In this post I'm going to write about combining several solutions to get the one that fulfill our requirements.</p>
<p>First I'm going to show an interesting idea that E.W. Dijkstra proposed to find prime numbers. After that, I will show an idea I came up with to obtain a data structure that combines the power of arrays and linked lists. </p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>I assume you have basic programming skills as well as some knowledge about data structures like arrays, linked lists, and heaps.</p>
<p>It is necessary some notions of big-O notation to calculate complexity.</p>
<p>It would be good you were familiarized with the algorithm called Sieve of Eratosthenes, in case you don't, you can check this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sieve-of-eratosthenes/">link</a>.</p>
<p>There is no other previous knowledge required in order to understand what I'm about to say.</p>
<h2 id="two-algorithms-one-problem">Two algorithms, one problem</h2>
<p>The problem is to find all prime numbers from 0 (zero) to N. The kind of problems you learn to do when you are beginning your journey in programming.  And I want to start with the simplest solution.</p>
<p>In the naive algorithm, we iterate over all numbers <code>x</code> from 2 to N. Then we check whether <code>x</code> has any divisor besides itself and one. For the last step we can check for every number <code>d</code> between 2 and <code>x - 1</code> whether it is a divisor or not.</p>
<p>There is room for improvement in the last step because we only need to check the divisors that are less than or equal to the square root of x. A pseudocode of the algorithm is written below</p>
<pre><code>   <span>primes(N):</span>
      <span>prime_numbers</span> <span>&lt;-</span> [] 
      <span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>2 to N:</span>

               <span>prime_numbers.add(x)</span> 
       <span>return</span> <span>prime_numbers</span>
</code></pre><p>What's the runtime complexity of the previous algorithm? Well, we take every number from 2 to N and for each one we iterate over all its possible divisors, so we make <code>O(N*sqrt(N))</code> operations, where <code>sqrt</code> stands for the square root function.</p>
<p>What about memory? We only store the primes we find. For a big enough N the amount of primes is relatively small compared with N. So, let's denote the memory complexity as <code>O(Primes(N))</code>, where <code>Primes(N)</code> is the amount of primes between 0 and N. Note that this is optimum in terms of memory because we need at least to store all the prime numbers.</p>
<p>Probably you already know that there is a better algorithm to find all the prime numbers in a given range: The sieve of Eratosthenes. Let's look at it.</p>
<p>The idea is to maintain an array of length N where every entry is either false or true. If the i-th position in the array is true, then we say that <code>i</code> is a prime number, otherwise <code>i</code> is not prime.</p>
<p>We start with all positions with a true value and then, for every position, starting with <code>i = 2</code>  we make false every multiple of <code>i</code>. We end up with an array in which every position with a true value represents a prime number. The code with some optimizations is presented below.</p>
<pre><code>    primes(N):
        prime_numbers &lt;- [] # empty list
        sieve &lt;- a <span>boolean</span> list <span>with</span> length equal <span>to</span> N <span>and</span> <span>all</span> its elements <span>set</span> <span>to</span> <span>true</span>

        <span>for</span> i = <span>2</span> <span>to</span> sqrt(N): # we <span>only</span> need <span>to</span> <span>analyze</span> the numbers less than <span>or</span> equal <span>to</span> sqrt(N)
            <span>if</span> sieve[i]: # <span>if</span> sieve[i] <span>is</span> <span>true</span> <span>then</span> i <span>is</span> prime
                prime_numbers.<span>add</span>(i)
                <span>for</span> j = i*i <span>to</span> N: # we can <span>start</span> the <span>inner</span> <span>loop</span> <span>in</span> i*i
                    sieve[j] &lt;- <span>false</span>
                    j &lt;- j + i
         <span>return</span> prime_numbers
</code></pre><p>It can be proved that the algorithm described above do <a target="_blank" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-is-the-time-complexity-of-sieve-of-eratosthenes-is-nloglogn/">O(N log(N))</a> operations which is better than the naive approach. Even it can be improved to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sieve-eratosthenes-0n-time-complexity">O(N)</a>! But we need to store an array with all the N numbers, and thus, we end up with a more expensive algorithm in memory terms. Here we have the trade off: time in exchange for memory.</p>
<p>Can we design an algorithm that is faster than the naive idea but cheaper in memory terms than the sieve of Eratosthenes? </p>
<h2 id="dijkstra-and-the-production-line">Dijkstra and the production line</h2>
<p>In the 60's, E.W. Dijkstra wrote in one of his manuscripts [<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/ewd02xx/EWD249.PDF">PDF</a>] an algorithm that combines the naive and the sieve ideas. But before we talk about it, let's analyze the differences between the two previous algorithms.  </p>
<p>When applying the naive algorithm we focus on analyzing whether every number is prime or not. When applying the sieve we analyze, for every prime number, all its multiples. The difference can be illustrated with the following analogy.</p>
<p>Imagine we want to build several products, like action figures. We have two options: building them one by one or applying a line of production and in every stage we add one component of the action figure. With the latter we end up producing more in less time, but we need the "line infrastructure".</p>
<p>Dijkstra combined those ideas by analyzing a number at a time but taking advantage of the previous operations. We can maintain a pool of primes that have been already discovered, and, for each of those prime numbers store the least multiple that has not been analyzed yet. For example:</p>
<p>If we are analyzing number 6, then we have stored primes 2, 3 and 5, along with their least-not-analyzed-multiples that are: 6 for 2, also 6 for 3, and 10 for 5.</p>
<p>Then, when analyzing a new number we take the smallest multiple stored until that moment and if that multiple is greater than the new number, then we have found a new prime, otherwise we have a composite number and we need to update the multiples of the stored primes that have the new number as its least multiple.</p>
<p>We begin storing the prime number <code>2</code> with the least multiple <code>4</code> as well. Then when analyzing <code>3</code> we find that <code>4 &gt; 3</code> so <code>3</code> is prime. We store <code>3</code> along with its smallest multiple that has not been analyzed yet (<code>6</code>). When analyzing <code>4</code> we find that <code>4</code> is stored as a multiple of <code>2</code>, then we update the multiple of <code>2</code> that now will be <code>6</code>. When analyzing <code>5</code> we find that <code>6 &gt; 5</code> so <code>5</code> is a prime number and we store it along with <code>10</code>, and so on... The code is presented below.</p>
<pre><code>    <span>primes(N):</span>
        <span>primes_pool</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>Heap(</span> <span>(4,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>)</span> 
        <span>prime_numbers</span> <span>&lt;-</span> [<span>2</span>] 
        <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>3 to N:</span>
            <span>tuple</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>getMin(primes_pool)</span> 
            <span>mult</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>tuple.first</span> 
            <span>if</span> <span>mult</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>i:</span>
                <span>prime_numbers.add(i)</span> 
                <span>primes_pool.insert(</span> <span>(i*i,</span> <span>i)</span> <span>)</span> 
                <span>continue</span>
            
            <span>for t such that t is in primes_pool and t.first is equal to mult:</span>
                <span>t.first</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>t.first</span> <span>+</span> <span>t.second</span> 
        <span>return</span> <span>prime_numbers</span>
</code></pre><p>The previous method only stores the prime numbers and another number for each of those primes. So we have a memory complexity of <code>O(Primes(N))</code> which is the same as the naive idea. If we store the prime numbers along with their multiples in a structure like a heap, we get a time complexity of <code>O(N*log N)</code> which is the same as the sieve! So we got what we wanted!</p>
<p>The trick here is that we don't need to mark every multiple of the given prime but just the least multiple.</p>
<p>I need to say that this is not a practical idea in the sense that the memory complexity of the sieve of Eratosthenes is not that bad and it is a very easy to implement algorithm. My point is that sometimes you have several ideas, each of one cannot be applied because of some flaw, then maybe is a good idea to combine their strengths and you can get a hybrid applicable solution for your problem. The Factory of Primes of Dijkstra has taught me to think in that way, although I have never implemented that algorithm in real life scenarios. </p>
<h2 id="combining-arrays-with-linked-lists">Combining arrays with linked lists</h2>
<p>Arrays are simple structures that allows us to get an element by its index in constant time. But we need <code>O(N)</code> operations to insert or remove an element to/from the array in the worst case, where N is the length of the array.</p>
<p>On the other hand, linked list are structures composed by nodes. Every node has a reference to the next one, and, in the case of doubly linked list, each node has also a reference to the previous one. In this case we need <code>O(N)</code> operations to reach a node in the worst case, but the insert and remove operations can be done in constant time. I think it's natural to think about a "perfect data structure" that allows us to make the three operations in constant time. Sadly, such structure does not exist, but I have found a middle point between the two opposite poles.</p>
<p>The "issue" with arrays is that they maintain a reference to all of their elements. That allows us to retrieve any element with the same amount of operations no matter where the element is. But maintaining those references is what makes the insertions and deletions so costly. When it comes to linked lists we only maintain a reference to the first and the last node and each node has a reference to its neighbors. So, when inserting or removing a new element we only need to change a few references. But that lack of references is the cause that we have to spend so much operations to get an element in the worst case.</p>

<p>Essentially frameworks are designed to help speed up your build process and ultimately give you a clean finish.</p>
<p>As a frontend web developer, you have heard or came across a couple of frameworks, like Bootstrap, Materialize, Foundation, or maybe TailwindCSS which is our focus for today.</p>
<p>At the end of this article, you would understand what TailwindCSS is, the difference between TailwindCSS from other CSS frameworks, it's pros, and cons and how to install and use it in your project.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-tailwindcss">What is TailwindCSS</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a> is a low-level utility first CSS framework. Like Bootstrap, it is a CSS framework but unlike Bootstrap which comes straight out of the box with predefined components like cards, buttons, or dropdowns, TailwindCSS gives you a whole lot of power and flexibility with its utility classes which let you build your own components.</p>
<p>Essentially TailwindCSS doesn't have a set look or feel, where you can look at a website and tell that it was built with Bootstrap, you can't do that with Tailwind CSS, each component you see on a website built with TailwindCSS is custom to the developers taste, and that's the beauty of Tailwind CSS. </p>
<p>Let's look at an example below, to solidify your understanding of this  concept; </p>
<pre><code>    <span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"rounded shadow bg-white"</span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>In the example above we used three utility classes on our <code>div</code> element, notice how we never left our HTML file? Now let's look at how we could have done that with Vanilla CSS.</p>
<pre><code><span>div</span>{

    <span>border-radius </span>: <span>15px</span>;
    <span>box-shadow</span>: <span>2px</span> <span>2px</span> <span>5px</span> <span>rgba</span>(<span>0</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0.5</span>);
    <span>background-color</span>:white;
}
</code></pre><p>let's see a couple of other examples to spike your excitement some more;</p>
<h3 id="hover-based-classes">Hover based classes</h3>
<pre><code> &lt;a <span><span>class</span>="<span>bg</span>-<span>blue</span>-400 <span>hover</span>:<span>bg-transparent"&gt;click me!</span>&lt;<span>/a</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><h4 id="pure-css">pure CSS</h4>
<pre><code><span>a</span>{
    <span>background-color</span>: <span>#76a9fa</span>;
}

<span>a</span><span>:hover</span>{
    <span>background-color</span>: transparent;
}
</code></pre><h3 id="focus-based-classes">Focus based classes</h3>
<pre><code>  &lt;<span>input</span> <span>type</span>="text" placeholder="no outline" <span>class</span>="outline-none " /&gt;
</code></pre><h4 id="pure-css">pure CSS</h4>
<pre><code><span>input</span>{
    <span>outline</span>: <span>0</span>;
}
</code></pre><h3 id="responsive-based-classes">Responsive based classes</h3>
<pre><code> &lt;img <span>class</span>=<span>"w-16 md:w-32 lg:w-48"</span> src=<span>"..."</span>&gt;
</code></pre><h4 id="pure-css">pure CSS</h4>
<pre><code><span>img</span>{
    <span>width</span>:<span>4rem</span>;
}

<span>@media</span> (<span>min-width:</span> <span>768px</span>){
      <span>img</span>{
             <span>width</span>:<span>8rem</span>;  
     }
}

<span>@media</span> (<span>min-width:</span> <span>1024px</span>){
      <span>img</span>{
             <span>width</span>:<span>12rem</span>;  
     }
}
</code></pre><p>Now do you see the power and flexibility of TailwindCSS, just by adding a few classes, we can do something amazing where we would have otherwise have to have written more lines of code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You should already have an understanding of CSS before using TailwindCSS, TailwindCSS is not a replacement for CSS.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="how-does-tailwindcss-work">How does TailwindCSS work?</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/h3pPokP.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Tailwind works simply by converting its core styles and functionality into vanilla CSS that can be used in our HTML file. Let me further explain this;</p>
<p>We create an <strong>src</strong> and <strong>public</strong> folder in our project directory, the <strong>src</strong> folder is going to have a <strong>styles.css</strong> file in it, this file is where we import tailwinds core styles and functionalities.</p>
<p>Now at build time tailwind is going to convert those core styles and functionalities into vanilla CSS and then sent to the <strong>styles.css</strong> file in our public folder which we can use in our HTML.</p>
<p>No problem if you don't quite understand this now, as you read further, you would get a grasp of it.</p>
<h2 id="installation-and-setup">Installation and Setup</h2>
<h3 id="install-using-npm-node-package-manager">Install using npm (node package manager)</h3>
<p>let me walk you through a quick installation process and how to get tailwind CSS set up for a simple <strong>Hello world</strong> project.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have node-js installed on your computer before you can use npm. You can install node-js <a target="_blank" href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">here</a>.</li>
<li><p>Once you have node installed, create a new folder in your desktop directory or where ever you would like to have the folder.</p>
<p> let's do that from the command line using these simple steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>open up the command line </li>
<li>create a new folder with this command, <code>mkdir folder name</code></li>
<li>now go into that directory using <code>cd folder name</code></li>
<li>open up your folder in your favorite text editor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Now that you have created a new folder and navigated into it, you need to create a new <strong>package.json</strong> file using npm like so; <code>npm init -y</code></p>
<p> the <strong>package.json</strong> file helps to keep track of all your dependencies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The next step is to install tailwindCSS using <code>npm install tailwindcss</code> on the command line. This will install tailwindcss dependency into then <strong>package.json</strong> file.</p>
<p> Now you should see a <strong>node_module</strong> folder in your project folder, a <strong>package-lock.json</strong> file and you should have tailwindCSS as a dependency in your <strong>package.json</strong> file</p>
<p> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/kVmDrMl.png" alt="tailwindcss example"></p>
<p> great if you can see this, you are on the right track, let's carry on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a new <strong>src</strong> folder and <strong>public</strong> folder in your project directory.</p>
<ul>
<li>Inside the <strong>src</strong> folder create a <strong>styles.css</strong> file</li>
<li><p>now let us add tailwinds core styles into our <strong>styles.css</strong> file. We do so by pasting these directives onto our stylesheet </p>
<pre><code>  <span>@tailwind</span> base;

  <span>@tailwind</span> components;

  <span>@tailwind</span> utilities;
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Now we can we process the <strong>styless.css</strong> file in our <strong>src</strong> folder so that it can bring out a final output file in our <strong>public</strong> folder;</p>
<ul>
<li>go to your <strong>package.json</strong> file, there is a section called <strong>scripts</strong> which allows us to register different scripts into our terminal, right now you should see a <strong>test</strong> script there.</li>
<li><p>now we have to change the test script into our own script which is going to convert tailwindCSS into vanilla CSS, pretty sweet right. we can do that with the line of code below;</p>
<pre><code>  <span>"build"</span>:<span>"tailwindcss build src/styles.css -o public/styles.css"</span>
</code></pre><p>let's analyze this line of code. On the left-hand side of the colon, we have <strong>build</strong> which can be called anything we like, it is essentially the name of our script. </p>
<p>the right side of the colon holds <strong>tailwindcss build</strong> which is our tailwind package, also we have <strong>src/styles.css</strong> which is specifying our source file with the tailwind directives.</p>
<p>Then we specify our output using <strong>-o</strong> and the destination of our output file which is <strong>public/styles.css</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>now lets run our build script on the terminal, like so; <code>npm run build</code>, build here is the name of our script file which we created earlier.</p>
<p>Awesome, now we have tailwindCSS set up and working perfectly, we can now use it to finish our simple hello world project.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Create an HTML file in the <strong>public</strong> folder and have it linked to our newly built vanilla CSS file in the same folder and let's add some tailwind utilities to it, like so;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>    <span>&lt;<span>h1</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"text-4xl font-bold text-center text-blue-500"</span>&gt;</span>Hello world !<span>&lt;/<span>h1</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><h2 id="tailwindcss-vs-bootstrap">TailwindCSS vs Bootstrap</h2>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>TailwindCSS</td><td>Bootstrap</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Tailwind lets you build your own components.</td><td>Comes with predefined components.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>It is very customizable.</td><td>It is difficult to create a unique design.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="pros-and-cons">Pros and Cons</h2>
<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>utility first</li>
<li>highly flexible and customizable </li>
<li>Responsive</li>
<li>Build a beautiful responsive website without leaving your HTML</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tailwind comes with a pretty large file, and unless you purge it, you have this large file with unused CSS.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Frameworks are designed to make our lives easier, and TailwindCSS does a pretty good of that, it provides us with a lot of power and flexibility with its utility classes, to help us make very customizable components and ultimately give us a good finish.</p>
<p>You've made it to the end of this article, I hope it explains the concept of tailwindCSS to you. </p>

Open to Attack and Connected to The Kremlin<br>
<span color="#A0A0A0">Mark Zuckerberg is more dangerous than I ever imagined possible.</span></p><div>

<p>Each day, we learn another tiny detail about Russia's influence on the 2016 presidential election.  The most recent: that despite Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strong initial denial, his company sold targeted advertising services to an obvious proxy for Russian intelligence.</p><p>Even in the midst of unprecedented informational chaos, this caught my attention for two reasons.  First, Mark is positioning himself to run for President in 2020.  Second, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/01/technology/01facebook.html" target="_new">I know Mark</a>, and I have a clear position on him.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg is a sociopath.</p><p>In 2009, I entered into a settlement agreement with Mark and Facebook, Inc., just before a group of Russian oligarchs and Goldman Sachs infused $200 million into his company.  Finally, I could move on; people might believe me when I told them that I had developed The Facebook at Harvard College in late 2003â€”or so I thought.  Mark's lawyers buried <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2009/05/facebook-and-think-computer-corporation-resolve-trademark-dispute/" target="_new">the press release</a> at 11:48 P.M. on Friday night, violating our contract from the moment it was signed.</p><p>The following year, The Social Network was released nationwide, and Facebook's origin myth was cemented in the minds of everyone from students to bank CEOs.  The movie paved the way for Facebook's IPO, which despite a disastrous opening still made Mark a billionaire.  Luckily, the world grew more open and connectedâ€”sort of.</p><p>Reality tends to be more complicated than a tidy screenplay.  America today is as close to fascism as it has ever been, and Facebook played a pivotal role in that development.  So did Mark.</p><p>That is not a coincidence.  As early as 2005, I pushed Mark to focus on keeping Facebook free of spam and unwanted content; he ignored the warning and opted for growth at any cost, which remains his only concern.  I was furious when he ignored gaping security holes for weeks.  Today, these issues remain more urgent than ever.</p><p>Markets love growth and are quick to forget, especially when critics are hounded, ignored, and silenced.  As one such critic, my legal testimony was redacted and television interviews were canceled last-minute.  I was labeled a mentally ill, "jealous," "bitter," "sore loser" with a case of "sour grapes."  These barbs missed the point: not just that Mark was wrong to appropriate others' work, but that even given the opportunity to make amends when he had nothing to lose, Mark left meâ€”someone he described as an unusually smart "friend"â€”for dead.  I spent months pondering how my other friends might have handled this scenario.  None would have considered profiting without another word.</p><p>In retrospect, I was the first casualty of Mark's tendency to abuse the word "friend"â€”to treat people as though their sole purpose is his advancement.  Next, there was the Winklevoss altercation; ultimately, all of his "official" co-founders left.  By 2007, Facebook users began to notice a pattern: expansionist power grabs followed by Mark's perfunctory apologies, only to be repeated all over again.</p><p>Sociopathic behavior is de rigeur in business; perhaps this is why we let CEOs get away with crimes that would send others to prison.  Now, the stakes are higher.  Mark is signaling that he wants to run the country, and not just in a supportive role (see "NSA Prism").  He should be disqualified from running for office.</p><p>The immediate issue is that Mark surely knew that Facebook had a connection to Russia at some point long before the company's admission.  What did he know when?  Was he aware of a crime or cover-up?  Why has the media been so slow to ask?</p><p>One reason is that after thirteen years, there has never been a true mainstream media accounting of Facebook's birth.  Had The Social Network been honest, it would have followed a pathological liar lacking remorse and respect for law.  After "befriending" me and copying many aspects of my work for profit, Mark searched my Facebook for the Winklevosses, who I didn't know, to see if I had been working with them.  He then launched his site, and used the Facebook passwords of the very Crimson reporters heaping praise upon him to break into their Harvard e-mail accountsâ€”a brazen violation of federal law.  He actually wrote, "You can be unethical and still be legal that's the way I live my life haha."  He called his users "dumb," plus an expletive.  He raised millions from investors, but avoided informing me that he'd changed his mind about not wanting to start a company.  Now, he doesn't want to run for officeâ€”<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/26/mark-zuckerbergs-best-advice-finding-your-purpose-isnt-enough.html">he just wants us all to have "purpose."</a></p><p>If this kind of deception sounds familiar, it's because Mark and Donald Trump have something in common.  They have the same condition and apologists with buckets of excuses: "youth," "inexperience," "candor," "genius."  Both have manipulated their way out of countless outrageous situations, such as <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2003/11/4/hot-or-not-website-briefly-judges/" target="_new">objectifying women</a>, and both have enabled other sociopaths.  The Social Network was made possible by author Ben Mezrich, a fake news pioneer who audaciously boasts that truth is whatever he believes it to be.</p><p>Sociopaths have always been threats to democracy; that is why the founding fathers were so concerned about checks and balances.  Yet it is doubtful that they ever imagined their ingenious protections being trumped by a network of con men, connected only by illness and the internet.</p><p>We need to get better at examining candidates for these hallmark traits, and most importantly, at holding leaders accountable.  With Mark in charge, we can safely assume that almost everything we know about Facebook is a lie, from its advertising revenue to its account statistics.  We can also assume that there will be more lies, more victims, and more sociopaths eager to hop on the bandwagon of Mark's success.</p><p>Donald Trump's modus operandi is now familiar to us all.  Mark's is really no different.  He nearly destroyed my life.  Don't let him destroy the country.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><em>This is a guest post from Mia de Búrca. Enjoy.</em></p>



<p>Dear new developer,</p>



<p>You’re probably going to want to quit.</p>



<p>The very qualities that make writing software appealing can also make it frustrating beyond belief. You’re headed down this path because you like to be challenged, to learn and grow. However, facing new harder problems day in, day out can take its toll on your morale. And keeping up to date, familiarising yourself with the breadth and depth of topics in this domain – it can be overwhelming. But if you’re reading this it’s likely you’ve already felt the deep satisfaction of writing code to be proud of, so I hope that by sharing my experiences, from early in my career and from a few weeks ago, you will be motivated to push through and keep enjoying the journey.</p>



<p><strong>The Import</strong></p>



<p>One of the first times I nearly quit was a few weeks into my first role as a dev. I was fortunate enough to land a great job at a small startup, and I was pretty awe struck by the talented and motivated people on my team. So after a while of pairing, I picked up a piece of work to try on my own. After doing some copy-pasta from other files and then tweaking I was chuffed and attempted to view the web page that would now be perfect, right?</p>



<p>Much to my dismay I was met with a blank page and an obscure error message. Baffled, bit by bit I undid all my changes, at each step feeling less worthy of the job, until nothing was left except one measly import statement. I could feel myself go red in the face as I still couldn’t understand what was going on. I should be able to do this, but I’m not good enough. Eventually, I turned to my mentor to admit defeat, and my panic dissolved when he said “oh yeah, this one is definitely confusing” then casually pointed out a simple syntax error. I realised that unlike him, I was not yet equipped with the necessary debugging skills, I was not yet familiar enough with the language I was working in to decode the error message. It takes time.</p>



<p><strong>The Library</strong></p>



<p>It has been four years since the import statement that stumped me, but just a few weeks ago, when I volunteered to update a library which was many versions behind, this seemingly trivial task wound up with me ready to quit yet again. Between a broken development environment, failing tests (was it the tests… or the code?), and still this library integration that refused to obey, I was at a loss. I should be able to do this, I should be good enough by now surely? These thoughts drove me to stubbornly dig my heels in and devote hours to diving into the library source code, reading in circles, dipping in and out of StackOverflow, getting more and more frustrated. Much time wasted I was no better off, so I went and made myself a cup of tea and called up a colleague and good friend to lament my problem. Typically, within seconds of this accidental rubber ducking session the solution to my worries became apparent.</p>



<p><strong>The Lessons</strong></p>



<p>And I could probably list countless other occasions. There may be many different things that leave you feeling like quitting, for me it often boils down to not feeling good enough to tackle a problem. But when you come up against a roadblock, you shouldn’t see it as a reflection on your own ability. If like me you find yourself paralysed by feelings of inadequacy, recognise that the foundation of all programming is problem solving – if there were no annoying problems, you wouldn’t have a job – and as you progress through your career you will gain more tools to solve them. Step back and remember, when it comes to tech, there is a reason to be found – sometimes it takes time, distance, or some help to see it.</p>



<p>These are lessons you should try to internalise, or like me you’ll relearn them throughout your career. You can’t change the fact that deeply frustrating problems are coming your way. You can only change your perspective. Put your energy into solving the problem and don’t assume that you’re not good enough. “Good enough” is an arbitrary concept, an ever moving goalpost. Give up on the notion of “good enough” and instead give yourself some time.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Mia</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>An HTTP <em>router</em> (also called <em>multiplexer</em>) is responsible for listening to HTTP requests and invoking the appropriate handler based on matching criteria like HTTP method or URL.</p>
<p>Go provides a very simple router called <code>ServeMux</code> but it's <em>so</em> basic that most developers opt to use a third-party replacement like <a href="https://github.com/gorilla/mux"><code>gorilla/mux</code></a>. For any real-world project, I'd likely do the same. However, <strong>today we're going to learn a few things by building our own!</strong> 😎</p>
<h2 id="what-were-building">What We're Building<a href="#what-were-building">#</a></h2>
<p>There are a few things we're going to want our router to do:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>404 Handler:</strong> Serve a 404 response for non-matching requests</li>
<li><strong>Matching:</strong> match on URL path and HTTP method and invoke route handler</li>
<li><strong>Parameters:</strong> extract dynamic URL parameters like <code>/users/(?P&lt;id&gt;\d+)</code></li>
<li><strong>Panic Recovery:</strong> Catch Go <em>panics</em> and respond with a 500</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's a snippet showcasing all the functionality we need.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><code><span>r</span> <span>:=</span> <span>NewRouter</span><span>()</span>

<span>r</span><span>.</span><span>Route</span><span>(</span><span>"GET"</span><span>,</span> <span>"/"</span><span>,</span> <span>homeRoute</span><span>)</span>
<span>r</span><span>.</span><span>Route</span><span>(</span><span>"POST"</span><span>,</span> <span>"/users"</span><span>,</span> <span>createUserRoute</span><span>)</span>
<span>r</span><span>.</span><span>Route</span><span>(</span><span>"GET"</span><span>,</span> <span>"/users/(?P&lt;ID&gt;\d+)"</span><span>,</span> <span>getUserRoute</span><span>)</span>
<span>r</span><span>.</span><span>Route</span><span>(</span><span>"GET"</span><span>,</span> <span>"/panic"</span><span>,</span> <span>panicRoute</span><span>)</span>

<span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ListenAndServe</span><span>(</span><span>"localhost:8000"</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<h2 id="basic-routing">Basic Routing<a href="#basic-routing">#</a></h2>
<p>To start, we'll build a router that simply returns a 404 response for every request.</p>
<p>We want our router to handle every HTTP request that comes into the web server, which we can do by passing it into Go's <code>http.ListenAndServe</code> method. <code>ListenAndServe</code>'s second argument is an <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Handler"><code>http.Handler</code></a>, which is responsible for handling every incoming request. To make this possible, our router will need to implement the <code>Handler</code> interface.</p>
<p><code>Handler</code> only declares a single method <code>ServeHTTP</code> so let's create a struct to match it.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><code><span>type</span> <span>Router</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>sr</span> <span>*</span><span>Router</span><span>)</span> <span>ServeHTTP</span><span>(</span><span>w</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ResponseWriter</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Return 404 for every request</span>
    <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>NotFound</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>And, just like that, we have a router type that can be used anywhere an <code>http.Handler</code> is accepted. Let's see what it looks like in a runnable program.</p>
<div>

<span>// ~~~~~ Router ~~~~~ //</span>

<span>type</span> <span>Router</span> <span>struct</span><span>{}</span>

</code></pre></div>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
                </details>
            
        </div>
        
<p>If we run this program using <code>go run main.go</code> from the command line, we can open <a href="http://localhost:8000/">localhost:8000</a> in our web browser and verify it responds with "404 page not found."</p>
<h2 id="matching-routes">Matching Routes<a href="#matching-routes">#</a></h2>
<p>There isn't much use for a router that always returns a 404, but now we have a strong foundation to build on. The next step is to modify our router to store a list of routes that can be matched against.</p>
<p>For every incoming request, we'll need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Extract HTTP method and URL path from the request</li>
<li>Check if any routes exist that match the method and path</li>
<li>Invoke the route if there is a match</li>
<li>Return a 404 if no match is found</li>
</ol>
<p>So, we'll need to store three things for every route. (1) The HTTP method for the route, (2) the path for the route, and (3) the handler function to call if we find a match.</p>
<p>Let's make another struct called <code>RouteEntry</code> to store these three things together.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><code><span>type</span> <span>RouteEntry</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Path</span>    <span>string</span>
    <span>Method</span>  <span>string</span>
    <span>Handler</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>HandlerFunc</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>We also need to update <code>Router</code> to store a list of <code>RouteEntry</code>. To improve the experience of using our router, we'll add a helper function called <code>Route</code> to do the work. The route function will create a new <code>RouteEntry</code> and add it to the list of routes.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><code><span>type</span> <span>Router</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>routes</span> <span>[]</span><span>RouteEntry</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>rtr</span> <span>*</span><span>Router</span><span>)</span> <span>Route</span><span>(</span><span>method</span><span>,</span> <span>path</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>handlerFunc</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>HandlerFunc</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>e</span> <span>:=</span> <span>RouteEntry</span><span>{</span>
        <span>Method</span><span>:</span>      <span>method</span><span>,</span>
        <span>Path</span><span>:</span>        <span>path</span><span>,</span>
        <span>HandlerFunc</span><span>:</span> <span>handlerFunc</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>rtr</span><span>.</span><span>routes</span> <span>=</span> <span>append</span><span>(</span><span>rtr</span><span>.</span><span>routes</span><span>,</span> <span>e</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>And finally, we'll need to write the logic inspect the incoming request and find which route matches. </p>
<p>There are two obvious places to put the matching logic—either in <code>Router</code> itself or in the <code>RouteEntry</code>. Either of these locations would work, but making <code>RouteEntry</code> responsible for matching seems sensible, since it stores the criteria to match on.</p>
<p>So let's add a <code>Match</code> method to the <code>RouteEntry</code> struct. Since we're matching based on information on the request we'll make request an argument. And, to indicate a successful match, we'll have it return a boolean.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><code><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>re</span> <span>*</span><span>RouteEntry</span><span>)</span> <span>Match</span><span>(</span><span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span> <span>bool</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>Method</span> <span>!=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>Method</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>false</span> <span>// Method mismatch</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>URL</span><span>.</span><span>Path</span> <span>!=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>Path</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>false</span> <span>// Path mismatch</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>true</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>Now, all the router needs to do is loop over all the routes that it has and check to see if one of them matches.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><code><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>rtr</span> <span>*</span><span>Router</span><span>)</span> <span>ServeHTTP</span><span>(</span><span>w</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ResponseWriter</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>e</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>rtr</span><span>.</span><span>routes</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>match</span> <span>:=</span> <span>e</span><span>.</span><span>Match</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>)</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>!</span><span>match</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>continue</span>
        <span>}</span>

        <span>// We have a match! Call the handler, and return</span>
        <span>e</span><span>.</span><span>HandlerFunc</span><span>.</span><span>ServeHTTP</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>// No matches, so it's a 404</span>
    <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>NotFound</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>To make sure this all works, we can add a simple route to handle the home page <code>/</code>.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><code><span>r</span> <span>:=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>Router</span><span>{}</span>
<span>r</span><span>.</span><span>Route</span><span>(</span><span>"GET"</span><span>,</span> <span>"/"</span><span>,</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>w</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ResponseWriter</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>w</span><span>.</span><span>Write</span><span>([]</span><span>byte</span><span>(</span><span>"The Best Router!"</span><span>))</span>
<span>})</span>
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>When we put it altogether and run it with <code>go run main.go</code>, we can verify that it works by navigating to <a href="http://localhost:8000/"><code>localhost:8000/</code></a> in a web browser. You should see it respond with "The Best Router!" as expected. Any other path will still return the 404 response correctly.</p>

<p>We now have a router that is actually fairly useful! 🥳 There are just a couple features left to add to take it to the next level.</p>
<p>Most API's that deal with creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) data need to define routes with dynamic parameters. For example, a route that URL to fetch a user by ID might look like <code>/users/10</code> where <code>10</code> is the ID of the user. In our current router, we'd have to define a fixed route for every possible user ID we'd ever want to fetch, which is not practical. What we actually need is a way to define a route with a dynamic part <code>/users/?</code>. That's what we're going to implement now.</p>
<p>To perform dynamic matching, we're going to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expressions</a>—the epitome of dynamic matching.</p>
<h2 id="accessing-parameters">Accessing Parameters<a href="#accessing-parameters">#</a></h2>
<p>Before we dive into regular expressions, though, let's begin by talking about how the extracted parameters will be accessed by the route handlers. After all, a <code>fetchUserRoute</code> will need to be able to pull the ID out of the URL to fetch the correct user.</p>
<p>Luckily, Go provides a mechanism to store short-lived data on the request object called <em>context</em>. Using this mechanism, the router can add the parameters to the request context for the handler to read when it's invoked.</p>
<p>Here's an example of how a handler might access a parameter. Note that, since accessing things on the request context is a bit cumbersome, we'll also create a helper function to reduce duplication.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><code><span>r</span><span>.</span><span>Route</span><span>(</span><span>"GET"</span><span>,</span> <span>`/hello/(?P&lt;Message&gt;\w+)`</span><span>,</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>w</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ResponseWriter</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>message</span> <span>:=</span> <span>URLParam</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>"Message"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>w</span><span>.</span><span>Write</span><span>([]</span><span>byte</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello "</span> <span>+</span> <span>message</span><span>))</span>
<span>})</span>

<span>// URLParam extracts a parameter from the URL by name</span>
<span>func</span> <span>URLParam</span><span>(</span><span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>ctx</span> <span>:=</span> <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>Context</span><span>()</span>

    <span>// ctx.Value returns an `interface{}` type, so we</span>
    <span>// also have to cast it to a map, which is the </span>
    <span>// type we'll be using to store our parameters.</span>
    <span>params</span> <span>:=</span> <span>ctx</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span><span>(</span><span>"params"</span><span>).(</span><span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>]</span><span>string</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>params</span><span>[</span><span>name</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>Okay, so we now have a plan for accessing the parameters. Now we can move on to the fun part—using regular expressions. 💪🏻</p>
<h3 id="matching-with-regexp">Matching with Regexp<a href="#matching-with-regexp">#</a></h3>
<p>As you might have noticed in the previous snippet, we're going to be storing parameters in a <code>map[string]string</code>, where each key in the map is the parameter name and the value is the value extracted from the URL. Conveniently, regular expressions have named groups that are perfect for this use case. In Go, we can match these named groups using the <code>FindStringSubmatch</code> method.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><code><span>r</span> <span>:=</span> <span>regexp</span><span>.</span><span>MustCompile</span><span>(</span>
     <span>`/books/(?P&lt;AuthorID&gt;\d+)/(?P&lt;BookID&gt;\d+)`</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>match</span> <span>:=</span> <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>FindStringSubmatch</span><span>(</span><span>"/books/123/456"</span><span>)</span>
<span>if</span> <span>match</span> <span>==</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>match</span><span>)</span>           <span>// [123, 456]</span>
<span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>.</span><span>SubexpNames</span><span>())</span> <span>// [AuthorID, BookID]</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>There has been a lot of good content on regenerative agriculture practices being adopted in the past decade. In the book, “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Revolution-Bringing-Soil-Back/dp/0393608328" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Revolution-Bringing-Soil-Back/dp/0393608328" target="_blank">Growing a Revolution</a>“, David R. Montgomery discusses many of the core ideas of regenerative agriculture, but the central theme of the book is stopping the mining of our soils for monoculture agriculture and instead start to adapt practices that <em>grow</em> or repair soil through organic matter and related compounds. A core argument made is that these ‘regenerative’ practices can not only be sustainable (for the environment), but they can also be profitable (for the farmer) so it is implied the difficult part is <em>convincing</em> and <em>educating</em> modern farmers on these practices so they can <em>see it to believe it</em>. </p>



<p>I think most of the arguments are correct, but I don’t think regenerative agriculture will scale unless its properly incentivized. The book posits, correctly, that fertilizer companies (such as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.mosaicco.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="http://www.mosaicco.com/" target="_blank">Mosaic</a> and <a href="https://www.kochind.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.kochind.com/">Koch Industries</a>) and other inputs companies will do as much as possible to avoid losing revenue and try to rally farmers around using high rates of inputs. It is not a hard sell as farmers are businessmen themselves and need to be profitable in the short-term (whatever their long-term goals may be). Therefore modern agriculture can be crudely summarized as turning natural resources into money catalyzed by synthetic fertilizer and chemicals. Most parties admit this is not sustainable long-term, so agriculture finds itself trying to shoe-horn in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cropwatch.unl.edu/2019/cover-crops-and-carbon-sequestration-benefits-producer-and-planet" data-type="URL" data-id="https://cropwatch.unl.edu/2019/cover-crops-and-carbon-sequestration-benefits-producer-and-planet" target="_blank">sustainable practices</a> into the status-quo with mixed success. The fact remains modern agriculture has a double whammy of depleting soil resources and adding carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere.</p>



<p>This blog has made the argument the government <em>should </em>have a<em> </em>vested interest in long-term sustainability of its agriculture (a national security asset as well) and has historically proven to fund it as such–<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fy2020-budget-summary.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fy2020-budget-summary.pdf" target="_blank">the USDA budget circa 2020 is ~145B</a>. At issue is the large majority of agriculture subsidies go toward maize, soybeans, wheat, and cotton in some way shape or form (<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/12/31/790261705/farmers-got-billions-from-taxpayers-in-2019-and-hardly-anyone-objected" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/12/31/790261705/farmers-got-billions-from-taxpayers-in-2019-and-hardly-anyone-objected" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about ~20B worth in 2019</a>). The path of least resistance to getting regenerative agriculture practices scaled up to the United States 300M acres of land is via the government. We <span>cannot</span> ask farmers to adapt economically risky (but environmentally healthy) ‘unconventional’ practices. To be clear, ‘unconventional’ means they are unconventional in profitable modern row crop agriculture operations. Montgomery’s book highlights several farmers that show you can be profitable adopting these practices, but I would argue these first adopters would be successful in virtually any farming scheme and likely represent top 10% ‘performers’.</p>



<p>This chart below from the USDA describes the major uses of land. The two biggest changes that <span>can</span> be incentivized through USDA subsidies (again, the money is already there we just need to redirect it) are <em>paying</em> <em>farmers directly</em> to put marginal ground or high-risk ground (e.g. highly eroded, highly sloped, within <em>X</em> feet of waterways) into the ‘Idle Cropland’ category. We cannot simply take the land and profit generated from a farming operation and pull a rug out. This is a lose-lose for the farmer. <span>All</span> parties should win (farmers by making profit on marginal/high-risk ground, the government protecting it soil and water resources, U.S. citizens by sequestering carbon emissions, and rural communities who rely on agriculture land tax dollars). Many communities in those states with yellow circles in the second chart rely on agriculture land for it tax purposes; if we want the farmers to change their practices, it must be incentivized. USDA subsidies are a natural thought experiment. For this reason, an eminent domain approach is a non-starter. The government cannot take away the only resource many of these states have and leave them holding the bag without serious civil unrest ensuing.</p>

<p>Most people generally scoff at suggesting this can be solved via the USDA. It is true there are many private businesses trying to solve problems related to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nori.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://nori.com/" target="_blank">sequestering carbon</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.soilwarrior.com/blog/easiest-way-to-switch-to-strip-till" data-type="URL" data-id="http://www.soilwarrior.com/blog/easiest-way-to-switch-to-strip-till" target="_blank">selling regenerative agriculture friendly machines</a>, but it is clear monetizing these practices is going to be difficult (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&amp;rlz=1C1GCEU_enUS855US855&amp;ei=5n9mX9D9AZW5tQapvKaYCA&amp;q=cover+crops+startups&amp;oq=cover+crops+startups&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIFCCEQoAE6BAgAEEc6AggAOgUIABCRAjoLCAAQsQMQgwEQkQI6CAgAELEDEIMBOggILhDHARCjAjoICC4QsQMQgwE6BQgAELEDOgsILhCxAxDHARCjAjoHCAAQsQMQQzoECAAQQzoECC4QQzoKCC4QsQMQgwEQQzoICC4QxwEQrwE6AgguOgYIABAWEB46CAghEBYQHRAeOgUIABDNAkoFCDcSATFKBQgkEgExULg4WPJQYMFWaAFwA3gAgAGUAYgBwQ-SAQQxNS43mAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesgBCMABAQ&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQiM-onPbrAhWVXM0KHSmeCYMQ4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&amp;rlz=1C1GCEU_enUS855US855&amp;ei=5n9mX9D9AZW5tQapvKaYCA&amp;q=cover+crops+startups&amp;oq=cover+crops+startups&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIFCCEQoAE6BAgAEEc6AggAOgUIABCRAjoLCAAQsQMQgwEQkQI6CAgAELEDEIMBOggILhDHARCjAjoICC4QsQMQgwE6BQgAELEDOgsILhCxAxDHARCjAjoHCAAQsQMQQzoECAAQQzoECC4QQzoKCC4QsQMQgwEQQzoICC4QxwEQrwE6AgguOgYIABAWEB46CAghEBYQHRAeOgUIABDNAkoFCDcSATFKBQgkEgExULg4WPJQYMFWaAFwA3gAgAGUAYgBwQ-SAQQxNS43mAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesgBCMABAQ&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQiM-onPbrAhWVXM0KHSmeCYMQ4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5" target="_blank">check out the startups scene for cover crop companies</a>). One of the principles of regenerative agriculture is to <em>reduce</em> your input cost, and this is at odds with for-profit companies (who rely on <em>increases</em> in input cost to grow). This is why I continue to argue giant, existing multinational input companies will not solve agriculture’s sustainability problems–if done right, they will end up cutting themselves off at the knees. A new business model will be needed, or the government simply admits protecting it agriculture land it important and adapts the <span>profit-neutral, benefit-positive</span> stance of subsidizing these regenerative practices.</p>



<p>We are seeing this play out in real-time. A flurry of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://agfundernews.com/fbn-launches-free-membership-and-its-answer-to-ag-carbon-credit-markets.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://agfundernews.com/fbn-launches-free-membership-and-its-answer-to-ag-carbon-credit-markets.html" target="_blank">startups</a> are pivoting to ‘carbon markets’ and established <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://agfundernews.com/cargill-wants-to-help-farmers-turn-over-10-miilion-acres-to-regenerative-ag-by-2030.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://agfundernews.com/cargill-wants-to-help-farmers-turn-over-10-miilion-acres-to-regenerative-ag-by-2030.html" target="_blank">big players</a> are in the game. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/technical/emkts/?cid=nrcseprd1396024" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/technical/emkts/?cid=nrcseprd1396024" target="_blank">government</a> to its credit is also trying to understand the market (albeit slowly) and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/USDATB1939_07072014.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/USDATB1939_07072014.pdf" target="_blank">measurements</a>. One supposed key problem is the quantification of measuring carbon and how much one is sequestering versus alternate scenarios. This hang-up is missing the point and partly why I think <span>no current approach will be the winner</span>. Everyone want to use ‘their model’ in ‘their system’ matched in ‘their marketplace’ so that they can continue to use that customer interaction (and all the data collected) to generate additional revenue. This is a smart business decision for individual companies, but it will absolutely prevent a true market from forming due to severe fragmentation. But from a common sense and societal point of view, we can to protect our land and water. The highest value acres to take out of annual production are next to waterways and those with high water tables along with acres that contain soil that is susceptible to leeching nitrates. All of these acres can be merged into one data tool. These are win-win acres for sequestering emissions <em>and</em> protecting water resources. The USDA (and probably most large multi-national agriculture input companies) knows who owns and farms these acres. From the above graph, a simple plan would be to target 30M of our most at risk acres, <span>pay</span> the farmers and landowners $250 per acre to plant a perennial native species for a total cost of only 7.5B. They money already exists in either private or public sector or a joint effort. There would be little argument from farmers and landowners when they are generating $250 of revenue. We’ll figure out the exact equation in time, but common sense tells us this can be a good starting point.</p>



<p>The simple fact remains that <a href="https://secondnature.org/climate-action-guidance/purchasing-carbon-offsets-faqs/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://secondnature.org/climate-action-guidance/purchasing-carbon-offsets-faqs/">current markets are pricing carbon at $1-10 an acre</a>, with the majority being in the $3-$6 range. This will <span>not</span> compete with modern agriculture where landowners can simply collect cash rent <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/Highlights/2018/2018LandValuesCashRents_Highlights.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/Highlights/2018/2018LandValuesCashRents_Highlights.pdf" target="_blank">ranging from $150-300</a>. Land that is highly sloped, highly eroded, near important waterways needs to be priced competitively to accomplish 2 tasks: offset carbon and improve water quality. Until we get carbon buyers to understand this, verification methods, and ‘walled garden’ carbon marketplaces are merely noise on the scale of United State agriculture.</p>

This doesn’t really matter if you’re using a webcam, but by the end of this post, you might have a good enough camera that it matters.</p></li></ol><p>I wrote a whole post of its own on how to troubleshoot your home network for video calls, but realistically, most connection problems are because <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/wireless/">wifi sucks</a> and you can avoid them by not using wifi. So, first try running an <a href="https://amzn.to/3luTVdV" target="_blank">Ethernet cable</a> between your computer and your router. If you still notice high latency or your connection dropping, or if you really can’t run a cable for some reason, <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/vcnet/">check the guide</a> for more troubleshooting advice.</p><h2 id="audio">Audio</h2><p>Video improvements are flashy and noticeable, but audio is the reason you’re having the call, thus ultimately more important. So audio comes first.</p><h3 id="get-away-from-other-people">Get away from other people</h3><p>This is a basic prerequisite for everything below. Coworking spaces and cafés are nice if you plan to be silent all day, but will make natural-feeling meetings impossible due to your crippling self-consciousness about noise levels. If you’re going to be on a call for more than 5 minutes, get your own space.</p><p>(If you are committed to taking your meetings in a crowded and noisy space, ignore the rest of the audio section. You’re mostly just doomed to crappy calls in this case, though you might be able to limit the damage by getting <a href="https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/BoomProMic--v-moda-boompro-microphone-communication-mic-for-headphones" target="_blank">a nice headset mic</a> and installing <a href="https://krisp.ai/" target="_blank">krisp.ai</a>.)</p><p>If you’re talking to someone else who’s in a noisy environment, you can apparently also use krisp.ai to filter their audio yourself, though I haven’t tried this.</p><h3 id="get-full-duplex-audio-with-no-echo">Get full-duplex audio with no echo</h3><p>One key ingredient to making voice conversations feel “natural” is that both participants need be able to talk and hear the other person talking at the same time (“full-duplex audio”). Full-duplex audio is important because it allows you to talk simultaneously (“overlap”) with the other person.</p><p>You might think that overlap should be rare, because interrupting someone else is rude. While that’s true of large-scale overlaps, we often use small-scale overlaps to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn-taking#Overlap" target="_blank">negotiate conversational turn-taking</a> (e.g. starting talking when the speaker is trailing off but hasn’t finished), or to signify that we’re paying attention (“uh-huh,” “yeah”).</p><p>The hard problem of full-duplex audio is that if someone else is talking, their voice is going to come out of your computer’s speakers and go back into your microphone. If your computer leaves the microphone on, in that case, it’ll end up playing back an “echo” of their own voice to them, which is extremely annoying. So video call tries to filter out feedback from your speakers into your microphone, which is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_suppression_and_cancellation" target="_blank">echo cancellation</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, removing <em>only</em> the speaker echo from your microphone stream is really hard to do. So instead, the software often ends up completely muting your mic if someone else is talking. If you’ve ever tried to micro-overlap with someone and noticed that their audio cut out briefly, that’s what’s going on.</p><p>If your listeners can’t overlap with you, it’s harder to tell whether they’re following along, and it’s harder to negotiate whose turn it is to speak. This makes the conversation feel less natural, especially in larger groups.</p><p>To get full-duplex audio, you need to (a) have an audio setup that doesn’t produce echoes, then (b) convince your video call app not to try to suppress echoes.</p><p>(a), “an audio setup that doesn’t produce echoes,” means that your microphone should not pick up any sound from your speakers. In practice this means that your “speakers” must be headphones.</p><p>(b), “convince your video call app not to try to suppress echoes,” seemed surprisingly tricky when I tried to research it, because each video call app has its own heuristics for when to engage echo-cancellation.</p><p>So I did my own tests of echo cancellation Zoom, Skype, and Hangouts in Chrome and Firefox. I started a chat between two computers, both with headphones attached—a setup that should have required no echo cancellation. I then played music into the microphone of one computer. On the other, I spoke into the microphone and listened for whether the music got quieter.</p><p>Zoom, Skype and Hangouts in Firefox all seemed to slightly decrease the audio volume when I spoke, indicating light echo cancellation. For Hangouts in Chrome, the audio cut out <em>completely</em> every time I said anything. In Zoom, I was able to eliminate all echo cancellation by selecting the “use original audio” option, which you can also permanently enable for particular audio devices—I’d recommend doing this.</p><h3 id="throw-your-wireless-headset-in-the-trash">Throw your wireless headset in the trash</h3><p>The gear I recommend in this guide is all wired, not Bluetooth. While Bluetooth seems like it should be great, in practice it has <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/wireless/">horrible problems with audio latency, quality and reliability</a>. Also, I don’t think wireless open-back headphones (see below) exist.</p><p>If you finished the previous paragraph and still think you can get away with using wireless audio gear, read the post at the link :)</p><h3 id="hear-yourself-clearly-with-open-back-headphones">Hear yourself clearly with open-back headphones</h3><p>Most headphones are <em>closed-back</em>, which means they form an acoustic seal over your ear that attenuates outside sound. This is good for “noise isolation” when you’re listening to music. But it’s bad in calls because it also isolates you from your own voice, making you sound muffled and unnatural to yourself. (The same thing also happens with any earbuds that form a seal, i.e. pretty much everything except EarPods or non-Pro AirPods.)</p><p>Personally, without the feedback from hearing myself, I also tend to start speaking louder or shouting on calls. This tires out my voice, and can get stressful for whoever I’m <del>shouting at</del> talking to.</p><p>To avoid this, you can buy <em>open-back headphones</em>, which have mesh instead of a closed covering over your ears. I bought the <a href="https://amzn.to/3bULynH" target="_blank">Philips SHP9500</a>, which I like a lot; I haven’t tested any other pairs. (I chose a low-end pair because for …</p></article></div>

<![CDATA[Thoughts on Structured Editing: Breaking Away from Syntax]]>

September 27, 2020 | https://mbuffett.com/posts/structured-editing-syntax/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mbuffett.com/posts/structured-editing-syntax/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>I was aimlessly browsing Github and came across
<a href="https://github.com/kneasle/sapling">sapling</a>, a very early-stage structured
editor. It was inspired by <a href="http://shtanton.com/ex.html">this blog post</a>, which
talks about structured editing.</p>
<p>Structured editing has had my interest for a while. I’ve put a lot of time and
effort into getting really good at text editing, but I’m holding out hope that
in 10 years plaintext editing will be outdated. The idea behind structured
editing is to edit code instead of text, so instead of “move cursor to next
parentheses, delete in parentheses”, you’d have operations like “change function
argument”.</p>
<h2 id="formatting">Formatting</h2>
<p>With auto-formatters like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt">rustfmt</a>,
<a href="https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/">gofmt</a>, and <a href="https://prettier.io/">prettier</a>,
some of the promise of structured editors have been achieved in regular editors.
Because now the ambiguity of syntax is eliminated by formatters. These editors
take the text, transform it into an AST (abstract syntax tree), and then print
the AST, using their formatting rules.</p>
<p>Conveniently, they provide an easy way to get started with creating a structured
editor. Ex. since rustfmt can already print an AST, why not use the output of
rustfmt to display the AST in a structured editor. I added some syntax
highlighting to rustfmt and got something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://mbuffett.com/rust.png"></p><h3 id="customization">Customization</h3>
<p>I’m not a semicolon fan; sometimes I wish Rust was written python-style, with
newlines meaning new statement, instead of semicolons representing the end of a
statement. It’s always a pain when
I forget a semicolon, and I wish my editor would just automatically insert them
for me. Since they’re always followed by a newline, they’re just a wasted character, in my mind.</p>
<p>Well now I’ve got this alpha structured editor, how about I just remove
the semicolons when printing the AST? Obviously I couldn’t do this in a
plaintext editor, since the code wouldn’t be valid. But the underlying AST is
the same regardless of how I print it, so let’s print without semicolons:</p>
<p><img src="https://mbuffett.com/no-semicolons.png"></p><h3 id="taking-it-further">Taking it further</h3>
<p>There’s so many details of a language that matter more
than syntax; performance, type system, available libraries, community, standard
library, dev tools, etc. Unfortunately, syntax is the first thing people see,
and therefore gets a disproportionate amount of attention. There’s also the
inertia of C-style syntax; languages that want to have any chance of being
popular have to use curly brackets for blocks, parens for invocations, dots for
method access, etc.</p>
<p>I think structured editors offer an escape from this. For example, here’s the
same example from above, with the same AST, but with python-esque syntax instead:</p>
<p><img src="https://mbuffett.com/python.png"></p><p>Now when learning Rust coming from Python, I wouldn’t need to learn about
implicit returns, or re-learn that <code>{}</code> means a block, instead of <code>:</code>. The
underlying AST has the <code>block</code> and <code>return</code> nodes, and I can view them however
I’m most comfortable. This would free up time to learn more important things,
like lifetimes and borrowing.</p>
<h2 id="other-syntax-thoughts">Other syntax thoughts</h2>
<h3 id="unicode-symbols">Unicode symbols</h3>
<p>Some languages, like Haskell, have embraced unicode symbols. Using <code>∀</code> instead
of <code>forall</code>, or <code>→</code> instead of <code>-&gt;</code> is becoming more popular. The problem is
that these are a lot harder to type. With a structured editor, you wouldn’t be
typing these anyway, so it’s no longer such a tradeoff between unicode and ASCII
characters.</p>
<h3 id="non-text-representations">Non-text representations</h3>
<p>When you have an editor representing an AST, you’re not limited to text to
convey information. For example, instead of writing <code>mut foo</code> for mutable
params to a function, you may want mutable params to have a squiggly line below
them. Or maybe you want a graph-like representation of your code instead of
text, to get an idea of which functions call which other functions.</p>
<h3 id="parsing-considerations">Parsing considerations</h3>
<p>Part of the discussion around Go generics involved the use of <code>&lt;&gt;</code> brackets for
generics, like in other languages. If you use angle brackets, seeing a <code>&lt;</code> means
you then have to determine whether what follows is a type or an expression,
which results in unbounded lookahead, something the compiler devs wanted to
avoid for performance reasons. So now Go developers have to get used to seeing
and using <code>[]</code> brackets for generics. If structured editors and ASTs were used
instead, not only would there not be a parsing step at all, eliminating the
unbounded lookahead problem, but Go developers could use whatever generic
annotation they like.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Don’t know if I have much of a conclusion, besides that I hope
that syntax will continue to lose importance as a defining characteristic of a
language. It’s already been losing importance with auto-formatters. In the
languages I use where auto-formatters are the norm, I’ve seen way less
bikeshedding about spaces vs tabs, bracket styles, trailing commas, etc.</p>

<p>The <strong>recent v1.5</strong> is a new update which revises
many of the earlier chapters as well as adding new content
in real analysis, measure theory, and algebraic geometry.
It is however even more visibly incomplete,
with several chapters scheduled but not yet written.
In addition, many chapters still lack problems or solutions.</p>

<p>I would very highly appreciate any corrections, suggestions, or comments.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Napkin project is a personal exposition project of mine
aimed at making higher math accessible to high school students.
The philosophy is stated in the preamble:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll be eating a quick lunch with some friends of mine who are still in high school.
They'll ask me what I've been up to the last few weeks, and I'll tell them that I've been learning category theory.
They'll ask me what category theory is about.
I tell them it's about abstracting things by looking at just the structure-preserving morphisms between them, rather than the objects themselves.
I'll try to give them the standard example Gp, but then I'll realize that they don't know what a homomorphism is.
So then I'll start trying to explain what a homomorphism is, but then I'll remember that they haven't learned what a group is.
So then I'll start trying to explain what a group is, but by the time I finish writing the group axioms on my napkin, they've already forgotten why I was talking about groups in the first place.
And then it's 1PM, people need to go places, and I can't help but think:</p>
<p><em><span>Man, if I had forty hours instead of forty minutes, I bet I could actually have explained this all.</span></em></p>
<p>This book is my attempt at those forty hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This project has evolved to more than just forty hours.</p>

		<p>Sometime in November, or maybe early December, depending on the temperatures, Korean families will set aside a weekend for gimjang (김장), the annual kimchi-making.&nbsp;<span id="more-22755"></span>There are so many kinds of kimchi that you can make each season, but gimjang is special. It’s the time of year when families make the&nbsp;beloved and versatile pogi kimchi (포기김치) to&nbsp;be eaten year-round. Gimjang takes place&nbsp;after Chuseok (추석, the fall harvest holiday) and before the winter frost sets in. It’s a group affair—everyone pitches in, and these days more men are helping out, too. Recently, one of Seoyoung’s friends invited us out to her family’s gimjang&nbsp;at the end of November deep in the mountains of North Chungcheong Province.</p>


<p>“My brothers and I go home every year to help our mom with gimjang,” Eugene explains at the train station. Her parents moved from the city out to the countryside a few years ago, following a return-to-the-land <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/08/03/428102390/tired-of-the-seoul-sucking-rat-race-koreans-flock-to-farming">trend</a>&nbsp;called guinong (귀농). “It’s a lot of work, though,” she adds, looking concerned. “You know we make about 150 pogi (포기, heads of cabbage).” Just to put that in context, for an extended family of eight, Seoyoung’s mom usually made around 70 pogi.</p>

<p>We arrive at the farm late at night and wake up early the next morning to a landscape&nbsp;muffled in&nbsp;mist. The air is just cold enough to keep you awake. Eugene’s mother had already begun the first steps the night before, cutting and brining the cabbages in 40 kilos of salt.</p>

            <article>
    
    <p>February 26, 2015</p>

    <p>Ever wonder what exactly is inside a font? We know it contains letters — or actually, drawings of letters, but what else is in there? Well, why not crack one open and see, and while we’re there, find a way to make this world a little less buzzwordy?</p>

<h2 id="laying-out-our-plan">Laying out our plan</h2>

<p>We’re going to create a font called <a href="http://www.sansbullshitsans.com/">Sans Bullshit Sans</a> and it’ll do something like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://pixelambacht.nl/img/sans-bullshit-sans-in-action.gif" alt="A text full of buzzwords is being typed out, with all the buzzwords being replaced with a sign saying 'bullshit'"></p>

<p>When using Sans Bullshit Sans, every buzzword will be replaced by a Comic Sans-styled censorship bar. And the cool part is, we won’t be using CSS or JavaScript for this, but plain ol’ OpenType font technology.</p>

<p>We’ll need three things for this project:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A font we can examine and edit</li>
  <li>Tools that allow us to edit fonts with a texteditor</li>
  <li>Our own ligatures</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ll take care of step one right away. Since we’re more or less reverse-engineering a font, we need one that allows us to legally do this. I decided on the open source font <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Droid+Sans">Droid Sans</a>, as its Apache license allows us to modify and redistribute it afterwards. Download it and save it to your favorite font hackin’ directory.</p>



<p>Most font tools focus on the designey part of fonts: drawing the actual letter shapes, and tweaking their details like kerning and hinting. Think of them like Photoshop for fonts: very graphical and with quite a steep learning curve.</p>

<p>But there is another way to edit fonts. Once they have been saved as a TTF, they hold all their data in a special format. This is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType">OpenType format</a>, in which each letter has its own occurrence in various <em>tables</em>, each describing a specific property of that letter.</p>

<p>For example, the <em>glyf</em> table holds information about the shape of the characters in a font — it actually stores a drawing for each character. Other tables hold different info: the name of the type’s designer, the maximum height of the font, or which combinations of letters should be replaced by a ligature.</p>

<p>Fonts are binary files, generally unsuitable for being picked apart by humans. So if we want to look at those tables, we better translate them into something more readable, like plain text. Luckily for us, there’s TTX/Fonttools, a command line tool that converts fonts to XML and vice versa. The XML document can be opened, read, and edited with your favorite text editor and is actually quite readable for us humans.</p>

<p>You can download the original version on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fonttools/">Sourceforge</a>, but I recommend <a href="https://github.com/behdad/fonttools/">a fork by Behdad Esfahbod</a>. It’s actively maintained and gets bugfixes and new features (for instance, decoding of the <a href="http://pixelambacht.nl/2014/multicolor-fonts/">new color tables</a>. Follow either page’s installation instructions, or <a href="http://glyphrstudio.com/ttx/">this detailed one</a> for Windows.</p>

<h2 id="looking-under-droid-sans-hood">Looking under Droid Sans’ hood</h2>

<p>With TTX/Fonttools installed, let’s fire it up and have it decode Droid Sans:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>ttx DroidSans.ttf</code></pre></figure>

<p>TTX/Fonttools translates all the binary data in <code>DroidSans.ttf</code> to XML. While it does so, the output looks a little like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">Dumping <span>"DroidSans.ttf"</span> to <span>"DroidSans.ttx"</span>...
Dumping <span>'GlyphOrder'</span> table...
Dumping <span>'head'</span> table...
Dumping <span>'hhea'</span> table...
Dumping <span>'maxp'</span> table...

<p>You can see that besides the <em>glyf</em> table we talked about, there are about 18 other tables in Droid Sans. Some fonts have less, some more, but there’s always a basic set of tables that are needed for a valid font.</p>

<p>These tables hold every single detail about the font: a list which letters are in the font, the shapes of the letters, the name of the font — everything. Let’s take a quick look at Droid Sans’ <em>head</em> table, which contains global information about the font:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;head&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;!-- Most of this table will be recalculated by the compiler --&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;tableVersion</span> <span>value=</span><span>"1.0"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;fontRevision</span> <span>value=</span><span>"1.0"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;checkSumAdjustment</span> <span>value=</span><span>"0x2e9ffae7"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;magicNumber</span> <span>value=</span><span>"0x5f0f3cf5"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;flags</span> <span>value=</span><span>"00000000 00011111"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;unitsPerEm</span> <span>value=</span><span>"2048"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;created</span> <span>value=</span><span>"Mon May 17 19:56:38 2010"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;modified</span> <span>value=</span><span>"Fri Jul  9 07:55:05 2010"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;xMin</span> <span>value=</span><span>"-352"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;yMin</span> <span>value=</span><span>"-492"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;xMax</span> <span>value=</span><span>"1966"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;yMax</span> <span>value=</span><span>"1907"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;macStyle</span> <span>value=</span><span>"00000000 00000000"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;lowestRecPPEM</span> <span>value=</span><span>"8"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;fontDirectionHint</span> <span>value=</span><span>"2"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;indexToLocFormat</span> <span>value=</span><span>"0"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;glyphDataFormat</span> <span>value=</span><span>"0"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/head&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/head.htm">This table is required</a> for all OpenType fonts, and contains info like the minimum and maximum size for all glyphs in the font, and the number of units per em, which is the grid the glyphs are drawn against.</p>

<p>For now we’re only interested in those units per em:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;unitsPerEm</span> <span>value=</span><span>"2048"</span><span>/&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>When we create our ligatures, we’ll use the same value. That way the dimensions of our characters, most importantly the vertical height, will match up precisely with that of Droid Sans.</p>

<p>For now we leave the TTX file for what it is. We’ll come back to it later when we add our actual ligatures.</p>

<h2 id="designing-our-ligatures">Designing our ligatures</h2>

<p>This is the plan: we have <a href="http://ngenworks.com/blog/250-buzzwords-we-love-to-hate/">a list of buzzwords</a>, and we’re going to (ab)use the OpenType feature of <em>ligatures</em> to replace those words with something of our own choosing: a sign that says “bullshit”:</p>

<p><img src="http://pixelambacht.nl/img/bs-medium.svg" alt="Crude hand drawn black bar with the word 'bullshit' written over it"></p>

<p>A ligature is when a string of characters (or a sequence of <em>glyphs</em> representing those characters) are replaced by one single glyph:</p>

<p><img src="http://pixelambacht.nl/img/infinite.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>Ligatures improve legibility: instead of awkwardly overlapping parts of the letters (like the upper curve of the <em>f</em> and the dot of the <em>i</em>), the type designer can create a custom shape that looks a lot nicer. Another function of ligatures is joining letters in a different way in handwritten or brush typefaces. Fun fact: the well known ampersand, <em>&amp;</em>, was originally a ligature for “et”, meaning “and” in Latin.</p>

<p>Not all fonts offer ligatures: it’s the choice of the type designer, or the distributor of the font, to create or include them. For instance, Google’s web versions are stripped of ligatures so they result in smaller files. Type aficionados might cringe, but it makes sense: ligature support in web browsers is still kinda shaky, so it would be a waste to have people download stuff they can’t use.</p>

<p>For ligatures to work, a font has to have a <em>GSUB</em> table (the Glyph Substitution table), which has entries about which combination of letters should be replaced by a ligature. It’ll say “for the letter combination <em>f</em> and <em>i</em>, show the <em>fi</em>-ligature.”</p>

<p>We’re going to use this table to turn words like “synergy” into a “bullshit”-ligature.</p>

<p>It’s probably worth noting that what we’re doing here is far from proper use of the ligature functionality. True type-folks will rightfully scoff at this juvenile misuse of a feature like this, but I thought it was a neat way to learn about how fonts work.</p>

<p>With that disclaimer out of the way, let’s draw three ligatures — one for short words, one for medium words, and one for long words. Fire up Illustrator or any other vector drawing tool that can save SVGs, and draw our soon-to-be ligatures:</p>

<p><img src="http://pixelambacht.nl/img/three-bullshits.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>Looking good? I think so. Let’s turn these into ligatures!</p>

<h2 id="turning-svg-files-into-a-font">Turning SVG files into a font</h2>

<p>We now have three SVG files and a reverse-engineered font waiting for ‘em. But even though both SVG and glyphs are vector images, they’re different formats, so we can’t just copy them over. We need to convert them to something OpenType can understand.</p>

<p>To do this, I find it easiest to create a new font from our SVGs, with specs matching our target font. If we’d pass that font through TTX, we can simply copy-and-paste the parts of the XML.</p>

<p>To create a font from SVGs, we can choose from a wide range of command line tools, web apps, or full-fledged font editors. I used the web based tool <a href="http://icomoon.io/">Icomoon</a>.</p>

<p>The steps are straightforward: create a new empty font, import the SVG images, and export the font. All Icomoon’s settings can be left on default, except the units per em. If we keep those the same as Droid Sans’, we can simply copy our glyphs over without recalculating dimensions and offsets. On the download screen, click the preferences-button and head over to the font metrics. Under “Em square height” we fill in 2048, the number we noted from Droid Sans.</p>

<p>To make creating our own ligatures a lot easier, we already define one for each SVG. Click the “fi” button on the top of the screen to enable ligatures for our font, and you’ll see an input field appear for each character. Enter a word, like “ninja” for the smallest ligature, to create a <em>GSUB</em> table entry that we’ll use as blueprint for our word list.</p>

<p>We’re ready to download the font! Unzip it, and move the TTF over to your font hackin’ directory.</p>

<h2 id="transplanting-our-ligatures">Transplanting our ligatures</h2>

<p>We now have a font that contains only our three bullshit drawings — no letters, no punctuation marks, no icons, just our bullshit images. At this point, they’re mapped to characters in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Use_Areas">Unicode’s PUA</a> (0xE600, 0xE601 and 0xE602). As you will see in a minute, these codes also make up their internal name.</p>

<p>Next step: moving our bullshit characters over to Droid Sans. We do this by converting <code>bullshit.ttf</code> to <code>bullshit.ttx</code> so it’s openable in our favorite text editor. This is the same thing as we did with Droid Sans:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>ttx bullshit.ttf</code></pre></figure>

<p>We don’t need everything in this TTX file. All the data we’re interested in is contained in five tables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GlyphOrder (entry GlyphID)</li>
  <li>hmtx (entry mtx)</li>
  <li>cmap (entry map)</li>
  <li>glyf (entry TTGlyph)</li>
  <li>GSUB</li>
</ul>

<p>As we seen before, each table handles one specific feature or detail for each of the characters in a font. Let’s take a look:</p>

<h3 id="table-one-glyphorder">Table one: GlyphOrder</h3>

<p>This is a table generated by the TTX/Fonttools tool, and is not part of the OpenType spec. It simply lists all the characters inside the font. The glyph ordering is stored explicitly-but-implicitly in the <em>glyf</em> table, TTX/Fonttools just makes it easier for you to reorder them by giving you this <em>GlyphOrder</em> table.</p>

<p>We need to take our two entries in <code>bullshit.ttx</code> and stick ‘em to the end of the <em>GlyphOrde…</em></p></article></div></div>

									<p>This summer, Google has been deploying its AI voice assistant called Duplex to call bars and restaurants in order to update their opening hours on Google Maps listings.<br>
Here’s a call their system had with our virtual assistant for restaurants.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/460586741" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>As far as we’re aware, this is the <strong>first naturally-occurring conversation between AI voice assistants in the wild</strong>. I have never seen anything like this before, and I’m incredibly proud that PolyAI is sharing this moment in computing history with our friends from Google.</p>
<p>After listening to the call, we’d say that it went pretty well! Google could have handled the two-part opening hours a bit better, but overall, the interaction was smooth. I want to share a few thoughts on what this means for the future of conversational technologies.</p>
<h3>Human language is a Universal API</h3>
<p>This interaction did not need to be a conversation in the way that we as humans think of it. The caller’s request was transactional and to the point. An API call or an HTTPS request between two web services would have done the job in 150ms, instead of two minutes of synthesized voice going back and forth across the telephone line. However, such APIs are not always available, or standardised. For instance, there are dozens of reservation APIs for restaurants used in the UK alone, and voice assistants will never integrate with every single one.</p>
<p>This kind of machine-to-machine conversational communication will become more commonplace as AI deployment accelerates. And while it may seem like an overkill from a technical standpoint, there are good reasons for these kinds of interactions to be conversational, rather than API calls.</p>
<p>Imagine you ask your virtual assistant — Siri or Alexa, for example — to book a hotel room. It can phone multiple hotels to check availability and book without having to integrate into each hotel’s individual booking API. And logs of the conversation can inform the user of alternative venues for their next trip.</p>
<h3>Welcome to the Uncanny Valley</h3>
<p>Google introduced <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html">Duplex in May 2018</a> as an ‘AI system for accomplishing real-world tasks over the phone’. You may have seen this video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5VN56jQMWM">Sundar Pichai at Google I/O</a> using Duplex to make a restaurant reservation.</p>
<p>I’ll be the first to point out how incredible Google’s TTS (text-to-speech) is in the Duplex/PolyAI call. It sounds like a human, much more so than our assistant does.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">Uncanny Valley theory</a>, the more human-like a robot is, the more likely people are to feel positive towards it. However, at a certain point of human-likeness, the robot becomes a bit creepy, and people are repulsed by it.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.polyai.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/uncanny-valley.png" alt="" width="588" height="387" srcset="https://www.polyai.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/uncanny-valley.png 588w, https://www.polyai.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/uncanny-valley-300x197.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px"></p>
<p>In the Google/PolyAI call, Duplex really does sound like a human – it does mention that it’s an automated service, but this is not enough. Why? Because crossing the Uncanny Valley means that a person on the call will treat the bot as though they are human.</p>
<p>Around the 1 minute mark, you’ll hear our voice assistant ask the caller when they’d like to come in, and Duplex speaks over it. In reality, these are machines – no-one’s getting offended. But when you listen to the call, the Duplex bot comes across as pretty rude. Because it sounds so human, it’s practically impossible to not attribute human qualities to the bot. And no one wants a rude voice assistant representing their company.</p>
<p><strong>Making customers think that your voice assistant is a real human is a sure-fire way to deliver frustrating customer experiences. At PolyAI, we work hard to make sure our voice assistants sit at the peak right before the Uncanny Valley – but without crossing it. Warm and friendly enough to put callers at ease, but not real enough to cause cognitive dissonance.</strong></p>
<h3>The Future of Voice</h3>
<p>Companies are wising up to the benefits of conversational AI in customer communications, and we’ll see a growing number of instances of machines communicating in human language. While this type of transactional communication may seem better suited to quick API calls, voice assistants can get the job done even when such APIs are not available.</p>
<p>We are super excited about the future of voice assistants. Two highly sophisticated voice assistants have now met in the wild, in a rerun of the legendary “Dr Livingstone, I presume” moment (though neither assistant realised they were speaking to one of their own). This is a sign of great things to come. Stay tuned – and get in touch with us if you want to build a great voice assistant for your brand.</p>

<p>W000t, b4.0 is here! This is a major release with a pile of new features and improvements, including our first cut of WiFi networking support as well as file system support! All in, this release includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Basic WiFi Networking</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Basic File System</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Serial Port Fixes</strong></li>
  <li><strong>CLI/USB deployment overhaul</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Garbage Collector Improvements</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="updating">Updating</h2>

<p>This release requires an OS update as well as IDE extension updates. We recommend updating on a Windows machine in Visual
Studio if you have access to one, but the manual steps for macOS and Linux are provided as well.</p>

<h3 id="windows-instructions">Windows instructions</h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Due to a bug in the VS for Windows IDE Extension, you must update manually in order to get WiFi networking working.</p>

<!--
### Windows instructions

1. Download/update [VS Tools for Meadow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WildernessLabs.vsmeadow01) extension.
1. Connect the device in normal mode and click "Check Version".
1. If you are on OS version 0.3.12 or later, you must first "Erase Flash".
1. Click "Download Meadow OS".
1. Next, reconnect the device in bootloader mode and then "Flash Device".
-->

<h4 id="post-build">Post-build</h4>

<p>A bug in msbuild is causing <code>System.Net.Http.dll</code> to not copy to the Output Directory. A temporary workaround is to add a post-build step to the project by adding the following to your csproj file within the <code>Project</code> node:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&lt;Project Sdk="Meadow.Sdk/1.1.0"&gt;
    ...
    &lt;Target Name="PostBuild" AfterTargets="PostBuildEvent"&gt;
      &lt;Exec Command="copy C:\Users\[YOUR_FOLDER]\.nuget\packages\wildernesslabs.meadow.assemblies\0.3.2\lib\net472\System.Net.Http.dll  $(OutDir)" /&gt;
    &lt;/Target&gt;
&lt;/Project&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<!--### macOS/Linux Manual Instructions-->

<h4 id="manual-update-instructions">Manual Update Instructions</h4>

<p>First, go to the <a href="http://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Meadow/Getting_Started/Downloads/">Downloads page</a> and download the Beta 4.0 Meadow.OS binaries, the Beta 4.0 CLI, and the Meadow network binaries.</p>

<p>Unzip everything to a common folder, the instructions below assume the OS and network binaries are in the same folder and the CLI is in a <code>Meadow.CLI</code> subfolder relative to the OS binaries.</p>

<p>Open a terminal window and execute the following steps. Please note that if you don’t have DFU-Util
installed, you can find instructions on how to install it <a href="http://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Meadow/Getting_Started/Deploying_Meadow/DFU/">here</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Connect Meadow in normal mode</li>
  <li>Disable mono (may need to run twice if you get an exception the first time).
<code>mono ./Meadow.CLI/Meadow.CLI.exe -s /dev/tty.usbmodem01 --MonoDisable</code></li>
  <li>Erase flash:<br>
<code>mono ./Meadow.CLI/Meadow.CLI.exe --EraseFlash --KeepAlive</code><br>
 This will take a few minutes. After it says “Bulk erase completed,” hit space to exit.</li>
  <li>Connect Meadow in bootloader mode (hold down the BOOT button)</li>
  <li>Copy the new Meadow.OS.bin using dfu-util:<br>
<code>dfu-util -a 0 -S [serial] -D Meadow.OS.bin -s 0x08000000</code></li>
  <li>Reset F7</li>
  <li>Disable mono (may need to run twice if you get an exception the first time).
<code>mono ./Meadow.CLI/Meadow.CLI.exe -s /dev/tty.usbmodem01 --MonoDisable</code></li>
  <li>Upload new Mono Runtime<br>
<code>mono ./Meadow.CLI/Meadow.CLI.exe --WriteFile -f Meadow.OS.Runtime.bin --KeepAlive</code><br>
 After “Download success,” hit space again.</li>
  <li>Move the runtime into it’s special home on the 2MB partition<br>
<code>mono ./Meadow.CLI/Meadow.CLI.exe --MonoFlash --KeepAlive</code><br>
 After “Mono runtime successfully flashed,” hit space to exit.</li>

<code>mono ./Meadow.CLI/Meadow.CLI.exe --Esp32WriteFile -f bootloader.bin --McuDestAddr 0x1000</code></li>
  <li>Upload the ESP32 partition table:<br>
<code>mono ./Meadow.CLI/Meadow.CLI.exe --Esp32WriteFile -f partition-table.bin --McuDestAddr 0x8000</code></li>
  <li>Upload the ESP32 Meadow Comms application:<br>
<code>mono ./Meadow.CLI/Meadow.CLI.exe --Esp32WriteFile -f MeadowComms.bin --McuDestAddr 0x10000</code></li>
  <li>Reset F7</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="meadowos-improvements">Meadow.OS Improvements</h2>

<h3 id="networking">Networking</h3>

<p>Basic WiFi networking is up! Check out our <a href="http://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Meadow/Meadow_Basics/Networking/">Networking guide</a> for more information!</p>

<h4 id="networking-known-issues">Networking Known Issues</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>SSL not supported</strong> - Currently, only unencrypted traffic is supported via HTTP. We’re working on TLS support.</li>
  <li><strong><code>HttpServer</code> not available</strong> - <code>HttpClient</code> has been tested and is fully supported, but we’re still working on <code>HttpServer</code> support.</li>
  <li><strong>Network scans require a network connection</strong> - Due to a limitation in the API, you must first connect to a WiFi network before attempting a scan.</li>
  <li><strong><code>HttpClient</code> memory leak</strong> - Each <code>HttpClient.Request</code> incurs a <code>~5k</code> memory leak on the ESP32 coprocessor, so after a number of requests it will no longer be functional. If requests become unresponsive, a call to <code>Device.InitWiFiAdapter()</code> will reset the ESP32 coprocessor and get things running again.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="file-system">File System</h3>

<p>You can now use the <code>System.IO</code> file system calls to do basic file system operations such as create, open, and delete files on the onboard flash device. For more infomation, see the <a href="http://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Meadow/Meadow_Basics/File_System">File System guide</a>.</p>

<h4 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Non-persistent during deployment</strong> - Currently, during IDE deployment, all non app-related files are purged from flash. In a near future release, all files within a special app folder will be excluded from file purging. In the meantime, if you need to persist files between app deployment, you can use Meadow.CLI to manually deploy a new app.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="garbage-collector-improvements">Garbage Collector Improvements</h3>

<p>Our Garbage Collector work is almost done now; the Mono GC works in most use cases and has been tuned for the Meadow device. We still have an outstanding
deadlock to solve, but generally apps should stay alive for hours, days, or weeks, depending on memory allocation.</p>

<h3 id="other-known-issues">Other Known Issues</h3>

<p>Due to a configuration issue with UARTs that we’re investigating, <code>D02</code> and <code>D05</code> are pulled <code>HIGH</code> on Meadow.OS startup. All other pins are pulled <code>LOW</code>.</p>

<h3 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

<h2 id="meadowcli--deployment-improvements">Meadow.CLI &amp; Deployment Improvements</h2>

<p>We did a big rearchitecture of our host comms layer on the Meadow, which is the part of the Meadow.OS
stack that handles USB deployment and other CLI tasks. We refactored host comms out of the process that
runs Mono and hosts Meadow applications. We also changed how Meadow applications are launched so that
the Mono Virtual Machine is in its own isolated process.</p>

<p>The upshot of this is that deployment should be more reliable and a crashing Meadow app shouldn’t tear
down the host communications.</p>

<h2 id="meadowfoundation">Meadow.Foundation</h2>

<p>Meadow.Foundation has new peripheral drivers to play with, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://developer.wildernesslabs.co/docs/api/Meadow.Foundation/Meadow.Foundation.Sensors.Hid.Mpr121.html">Mpr121</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://developer.wildernesslabs.co/docs/api/Meadow.Foundation/Meadow.Foundation.Sensors.Distance.Vl53l0x.html">Vl53l0x</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://developer.wildernesslabs.co/docs/api/Meadow.Foundation/Meadow.Foundation.Sensors.Camera.Vc0706.html">Vc0706</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="minor-update-on-sg90-servos">Minor update on SG90 Servos</h4>

<p>We adjusted the frequency for the SG90 micro servos that comes in the hack kit, so when using the <code>NamedServoConfigs.SG90</code> enum, you will see the servos wont twitch when using <code>Rotate To(int degrees)</code> and have full 180 degree range;</p>

<h4 id="updates-on-graphics-library">Updates on Graphics Library</h4>

<p>We also added and improved several APIs in the Graphics Library including the ability to draw quadrants and rounded rectangles.</p>

<h4 id="characterdisplay-now-supports-i2c">CharacterDisplay now supports I2C</h4>

<p>If you have an LCD character display comes with an I2C backpack, you can now instantiate a CharacterDisplay object passing an II2cBus, reducing eight Digital IO pins to just two for I2C.</p>

In one, the lesson focuses on how a caption differs from a title or a subtitle, in that it’s a “label for a picture.” The children clamor to know more about the pictures themselves: What’s the shark eating? What planet is that? But the teacher deflects their questions, trying to get the six-year-olds to focus on locating the captions.</p><p>In the other classroom, children listen in fascination as their teacher reads a book about mummies. In passing, the teacher points out a caption on a photo of a sarcophagus. But the focus is on mummies: how they were preserved, how scientists can tell that they had used hair gel or eaten vegetable soup when they were alive. At the end, the kids are full of questions, which the teacher answers until it’s time to stop.&nbsp;</p><p>The first class reflects the now standard approach of focusing on “comprehension skills” like finding the main idea, making inferences or identifying text features like captions. The theory is that kids who master these skills will, later on, be able to use them to acquire knowledge from their own reading—and to do well on high-stakes standardized reading tests.</p><p>As a result, the subjects that could build kids’ knowledge—social studies, science, the arts—<a href="http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational_leadership/mar11/vol68/num06/High-Stakes_Testing_Narrows_the_Curriculum.aspx">have, over the last twenty years, been edged out</a> to make more time for comprehension skill practice. But as cognitive scientists&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/25/opinion/sunday/how-to-get-your-mind-to-read.html">have discovered</a>, the key factor in comprehension isn’t skill; it’s subject-specific knowledge and vocabulary. And so, for all its good intentions, the approach that now dominates public schools across America only ends up further penalizing disadvantaged students. (Comprehension, of course, is only one aspect of reading. Children also need to learn how to sound out words—and there are huge problems with the way many schools teach that, also with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apmreports.org/episode/2020/08/06/what-the-words-say">a disproportionately negative impact</a> on disadvantaged students.)</p><p>Children from wealthier and better educated families are likely to pick up the background knowledge they need to understand a wide variety of texts at home. Their parents are better able to provide enriching experiences and engage them in conversations that involve sophisticated concepts and vocabulary. Such kids start school better equipped to understand more complex books. And because knowledge tends to build on related knowledge, they’re able to acquire more knowledge through their reading, allowing them to read even more complex books.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, their less advantaged peers fall farther behind every year. By high school, the gap between these two groups is huge—as is the gap between what teenagers are assumed to know and what many actually do. At high schools serving low-income populations, students may arrive unaware of the difference between a city and a state or a country and a continent, or confuse the Civil War with the Civil Rights movement. That’s because they have not been taught these things early enough.</p><p>Testing may have exacerbated the focus on skills over content. But the roots of the obsession with skills go deeper. They rest on suspicion of the very idea that knowledge should be transmitted.</p><p>For decades, prospective teachers have been inculcated with the belief that it’s better for students to discover knowledge for themselves than to have someone explain things to them. Storing information in your head, they are told, is unnecessary since students can always look up what they need; besides, kids find facts boring. Far better, the theory goes, to focus on skills like comprehension and critical thinking. And many educators are skeptical of&nbsp;<em>any&nbsp;</em>prescribed curriculum on the grounds that teachers should be guided by the interests of their particular students.</p><p>Learners do need to participate in constructing their knowledge, and students who are merely lectured at can become disengaged. But we can’t assume that all elementary students will acquire the&nbsp;information they need for themselves. For children starting out with limited knowledge of the world, this approach is often a dead end.</p><p>When students are new to a topic, direct instruction&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1">works best</a>. Factual knowledge&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/Crit_Thinking.pdf">is also a prerequisite</a> for critical thinking: the more knowledge you have relating to a topic, the better equipped you are to think about it critically. And despite the current pedagogical consensus, kids are excited about discovering things and learning facts. As for following students’ interests, kids rarely express interest in subjects they don’t know anything about—and they often become intensely interested in new topics if they’re explained in an engaging way.</p><p>Another objection to foregrounding content is that it may reflect political or cultural bias. That objection isn’t new. An effort to craft voluntary national history standards in the 1990s foundered when right-wingers denounced them as being anti-American and focusing too squarely on marginalized groups. Conversely, leftists have, since at least the 1980s, expressed concerns that students of color will not feel represented if the knowledge covered in schools is too “Eurocentric,” or if all the books they study are written by dead white males.</p><p>Now, the old battles over historical and cultural content are being reignited. In some quarters, attributes like rational, linear thinking and an emphasis on the written word are <a href="https://www.amny.com/opinion/cathy-young-nyc-diversity-1-31720835/">being</a> denounced as part of&nbsp;<em>white culture</em>. Donald Trump is making “left-wing indoctrination” in the nation’s schools a campaign issue,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-white-house-conference-american-history/">citing</a>, among other things, the New York Times’ 1619 Project, which has inspired a&nbsp;<a href="https://pulitzercenter.org/lesson-plan-grouping/1619-project-curriculum">curriculum</a> focused on the history and legacy of slavery. To avoid battles over “whose” knowledge to teach, even some who acknowledge the defects of a skills-focused curriculum may feel the need to stick with it.&nbsp;</p><p>But if we don’t provide all children with access to the knowledge that children of the elite routinely acquire, we will continue to preserve, not lessen, social inequities. One group of students—and adults—will understand references to key cultural touchstones while others will feel mystified and excluded.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the past few years, some new curricula for elementary schools have put the emphasis on building knowledge rather than skills. But some on the left have resisted these initiatives on the ground that they don’t sufficiently center the experience of black and brown students. </p><p>If these critics aim to help disadvantaged students gain the kind of education that will enable them to escape poverty and fulfill their responsibilities as citizens, it’s incumbent on them to create curricula that answer these objections&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>build knowledge. The worst thing we can do to children who rely on schools for their education is to deny them access to knowledge until it’s too late.</p><p><strong>Natalie&nbsp;Wexler&nbsp;is the author of&nbsp;The Knowledge Gap: The Hidden Cause of American's Broken Education System—And How to Fix It.</strong></p></div></div>]]>

        <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In my <a href="https://kunalspathak.github.io/2020-08-01-Vectorization-APIs">vectorization using .NET APIs</a> blog, I describe SIMD datatypes <code>Vector64&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Vector128&lt;T&gt;</code> that operates on ‘Arm64 hardware intrinsic’ APIs present under <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics.arm.advsimd?view=net-5.0">System.Runtime.Intrinsics.Arm.AdvSimd</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics.arm.advsimd.arm64?view=net-5.0">System.Runtime.Intrinsics.Arm.AdvSimd.Arm64</a> class. In this post I will describe those hardware intrinsic APIs by showing sample code usage along with examples and generated Arm64 code. This will help people in understanding these APIs so they can use them to optimize their .NET code written to target Arm64. Since there are 360 APIs, describing all of them in a single post will be overwhelming. So I have divided these APIs among 8 blogs and will demonstrate 45 APIs in each blog. This is part 2 of that blog series.</p>

<p>Most of the description of these APIs is adapted and referenced from <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0487/fc/">Arm Architecture Reference Manual Armv8, for Armv8-A architecture profile document</a>. You can also refer to the description of SIMD and Floating-point instructions description at <a href="https://developer.arm.com/docs/ddi0596/h/simd-and-floating-point-instructions-alphabetic-order">Arm developer docs page</a>.</p>

        <div>
    <p>Swift was introduced a couple of years ago at Apple's 2014 WWDC. Over the years I analyzed iOS to measure how many built-in applications were using Swift. iOS 9 released in 2015 included a single application written with Swift: Calculator. Since then this number has grown with each iOS release: <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2016/1101-apples-use-of-swift-in-ios-10-1-and-macos-10-12/">iOS 10.1</a>, <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2017/1115-state-of-swift-ios11-1-macos10-13/">iOS 11.1</a>, <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2018/0924-state-of-swift-ios12/">iOS 12.0</a> and finally <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2019/0926-state-of-swift-ios13/">iOS 13.1</a>.</p>
<p>iOS 14 is now available so let's check how this number evolved since iOS 13. Apple announced SwiftUI during WWDC 2019, a year ago. In this article I will also try to measure which built-in apps are using this new UI framework.</p>

<p>The methodology and tools used for this article have been detailed in the previous posts. If you are interested, please refer to <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2016/1101-apples-use-of-swift-in-ios-10-1-and-macos-10-12/">Apple’s use of Swift in iOS 10.1 and macOS 10.12</a>.</p>
<p>Later in this article, I describe how I adjusted the tools to detect SwiftUI.</p>

<p>iOS 14.0 contains 351 binaries and frameworks using Swift. Note that these binaries might contain a single line of Swift code and are not necessarily entirely written in Swift. This list has been built using iOS 14.0 (18A373) for iPhone 11 Pro Max:</p>

<p>You can get the full list here: <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/0927-state-of-swift-ios14/BinariesUsingSwift.txt">BinariesUsingSwift.txt</a></p>

<p>SwiftUI, announced at WWDC 2019, is a new framework to build user interfaces with Swift. As a consequence a binary using SwiftUI will use Swift. Can we get the list of built-in apps using SwiftUI?</p>
<p>When I worked on the iOS 14 widgets for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/clatters/id1480930237">Clatters 3.0</a>, I noted that the widgets were linking against <code>/System/Library/Frameworks/SwiftUI.framework/Versions/A/SwiftUI</code>.</p>
<p><em>( <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/clatters/id1480930237">Clatters</a> lets you easily monitor in one place your brand, product or any other keyword on your favorite social networks - Twitter, Reddit, HackerNews and even comments on the iOS App Store. You should check it out at <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/clatters/id1480930237">https://apps.apple.com/app/clatters/id1480930237</a>! 😜 )</em></p>
<p>The script detecting Swift could easily be adjusted to detect SwiftUI by using this line:</p>
<pre><code>otool -L $1 2&gt;/dev/null | grep -o /System/Library/Frameworks/SwiftUI.framework/SwiftUI | wc -l
</code></pre>

<p>Until now I did not publish the list of apps using SwiftUI in iOS. To have a first reference, I built the list for iOS 13.7. With no surprise, iOS 13.7 only contained a handful of binaries relying on SwiftUI:</p>
<pre><code>/Applications/SharingViewService.app/SharingViewService
/System/Library/Frameworks/SwiftUI.framework/SwiftUI
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Settings/LegalAndRegulatorySettingsPrivate.framework/LegalAndRegulatorySettingsPrivate
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Settings/SettingsUIKitPrivate.framework/SettingsUIKitPrivate
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Settings/WallpaperSettings.framework/WallpaperSettings
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/VideosUI.framework/VideosUI
</code></pre>

<p>iOS 14.0 contains a lot more binaries using SwiftUI. The primary reason is without a doubt WidgetKit, the first public SwiftUI-only framework.
Each widget available in iOS 14 appears in this list. Another shiny new iOS 14 feature is the Translate app  which appears to be built with SwiftUI.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main id="genesis-content"><article aria-label="SOAR Fiction: The Playbooks" itemref="breakthrough-page-title" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><div itemprop="text">
<p>The tool which can find its real meaning from its user’s scenarios and&nbsp;<em>sine qua non</em>&nbsp;inputs is a Security Orchestration Automation and Response (SOAR) platform. By bringing productivity growth in security workflows, harmonizing security tools for multiple purposes, providing flexibility into your security architecture and accelerating decision-making process, SOAR is mainly used for security operations centres (SOC) but it also can help other security <strong>operations</strong>. And it facilitates unloading your anger against most of the threats in a controlled manner.</p>



<p>While SOAR is a centralized control hub, the playbooks are vital scenarios, and <strong>sine qua non</strong> inputs are a perfectly performing SIEM and an indispensable threat intelligence. In case of insufficient or flawed scenarios and ruined inputs, SOAR will be as useful as a chocolate teapot. In this post, I will try to design some useful playbooks to run in your environment, bearing in mind that SIEM and threat intelligence are already in play. The playbooks below are designed according to the most restricted actions. The scenarios depend on several factors such as your business, your IT environment, the legal and regulatory compliance and so on. You can expand or detail the scenarios according to your needs:</p>



<ul><li><a href="#S1" data-type="internal" data-id="#S1">Phishing or Spear-Phishing</a></li><li><a href="#S2" data-type="internal" data-id="#S2">End-User and Endpoint</a><ul><li><a href="#S21" data-type="internal" data-id="#S21">Failed Logins</a></li><li><a href="#S22" data-type="internal" data-id="#S22">Unusual Logins</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#S3" data-type="internal" data-id="#S3">Security Maintanance Operations and Diagnotics</a></li><li><a href="#S4" data-type="internal" data-id="#S4">Threat Hunting and Malware Analysis</a></li></ul>



<h3 id="S1">Phishing or Spear-Phishing</h3>



<ol><li>Alarms/alerts of suspicious e-mails feed the SOAR from various resources like your anti-phishing tool, SIEM or e-mail security gateways.</li><li>The SOAR dissects important indicators of compromise (IOC) such as sender IP, e-mail address, attachments, subject and so on as a requirement of the triage process. Later, simultaneously:<ul><li>It checks and evaluates reputation or severity of incoming data by cross foot checking the data against reputation services and threat intelligence sources.</li><li>It sends content or attachments to a sandbox for further analysis.</li></ul></li><li>If the result of one of the actions above is <strong>positive</strong>, the security operators and the affected users are informed with the detailed instructions. At this point, suspicious becomes malicious. At the same time, the SOAR also scans all e-mail accounts to locate other malicious e-mails and then deletes them. Later the SOAR informs other security tools for blacklisting the malicious IOCs.</li><li>If the result of one of the actions in the second step is <strong>negative</strong>, the SOAR forwards the case to the security team for a manual investigation. If the manual investigation is assessed as “clean”, then the SOAR closes the case and sends the original e-mail to the owners.</li></ol>



<h3 id="S2">End-User and Endpoint</h3>



<p>Several attacks may be started from endpoints or by end-users such as failed login attempts, login attempts from unusual locations or devices, same user logins from different places and so on. You can see some of the end-user or endpoint scenarios below:</p>



<h4 id="S21">Failed Logins</h4>



<ol><li>When the number of failed logins on a service/device exceeds the allowed threshold, the SOAR warns the affected end-user to confirm whether it is legitimate:<ul><li>If the end-user verifies the attempts with “<strong>legitimate</strong>” response, the SOAR platform resets the password and informs the affected end-user with the required information.</li><li>If the end-user confirms that it is&nbsp;<strong>illegitimate</strong>, the SOAR confirms the account takeover attempt, simultaneously investigates the details like the IP and location of the failed attempts and quarantines the affected endpoint.</li></ul></li></ol>



<h4 id="S22">Unusual Logins</h4>



<p>There may be multiple unusual login types that depend on your business or environment. In one example, when end-users are connected to the company VPN service, same end-user’s login activity may be seen at the workplace location in time that cannot happen as quickly as the two logins occur. In the other example, it occurs when end-user logins from an unusual place or on a new device other than its likely geographical location/IP. In such scenarios:</p>



<ul><li>for reconciling and cross-checking time, IP and login information, the SOAR seems able to query Active directory service, geo-IP lookup, NTP service, the VPN service, the workplace’s point of entry/exit data and so on.</li><li>once catching a different IP address other than likely original IP blocks, the SOAR warns the affected user to verify its exact location. If the user responds as “an illegitimate action”, the SOAR blocks the suspicious IP and notifies the security team for further investigation.</li></ul>



<h3 id="S3">Security Maintanance Operations and Diagnotics</h3>



<p>The SOAR can be used for security maintenance or diagnostics operations. For this type of purposes, you can see the example usages below:</p>



<ul><li>the SOAR can query your certificate management tool to check the expiration status of SSL certificates of any servers/endpoints. For problematic certificates, the SOAR informs the affected user or the certificate’s manager by finding the related user details from the Active Directory.</li><li>the SOAR can identify unmanaged endpoints in terms of antivirus, DLP or any endpoint agents. If any endpoints are out of control or down, the SOAR can ping/wake the agents, open tickets or escalate the case.</li><li>The SOAR can query the vulnerability management tool for any diagnoses, consequences, results, reports and remediations related to a specific vulnerability or endpoint/server. At the same time, it can correlate the data with data from other relevant security tools. Hence, based on the gathered correlated data, the SOAR can assign the severity of the incident/vulnerability and escalate the situation for manual investigation and remediation.</li></ul>



<h3 id="S4">Threat Hunting and Malware Analysis</h3>



<ul><li>If a malicious indicator is found by other resources/tools, the SOAR can feed other security tools with the finding and update watch lists. Also, the SOAR can check all endpoints/servers to identify if other endpoints have been compromised by the same malicious indicator, and take further actions such as quarantining, opening tickets and so on.</li><li>For identified indicators or unidentified things, the SOAR can trigger the endpoint tool to kill malicious processes or neutralize/delete infected files.</li><li>The SOAR can collect data from a wide variety of sources such as SIEM, endpoint tools, Exchange servers, threat intelligence feeds, malware analysis tools, etc and then extract any files that need to be neutralized.</li></ul>

<p>I'm not so sure that I'm a fan of agile software development (at least as it's commonly
practiced).  But I am sure that the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> got one
thing <em>really</em> right: It not only stated what values were important but also stated which
values (though important!) could be sacrificed.  That is, the Agile Manifesto was explicit
about what tradeoffs it was willing to make.</p>
<p>That's crucial because it's really easy to select some nice-sounding phrases and label
them as "priorities" – who wouldn't agree that "<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">readability
counts</a>"?  But it's much harder to pick out
important values that you're willing to sacrifice.  And, because it's harder, it's also
much more revealing.  You'll often learn a lot more from knowing a project's non-goals
than from knowing its goals.</p>
<p>In that spirit, I'd like to present a similar manifesto for the <a href="https://raku.org/">Raku programming
language</a>.  Note: I said "<strong>a</strong>" manifesto, not "<strong>the</strong>" manifesto for
Raku.  I'm speaking only for myself; I'm sure many others would include different
dichotomies on their version of a Raku manifesto.  Additionally, this is very much a first
draft.  I've put considerable thought into this but haven't yet discussed my views broadly.
I also artificially limited myself to four pairs of values (following the form set by the
Agile Manifesto), and I could easily imagine changing my mind.  If you disagree or just have
a different perspective, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/j0vq6u/a_raku_manifesto_part_1/?">r/rakulang</a>
thread for this post on the <a href="https://raku.org/community/irc">#raku IRC channel</a>.</p>

<p>Before we get started, I want to remind you of a statement from the Agile Manifesto:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel the same way.  All the items on the right side of the chart up above (the items that
come after "over") are still <em>really</em> important.  So, in this series of posts, I'm going to
walk through the four value pairs in my Raku manifesto.  I'll discuss the first two pairs in
this post, and the next two in the second post.  For each pair, I'll say why the value on
the right side is important, and what Raku does to support it.  Then I'll say why, in my
view, the value on the left is even <strong>more</strong> important (for the language Raku is trying to
be, anyway), and how Raku prioritizes it in ways that require sacrificing the value on the
right.  After discussing all four value pairs, I'll close with a post on why I believe that
Raku's decision to prioritize the values on the left is absolutely the correct one.</p>

<h2 id="expressive-code-over-uniform-code">Expressive code over uniform code</h2>
<p>Uniform code is great.  Tools like <a href="https://prettier.io/">prettier.js</a>,
<a href="https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/">gofmt</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt">rustfmt</a>
are popular for a good reason: they let a team consistently apply a uniform style, without
any of the <a href="https://geometrian.com/programming/tutorials/tabsspaces/index.php">holy wars</a>
that can accompany code formatting debates.  What's more, they let any programmer who is
fluent in those languages jump into a new codebase and feel right at home – no need to
adjust to the stylistic peccadilloes of a particular project or individual.</p>
<p>And, of course, code uniformity goes far beyond automatic code formatters.  For example,
Rob Pike <a href="https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article">has said</a> that one of the reasons
Golang has a minimal syntax is to avoid the problem of "each programmer using a different
subset of the language".  That "subset" problem can be a real issue in languages with more
syntax: it's entirely possible for two programmers who nominally know the same language to
have extreme difficulty reading one another's code if they use sufficiently different
subsets.</p>
<h3 id="how-raku-values-uniformity">How Raku values uniformity</h3>
<p>Raku values code uniformity, but it doesn't force it on you.  I keep coming back to the
following <a href="https://theworld.com/%7Eswmcd/steven/perl/linguistics.html">quote from Larry Wall</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Style [is] not enforced except by peer pressure.  We do not all have to write like
Faulkner, or program like Dijkstra.  I will gladly tell people what my programming style
is, and I will even tell them where I think their own style is unclear or makes me jump
through mental hoops.  But I do this as a fellow programmer, not as the Perl god.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That quote was from 1995, and Larry was talking about Perl – but it applies just as much
today and to Raku.  And, from this point of view, a tool that automatically rearranges
everyone's code into "better" style is just about the ultimate act of playing
language-god.</p>
<p>But I also want to focus on the "peer pressure" part of that quote.  While Raku doesn't
force uniform style on anyone, the community around the language does quite a bit to
(hopefully gently) encourage people to write uniform code.  For one thing, we try really
hard to ensure that Raku's documentation and the accompanying code examples model a
<a href="https://github.com/Raku/doc/blob/master/writing-docs/STYLEGUIDE.md">single, uniform style</a>.
Perhaps more notably, the Raku community has <em>enthusiastically</em> embraced the <a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/">Perl &amp; Raku
weekly challenge</a> – it's not uncommon for the subreddit
and the <a href="https://rakudoweekly.blog/">weekly Raku newsletter</a> to feature a half-dozen or so
solutions to the same programming puzzle every week.  Seeing so many different takes on the
same problem helps keep us all on the same page about what constitutes good style and helps
prevent Raku from splintering into mutually unintelligible dialects.</p>
<h3 id="how-and-why-raku-sacrifices-uniformity-for-expressivity">How and why Raku sacrifices uniformity for expressivity</h3>
<p>Given all the positives I just mentioned, why is Raku willing to sacrifice uniformity?
Because variety enhances expressivity.  This is abundantly clear in natural languages;
consider the following English sentences:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Variety enhances expressivity.</li>
<li>The ability to use a variety of near-synonyms allows you to more clearly express your
intent.</li>
<li>Expressivity – the amount of information you can express in a given unit of text – is
maximized by varying your words in response to the context in which you are
communicating.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Each of these sentences communicates more or less the same idea.  But they make different
tradeoffs between concision and clarity, and they place the emphasis on different ideas.
The ability to communicate the same basic idea in multiple ways is part of what makes
English (and other natural languages) so expressive.</p>
<p>Raku applies this same idea to code.  To start with a fairly trivial example, Raku lets you
call any function as a method.  That is, the two lines after <code>use Test</code> both mean the same
thing:</p>
<pre><span>use</span><span> Test;
</span><span>is</span><span>(</span><span>$the-answer</span><span>, </span><span>42</span><span>);
</span><span>$the-answer</span><span>.&amp;</span><span>is</span><span>(</span><span>42</span><span>);
</span></pre>
<p>The result is the same, but – just as in English – changing the order changes the emphasis
conveyed to the reader.  Depending on the context, one or the other might be clearer; having
the option to choose between the two forms makes Raku more expressive.</p>
<p>Generalizing a bit, Raku firmly embraces the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it">TIMTOWTDI</a>: there's
nearly <em>always</em> more than one way to do it, not matter what "it" happens to be.  This shows
up in the abundance of conditional keywords (prefix <code>if</code>, postfix <code>if</code>, <code>unless</code>, <code>when</code>)
and in the different Boolean operators (<code>?</code> vs <code>so</code>; <code>!</code> vs <code>not</code>).  Each one has a
different meaning, and using a different keyword or operator in the correct context can make
Raku code much more readable.</p>
<p>Zooming out, TIMTOWTDI also explains how emphatically multi-paradigm Raku is.  Raku offers
<em>extremely</em> strong support for <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/objects">object-oriented
programming</a> – it's not at all an exaggeration to
say that everything is an object; at the same time, it's also possible to write Raku in a
strongly functional style (and I usually do!).  This flexibility greatly enhances Raku's
expressive power; after all, some problems are a natural fit for OOP, while others fit well
within a functional programming paradigm.  But this expressive power comes at the expense
of code uniformity – it really is possible to write Raku in a style that would look
alien to a different Raku programmer who fully embraces a different paradigm.</p>
<p>To return to the first topic I mentioned, all of the expressivity/uniformity tradeoffs we've
discussed apply to code formatters.  Having line breaks between every method call in a
multi-line method chain certainly improves uniformity.  But it also limits a programmer's
expressive flexibility.  There's a tradeoff here, and I'm happy with Raku's decision to
favor expressive code over uniform code.</p>

<p>Many languages are expressly designed to be easy to learn.  Markdown is <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">explicitly
designed</a> "to be as easy-to-read and
easy-to-write as is feasible".  Scheme has a syntax that's so minimal that it can be
learned, in its entirety, in the <a href="https://archive.org/details/SICP_4_ipod/Lecture-1a.MP4">first
lecture</a> of a standard CS course.
Golang <a href="https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article">was designed</a> to be easy enough to
learn that "programmers … early in their careers [could become] productive quickly in a new
language".</p>
<p>And the value in being easy to learn is obvious: No one is born knowing a programming
language – to attract new users, a language must convince programmers that spending their
time learning the language is a worthwhile investment.  The less time it takes to learn
the language, the easier it is to make this case.  And, indeed, languages that are more difficult
to learn, such as Rust, frequently cite their difficulty as an impediment to the language's
adoption.</p>
<h3 id="how-raku-values-ease-of-learning">How Raku values ease of learning</h3>
<p>Raku is designed to be a language you don't have to learn all at once.  From its <a href="https://raku.org/archive/talks/2000/als/larry-als.txt">initial
announcement</a>, Raku was envisioned as
a language that should be easy to learn at a "baby talk" level.  In other words, it should
be (and, now, is) easy for a programmer to come to Raku and program in the limited subset of
the language that they're already comfortable with.  Indeed, the Raku website maintains <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language.html">ten
different migration guides</a> designed to help
programmers transition from other languages to the equivalent Raku subset.</p>
<h3 id="how-and-why-raku-sacrifices-ease-of-learning-to-reward-deep-mastery">How and why Raku sacrifices ease of learning to reward deep mastery</h3>
<p>As is probably obvious from our discussion of TIMTOWTDI, the Raku language is <em>big</em>.  Raku
has a lot of syntax, and those syntactical elements can be used together in a combinatorial
explosion of ways.  What's more, because Raku incorporates ideas from so many different
paradigms (including, …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div>
        <p>The engineering team of <a href="https://www.rainforestqa.com/">RainforestQA (YC S12)</a> is remote and distributed around the globe, with developers in America, Europe, and Asia. Our working hours cover almost all time-zones, about 22 hours from full time-zone coverage. Yet for distributing our on-call schedule, we were unhappy with PagerDuty’s standard daily rotation. ​​For a distributed team, why does somebody need to be on-call at night when other team members are working right now?</p>
<h2 id="the-tyrant">The Tyrant</h2>
<p>Starting in 2017, a new internal project for on-call scheduling was born - the Tyrant - as tool to handle On-Call scheduling across time-zones.</p>
<p>Over time the project evolved - scheduling algorithm and technology. In 2019, during a hackathon session in Kuala Lumpur (<a href="https://www.rainforestqa.com/blog/2019-10-09-a-guide-to-running-company-offsites">learn how to run off-sites for distributed teams</a>), the latest version created with discrete optimization as its core.</p>
<p>Tyrant runs as a cron job every Saturday. It gets hour’s preferences from developers, builds on-call schedule, and pushes it to PagerDuty ​​plus emails to folks.</p>
<p>This series of blog posts will describe all the technical details about using discrete optimization for building schedule.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.optduty.com/images/schedule_after-min.png"></p>
<h2 id="what-is-discrete-optimization">What is Discrete Optimization</h2>
<p>Discrete optimization is the selection of a best element (answer) with regard to some criterion, and where some of the variables are restricted to be discrete. For practical purposes it is a DSL. A user models the problem in specific language, and solvers finds the best answer.</p>
<p>I had used discrete optimization for a few small hobby projects and for programming challenges. But for a long time I could not find a use in day-to-day jobs; every time I had a project solvable by discrete optimization - some naive algorithms always beat it. Sometimes by speed; sometimes better quality over naive algorithms was not worth paying by extra complexity.</p>
<p>Tyrant is a completely different story. As it creates the schedule only once per week, speed isn’t important - the quality of the result is.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.minizinc.org/MiniZn_logo.png" width="100"></p>
<p>Tyrant’s core is implemented in <a href="https://www.minizinc.org/">MiniZinc</a> and the first 3 blog posts will cover it. MiniZinc is a high-level modelling language and compiler. MiniZinc compiles into FlatZinc, a low-level language that is understood by a wide range of solvers (an implementation of a discrete optimization algorithm). For us it means faster development, self-explanatory model, and ability to switch solvers.</p>

<p><img src="https://scipopt.org/images/newscippy.png" width="100"></p>
<p>In Part 4, we’ll look inside MiniZinc by manually translation an on-call model to low-level mixed integer format <a href="http://polip.zib.de/pipformat.php">PIP-format</a>, and then solve the problem with <a href="https://www.scipopt.org/">SCIP</a> solver.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-to-minizinc">Introduction to MiniZinc</h3>
<p>Let’s explore a simple problem to familiarize ourselves with the basic MiniZinc syntax. Imagine a small car factory named “BetterThanTesla”. You have 100 lithium batteries, and 190000 kilograms of metal. Building a “Cybertruck” requires 1 battery and 2500 kg of metal, while building “Model3” requires also 1 battery, but only 1500 kg of metal. You would like to know how many of each cars to produce to maximize profit if you can sell “Cybertruck” for $40k and “Model3” for $35k.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>int</span>: total_nb_battery <span>=</span> <span>100</span>;  <span>% fixed, input parameters
</span><span></span><span>int</span>: total_kg_metal <span>=</span> <span>190000</span>; <span>% fixed, input parameters
</span><span></span>
<span>% variable, possible number of different cars
</span><span></span><span>var</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span>total_nb_battery: nb_cybertruck;
<span>var</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span>total_nb_battery: nb_model3;

<span>var</span> <span>int</span>: profit <span>=</span> nb_cybertruck <span>*</span> <span>40000</span> <span>+</span> nb_model3 <span>*</span> <span>35000</span>;

<span>% limit total number of kilograms
</span><span></span><span>constraint</span> nb_cybertruck <span>*</span> <span>2500</span> <span>+</span> nb_model3 <span>*</span> <span>1500</span> <span>&lt;=</span> total_kg_metal;
<span>% limit total number of batteries
</span><span></span><span>constraint</span> nb_cybertruck <span>+</span> nb_model3 <span>&lt;=</span> total_nb_battery;

<span>solve</span> <span>maximize</span> profit;
</code></pre></div><p>The amount of words to describe the problem in English would be about the same as in MiniZinc. The code is self-explanatory even without knowing a lot about the syntax.</p>
<p>There’s a few nuances:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>int</code> (first 2 lines) fixed integer variables - value should be defined</li>
<li><code>var int</code> unfixed integer variable - MiniZinc figures out the value later</li>
<li><code>constraint</code> some expression that should be true</li>
</ul>
<p>The line: <code>var 0..total_nb_battery: nb_model3;</code> says variable <code>nb_model3</code> should be an integer from 0 to total_nb_battery. This could be written as:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>var</span> <span>int</span>: nb_model3;
<span>constraint</span> nb_model3 <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span>;
<span>constraint</span> nb_model3 <span>&lt;=</span> total_nb_battery;
</code></pre></div><p>The last line <code>solve maximize profit</code> tells MiniZinc what to optimize.</p>
<p>If you run: <code>minizinc hello1.mzn --output-objective</code>, you should get how many cars to build in order to maximize profit: $3.7M:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc">nb_cybertruck <span>=</span> <span>40</span>;
nb_model3 <span>=</span> <span>60</span>;
_objective <span>=</span> <span>3700000</span>;
<span>----------</span>

<h3 id="with-data-file">With data file</h3>
<p>To reuse the model we skip defining fixed variables in the model.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>int</span>: total_nb_battery;
<span>int</span>: total_kg_metal;
</code></pre></div><p>And create separate data file <code>hello2.dzn</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc">total_nb_battery <span>=</span> <span>100</span>;
total_kg_metal <span>=</span> <span>190000</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>Command to run model with the separate data file: <code>minizinc hello2.mzn hello2.dzn</code> (Btw, file extension is important for MiniZinc)</p>

<h2 id="building-our-first-on-call-schedule-model">Building our first On-call schedule model</h2>
<p>Now we’re prepared to build our first, simplified on-call scheduling model. For input, the model takes developers' preferences (does developer X want to be on-call at hour Y). The output: assign a developer to every hour next week.
The final assignment should follow only one constraint: assign a developer to an hour according to their preferences.</p>
<h3 id="data-structures-of-scheduling-model">Data Structures of scheduling model</h3>
<p>A famous book by Niklaus Wirth was named <code>Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs</code>. For discrete optimization modeling, MiniZinc does <code>Algorithms</code>, so only <code>Data Structures</code> left to us. For this problem, we have 2 core data structures to define: Input and Output.</p>
<p>For output we use an array <code>assignment</code>, which maps from week hour to a developer. The size is 168 (7 days * 24 hours).</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>int</span>: nb_workers;
<span>set</span> <span>of</span> <span>int</span>: HOURS <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>..</span><span>168</span>;
<span>set</span> <span>of</span> <span>int</span>: WORKERS <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>..</span>nb_workers;

<span>array</span>[HOURS] <span>of</span> <span>var</span> WORKERS: assignment;
</code></pre></div><p>Consider <code>set of int</code> as some sort enumeration of numbers from start to end (including end). MiniZinc arrays have named indexes. In our example, <code>assignment</code> has named indexes based on range <code>HOURS</code> (1..168). The statement <code>array[HOURS] of var WORKERS: assignment = [7, 8, 9, ..]</code> means developer <code>7</code> will be on-call at hour <code>1</code> (first index of <code>HOURS</code> range).</p>
<p>Input data will also be array, but 2 dimensional, with size <code>WORKERS</code> × <code>HOURS</code>. It’s a mapping from a developer and an hour to a 0..1 integer. Where 1 means a developer is available for on-call.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>array</span>[WORKERS, HOURS] <span>of</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span><span>1</span>: working_hours;
</code></pre></div><p>Example of a data file (notice how rows separated with <code>|</code> symbol):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc">nb_workers <span>=</span> <span>3</span>;

working_hours <span>=</span> [|
<span>0</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>..</span><span>.</span>, <span>0</span> |
<span>0</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>..</span><span>.</span>, <span>0</span> |
<span>1</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>..</span><span>.</span>, <span>1</span> |];
</code></pre></div><p>One note about nb_workers. Theoretically we could get the value of <code>nb_workers</code> from <code>working_hours</code>, but in practice it’s chicken or egg problem. MiniZinc needs to know <code>nb_workers</code> to define indexes(type) for the <code>working_hours</code> array.</p>
<h3 id="constraint-and-objective">Constraint and objective</h3>
<p>We have only one constraint for now: follow the <code>working_hours</code> input data. We iterate all elements of the <code>working_hours</code> array, and if some developer is unavailable at a specific hour (== 0), then <code>assignment</code> at that hour should not be equal to the unavailable worker.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>constraint</span> <span>forall</span>(h <span>in</span> HOURS, w <span>in</span> WORKERS)(
    working_hours[w, h] <span>=</span> <span>0</span> <span>-&gt;</span> assignment[h] <span>!=</span> w
);
</code></pre></div><p><code>-&gt;</code> means implication. For me it’s easier to understand in pseudocode:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>if</span> working_hours[w, h] <span>==</span> <span>0</span>:
    add_constraint(assignment[h] <span>!=</span> w)
</code></pre></div><p>Unlike the car example, here we don’t need optimization, as we don’t have an the expression to optimize. Instead, we ask to satisfy all constraints:</p>
<p>A solution will be available in a few milliseconds.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc">assignment <span>=</span> <span>array1d</span>(<span>1</span><span>..</span><span>168</span>, [<span>1</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>..</span><span>.</span>, <span>1</span>]);
<span>----------</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The solution says it’s not so much fun to be the first developer.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/skrypka/minizinc_workshop/tree/master/oncall1">Source code of unfair model</a></p>
<h3 id="fairness">Fairness</h3>
<p>Let’s add fairness to the model. Fairness means total on-call hours for each developers should be as similar as possible. To make life easier later we can create an intermediate array <code>total_hours</code>, which for every developer returns the number of hours on-call for the week.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>array</span>[WORKERS] <span>of</span> <span>var</span> <span>int</span>: total_hours <span>=</span> [
    <span>sum</span>( [assignment[h]<span>=</span>w | h <span>in</span> HOURS ] )
    | w <span>in</span> WORKERS
];
</code></pre></div><p>Here we can see new syntax, a list comprehension. We iterate for every worker, and in the inner list comprehension, calculate the actual number of working hours.</p>
<p>To ask for fairness, we need an expression to convert <code>total_hours</code> to one number. One option is <code>min-max</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>solve</span> <span>minimize</span> <span>max</span>(total_hours) <span>-</span> <span>min</span>(total_hours);
</code></pre></div><p>The minimal possible objective is 0 when all developers has equal total on-call hours per week. The expression is provably correct, but in practice it’s pretty slow with default optimizer. MiniZinc assigns the first developer to all hours as initial solution and tries to improve it.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.optduty.com/images/blog/oncall2-slow.gif" alt="slow min max optimization">
(pay attention to the objective value)</p>
<p>One option to fix it is to ask MiniZinc to select developers randomly during search with search annotation. As I’ll focus on another solution, to find our more, check out check out <a href="https://www.minizinc.org/doc-2.4.3/en/mzn_search.html">this part of MiniZinc tutorial</a>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>solve</span> :: <span>int_search</span>(assignment, first_fail, indomain_random)
      <span>minimize</span> <span>max</span>(total_hours) <span>-</span> <span>min</span>(total_hours);
</code></pre></div><p><img src="https://static.optduty.com/images/blog/oncall2-fast.gif" alt="fast min max optimization"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/skrypka/minizinc_workshop/tree/master/oncall2">Source code of min-max model</a></p>
<h3 id="even-fairer-fairness">Even fairer fairness</h3>
<p>The min-max objective is simple, but unfortunately, in some edge cases, it will not work. Minimum and maximum create boundaries and the algorithm will try to push them together as much as possible, but it will not try to optimize developers between boundaries.</p>
<p>Instead, we could use a much more complicated expression:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>var</span> <span>int</span>: absolute_diff <span>=</span> <span>sum</span>(w1 <span>in</span> WORKERS, w2 <span>in</span> WORKERS <span>where</span> w1 <span>&gt;</span> w2)(
     <span>abs</span>(total_hours[w1] <span>-</span> total_hours[w2])
);
</code></pre></div><p>Again there is new syntax, but it’s slightly different list comprehension with an aggregation function on top. We iterate for all unique workers pairs and for each pair, calculate the absolute difference. As the last step, we sum all such differences.</p>
<p>Only one line left, to ask to minimize the sum of absolute differences:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>solve</span> <span>minimize</span> absolute_diff;
</code></pre></div><p><a href="https://github.com/skrypka/minizinc_workshop/tree/master/oncall3">Source code of absolute diff model</a></p>

            <h3>The Absurdity of Free Will</h3>
            <p>06/17/2020</p>
            <p>You have free will. You definitely are responsible for your actions. Right?</p>
<p>After all, you could choose to do any number of things, <em>right this very moment!</em> You could (if only you wanted to) bring your hands together and clap; you could open your mouth and shout something obscene; you could even stand up and dance in circles.</p>
<p>You <em>definitely</em> have free will.</p>
<p>Or do you?</p>
<p>I’m going to argue the opposite. I do not think free will exists, certainly not in the way most people envision it.</p>
<p>First, let us review the arguments. On the one hand we have our own, subjective, experience. It <em>feels</em> like we have a free choice. Even I, writing this, intuitively think that it must be true. How could it <em>not</em> be? I definitely feel free!</p>
<p>This view is also supported by most religions. Christian dogma states that man must be free; else how can he be judged by his actions? It would be absurd to send someone to hell if they weren’t responsible for their own sins. A similar sequence of reasoning is given in the Islamic Quran and the Jewish Torah. Both state the importance of man’s choice and how he will, eventually, be judged by God. Islam and to a lesser extent Christianity do believe in some form of predestined God’s Plan, but Free Will is an essential part of it.</p>
<p>One big camp on the contrarian side would be the Determinists. Determinists believe that reality is more or less like a (super large and complex) billiard board. Atoms and little particles whizz around, interact with other particles, and continue on. All under the watchful eyes of the laws of physics. These interactions are <em>deterministic</em>, i.e. if we knew everything about two particles before they interacted (their speed, position, mass, etc…) we could know exactly what they would do 
and where they would end up afterwards. Kind of like how a billiard pro can know where the ball will end up in. Just with, you know, billions of trillions of little billiard balls all flying around at the same time.</p>
<p>Determinists, then, believe that the current state (of everything) is just a logical consequence of previous states. Action, reaction. Everything moves forward in time in an orderly manner, everyone dances to the tune of the laws of Physics. And that “everyone” would include us: you reading this and me writing it. </p>
<p>There is some evidence that supports this notion. A pretty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience_of_free_will#Libet_experiment">(in)famous study in the 80’s</a> by one Benjamin Libet seems to indicate that we do things <em>before</em> we are consciously aware that we have chosen to do them. In Libet’s experiment, the electrical signal to move an arm appeared before participants said they chose to move it. Action preceded choice, and thus Libet thought that Free Will is nothing but a retrospective interpretation. We are all puppets that think they are free.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_A59BDC4BAD5CADFC869C63D4DECEB86DD55177CF11C8C274D8A8FFB9889C9741_1592336454919_puppet_determinists.svg"></p>
<p>People take offense at this. It’s hard not to. Nobody likes to think of themselves as “just” a puppet dancing on some strings. We are not machines, we are humans!</p>
<p>The Determinists use other arguments too. For example, most everyone agrees that plants, bacteria and insects lack free will. Most would also say that all the other animals (mice, dogs, cows) lack that quality too; they “act out of instinct”. Yet, if Darwin is to be believed, we humans (or at least our forefathers) were once dumb, instinctual animals too. How come we now have the magical quality of free will? At what point in the evolutionary timeline did a human receive the ability to make free choices? If Free Will is something that you either have or don’t have, a <em>qualitative</em> aspect of humanity, then it follows that, at some point in the past, there must have been a family where the (unfree) parents suddenly had a child with Free Will. The notion seems absurd. </p>
<p>But perhaps Free Will is not qualitative, perhaps it is something that is gained bit by bit. A <em>quantitative</em> thing. Perhaps, during the course of our evolutionary history, <em>homo sapiens</em> gained more and more of it. This seems like a reasonable argument, and we can use it to protect our ego (“I am not a puppet!”). </p>
<p>Unfortunately, making Free Will compatible with Evolution doesn’t really solve anything. Neither does hand-waving away Libet’s experiment. We will see why in a second. First, let us look at what the mortal enemies of the Determinists say, the <strong>In</strong>determinists.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_A59BDC4BAD5CADFC869C63D4DECEB86DD55177CF11C8C274D8A8FFB9889C9741_1592411197423_in_vs_determinists.svg"></p>
<p>The aptly named Indeterminists believe that nothing in the future is really set. They believe that, even knowing every possible thing in the present (what all the billion trillion atoms and little particles in our universe are doing), one could not precisely calculate what would happen in the next moment. At most we’d get some kind of probability distribution. But the important part is: the future is not determined! We determine it by our own actions! We have Free Will!</p>
<p>It does seem, on a first glance, like the Indeterminists are winning. The modern physics of the small stuff (people call it “quantum” physics) heavily supports their view. Newton is outdated, long live Heisenberg.</p>
<p>But in a war nobody wins, and this is most definitely a war. In this vast philosophical conflict, the nerdy Determinists are heavily outnumbered. On the other hand, the chaotic Indeterminists are long dead.</p>
<p>To understand <em>why</em> the Indeterminists never stood a winning chance, let us make the problem easy to visualize. We shall do so with the help of Jim.</p>
<p>Jim is a normal dude, and is faced with a super simple choice: A or B.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_A59BDC4BAD5CADFC869C63D4DECEB86DD55177CF11C8C274D8A8FFB9889C9741_1592413717044_AvsB2.svg"></p>
<p>A and B could be anything, the point is that Jim has to choose between them. This example is useful because we can make the following question: <em>how does Jim choose?</em></p>
<p>If it were a machine deciding, then the answer would be easy. The machine would choose solely based upon a set of hard rules: the software running it. The machine code that runs in its machine brain. Depending upon a set of inputs and its code instructions, the machine produces an output, choosing either A or B. This is the deterministic view. Applied to humans, it would go a bit like this: based upon his genetics, his upbringing, his current hormonal balance and because B smells a bit like his ex-girlfriend Jessica, Jim will choose B. Jim’s behavior is deterministic, ergo Jim is a puppet.</p>
<p>The opposite would be the indeterministic view: Jim has Free Will, therefore he can choose whatever he wants. With his magical Free Will he can choose A or B, independent of earthly reasons. Religion is happy, everyone goes home, the end. </p>
<p><em>But it really isn’t the end.</em> Because if Jim’s decision is <em>not</em> defined by the sum of his inputs (genetics, upbringing, environment, etc..), then there are two options: either some kind of metaphysical entity makes the choice, or the choice is random. Most people throughout history have taken a preference to the first: there <em>must</em> be some inner core, some magical <em>soul</em> inside of us that makes these choices and through which we are granted Free Will. We are not just defined by our fleshy prisons, no, in reality we are some grander metaphysical existence. Because the alternative, being nothing more than a smart pair of dice, is horrifying.</p>
<p>Saying a soul exists is all fine and dandy, but by doing this we are just shoving the decision into an additional layer of abstraction. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down">turtles all the way down problem</a>. Why doesn’t the world fall down? Because a giant turtle supports it. And what about that turtle, why doesn’t it fall down? Well, there’s another, even bigger turtle beneath it. And so it goes, on and on.</p>
<p>We have delegated the responsibility of <em>choosing</em> from Jim to the more exotic “soul-Jim”. However, the dilemma still exists: either soul-Jim makes the choice by evaluating all his inputs (how dense the metaphysical clouds were that day, how strict his soul-parents when he was little, how pretty soul-Jessica looked that day, etc…), or soul-Jim makes the choice between A or B <em>randomly</em>. We could of course believe in an <em>even more</em> abstract soul-soul-Jim that grants this soul-Jim and by extension our original human Jim Free Choice. But then we run into the same issue again. As I said, turtles all the way down.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_A59BDC4BAD5CADFC869C63D4DECEB86DD55177CF11C8C274D8A8FFB9889C9741_1592421195343_AvsB3.svg"></p>
<p>Thus we arrive at the main problem with Free Will. There really are only two options. Either everything is deterministic, and thus Free Will does not exist, and we are all puppets. Or, Free Will does “exist”, but is <em>literally just randomness</em>. A roll of the dice. Whether Jim chooses A or B, whether he chooses to go through with a murder or regrets it at the last second, is not determined by a grandiose notion of liberty and Free Will. No, it is determined by <em>complete chance</em>. Either there are reasons that fully determine Jim’s decision-making, and thus his decision is not free, or there aren’t reasons that fully determine Jim’s decision-making, in which case his decision must be a product of the accidental.</p>
<p>Pushing the act of decision-making onto a higher layer of abstraction (soul-Jim) does not solve anything: we are still faced with the fundamental choice between determinisim and random choice. <em>There are no other options.</em></p>
<p>It is thus absurd to imagine Free Will as some grandiose human quality that differentiates us from more primitive species. If Free Will exists, then we are nothing more than glorified pieces of weighted dice. If it doesn’t, then we are just complex biological automata.</p>
<p>Our choices are either predetermined, or they are arbitrary. Either Free Will does not exist, or it is a truly trivial and absurd thing.</p>
<p>Some people think that this is depressing. If its not <em>us</em> calling the shots, then what does anything matter?</p>
<p>What do you think? Will you lay on your couch and do nothing, because nothing matters? </p>
<p>I don’t think so. I think you will continue on with your daily life.</p>
<p>After all, you have no choice :)</p>

</ol>

<p>In Chapter 3 we managed to put together a first implementation of <code>POST /subscriptions</code> to fulfill one of the user stories of our email newsletter project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a blog visitor,<br>
I want to subscribe to the newsletter,<br>
So that I can receive email updates when new content is published on the blog.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have not yet created a web page with a HTML form to actually test the end-to-end flow, but we have a few black-box integration tests that cover the two basic scenarios we care about at this stage:</p>
<ul>
<li>if valid form data is submitted (i.e. both name and email have been provided), the data is saved in our database;</li>
<li>if the submitted form is incomplete (e.g. the email is missing, the name is missing or both), the API returns a 400.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should we be satisfied and rush to deploy the first version of our application on the coolest cloud provider out there?<br>
Not yet - we are not yet equipped to properly run our software in a production environment.<br>
We are blind: the application is not <strong>instrumented</strong> yet and we are not collecting any <strong>telemetry data</strong>, making us vulnerable to <strong>unknown unknowns</strong>.</p>
<p>If most of the previous sentence makes little to no sense to you, do not worry: getting to the bottom of it is going to be the main focus of this chapter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Discuss the article on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24608100">HackerNews</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/j0uo0t/are_we_observable_yet_an_introduction_to_rust/">r/rust</a></em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have a few tests. Tests are good, they make us more confident in our software, in its correctness.<br>
Nonetheless, a test suite is not <em>proof</em> of the correctness of our application. We would have to explore significantly different approaches to <em>prove</em> that something is correct (e.g. <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/formal-methods-amazon.pdf">formal methods</a>).<br>
At runtime we will encounter scenarios that we have not tested for or even thought about when designing the application in the first place.</p>
<p>I can point at a few blind spots based on the work we have done so far and my past experiences:</p>
<ul>
<li>what happens if we lose connection to the database? Does <code>sqlx::PgPool</code> try to automatically recover or will all database interactions fail from that point onwards until we restart the application?</li>
<li>what happens if an attacker tries to pass malicious payloads in the body of the POST <code>/subscriptions</code> request (i.e. extremely large payloads, attempts to perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL injection</a>, etc.)?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are often referred to as <strong>known unknowns</strong>: shortcomings that we are aware of and we have not yet  managed to investigate or we have deemed to be not relevant enough to spend time on.<br>
Given enough time and effort, we <em>could</em> get rid of most known unknowns.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there are issues that we have not seen before and we are not expecting, <strong>unknown unknowns</strong>.</p>
<p>Sometimes experience is enough to transform an unknown unknown into a known unknown: if you had never worked with a database before you might have not thought about what happens when we lose connection; once you have seen it happen once, it becomes a familiar failure mode to look out for.</p>
<p>More often than not, unknown unknowns are peculiar failure modes of the specific system we are working on.<br>
They are problems at the crossroads between our software components, the underlying operating systems, the hardware we are using, our development process peculiarities and that huge source of randomness known as "the outside world".<br>
They might emerge when:</p>
<ul>
<li>the system is pushed outside of its usual operating conditions (e.g. an unusual spike of traffic);</li>
<li>multiple components experience failures at the same time (e.g. a SQL transaction is left hanging while the database is going through a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/warm-standby-failover.html">master-replica failover</a>);</li>
<li>a change is introduced that moves the system equilibrium (e.g. tuning a retry policy);</li>
<li>no changes have been introduced for a long time (e.g. applications have not been restarted for weeks and you start to see all sorts of memory leaks);</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these scenarios share one key similarity: they are often impossible to reproduce outside of the live environment.<br>
What can we do to prepare ourselves to deal with an outage or a bug caused by an unknown unknown?</p>

<p>We must assume that we will not be there when an unknown unknown issue arises: it might be late at night, we might be working on something else, etc.<br>
Even if were paying attention at the very same moment something starts to go wrong, it often isn't possible or practical to attach a debugger to a process running in production (assuming you even know in the first place <em>which</em> process you should be looking at) and the degradation might affect multiple systems at once.<br>
The only thing we can rely on to understand and debug an unknown unknown is <strong>telemetry data</strong>: information about our running applications that is collected automatically and can be later inspected to answer questions about the state of the system at a certain point in time.</p>
<p>What questions?<br>
Well, if it is an unknown unknown we do not really know <em>in advance</em> what questions we might need to ask to isolate its root cause - that's the whole point.<br>
The goal is to have an <strong>observable application</strong>.<br>
Quoting from <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/what-is-observability/">Honeycomb's observability guide</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Observability is about being able to ask arbitrary questions about your environment without — and this is the key part — having to know ahead of time what you wanted to ask.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"arbitrary" is a strong word - as all absolute statements, it might require an unreasonable investment of both time and money if we are to interpret it literally.<br>
In practice we will also happily settle for an application that is <em>sufficiently</em> observable to enable us to deliver the level of service we promised to our users.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, to build an observable system we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>to instrument our application to collect high-quality telemetry data;</li>
<li>access to tools and systems to efficiently slice, dice and manipulate the data to find answers to our questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will touch upon some of the options available to fulfill the second point, but an exhaustive discussion is outside of the scope of this book.<br>
Let's focus on the first for the rest of this chapter.</p>

<p>Logs are the most common type of telemetry data.<br>
Even developers who have never heard of observability have an intuitive understanding of the usefulness of logs: logs are what you look at when stuff goes south to understand what is happening, crossing your fingers extra hard hoping you captured enough information to troubleshoot effectively.</p>
<p>What are logs though?<br>
The format varies, depending on the epoch, the platform and the technologies you are using.<br>
Nowadays a <strong>log record</strong> is usually a bunch of text data, with a line break to separate the current record from the next one.
For example</p>
<pre><code><span>The</span><span> application is starting on port 8080
</span><span>Handling</span><span> a request to /index
</span><span>Handling</span><span> a request to /index
</span><span>Returned</span><span> a 200 OK
</span></code></pre>
<p>are four perfectly valid log records for a web server.</p>
<p>What does the Rust ecosystem have to offer us when it comes to logging?</p>
<h2 id="3-1-the-log-crate">3.1. The <code>log</code> Crate</h2>
<p>The go-to crate for logging in Rust is <a href="https://docs.rs/log"><code>log</code></a>.</p>
<p><code>log</code> provides five macros: <a href="https://docs.rs/log/0.4.11/log/macro.trace.html"><code>trace</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/log/0.4.11/log/macro.debug.html"><code>debug</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/log/0.4.11/log/macro.info.html"><code>info</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/log/0.4.11/log/macro.warn.html"><code>warn</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/log/0.4.11/log/macro.error.html"><code>error</code></a>.<br>
They all do the same thing - emit a log a record - but each of them uses a different <strong>log level</strong>, as the naming implies.<br>
<em>trace</em> is the lowest level: trace-level logs are often extremely verbose and have a low signal-to-noise ratio (e.g. emit a trace-level log record every time a TCP packet is received by a web server).<br>
We then have, in increasing order of severity, <em>debug</em>, <em>info</em>, <em>warn</em> and <em>error</em>.<br>
Error-level logs are used to report serious failures that might have user impact (e.g. we failed to handle an incoming request or a query to the database timed out). </p>
<p>Let's look at a quick usage example:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>fallible_operation</span><span>() -&gt; Result&lt;String, String&gt; { ... }

</span><span>pub fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>match </span><span>fallible_operation</span><span>() {
        Ok(success) =&gt; {
            log::info!("</span><span>Operation succeeded: {}</span><span>", success);
        }
        Err(err) =&gt; {
            log::error!("</span><span>Operation failed: {}</span><span>", err);
        }
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>We are trying to perform an operation that might fail.<br>
If it succeeds, we emit an info-level log record.<br>
If it doesn't, we emit an error-level log record.</p>
<p>Notice as well how <code>log</code>'s macros support the same interpolation syntax provided by <code>println</code>/<code>print</code> in the standard library.</p>
<p>We can use <code>log</code>'s macros to <em>instrument</em> our codebase.<br>
Choosing what information should be logged about the execution of a particular function is often a <em>local</em> decision: it is enough to look at the function to decide what deserves to be captured in a log record. This enables libraries to be instrumented effectively, extending the reach of our telemetry outside the boundaries of the code we have written first-hand.</p>
<h2 id="3-2-actix-web-s-logger-middleware">3.2. <code>actix-web</code>'s <code>Logger</code> Middleware</h2>
<p><code>actix_web</code> provides a <a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/middleware/struct.Logger.html"><code>Logger</code> middleware</a>. It emits a log record for every incoming request.<br>
Let's add it to our application.</p>
<pre><code><span>//! src/startup.rs
</span><span>use crate</span><span>::routes::{health_check, subscribe};
</span><span>use </span><span>actix_web::dev::Server;
</span><span>use </span><span>actix_web::web::Data;
</span><span>use </span><span>actix_web::{web, App, HttpServer};
</span><span>use </span><span>actix_web::middleware::Logger;
</span><span>use </span><span>sqlx::PgPool;
</span><span>use </span><span>std::net::TcpListener;

</span><span>pub fn </span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>listener</span><span>: TcpListener, </span><span>db_pool</span><span>: PgPool) -&gt; Result&lt;Server, std::io::Error&gt; {
    </span><span>let</span><span> db_pool = Data::new(db_pool);
    </span><span>let</span><span> server = HttpServer::new(</span><span>move </span><span>|| {
        App::new()
            </span><span>// Middlewares are …</span></code></pre></article></section></div>

<p><strong>On November 3, America will go to the polls. But is it even possible to have a free and fair election in the age of Facebook? Already, the platform is being used to suppress African-American, Black and Latinx votes. Its tools are being used to spread lies and to enable private militias to organize voting station protests.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>We need your help to try to hold it to account.&nbsp;</strong></p>




</div></div>

<h3><span>A Facebook emergency</span></h3>



<p>In 2016, we didn’t understand how Facebook was being used to subvert the presidential election. This time, there’s no excuse. A single, unelected man rules Facebook’s vast empire and is accountable to no-one. Time and time again, Facebook has refused to respond to public concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<h3><span>What can we do?</span></h3>



<p>In November 2018, Mark Zuckerberg announced a new ‘independent’ body to provide outside oversight and in May this year the first 20 members of its new Oversight Board were announced. But it’s still not operational and even if it was, it only has limited powers to rule on whether content that was taken down should go back up. And once a case has been referred to it, this self-styled ‘Supreme Court’ can take up to 90 days to reach a verdict. This doesn’t even begin to scratch the surface of the many urgent risks the platform poses to the upcoming election.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<h3><span>The <em>Real</em> Facebook Oversight Board</span></h3>



<p>So, instead, we’re launching our own Oversight Board. The Real Facebook Oversight Board. We’re not waiting for another election to go wrong. We believe accountability in real-time is vital.&nbsp;</p>

If we allow <code>String</code> interpolation, should we do the same for <code>Int</code>s, such as allowing additions or substractions?</p><p>I'd say no, but then why not? If we do allow it, something like this could be possible:</p><pre><code><span><span>query</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  service <span>@include</span><span>(</span><span>if</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>{</span> totalCredits <span>}</span><span>}</span> - <span>{</span><span>{</span> usedCredits <span>}</span><span>}</span> &gt; <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    id</span><br><span>  <span>}</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>I do not support this use case as shown here, I certainly don't like it.

Because it enables templating, which could be considered a legitimate use case:</p><pre><code><span><span>mutation</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  comment<span>(</span><span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    replyToComment<span>(</span><span>data</span><span>:</span> data<span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>      id <span>@sendEmail</span><span>(</span></span><br><span>        <span>to</span><span>:</span> <span>"{{ parentComment.author.email }}"</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>        <span>subject</span><span>:</span> <span>"{{ author.name }} has replied to your comment"</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>        <span>content</span><span>:</span> "</span><br><span>          &lt;p&gt;On <span>{</span><span>{</span> comment.date<span>(</span><span>format</span><span>:</span> \"d/m/<span>Y</span>\"<span>)</span> <span>}</span><span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>{</span> author.name <span>}</span><span>}</span> <span>says</span><span>:</span>&lt;/p&gt;</span><br><span>          &lt;blockquote&gt;<span>{</span><span>{</span> comment.content <span>}</span><span>}</span>&lt;/blockquote&gt;</span><br><span>          &lt;p&gt;Read <span>online</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>{</span> comment.url <span>}</span><span>}</span>&lt;/p&gt;</span><br><span>        "</span><br><span>      <span>)</span></span><br><span>    <span>}</span></span><br><span>  <span>}</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><blockquote><p>Programming languages are good at transforming data. Why not use application logic?</p></blockquote><p>Indeed, my initial proposed features for the spec, <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/682">composable fields</a> and <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/683">composable directives</a>, add meta-scripting capabilities to GraphQL.</p><p>How could that be benefitial? Say that you have a <code>@translate</code> directive that is applied on a <code>String</code>, as in <a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/graphiql/?query=query%20%7B%0A%20%20posts%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20id%0A%20%20%20%20title%20%40translate(from%3A%20%22en%22%2C%20to%3A%20%22es%22)%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D">this query</a>:</p><pre><code><span><span>query</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  posts <span>{</span></span><br><span>    id</span><br><span>    title <span>@translate</span><span>(</span><span>from</span><span>:</span> <span>"en"</span><span>,</span> <span>to</span><span>:</span> <span>"es"</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>  <span>}</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>Now, what happens if a field returns <code>[String]</code>, i.e. a list of <code>String</code>s? Then you can't use <code>@translate</code> anymore, you'd need to create another directive <code>@translateArrays</code>. And if there is only one entry from the array you need to translate, and not all of them? Then you need to add an optional argument <code>$keys: [String]</code> to specify which keys to translate. And if the keys are not strings, but are numeric? Or if instead of an array, you get an array of arrays? And so on, and on, and on.</p><p>Working with only fields to fetch data, the schema might eventually become unwieldy.</p><p>Now, if we have capabilities to compose or manipulate fields, then there is no need to pollute the schema with ad-hoc fields to satisfy each custom combination.</p><p>For <a href="https://graphql-by-pop.com/">GraphQL by PoP</a> (a GraphQL server that I've designed from scratch), I have accomplished this through a syntax called <a href="https://graphql-by-pop.com/docs/extended/pql.html">PQL</a>, which is a superset from the GraphQL query, supporting <a href="https://graphql-by-pop.com/docs/extended/pql-language-features.html#composable-fields">composable fields</a> and <a href="https://graphql-by-pop.com/docs/extended/pql-language-features.html#composable-directives">composable directives</a>.</p><p>Let's see how all combinations can be satisfied just composing elements:</p><ul><li>Translating posts as strings:<br><a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?query=posts.title%3Ctranslate(from:en,to:es)%3E" target="_blank"><code>posts.title&lt;translate(from:en,to:es)&gt;</code></a></li><li>Translating a list of strings:<br><a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?query=echo([hello,%20world,%20how%20are%20you%20today?])%3CforEach%3Ctranslate(from:en,to:es)%3E%3E" target="_blank"><code>echo([hello, world, how are you today?])&lt;forEach&lt;translate(from:en,to:es)&gt;&gt;</code></a></li><li>Translating only one element from the list of strings, with numeric keys:<br><a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?query=echo([hello,%20world,how%20are%20you%20today?])%3CadvancePointerInArray(path:0)%3Ctranslate(from:en,to:es)%3E%3E" target="_blank"><code>echo([hello, world, how are you today?])&lt;advancePointerInArray(path: 0)&lt;translate(from:en,to:es)&gt;&gt;</code></a></li><li>Translating only one element from the list of strings, with keys as strings:<br><a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?query=echo([first:hello,second:world,third:how%20are%20you%20today?])%3CadvancePointerInArray(path:second)%3Ctranslate(from:en,to:es)%3E%3E" target="_blank"><code>echo([first:hello, second:world, third:how are you today?])&lt;advancePointerInArray(path:second)&lt;translate(from:en,to:es)&gt;&gt;</code></a></li><li>Translating an array of arrays:<br><a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?query=echo([[one,two,three],[four,five,six],[seven,eight,nine]])%3CforEach%3CforEach%3Ctranslate(from:en,to:es)%3E%3E%3E" target="_blank"><code>echo([[one, two, three], [four, five, six], [seven, eight, nine]])&lt;forEach&lt;forEach&lt;translate(from:en,to:es)&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></a></li><li>And so on, and on, and on.</li></ul><p>Embeddable fields is a watered-down version of composable fields, good enough for templating, but not for more advanced use cases.</p><blockquote><p>In your article you argue, that it is better to do this on GraphQL, but I don't understand why it would be.</p></blockquote><p>I think there is value in GraphQL having additional capabilities. If a GraphQL query can execute a complex operation all by itself, the query may become more difficult, but the overall application would become much simpler.</p><p>For instance, instead of a typical workflow of using GraphQL to retrieve data, process the data in the client with JavaScript, and then execute some operation in the server with this data, a single GraphQL query with meta-scripting capabilities can completely do away with the client. This is not just fewer lines of code, it's also fewer systems involved.</p><p>As an example that I've implemented for demonstration purposes, a single query <a href="https://graphql-by-pop.com/guides/localized-newsletter.html">can send a localized newsletter</a>.</p><p>This is not far-fetched. I think GraphQL can be considered good for more than just fetching and posting data, because in this modern world of APIs interacting with cloud-based services, it's difficult to determine what is fetching data, and what is executing functionality.</p><p>For instance, are these cases within the confines of just fetching/posting data?</p><ul><li>When uploading an image to the site, we upload it to an S3 bucket</li><li>When creating a post, we send an email notification</li><li>When adding a comment on a static site hosted on Netlify, we trigger a new build</li><li>When executing a query, we save the traces on AWS DynamoDB or Kinesis</li></ul><p>These are all operations that can be perfectly integrated within the GraphQL service, and that are typically found on a CI/CD pipeline. Imagine if the pipeline stages were GraphQL queries. GraphQL would then become the interface not just for fetching/posting data, but also for interacting with services.</p><p>I'm pretty confident that providing a robust support to GraphQL to interact with these cloud-based services can only make our API more powerful, capable of supporting more use cases, and better prepared for new requirements in the future.</p><blockquote><p>Another principle for GraphQL was coined by Lee Byron: A GraphQL server should only expose queries, that it can fulfill efficiently.</p></blockquote><p>These are not contradictory propositions. If well architected, the GraphQL server will not necessarily degrade its performance. GraphQL by PoP, for instance, resolves the query with <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/simplifying-the-graphql-data-model/">linear complexity time on the number of types</a>, so it supports composable fields to any number of levels without a scratch.</p><blockquote><p>The more features we add to GraphQL, the harder it becomes to ensure, that the queries are efficiently executable.</p></blockquote><p>Same as above.</p><blockquote><p>Furthermore, your functionality requires consecutive resolver executions for one single field. This fundamentally changes how queries are executed (in a way that IMO is incompatible with the spec).</p></blockquote><p>That's up to interpretation. I have not seen it described in the spec, and I believe it should not be there, since the spec is about defining standards on how the API must behave, and not about the nitty-gritty of the server's implementation.</p><blockquote><p>GraphQL is designed to be simple on purpose.</p></blockquote><p>I agree that these changes add complexity to the GraphQL servers, and extra capabilities to the GraphQL queries that make it more difficult to learn.</p><p>But at the same time, they make the GraphQL service more powerful and versatile, and enable the architecture of the overall application to become simpler.</p><p>For me the question is, is it worth it?</p></div></div>]]>

<div itemprop="text">
<p>I didn’t mess up the post’s title – I do mean you should stop winning arguments. This, of course, doesn’t mean you would start losing them – debates are not zero-sum games, and they are not fights either. We tend to turn them into rows, of course, when things get emotional, but that’s precisely the problem. </p>
<p>Arguments are also not goals, rather tools to achieve them – and those goals ideally should be to have better diversity of ideas, to get to alignment and test our assumptions. All this should take us to a much better place than we would be without debate.</p>
<p>This is easier said than done – our brains play some pretty sly tricks on us, many times without us being aware of what’s happening. </p>
<h2>Common logical fallacies in arguments</h2>
<p>Once you’ve decided you’d like to have productive arguments you need to identify the typical signs and forms of bad arguments, which, in most cases fall into the category of logical fallacies.</p>
<p>A logical fallacy is an error in reasoning common enough to earn its own fancy name. Knowing how to spot and identify these is an invaluable skill. It can save you time, money, relationships and personal dignity. We’ll focus on the so-called informal fallacies – issues with the content and not the form of your arguments. Wikipedia has a massive<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#Informal_fallacies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> list</a> of these, and I’ll only talk about a few frequent ones.</p>
<h3>Bulverism</h3>
<p>Bulverism is the logical fallacy of assuming without discussion that a person is wrong and then distracting his or her attention from this (the only real issue) by explaining how that person became so silly, usually associating it to a psychological condition. The fallacy deals with secondary questions about ideas rather than the primary one, thus avoiding the basic question or evading the issues raised by trains of reasoning. It is essentially dodging your opponent’s argument by treating them like a psychiatry patient who needs your evaluation to explain why they came up with such a ridiculous argument in the first place.</p>
<p>Person A: “We should re-examine gender-roles in American society, because there may be more beneficial paradigms.”<br>Person B: “Feminists have brainwashed you; You need to stop listening to people who want to ruin America.”</p>
<p>The fallacy was coined by C.S. Lewis in his essay, <em>First and Second things</em>.</p>
<h3>Ad hominem</h3>
<p>When people think of arguments, often their first thought is of shouting matches full of personal attacks. Ironically, personal attacks run contrary to rational arguments. In logic and rhetoric, a personal attack is called an ad hominem. Ad hominem is Latin for “against the man.” Instead of advancing good sound reasoning, an ad hominem replaces logical argumentation with attack-language unrelated to the truth of the matter.</p>
<p>More specifically, the ad hominem is a fallacy of relevance where someone rejects or criticises another person’s view based on personal characteristics, background, physical appearance, or other features irrelevant to the argument at issue.</p>
<p>This fallacy is so common that it even has sub-classes describing the multiple ways we aim to attack each other in debates.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Circumstantial</strong> ad hominem occurs when someone attacks a claim by saying that the person making the claim is only making it because it’s in his/her interest or because of his/her circumstances. This actually has no bearing on whether or not the claim is true or false. <em>“You only want more women in the engineering team because you are a woman.”</em></li><li><strong>Tu quoque a.k.a. “the appeal to hypocrisy”</strong>: Tu quouqe means “you also”. It is claiming the argument is flawed by pointing out that the one making the argument is not acting consistently with the claims of the argument. <em>“Stop telling me sugar is bad for my health; you eat cookies all the time.”</em></li><li><strong>Guilt by association</strong>: When the person making the argument is viewed negatively because of its association with another person or group who is already viewed negatively. <em>“Well, you know who else supported civil rights so fiercely? Communists!”</em></li><li><strong>Abusive ad hominem</strong>: Attacking the person making the argument, rather than the statement itself, when the attack on the person is utterly irrelevant to the statement the person is making. <em>“I think that you’re stupid and that nobody cares about your opinion.”</em></li><li><strong>Tone policing</strong>: Tone policing is an attack that focuses on how someone makes an argument, rather than on the argument itself. <em>“Okay, okay, no need to get so emotional over these things.”</em></li><li>The <strong>credentials fallacy</strong> is about stating that the person who made that argument doesn’t have sufficient credentials in the field being discussed, while those credentials are not necessary for the argument. <em>“Why are you writing an article about logical fallacies, you’re not a philosophy professor… ;)”</em></li><li><strong>Poisoning the well</strong> is a rhetorical technique where someone presents irrelevant negative information about their opponent, with the goal of discrediting their opponent’s arguments. Poisoning the well is a term referring to Medieval attacks on Jewish communities. Without evidence, people would accuse Jewish people of poisoning the town well when there was sickness in the city. This was used as an excuse to attack Jewish people and consider anything they were associated with as a tainted or evil. <em>“You’re a known liar, why should we listen to you?!”</em></li><li><strong>Argumentum ergo decedo</strong>, also known as <strong>the traitorous critic fallacy,</strong> is telling a person who criticised something that they should stay away from the subject of their criticism if they disapprove of the current situation. <em>“Well if you don’t like how we test our code here you can always find another company.”</em></li></ul>
<h3>Straw man Argument</h3>
<p>It’s much easier to defeat your opponent’s argument when it’s made of straw. The straw man argument is aptly named after a harmless, lifeless, scarecrow. In the strawman argument, someone attacks a position the opponent doesn’t really hold. Instead of contending with the actual argument, he or she attacks the equivalent of a lifeless bundle of straw, an easily defeated effigy, which the opponent never intended upon defending anyway.</p>
<p>The basic structure of the argument consists of Person A making a claim, Person B creating a distorted version of the claim (the “straw man”), and then Person B attacking this distorted version in order to refute Person A’s original assertion.</p>
<p>Person A: Evolution explains how animals developed, adapted and diversified over millions of years.</p>
<p>Person B: If we evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys? And why don’t we have three arms? Wouldn’t that give me a competitive advantage?</p>
<h3>Argumentum ad ignorantiam – appeal to ignorance</h3>
<p>This fallacy occurs when you argue that your conclusion must be true because there is no evidence against it. This fallacy wrongly shifts the burden of proof away from the one making the claim. Here the ignorance represents “a lack of contrary evidence”.</p>
<p>Common subclasses:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Absence of evidence</strong>: “There’s no evidence of bugs in my code, so it must be bug-free”</li><li><strong>False positives / false negatives</strong>: “I wore red socks and we won the baseball game. My red socks helped win the game.” – “I’ll stop taking antibiotics, I’ve taken them since yesterday and I’m not cured yet.”</li><li><strong>Evidence of absence</strong>: “All Python code is fast, I’ve never written slow Python code in my life.”</li></ul>
<h3>False dichotomy or false dilemma</h3>
<p>A limited number of options are incorrectly presented as being mutually exclusive to one another or as being the only options that exist, in a situation where that isn’t the case. For example, a false dilemma occurs in a situation where someone says that we must choose between options A or B, without mentioning that option C also exists. </p>
<p>“You’re either with us, or against us.”</p>
<p>Many times it’s paired with other ad hominem, e.g. poisoning the well or guilt by association: </p>
<p>“If you don’t support the complete rewrite of this service you don’t care about quality”</p>
<p>There are subtle versions too, such as:</p>
<p>“Censorship laws are not tools for suppressing the population, but rather for preventing crime.”</p>
<h3>Slippery slope fallacy</h3>
<p>When a relatively insignificant first event is suggested to lead to a more significant event, which in turn leads to a more significant event, and so on, until some ultimate, significant event is reached, where the connection of each event is not only unwarranted but with each step it becomes more and more improbable. Many events are usually present in this fallacy, but only two are actually required — usually connected by “the next thing you know…”</p>
<p>“Come on; we can’t support flexible working hours! First, people will show up later and later, leave early then sooner or later, no work will get done!”</p>
<p>“If we legalize pot, then that will lead to every drug in the world becoming legal”</p>
<h3>Hasty generalisation</h3>
<p>Also known as overgeneralization, this fallacy is drawing a conclusion based on a small sample size, rather than looking at statistics that are much more in line with the typical or average situation.</p>
<p>“My father smoked four packs of cigarettes a day since age fourteen and lived until age sixty-nine. Therefore, smoking really can’t be that bad for you.”</p>
<p>Hasty generalization may be the most common logical fallacy because there’s no single agreed-upon measure for “sufficient” evidence.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are many many more of such fallacies – the point is that it’s terribly easy to fall into such traps, some people even learned to consciously or automatically use the above fallacies as “techniques” to win arguments – you might be one of them! I, for sure have done this many times, guilty as charged. Wait, did I just overgeneralize? 😉 </p>
<p>There are ways to mitigate or at least control such behaviours and fallacies, such as following strict debate formats or having <em><strong>an unbiased, experienced moderator </strong></em>but ultimately real change only happens when we <em>stop wanting to win arguments</em>. An easy way to start is to think back and honestly re-evaluate your arguments once your mind cooled down a bit. Do a “retrospective” of your debates and try to identify your emotions and potential fallacies. If you get into this …</p></div></div></div>

<p><b>Summary:</b> Puma 5 is a huge major release for the project. It brings several new experimental performance features, along with tons of bugfixes and features. Let's talk about some of the most important ones. <i>(1839 words / 7 minutes)</i>
</p>
<p>Puma 5 (codename Spoony Bard<sup>1</sup><span>(When Puma gets a new ‘supercontributor’ that submits lots of important work to the project, we let them name the next release.

This release features a lot of code from Will Jordan, who named this release ‘Spoony Bard’. Will said: ‘Final Fantasy IV is especially nostalgic for me, the first big open-source project I ever worked on was a fan re-translation of the game back in the late 90s.’</span>) was released today (my birthday!). There’s a lot going on in this release, so I wanted to talk about the different features and changes to give Puma users confidence in upgrading.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-performance-features-for-cluster-mode-on-mri">Experimental Performance Features For Cluster Mode on MRI</h2>
<p>This is probably the headline of the release - two features for reducing memory usage, and one for reducing latency.</p>
<p>Puma 5 contains 3 new experimental performance features:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>wait_for_less_busy_worker</code> config. This may reduce latency on MRI through inserting a small delay (sleep sort!) before re-listening on the socket if worker is busy. Intended result: If enabled, should reduce latency in high-load (&gt;50% utilization) Puma clusters.</li>
<li><code>fork_worker</code> option and <code>refork</code> command for reduced memory usage by forking from a worker process instead of the master process. Intended result: If enabled, should reduce memory usage.</li>
<li>Added <code>nakayoshi_fork</code> config option. Reduce memory usage in preloaded cluster-mode apps by GCing before fork and compacting, where available. Intended result: If enabled, should reduce memory usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these experiments are only for <strong>cluster mode</strong> Puma configs running on <strong>MRI</strong>.</p>
<p>We’re calling them <em>experimental</em> because we’re not sure if they’ll actually have any benefit. We’re pretty sure they’re stable and won’t break anything, but we’re not sure they’re actually going to have big benefits in the real world. People’s workloads are often not what we anticipate, and synthetic benchmarks are usually not of any help in figuring out if a change will be beneficial or not.</p>
<p>We do not believe any of the new features will have a negative effect or impact the stability of your application. This is either a “it works” or “it does nothing” experiment.</p>
<p>If any of the features turn out to be particularly beneficial, we may make them defaults in future versions of Puma.</p>
<p><strong>If you upgrade and try any of the 3 new features, please post before and after results or screenshots to <a href="https://github.com/puma/puma/issues/2258">this Github issue</a>.</strong> “It didn’t do anything” is still a useful report in this case. Posting ~24 hours of “before” and ~24 hours of “after” data would be most helpful.</p>
<h3 id="wait_for_less_busy_worker-sleep-sort-for-faster-apps">wait_for_less_busy_worker: sleep sort for faster apps?!</h3>
<p>This feature was contributed to Puma by Gitlab. Turn it on by adding <code>wait_for_less_busy_worker</code> to your Puma config.</p>
<p>When a request comes in to a Puma cluster, the operating system randomly selects a listening, free Puma worker process to pick up the request. “Listening” and “free” being the key words - a Puma process will only listen to the socket (and pick up more requests) if it has nothing else to do. However, when running Puma with multiple threads, Puma will also listen on the socket when all of its busy threads are waiting on I/O or have otherwise released <a href="https://www.speedshop.co/2020/09/17/2020/05/11/the-ruby-gvl-and-scaling.html">the Global VM Lock</a>.</p>
<p>When Gitlab investigated switching from Unicorn to Puma, they encountered an issue with this behavior. Under high load with moderate thread settings (a max pool size of 5 in their case), average request latency increased. Why?</p>
<p>Remember, I said that the operating system <em>randomly</em> assigns a request to a <em>listening</em> worker process. So, it will never send a request to a worker process that’s busy doing other things, but what about a worker process that’s got 4 threads that are processing other requests, but all 4 of those threads happen to be waiting on I/O right now?</p>
<p>Imagine a Puma cluster with 3 workers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Worker 1: 0/5 threads busy.</li>
<li>Worker 2: 1/5 threads busy.</li>
<li>Worker 3: 4/5 threads busy.</li>
</ul>
<p>If Worker 3’s 4 active threads happen to all have released the GVL, allowing that worker to listen to the socket, and a new request comes in - which worker process should we assign the request to, ideally? Worker 1, right? Unfortunately, most operating systems will assign the request to Worker 3 33% of the time.</p>
<p>So, what do we do? We want the operating system to prefer less-loaded workers. It would be really cool if we could sort the list of workers listening on the socket so that the operating system would give requests to the least-loaded worker. Well, we can’t really do that easily, but we can do something else.</p>
<p><code>wait_for_less_busy_worker</code> causes a worker to <em>wait</em> to re-listen on the socket if it’s thread pool isn’t completely empty. This means that in high-load scenarios, the operating system will assign requests to less-loaded workers.</p>
<p><strong>This is basically sleep-sorting our workers</strong>. We’re kind of doing doing this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>[].tap { |a| workers.map { |e| Thread.new{ sleep worker_busyness.to_f/1000; a &lt;&lt; e} }.each{|t| t.join} }
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>… and hiding “more loaded” workers from the operating system by letting less-loaded workers listen first!</p>
<p>Originally the proposal was for a more complicated sort - processes slept longer if they had more busy threads - but that was removed when it was found that a simpler on/off sleep was just as effective.</p>
<p>The net effect is that in high-load scenarios, request latency decreases. This is because workers with more busy threads are slower than workers with no busy threads. We’re assuring that requests get assigned to the faster workers. Prior to this patch, Gitlab saw an increase in latency using Puma compared to Unicorn - after this patch, latency was the same (they also were able to reduce their fleet size by almost 30% thanks to Puma’s memory-saving multithreaded design).</p>
<p>There may be even more efficient ways for us to implement this behavior in the future. There’s some magic you can do with <code>libev</code>, I’m pretty sure, or we can just implement a different sleep/wait strategy.</p>
<h3 id="fork_worker">fork_worker</h3>
<p>Adding <code>fork_worker</code> to your puma.rb config file (or <code>--fork-worker</code> from the CLI) turns on this feature. This mode causes Puma to fork additional workers from worker 0, instead of directly from the master process:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>10000   \_ puma 5.0.0 (tcp://0.0.0.0:9292) [puma]
10001       \_ puma: cluster worker 0: 10000 [puma]
10002           \_ puma: cluster worker 1: 10000 [puma]
10003           \_ puma: cluster worker 2: 10000 [puma]
10004           \_ puma: cluster worker 3: 10000 [puma]
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Similar to the <code>preload_app!</code> option, the <code>fork_worker</code> option allows your application to be initialized only once for copy-on-write memory savings, and it has two additional advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Compatible with phased restart.</strong> Because the master process itself doesn’t preload the application, this mode works with phased restart (<code>SIGUSR1</code> or <code>pumactl phased-restart</code>), unlike <code>preload_app!</code>. When worker 0 reloads as part of a phased restart, it initializes a new copy of your application first, then the other workers reload by forking from this new worker already containing the new preloaded application.</li>
</ol>
<p>This allows a phased restart to complete as quickly as a hot restart (<code>SIGUSR2</code> or <code>pumactl restart</code>), while still minimizing downtime by staggering the restart across cluster workers.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>‘Refork’ for additional copy-on-write improvements in running applications.</strong> Fork-worker mode introduces a new <code>refork</code> command that re-loads all nonzero workers by re-forking them from worker 0.</li>
</ol>
<p>This command can potentially improve memory utilization in large or complex applications that don’t fully pre-initialize on startup, because the re-forked workers can share copy-on-write memory with a worker that has been running for a while and serving requests.</p>
<p>You can trigger a refork by sending the cluster the <code>SIGURG</code> signal or running the <code>pumactl refork</code> command at any time. A refork will also automatically trigger once, after a certain number of requests have been processed by worker 0 (default 1000). To configure the number of requests before the auto-refork, pass a positive integer argument to <code>fork_worker</code> (e.g., <code>fork_worker 1000</code>), or <code>0</code> to disable.</p>
<h3 id="nakayoshi_fork">nakayoshi_fork</h3>
<p>Add <code>nakayoshi_fork</code> to your puma.rb config to try this option.</p>
<p>Nakayoshi means “friendly”, so this is a “friendly fork”. The concept was <a href="https://github.com/ko1/nakayoshi_fork">originally implemented by MRI supercontributor Koichi Sasada</a> in a gem, but we wanted to see if we could bring a simpler version into Puma.</p>
<p>Basically, we just do the following before forking a worker:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>4</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>{</span> <span>GC</span><span>.</span><span>start</span> <span>}</span>
<span>GC</span><span>.</span><span>compact</span> <span># if available</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The concept here is that we’re trying to get as clean of a Ruby heap as possible before forking to maximize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write">copy-on-write</a> benefits. That should, in turn, lead to reduced memory usage.</p>
<h2 id="other-new-features">Other New Features</h2>
<p>A few more things in the grab-bag:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now compile Puma on machines where OpenSSL is not installed.</li>
<li>There is now a <code>thread-backtraces</code> command in pumactl to print all active threads backtraces. This has been available via SIGINFO on Darwin, but now it works on Linux via this new command.</li>
<li><code>Puma.stats</code> now has a <code>requests_count</code> counter.</li>
<li><code>lowlevel_error_handler</code> got some enhancements - we also pass the status code to it now.</li>
<li>Phased restarts and worker timeouts should be faster.</li>
<li><code>Puma.stats_hash</code> provides Puma statistics as a hash, rather than as JSON.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="loads-of-bugfixes">Loads of Bugfixes</h2>
<p>The number of bugfixes in this release is pretty huge. Here’s the most important ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shutdowns should be more reliable.</li>
<li>Issues surrounding socket closing on shutdown have been resolved.</li>
<li>Fixed some concurrency …</li></ul></article></div></div></div>

This is a newsletter about automating aspects of your business.</em></p><h3 id="story-and-problem">Story and Problem</h3><p>Yikes! I found out this week that the confirmation link in the signup email didn't work for the Automation Cookbook! I've been making improvements and updating the settings on various services piece by piece, and I accidentally flipped some bad settings in my email service provider that caused the links to break.</p><figure><img src="https://automationcookbook.io/content/images/2020/09/Gmail_-_--_Confirm_your_subscription_to_Automation_Cookbook.png" alt="" srcset="https://automationcookbook.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Gmail_-_--_Confirm_your_subscription_to_Automation_Cookbook.png 600w, https://automationcookbook.io/content/images/2020/09/Gmail_-_--_Confirm_your_subscription_to_Automation_Cookbook.png 606w"></figure><p>I only happened to noticed because I was trying to set subscription goals. Otherwise, I would have never noticed, and wondered why no one was signing up this week. 😑</p><p>While there are plenty of services for website uptime monitoring, there isn't really anything for email subscription monitoring. To stop this from happening again, I set up an email subscription monitoring automation.</p><p>If the workflow executed successfully, it won't do anything. If anything goes wrong in the subscription process, it'll alert me in Slack. 📨</p><h3 id="automation">Automation</h3><p>This time, I was playing with <a href="https://n8n.io/">n8n.io</a>, so I implemented the email subscription monitor service with it.</p><p>The outline of the entire automation is:</p><ol><li>A cron node triggered every hour</li><li>A WebRequest node to send a POST request to subscribe to the newsletter</li><li>If the subscription is a success...</li><li>A Gmail node to check the email account for latest messages</li><li>A HTML Extract node to parse the email body for the email link</li><li>A WebRequest node to send a GET request to check the confirmation link</li><li>Success or failure, run an AWS lambda function to delete the member record</li><li>If Subscribe or Visit fails, alert on Slack!</li></ol><figure><img src="https://automationcookbook.io/content/images/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-26-at-11.29.21-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://automationcookbook.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-26-at-11.29.21-PM.png 600w, https://automationcookbook.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-26-at-11.29.21-PM.png 1000w, https://automationcookbook.io/content/images/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-26-at-11.29.21-PM.png 1246w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The entire email subscription signup automation</figcaption></figure><p>(The start node can't be deleted, so that's why it floats)</p><p>The <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> newsletter/blogging platform doesn't have an API to add or remove members so that's why there's an AWS lambda node at the very end that removes members. All the lambda function does is log into the database and deletes the member record. </p><p>Normally databases aren't exposed directly to the web--even with a password, for security reasons, so that's why I did it this way. If the n8n container is in the same intranet as the database in a Kubernetes cluster, then maybe you'd connect directly.</p><p>This is more complicated than the usual automation because it has a bunch of steps. But it's entirely doable.

It has abruptly stopped the service industry leading to job losses and clogs in the unemployment benefit system. For the tech industry, it has made remote work universal with many major tech companies recently deciding that their employees will be working from home for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://jellyfish.co/"><span>Jellyfish</span></a> is the engineering management platform that helps teams understand how they are working towards roadmaps, interacting with one another, and spending time on objectives. We use data from GitHub and other sources to quantify and understand this activity, but this data can also be used to understand engineering trends across the country. At Jellyfish, we wanted to use GitHub [GitLab or Bitbucket] data to ask a simple question about these news trends:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>How has coding activity changed from before the pandemic to now? In particular, how has the distribution in time for when people make commits to Git changed?</em></strong></p><h3><strong>Peak Work Shifts Earlier in the Day</strong></h3><p>To answer this, we looked in particular at the distribution in time for when people make commits to <a href="https://github.com/"><span>GitHub</span></a> [as well as <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/"><span>GitLab</span></a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/product/"><span>Bitbucket</span></a>]. We compared the distributions for the month of January (well before any states began suggesting and then requiring remote work to curb the spread of COVID), and July (three and a half months after many such suggestions were implemented).

Such a peak is what we would expect if we imagined engineers committing code on a standard 9-5pm office schedule. We henceforth call this the “9-5pm peak”, and its existence is a signal for the pre-covid working habits of engineers. This peak does not exist for the July distribution. Rather, it is flatter and has a longer tail of commit times, which suggests that engineers who had comprised the “9-5pm peak” have now become more varied in the time spans of their work. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1598917896073_15523"><div>

            <section>
                <p>Before I was actually getting paid to write code, I got extremely accustomed to picking up new frameworks and libraries very quickly. I'd bootstrap a new web application in Rails in one week, but then the next week I'd be using Python and Flask for a different project. I also "learnt as I went", and got used to Googling for things as I needed them.</p><p>My relationship with documentation was complicated — I'd always read the "Getting Started" pages and then mostly forget about the documentation, and would only come back to it if Google or someone else linked me to it. Sometimes, this led to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10962085/lua-string-to-int">some extremely lazy questions</a> on StackOverflow.</p><p>When I started my professional software engineering career, these habits didn't really go away. I'd join a new team or project and then just start contributing with code as quickly as possible, mostly by doing pattern matching on existing code and by asking for help/Googling as needed. This worked out okay for a while but then I started noticing that the more senior engineers were able to diagnose bugs related to our dependencies much harder than the ones I took on, and they were also able to discuss internals of the libraries and frameworks we used to build our software. I also remember my manager saying things like "I read that library's documentation, I don't think it'll work very well if we try to do X with it".</p><p>This made me realize that I should actually be <strong>treating documentation more like a book</strong>, by reading it end-to-end before I <code>npm install</code>'ed something, especially for dependencies that were going to be widely used within a project. Of course, this is easier said than done since it requires <em>a great deal of discipline</em>.</p><h2 id="what-about-reading-the-code">What about reading the code?</h2><p>I fundamentally believe in treating our dependencies' code as our own code (it's part of our binaries, just like the code we write ourselves), and reading some of that code before we bring it in, similarly to how we do code review for what our coworkers write.</p><p>However, there's a lot to be said this. I'm not going to recommend that people go out and read the source code for React.js if they want to use it. Yet, for smaller libraries, this can make a lot of sense. There's also some techniques for more efficiently reading the code of an open source library, and I may write another article about this in the future.</p><h2 id="do-you-need-to-read-the-whole-documentation">Do you need to read the whole documentation?</h2><p>As with many things like this, it depends, but probably not. As I mentioned in the beginning of the article, it's certainly possible to use a library or even a programming language without reading its full documentation. There can be diminishing returns on the time that we invest in reading documentation, especially when you're reading things like API references, which are usually consulted and not read upfront.</p><p>There's exceptions to every rule, but I find myself asking the following questions when trying to decide how much I should be reading.</p><ul><li>How long are we going to use this project for? </li><li>Is it a small UI component or a framework that will define the architecture of our application? (This is a very large spectrum, so take this question with a grain of salt)</li><li>Is this so small that I should also be reading the code?</li><li>Is this API reference something I should skim or read fully?</li><li>How complex are the internals? Do I need to understand how this thing works or do I just need to be able to use it?</li></ul><p>Finally, it's important to note that not all documentation is structured equally. Some projects may have a "Handbook" which is a great first read for newcomers (e.g., <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html">https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html</a>). For people that strongly prefer learning by doing, a "Tutorial" section can teach you most of the basics (e.g., <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html</a>).</p><p>When in doubt, I tend to lean on the side of reading more than less, since an extra hour of studying can easily pay off in the long run, and it's rarely a wasted hour.</p><h2 id="working-out-the-discipline">Working out the discipline</h2><p>There's various ways of dealing with the discipline required to read documentation upfront. For example, if you find it hard to stay focused while reading something long, you definitely need to break it up and use "markers" to know where you last left off. Here's some other techniques that have worked well for me.</p><h3 id="1-required-reading-lists">1. Required Reading Lists</h3><p>For new hires that join your team, make sure they have a "Required Reading" list that they are expected to complete within the first 2-3 months. Make sure to let them know exactly <strong>which pages/sections</strong> <strong>they are expected to read</strong>, along with any other notes which you may find relevant. Here's a <strong>very short</strong> example:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>URL</th>
<th>Sections</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://reactpatterns.com/">https://reactpatterns.com/</a></td>
<td>Read everything</td>
<td>This should be read after you've been using React for at least a couple of months.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://reactivex.io/rxjs/manual/overview.html#introduction">http://reactivex.io/rxjs/manual/overview.html#introduction</a></td>
<td>Only read the following categories: - Introduction - Observable - Subscriptions</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>If you're joining a new team and they don't have a "required reading" guide, ask people on the team what you should read and then create one! Attach it to your onboarding guide and nudge folks to give it some love every now and then.</p><h3 id="2-taking-notes-and-sharing-them-with-the-team">2. Taking notes and sharing them with the team</h3><p>Recently, we started using <a href="https://testing-library.com/">React Testing Library</a> at work to write frontend integration tests. It's likely that we'll continue to use this library for years and years to come, and before we decided to use it, I made my fair share of prototyping and reading about it. However, just as we started using it, I decided to read its full documentation, end-to-end, like a book.</p><p>I also decided to take some very raw notes about what I read and to share them with the team. This was also helpful as a way to "mark" where I last left off since I wasn't able to read it in one go. However, this was primarily helpful as a motivator for me to work out the discipline to read everything. Finally, once I was done I was able to share with the team which pages they should also read and which ones they can skip which saves everyone time.</p><h3 id="3-reading-groups-are-fun-">3. Reading groups are fun!</h3><p>Soon, at work, we're going to be writing our new code using <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">React Hooks</a> (if you've never used React before, it's a new API for implementing UI components with React). There's a lot one should read about React Hooks before starting to use them, since they can be very different from React Class Components.</p><p>Definitely on this list is the official documentation, but there's some other articles and reading guides that we've found helpful. To help us all get through this before the switchover, we created a reading group which basically consists of an internal spreadsheet with the list of articles and what each person has read so far. We will then build on top of this by scheduling some calls to discuss specific things that we're finding difficult, and we can also asynchronously discuss other things over Slack and email.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Valuing the importance of reading documentation <em>upfront</em> was certainly a hard learned lesson for me, something I struggled with time and time again. Working out the courage to read the full documentation of a new library or framework that we're adopting can be hard, but I find it's more rewarding than we usually think.</p><p>I've been applying this approach more and more as I get more experienced, and don't see myself switching back. The next step for me is trying to convey why I think this is important, hence I wrote this article, but I think that sharing the notes I take about the documentation I read internally more often will also persuade others into trying this out.</p><p>Reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/davidrfgomes">Twitter</a> if you have something to add!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>ನಮಸ್ಕಾರ (Namaskāra)! This is not a post on fintech, or even technology for that matter. This is the story of a product of tenacity, selflessness, and passion; a product that will transcend and outlive most technology we know of. This is the story of a massive dictionary that will become the window to a language spoken by tens of millions of people for generations to come, a resource its author has donated to posterity. This is the story of V. Krishna, <a href="https://alar.ink/"><em>Alar</em></a>, his Kannada-English dictionary, and its accidental discovery and open sourcing at an unlikely place, a stock brokerage, Zerodha. This post is also a personal note, something I have not attempted in a long time.</p><h3 id="prologue">Prologue</h3><p>I have been running <a href="https://olam.in/">Olam</a>, an English-Malayalam and Malayalam-Malayalam dictionary, since 2010. It was built out of the frustration of not having an easily accessible online Malayalam dictionary, of the frustration at dictionary websites that insulted the reader’s intelligence with poor usability, terrible ad-ridden spamminess, and no respect for language. Olam’s website has stayed exactly the same for 10 years. It has an input box that responds to dictionary lookups in under ~50ms, exactly as it did in 2010. It is actively used by millions of Malayalam speakers.</p><p>The first version of the Olam corpus was seeded with unattributed word lists I scraped together from random parts of the web, and several thousand entries I entered myself. Since then, the English-Malayalam dictionary has been expanding slowly with crowdsourced entries.</p><p>The entire Olam corpus is <a href="https://olam.in/open">open source</a> (licensed under <a href="https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/">OdBL</a>), or open data, rather. While the English-Malayalam corpus is crowdsourced, the Malayalam-Malayalam corpus (now known as the <em>Datuk Corpus</em>) was created out of the mammoth digitisation project the late <a href="https://www.asianetnews.com/pravasam/datuk-kj-joseph-passes-away-pm1xdr">“Datuk” K. J. Joseph</a> undertook in the late 90s, when he single-handledly digitised an out-of-copyright Malayalam-Malayalam dictionary along with many other books and posted them online at the expense of copious amounts of time out of his retirement. He was a Malayali settled in Malaysia, a prominent active social worker and educator. The Malaysian government conferred the title “Datuk” upon him in recognition of his exemplary services in the country, which then ended up being his nickname too. I do not know of the origin of the dictionary Datuk digtised, but it is poignant to think that the original author’s work lives on after a century.</p><p>I discovered the RTF file Datuk had posted a decade prior on an inactive Yahoo groups page around the time I was working on Olam. Needless to say, I was stumped by the scope of this project, and immediately started working on integrating it into Olam. It took more than two years of on and off work to convert the text from the original ASCII input to Unicode, and to clean, structure, and correct close to 200,000 entries. The dataset was named <em>Datuk Corpus</em>, and was published on Olam in 2013. I wrote to the Swathanthra Malayalam Computing (SMC) mailing list <a href="http://lists.smc.org.in/pipermail/discuss-smc.org.in/2013-May/015592.html">announcing it</a>, and we launched it with some fanfare at the SMC conference held in Thrissur, Kerala, that year. Datuk’s story was covered by the press, and his work was now open and available to everyone.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, I was connected to Datuk by an old friend of his I had met at the conference, and we spoke briefly on the phone. He had seen the news clip of the dictionary’s release, and was thrilled to know that his work was now accessible as he had originally intended. Open data lives on. He found it amusing that a random stranger had somehow unearthed a relic he had lost to the annals of internet history. Life is absurd like that, shaped in infinite ways by tiny, random events.</p><p>Datuk <a href="https://www.facebook.com/amma.org.my/posts/tribute-to-the-late-datuk-k-j-josephthe-late-datuk-k-j-joseph-was-a-prominent-ed/2157527197640248/">passed away in January 2019</a>. He was 89 years old. RIP Datuk. Your work’s utility will span generations. The data you created will proliferate and continue to be useful to humanity in ways we never imagined. Such is the beauty of open data. I consider it a privilege to have been able to speak to you just that one time.</p><h3 id="open-data">Open data</h3><blockquote><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data">Open data</a> is the idea that some data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control.</p></blockquote><p>I shudder to think of a world without Wikipedia. The open data movement shares strong parallels with the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) movement. The gist is that certain knowledge should be freely available to everyone with no restrictions and with one goal—collective advancement of humanity.</p><p>I consider dictionaries to be on top of that list. The stepping stone to language, the underpinning of civilisation. Dictionaries should be open, free, and easily accessible to everyone, everywhere. If we cannot share something as fundamental as language without motives of profit, we ought to do some serious introspection as members of an advanced civilisation.</p><p>An open data dictionary for every Indian language, the largest collection of open source dictionaries in the world, would be an immense resource for not only India but for humanity in general. Ideally, this is the kind of project governments should do. State governments could very easily partner with local universities and undertake the creation and maintenance of open data dictionaries.</p><p>That said, at Zerodha, we would be happy to fund projects to create high quality open data dictionaries if there are scholars out there working on them.</p><h3 id="a-kannada-dictionary">A Kannada dictionary</h3><p>I moved from Kerala to Bengaluru in early 2012 to get access to fast internet. Bengaluru is a melting pot of people from all over India, and English is the glue that holds the “IT sector” together. I can comprehend Kannada speech reasonably well and speak rather poorly, but cannot read the script, thanks to the lack of opportunities to learn over the many years spent between home, where we speak Malayalam, and work, an English speaking environment. With the guilt of not being able to learn Kannada, and the great satisfaction of having Olam as an open data corpus, I had been looking for ways to build a Kannada dictionary right after I had moved to Bengaluru.</p><p>Sometime in 2016, I presented the idea of having an open source Kannada dictionary created from scratch to Nithin. He was immediately on board to commission the project. A perk I enjoy, the privilege of having a resourceful backer who believes in public good. Not knowing where to start, I asked around a few places but nothing materialised for the next two years, and as always, I continued to bring up this conversation once in a while.</p><p>Then, sometime in October 2018, I randomly brought up the conversation again, and Srihari, who had just joined the tech team, happened to overhear it. He vaguely remembered that someone in his family had been associated with a dictionary for a long time. This would be one of those minuscule, random events that would significantly change the timeline; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect">Butterfly effect</a> in action. I crossed my fingers and he soon setup a meeting with V. Krishna, the relative of his. Shortly thereafter, Srihari, Sharath (also from the tech team), and I went to <a href="http://www.kagapa.in/">KaGaPa’s</a> office to meet V. Krishna and to find out what exactly it was that Srihari remembered about him and a dictionary. KaGaPa (Kannada Ganaka Parishat) created the popular Nudi font and input method for Kannada, an important early innovation for digital Kannada, and V. Krishna had worked with them on several projects.</p><p>V. Krishna and Narasimhamurthy, KaGaPa’s proprietor, spoke passionately about Kannada literature and digitisation projects in the quaint little office room, surrounded by stacks of old Kannada books and literature. It was the perfect setting. Then, the extremely soft-spoken and mild-mannered V. Krishna fired up a computer and showed us his lifelong side project, his Kannada-English dictionary. Researched and written over a period of more than 40 years, 150,000+ Kannada words and 240,000+ English definitions, all neatly typed up in a Word document, complete with parts of speech tags and phonetic notations with diacritics for Kannada words. The ambition of the project, its scholarly quality, the depth of the data, the culmination of one man’s passion, perseverance, and tenacity over a lifetime, all lying in obscurity, stumbled upon by sheer coincidence. Absolutely mind blowing.</p><h3 id="v-krishna">V. Krishna</h3><figure><img src="https://zerodha.tech/static/images/vkrishna-alar.png" alt="V. Krishna's photo" height="150"></figure><p>V. Krishna was born in 1950 in the Malanayakana Halli village in Mysore district in Karnataka. He studied in a Kannada medium school, followed by a year at a pre-university college that he was forced to drop out of before moving to Bengaluru with his family in 1968.</p><p>He found a job at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) in 1970. At IARI, around this time, noticing him struggle with the English language, his boss casually suggested that he procure a dictionary to learn English. This conversation would turn out to be pivotal, and would set V. Krishna on a lifelong journey of language research and scholarship, an amazing case of autodidacticism.</p><p>So, he took his boss’s advice and got himself an English dictionary and started studying it. Then he got himself another dictionary, and another, until he had five of them. At the same time, he took an interest in Kannada literature and started studying Kannada and English together. To help with this, he started jotting down notes, and at some point, began structuring them. A dictionary was being born. In the meanwhile, he took evening classes and obtained a commerce degree in 1976 from MES college, Malleshwaram.</p><p>Around 1980, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada_Sahitya_Parishat">Kannada Sahitya Parishattu</a> published a Kannada - English dictionary, and unsurprisingly, V. Krishna got himself a copy. He was surprised by the sheer number of errors he spotted—more than 200 in the first 50 pages. He wrote to the editor with his findings, and impressed by it, the editor met him in person in Bengaluru, where V. Krishna presented his manuscripts to him. Surprised by its quality, he suggested that V. Krishna continue his work and turn it into a full-fledged dictionary. This was the …</p></div></div>

Ordinarily, that career trajectory change might have been relatively unremarkable; engineers make this leap all the time. But there’s a pandemic going on, and to say that it’s been tough would be an understatement. There have been tears. There have been times when I’ve wanted to chuck my laptop out the window. And there have also been awesome, rewarding moments that have reminded me that if I could go back in time and make the choice again, I’d still go down the same path. But I’ve often joked that I tend to play life on hard mode, and this has <em>certainly</em> been an example of that.</p><p id="fbc4">My job change was both sudden and not: the timing was a surprise, but I probably would have ended up here someday no matter what. However, the pandemic has had a major impact on my understanding of the role, and it’s strange to think that I’ve only <em>ever</em> been a manager during a pandemic. I believe this lends me a unique perspective, which is why I wanted to share my experiences, especially if I can help anyone else currently going through this transition or beginning the move soon.</p><p id="92ae">And part of the point of this article is simply catharsis. I’ve always processed what’s happened to me the best by writing about it, and the ~100-day mark (coinciding with <a rel="noopener" href="https://npr.codes/zen-days-at-npr-5334c205f972">Intersession at NPR</a>, the perfect opportunity for me to take a break from project work for 3 days to write this) seemed like an ideal moment to pause and reflect on the past few months and what I’ve learned.</p><p id="b594">So, strap in and let’s go on a journey together!</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="2eff">Before I begin to summarize my experiences <em>since</em> becoming a manager, I wanted to spend a little more time describing the events and circumstances leading up to my role change, because context is everything; even if you went through the same transition at the same time, many of your experiences are likely different. My subsequent thoughts, struggles, and learnings are a product of my background, values, the organizational context I work within, the people I work closely with, and how the pandemic has affected me personally on top of professionally.</p><p id="5848">By way of background, here is a brief timeline of some of the most significant milestones leading up to my role change:</p><ul><li id="a1da"><strong>March 24, 2014</strong>: I started at NPR as a software engineer</li><li id="d96b"><strong>September 2017</strong>: I became a founding member of and the senior developer on the newly-created Voice &amp; Emerging Platforms team</li><li id="9ceb"><strong>October 2018</strong>: We decided to create a second voice-focused scrum team</li><li id="db76"><strong>May 2019</strong>: The second Voice Platforms team was finally in place, and I began transitioning my role from senior developer to tech lead</li><li id="eb44"><strong>September 16, 2019</strong>: I was officially promoted to lead software engineer</li><li id="55de"><strong>January 29, 2020</strong>: I was asked by our VP of Technology whether I would be interested in becoming the manager for Voice &amp; Emerging Platforms</li><li id="fb49"><strong>February 28, 2020</strong>: My reports’ previous manager left, and I took over as interim/unofficial engineering manager</li><li id="329f"><strong>May 11, 2020</strong>: My role officially changed to engineering manager</li></ul><p id="3a18">When I started at NPR in March of 2014, Digital Media (our department)’s tech team had two managers, one for all software engineers and one for the small handful of sysadmins, though a second developer manager vacancy was filled later that year. By that time, we had ~25 individual contributors on the team, a mix of software engineers, mobile engineers, QA analysts, support analysts, and sysadmins/DevOps engineers. Both developer managers had roughly 10–12 engineers reporting to them. We did only incremental hiring over the next couple of years, until an internal departmental merger in the spring of 2017 led to several new engineers moving into the team, leading to the decision to create two more developer manager roles, the last of which was finally filled in May 2018 (with another external hire — up until then we’d never had someone promoted into management internally). Despite some reshuffling of who reported to who, by that point, we had grown to nearly 50 engineers, and the original manager who had hired me had become a Senior Director with only the other managers reporting directly to him, which meant we once again had anywhere from 10–14 ICs reporting to each manager. Throughout, there were always questions about how technical these managers were expected to be, but it was generally acknowledged that with so many direct reports, it didn’t leave them with enough bandwidth for much more than participation in high-level technical discussions.</p><p id="f00a">At the same time, we always had anywhere from 6 to 12 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)" rel="noopener">scrum</a> teams focused on a specific project or product. In other words, our management structure was entirely divorced from our team assignments. This was generally considered to be a good thing at the time, because many of these project teams were intentionally short-lived, and during my first couple of years at NPR in particular, it was not unusual for someone to change teams every 9 months or so on average. Because of our reporting structure, that meant folks could change teams without needing to change managers, and thus gave us maximum flexibility and made it easier to circulate knowledge and prevent silos. For the longest time, most folks seemed happy with this setup.</p><p id="b79c">But as the tech team grew, the reporting structure made less and less sense, especially as our scrum teams had become more static over time, and our projects grew more complex and began to require a lot more cross-team coordination. The final straw came in the fall of 2019, when one manager suddenly left and another was about to embark on a 3-month sabbatical — leaving our team of ~50 ICs with only two managers for at least the next several months. It was clear that something needed to change both to address the immediate problem now and to prevent us from spreading ourselves too thin like this again in the future.</p><p id="0b1c">Now, I’ll put a pin in that for a bit and circle back to my own personal journey, because it’ll help explain why and how <em>I</em> became a manager. First, it’s important to know that I had already been expecting to go into management eventually — but I thought it was still 5–10 years off. That was a conscious decision, not an assumption about my age or tenure; I knew it was possible to go into management at this stage of my career, but I didn’t think it was the right time for me personally. I was still enjoying my role as an individual contributor, and I’d also observed other managers over the years who had struggled with the transition, often because they were moving into management <em>and</em> starting a family at the same time. Given the stage where I was at in my personal life, I decided I’d rather stay an individual contributor until after I got married and had children, deferring the challenging transition into management until after I’d settled into parenthood.</p><p id="45f7">But I knew that all roads would ultimately lead to management for me, because I knew it aligned with my values. I believe that <em>humans</em> are simultaneously the best and hardest part of software development — not code. And while I recognize that it’s possible to be a very empathetic and human-oriented lead IC, somewhere along the way, I realized that I’m more likely to be able to make the kinds of meaningful changes to make life better for the humans building our software as a manager. I’ve always been instinctively drawn to process improvements so that we don’t just solve a problem once, we prevent it from ever happening again in the future. And in many ways, a manager’s job is to continuously advocate for process changes in order to improve the lives of your team.</p><p id="2214">One memory that stands out dates back to October 2017, when I attended (and spoke at) the <a href="https://ghc.anitab.org/" rel="noopener">Grace Hopper Celebration for Women in Computing</a> for the first time. I attended a session titled “Technical to Manager: Making the Leap or Not”, which was a panel discussion featuring a diversity of experiences: a woman who had deliberately gone into management, a woman who had deliberately stayed an IC, a woman who had gone into management and hated it and went back to being an IC, and a woman who had managed to carve out a fairly unique role where she got to do equal parts of both. At one point, the woman who had deliberately gone into management made a comment that you’ll likely know management is right for you if you find yourself (perhaps subconsciously!) trading your books and blog posts and podcasts about technology for books and blog posts and podcasts about psychology and sociology. I realized already back then that that was me; while I was still doing both, I was getting more value out of reading articles from the Harvard Business Review than I was reading technical blogs.</p><p id="c78b">I still thought the move into management was many years away for me, but I ended up taking (unknowingly at the time) tentative steps toward this journey beginning in October 2018, when, as I alluded to in the timeline above, we decided to create a second voice-focused scrum team. Up until then, the engineering portion of our team had consisted of three developers, of whom I was the most senior. My manager at the time encouraged me to leverage this opportunity to move into a lead software engineer role, because our engineering ladder centered on one of the key requirements for a lead being to lead projects across multiple teams — and the addition of the second Voice team would certainly give me ample opportunity to do that.</p><p id="260d">The new scrum team was in place by May 2019, and I was incredibly proud of the combined unit we built, captured a few months later in this photo (a bit outdated now, as a couple of folks have since moved on to other teams):</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="A group photo of the combined Voice &amp; Emerging Platforms team from October 2019." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/8576/1*eHOmjfxiKM382kxy0flixw.jpeg" width="4288" height="2848" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*eHOmjfxiKM382kxy0flixw.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*eHOmjfxiKM382kxy0flixw.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*eHOmjfxiKM382kxy0flixw.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1456/1*eHOmjfxiKM382kxy0flixw.jpeg 728w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1632/1*eHOmjfxiKM382kxy0flixw.jpeg 816w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1808/1*eHOmjfxiKM382kxy0flixw.jpeg 904w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1984/1*eHOmjfxiKM382kxy0flixw.jpeg 992w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*eHOmjfxiKM382kxy0flixw.jpeg 1000w" sizes="1000px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*eHOmjfxiKM382kxy0flixw.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>From top left: Kaivon Jones (developer), Greg Sauer (QA), Vince Farquharson (designer), Nara Kasbergen (tech lead).

                <p>Should you need to get familiar with <a href="https://turkogluc.com/apache-kafka-connect-introduction/">Kafka Connect Basics</a> or <a href="https://turkogluc.com/kafka-connect-jdbc-source-connector/">Kafka JDBC Connector</a><strong> </strong>check out the previous post. This post focuses on PostgreSQL backup-replication mechanism and streaming data from database to Kafka with using Debezium connector.</p><p>There are basically 3 major methods to perform backups or replication in PostgreSQL:</p><ul><li>Logical dumps (Extracting SQL script that represents the data, for example with using <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/app-pgdump.html">pg_dump</a>)</li><li>Transactional Log Shipping (Using Write-Ahead Log)</li><li>Logical Decoding</li></ul><p>The first method is relatively harder to maintain and creates more load on the database. <code>Log shipping</code> and <code>Logical Decoding</code> is low level solutions that make use of transaction logs and have the major advantage of efficiency.</p><h2 id="understanding-the-transactional-log">Understanding the Transactional Log</h2><p>Transactional Log is the essential part of the modern relational database systems. It is basically <strong>history log of all actions and changes</strong> applied on the database. The database stores the data eventually in the filesystem, however this I/O operation is relatively costly and if any failure interrupts the writing process the file becomes inconsistent and it would not be easy to recover. </p><p>Therefore database writes the data to a log which is called <strong>Write-Ahead Log</strong> (WAL) directly and transaction is completed. When the data is logged in the WAL, it is considered to be successfully stored even though it is not written to file system yet. So even if system crashes or some failure arises, it will be read from the log when system restarts. </p><p>A process constantly reads the WAL, sets a <code>checkpoint</code> as point in time and writes the changes appended since the last checkpoint time to the actual database file system (every 5 mins by default). As the disk space is limited, the WAL files that are already processed are either archived or recycled (old ones are removed) in order to clean up disk space.</p><p>Each transaction log is divided into 16 MB file that is called <strong>WAL segment</strong> that consist of <strong>records</strong>. Each record has an identifier named <strong>Log Sequence Number</strong> (LSN) that shows the physical location of the record. Processing the transactions and checkpointing could be demonstrated as follows:</p><figure><img src="https://turkogluc.com/content/images/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-27-at-01.51.59.png"></figure><h2 id="it-s-all-about-wal-">It's All About WAL!</h2><p>The WAL has important role in replication as it contains the details about transactions, and these records are very important and useful in terms of representing the database state. Note that the WAL segments are not stored forever, once it is consumed it is removed from the disk. So one way to backup locally is copying segment files to a different directory (default dir: <code>pg_wal</code>). Sharing these records with remote servers gives the opportunity to create replicas efficiently.</p><h3 id="transactional-log-shipping">Transactional Log Shipping</h3><p>It is a solution to replicate the database in different servers by shipping the WAL segments. Replica server operates on recovery mode all the time and replays the WAL records that it receives to be consistent with primary server. This solution could be implemented by sending the complete 16MB WAL segments files or streaming individual records as they are written. Streaming is a better solution in terms of durability. See the details of psychical replication implementation details: <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/warm-standby.html">Log Shipping</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://turkogluc.com/content/images/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-27-at-10.36.31.png"></figure><p>In Log Shipping method the segment files which contains binary data copied physically (byte-by-byte) to another server. So it can be also called <strong>physical replication</strong>. This approach has some limitations and drawbacks as it is not possible to replicate between different versions of Postgres or different operating systems, and also it can not replicate part of a database. Logical replication is introduced to address these limitations.</p><h3 id="logical-replication">Logical Replication</h3><p>Logical replication is a method that decodes the binary WAL records into a more understandable format and sends this decoded data to remote server. It uses <code>publish</code> and <code>subscribe</code> model with one or more subscribers receiving data from publishers. In contrast to physical replication, there is no Primary and Standby servers but data can flow both sides, but from publishers to subscribers. Publisher creates a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/sql-createpublication.html"><code>PUBLICATION</code></a>:</p><pre><code>CREATE PUBLICATION mypublication FOR TABLE users, departments;
CREATE PUBLICATION alltables FOR ALL TABLES;</code></pre><p>And Subscribers creates <code><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/sql-createsubscription.html">SUBSCRIPTION</a></code>:</p><pre><code>CREATE SUBSCRIPTION mysubcribtion
         CONNECTION 'host=localhost port=5432 user=foo dbname=foodb'
        PUBLICATION mypublication, alltables;</code></pre><p>The changes send by publisher are replicated in the subscriber database to ensure that the two databases remain in sync. It is important to remember that after some time WAL segments are deleted. So if a subscriber stops for some and the the WAL record is deleted in the publisher it causes a FATAL error. </p><p><strong><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/logicaldecoding-explanation.html">Replication slots</a></strong> solves this problem for us. By assigning a subscriber to a replication slot we can guarantee that the WAL records that it related with the subscription are not going to be removed until the subscriber consumes them. <code>CREATE SUBSCRIPTION</code> command automatically generates a replication slot in the publisher side for us so we do not need to create it manually.</p><figure><img src="https://turkogluc.com/content/images/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-27-at-12.14.55.png"></figure><p>Now having the necessary knowledge of PostgreSQL replication concepts we can proceed to configure and manage the Debezium Connector.</p><h2 id="debezium-connector">Debezium Connector</h2><p>Debezium is an open source <strong>Change Data Capture</strong> platform that turns the existing database into event streams. Debezium Kafka Connector captures each row level change in the database and sends them to Kafka topics.</p><figure><img src="https://turkogluc.com/content/images/2020/09/debezium-architecture.png"></figure><p>Debezium uses the <code>logical replication</code> feature of PostgreSQL in order to capture the transaction records from the WAL. The connector acts the subscriber role for the changes published from tables. It handles all the low level configuration for us, as creating publisher, subscribers replication slots etc.</p><p>In order to use the connector we need an <code>output plugin</code> installed in the PostgreSQL server so that it can decode the WAL records. Debezium connector supports number of output plugins:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/debezium/postgres-decoderbufs"><code>decoderbufs</code></a>: based on Protobuf and maintened by Debezium Community</li><li><a href="https://github.com/eulerto/wal2json/blob/master/README.md"><code>wal2json</code></a>: based on JSON</li><li><code>pgoutput</code>: is the standard logical decoding output plug-in in PostgreSQL, also supported by Debezium Community.</li></ul><p>I personally recommend using <code>pgoutput</code> as it is the native plugin and it does not require any additional installation. If you would like to use another plugin you need to install it in the database server. See the <a href="https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/1.2/postgres-plugins.html">documentation</a> for installing plugins. We can setup the all architecture with the following steps</p><h3 id="1-running-kafka-cluster">1-Running Kafka Cluster</h3><p>We can use the following docker-compose file to get Kafka cluster with a single broker up and running.</p><pre><code>version: '2'

<p>Can you imagine disowning your parents because you think you can do better?</p>



<p>What about disowning your kids because you just weren’t compatible, or right for each other? After all, our relationships with our family are such an essential component of our lives. Doesn’t it make sense to carefully pick &amp; choose exactly the right parent, child &amp; sibling who fit what we’re looking for? Why should we simply sit back &amp; accept things the way nature’s lottery handed it out?</p>



<p>If this idea strikes you as insane, repulsive and idiotic, you’re not alone. I agree with you wholeheartedly. We may be able to pick &amp; choose our friends, but they rarely ever become as close to us as our family does. People consistently rate their family members as the most treasured people in their lives, much more so than their friends. In study after study, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19910646" target="_blank" rel="noopener">family ties are consistently shown to be deeper, stronger &amp; more valuable</a> than friendships.</p>



<p>But you don’t need studies to tell you that. We all know it in our hearts. We all know the feeling of intimacy and love that we feel for our family. Exasperating and maddening but love nonetheless. We know that when the time comes, we are perfectly willing to take a bullet for our families. How many of us can honestly say the same about our friends. We’ve all heard of politicians &amp; business executives who stepped down so they can spend more time with their families. Where are all the politicians who resigned so they can hang out with their friends?</p>



<p>This all feels perfectly natural, but why is it so? How is it that parents &amp; children, complete strangers whom nature threw together, can develop such a close bond that even our closest friends in the world cannot achieve?</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>We don’t love</strong> our family because they are charming, beautiful, intelligent or witty. We don’t love them because they are fun to be around, or because they make us happy. All those things are bonuses, but never the cause.</p>



<p>We love them because of the shared experiences that we’ve gone through together. We love and accept them simply for who they are.</p>



<p>We never ask whether we can do better. We never ask whether we should look for someone else with better “compatibility”. We never entertain the thought of leaving them if they don’t make us happy or live up to our disney fairytale of what a family should be like. We don’t stop talking to each other simply because we have nothing in common to talk about, nor do we stop seeing each other just because we moved somewhere else. We simply accept each other for who we are, love each other regardless, and find a way to maintain that bond.</p>



<p>If all this sounds obvious, let me get to the point: <em>Why don’t we practice this same unconditional love &amp; acceptance with the most important person in our family: our spouse?</em></p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Over the past century</strong>, our society has grown &amp; improved in almost every regard but one. Marital success. We spend more and more time <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/marriage/data/acs/ElliottetalPAA2012figs.pdf">putting off marriage</a> until everything is perfect. We <a href="http://www.sagepub.com/edwards/study/materials/reference/77592_2.1ref.pdf">date more and more</a>, in the hopes of finally meeting that one special person. We extend our courtship period to multiple years, so that we can know each other inside and out before finally making that commitment.</p>



<p>And yet, despite all this, our divorce rates are higher than they have ever been. <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr049.pdf">One in two marriages</a> conducted in America today eventually end in divorce; <a href="http://divorce.lovetoknow.com/Historical_Divorce_Rate_Statistics">twice the rate that it used to be</a> in the 1950s. Marital studies show that even among the fewer couples who actually stay together, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/15/opinion/sunday/the-all-or-nothing-marriage.html">the average married couple today is less satisfied</a> than the average married couple from decades past. If we’re more careful than ever before when it comes to marriage, why is the institution of marriage still crumbling all around us?</p>



<p>The answer that I’m going to put forth: <em>Unconditional acceptance</em>. Or rather, the lack of it.</p>



<p>In the old days, it used to be that spouses viewed each other the same way we view our parents or children. Life partners whom we love &amp; accept, for better or worse, till death do us part. But at some point in the past few decades, that changed. We no longer simply accepted our spouses for who they were. We expected great things from them. We expected them to be our soulmates. We expected them to set our hearts on fire. We expected them to make us feel like teenagers swooning over our first crush. We expected them to give us a fairy tale marriage, complete with tiaras &amp; glass slippers. And when that doesn’t happen… when things get mundane or problematic… when life becomes life… we decide to go our separate ways &amp; find that one magical person who can make everything sparkle once again.</p>



<p>To put it in a nutshell, we stopped treating our spouses as family and started treating them as friends. And the results speak for themselves. Soaring divorce rates. Falling marital satisfaction. The new normal of <a href="http://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/107-children-in-single-parent-families-by#detailed/1/any/false/868,867,133,38,35/10,168,9,12,1,13,185/432,431">single parent households</a>. Whatever it is we’ve started doing, it is simply not working. And yet, we keep coming back for more.</p>



<p>I can certainly sympathize that some marriages are indeed toxic, and it’s good that our society offers those people a way out. Infidelity, abuse &amp; battery are unacceptable, and <em>no one</em> should have to live with that.</p>



<p>And yet, there has to be so much more that can be done. There are children who are taken away from their abusive parents for their own safety, and there are certainly adults who cut off contact with their parents due to deep childhood scars. However, these exceptions remain simply that: exceptions that arise only in extreme cases. <em>Exceptions that prove the rule</em>.</p>



<p>For the most part, we accept our parents, children and siblings without question. We spend the first 2 decades of our lives living with strangers whose home we happened to be born into, and the next 2 decades of our lives living with other strangers who happened to be born into our home. And these strangers end up forming the bedrock of our lives. Our most treasured relationships. The people we would fight and die for, however flawed and imperfect they may be.</p>



<p>Perhaps it’s time we extended this same love to our significant others. For better or for worse. Till death do us part.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Dunlop CryBaby is a timeless effect pedal. Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, David Gilmour, and a host of other rock musicians began popularizing the wah effect in the mid 60s, and just about every rock guitarist onwards has toyed with them at one point or another. Seems like a natural choice to look at next using LTSpice.</p><p>If you’d like to follow along at home, <a href="https://github.com/Cushychicken/ltspice-guitar-pedals/tree/master/dunlop-crybaby-wah">I’ve put the LTSpice file up on GitHub for your persual</a>. Find mistakes? Want to submit mods? Feel free to submit a pull request.</p><p>This is the first design I’ve analyzed with no opamps. Cool! Light on active components, but heavy on fun circuit tricks.</p><p>The bulk of the excitement in the Dunlop CryBaby is in the Active Filter + Output section, but we’ll take a look at the Input and Feedback Follower segments as well. (Power is very simple - a few bulk caps, and a Zener for reverse voltage clamping in the event that the battery accidentally gets wired backwards. Doesn’t meaningfully affect any of the audio stuff we’re discussing.)</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1600979249553.png" alt="Dunlop Crybaby - Whole Schematic"></p><p>This isn’t anything special - just a high impedance BJT follower. This forms a nice, cheap buffer to redrive the input signal into the downstream components.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/2020-09-25-ltspice-dunlop-crybaby/Image-1600979302189.png" alt="Input Buffer"></p><p>Q1 is actually strongly biased. Based on my limited research, this is pretty rare in guitar pedals. Lotsa vendors out there who want to save a few fractions of a cent on a resistor, apparently. That, and the fact that audio electronics is a pretty small community. Lots of designers bouncing from one company to the next, and a reasonable amount of ripping off of other companies’ designs.</p><p>At the end of the day, though, lousy biasing isn’t that big of a deal. This is just audio. It’s not medical equipment, or critical infrastructure. Worst case, the biasing sucks, and someone’s pedal dies.</p><p>Q2 is a standard common-emitter amp. It also provides the bias for Q3, the downstream feedback amplifier, via R11.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1600979345975.png" alt="Active Filter + Output Stage"></p><p>L1 and C11 form a resonant tank. This LC tank circuit accentuates different frequencies based on the setting of the potentiometer (R14 + R12), which alters the feedback into the tank. (More on the Q3 feedback circuit in a minute.)</p><p>This affects the damping, and also the resonant frequency, of the resonant tank. It’s easiest to see in the time domain; a simple step response shows that for Rtone = 100 ohms, you get a mildly underdamped circuit with a resonance at ~2.1kHz.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1600979387157.png" alt="Step Response: Rtone=100 ohm"></p><p>Crank Rtone up to 100kOhm (i.e. short the feedback path to the output), and you get a wildly underdamped circuit with a resonance at ~430Hz.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1600979449819.png" alt="Step Response: Rtone=100k"></p><p>The feedback follower is really just another emitter follower, like the input stage. Unlike the input stage, it’s got a potentiometer serving as a variable attenuator at the input.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1600979641895.png" alt="Feedback Follower"></p><p>Rtone is really controlling two things:</p><ul><li>how much current is fed back into the LC tank in the active filter stage, and</li><li>which frequencies are fed back into the LC stage.</li></ul><p>Rtone and C8 form a very simple RC filter which determines which range of frequencies get fed back. When the potentiometer is at 100k, Vfb_in shorts to Vout, and you’re feeding the unattenuated signal back into the LC tank, with no meaningful guitar frequencies suppressed: \[R12||C8 = (100k\Omega) || (0.22uF) = 7.2[Hz]\]</p><p>Conversely, when the potentiometer starts to short Vfb_in to GND, you’re not feeding anything back into the tank. The RC passband moves down, with most current getting shunted to ground instead of thru C8: \[R12||C8 = (100 \Omega) || (0.22uF) = 7200[Hz]\]</p><p>You can see this as you plot Vfb_in against Vout for a sweep of Rtone values across frequencies:</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/image-20200925141159987.png" alt="Vbn_in magnitude decreases as Rtone shorts to GND"></p><p>Without the feedback component, Q2 is basically just an active highpass filter. The feedback element formed by Rtone, C8, and Q3 is a variable lowpass filter. Adding feedback mixes this lowpass element with the highpass filter, forming an <em>active bandpass filter</em>.</p><p>The net effect of this a nice moving central peak in the magnitude response of the Wah pedal, allowing you to accentuate any signals within the 500Hz to 2kHz band:</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1601057975751.png" alt="Tone Setting vs Frequency"></p><p>Plotting phase with this many sweep components is a bit of an eye exam, but it reveals a pretty useful corollary to understanding the Wah at a conceptual level:</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1601058017485.png" alt="Tone Setting vs Frequency, with Phase"></p><p>Note that the peak of each output magnitude in the plot aligns nicely with the 180deg phase delta of the input. That’s not an accident - in fact, that’s the crux of what this pedal is doing. The feedback stage is a simple emitter follower. An emitter follower inverts whatever signal it is fed, leaving you with a signal shifted 180 degrees at the output. That shifted signal, in this case, is fed back into the input, through the resonant tank. If you’ve done any oscillator design, this 180 degree criterion will sound familiar:</p><ul><li>take a high gain amplifier,</li><li>offset its output 180 degrees from the input,</li><li>and feed the output back into the input,</li></ul><p>…and you have an oscillator! That’s the same idea behind the CryBaby. It’s basically a crude voltage tuned oscillator, but without the near-infinite gain. You’re effectively selecting the oscillator tuning frequency by controlling how much current is fed back into the LC tank.</p><p>ElectroSmash, of course, is an excellent reference on all things guitar pedal, and <a href="https://www.electrosmash.com/crybaby-gcb-95">their wah analysis is no exception</a>.</p><p>The timeless R.G. Keen also has <a href="http://www.geofex.com/article_folders/wahpedl/wahped.htm#whatwah">a wondrous overview of wah pedals</a>, consisting of both circuit and qualitative analysis.</p></div></div>]]>

September 27, 2020 | https://blog.carlmjohnson.net/post/2020/web-components/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.carlmjohnson.net/post/2020/web-components/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><blockquote><p>The promise of Web Components was that we’d get this convenience, but for a much wider range of HTML elements, developed much faster, as nobody needs to wait for the full spec + implementation process. We’d just include a script, and boom, we have more elements at our disposal!</p><p>Or, that was the idea. Somewhere along the way, the space got flooded by JS frameworks aficionados, who revel in complex APIs, overengineered build processes and dependency graphs that look like the roots of a banyan tree.</p></blockquote><p>I think the issue is deeper than Verou’s complaints, although those are valid. Web Components don’t actually to solve the problem they purport to solve. The pitch is “get <strong>semantic elements</strong> from <strong>across the web</strong><i>!</i>” But those are <strong>wrong problems</strong> to try to solve.</p><hr><p>First of all, if search engines and screen readers don’t know about <code>&lt;my-tag&gt;</code>, it’s <strong>not semantic</strong> in any meaningful sense. There is already a very good way to provide semantic information to search engines: use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-LD">JSON-LD</a> to provide <a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a> metadata. For accessibility, you need to either use the correct HTML5 element or use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/An_overview_of_accessible_web_applications_and_widgets">ARIA attributes</a>, and this process is going to be the same whether you’re using Web Components or something else.</p><p>So next, <strong>“from across the web”</strong> is a performance killer. No matter how good networks and browsers get in the foreseeable future, you’re not going to be able to build a content page from multiple domains in under a second just due to the latencies involved in connecting, and that’s the performance goal content sites should be meeting. You need to at minimum host the scripts on your site. Once you’re doing that, the temptation to just go ahead and bundle them is pretty strong. Yes, HTTP2 makes the price of having several small modules much lower, but it’s hard to argue against minifying, concatenating, and tree shaking to pick up any remaining performance benefits. Now you’ve landed into the mess that it is modern JS bundling, for better or worse. Remember that best case here is that you end up at the fourth phase of <a href="https://twitter.com/carlmjohnson/status/982747054614220800">the dialectic of dependencies</a>: being overrun by low quality user written components.</p><hr><p>Okay, so what about the JavaScript for Web Components themselves. They have this system in which you subclass <code>HTMLElement</code> and register the class as custom element with <code>customElements.define()</code>. What does this buy you over and above just using <code>document.querySelectorAll("[data-my-element]")</code>? Not a lot. It gets you a system of lifecycle hooks. Cool, I guess, but it doesn’t actually have any tools to manage your <em>data</em> lifecycle, so it’s not actually very useful. If you store your data in the DOM, it just becomes a bunch of strings on elements, and this stinks because most of you data is boolean (Is the widget open or closed? Am I waiting on a fetch to finish?) and has to be mutilated to fit into string (<code>el.attr === "true"</code> makes Alan Turing’s ghost cry). And forget about compound types like arrays and maps. The only practical solution there is to serialize the data to JSON and store that on the element, which is crazy. So, you can use the Web Component custom element lifecycle to manage <em>element</em> creation and deletion, but you need to have some other system for rationalizing the data lifecycle if your component is more complex than a <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> box.</p><p>Web Components are also associated with <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> elements, but this is a substitute templating language, and it stinks. There are three competing schools of templating, each with its own niche. There are old school <a href="https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html">Mustache</a>/<a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a>/<a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid</a>/<a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/">Jinja</a>-style templates where the HTML is treated as raw text but with auto-escaping and some looping constructs. There are <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_02">Angular</a>/<a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/">Vue</a>/<a href="https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine">Alpine</a>-style templates which treat HTML as a first class concept, and there are attributes for interpolation and looping. And there is <a href="https://crank.js.org/">JSX</a>, which sort of combines the two, allowing for intermingling of regular JavaScript and pseudo-XML. <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>/<code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> is pretty much unusable because it doesn’t actually address the hard parts of templating, which are interpolating and looping. Again, it’s not buying you much versus just writing a <a href="https://gist.github.com/carlmjohnson/45c0b8394f28b2ee3662edfeb80d29ee">quickie <code>document.createElement</code> helper function</a>.</p><p>So what’s left is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM">Shadow DOM</a>. Shadow DOM is a feature for when you need to include an element on a page that breaks out of the styles of its parents. That <em>is</em> sometimes useful. But it is also extremely niche and should be part of CSS and not part of JS. The fundamental thing that Shadow DOM does is to allow an element of the page to have its own CSS reset. There’s no reason we couldn’t have that as part of CSS itself instead (perhaps by changing the rules for <code>@import</code> to allow it to be nested instead of only at the top level).</p><hr><p>I am a person who is in the market for the sort of thing that Web Components are supposedly good at. For <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/">my day job</a>, I distribute embed codes so that our partners can embed little widgets that let you sign up for <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters/">the Spotlight PA newsletter</a> from their sites. It’s supposed to be the clear use case. But even if I were willing to sacrifice IE11 compatibility (not a big deal but I prefer not to do so gratuitously), I don’t see why I should prefer that my embed code look like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;</span><span>script</span> <span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"https://example.com/embed.js"</span> <span>async</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>spl-embed</span> <span>version</span><span>=</span><span>"1"</span> <span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/newsletter/"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Instead of what it actually looks like, which is this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;</span><span>script</span> <span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js"</span> <span>async</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>div</span>
  <span>data-spl-embed-version</span><span>=</span><span>"1"</span>
  <span>data-spl-src</span><span>=</span><span>"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/newsletter/"</span>
<span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Yes, shorter tags would be nicer, but how does it actually benefit performance, search engines, or accessibility?</p><p>As it turns out, I <em>do</em> use Shadow DOM, but just to reset the CSS around my iframe to make sure it is responsively sized.</p><p>If I could get the ear of W3C, I would ask them to create a way for iframes to be properly sized without requiring JavaScript to communicate the size from within the iframe to the host page. That’s something that would actually make my life easier, unlike Web Components, which are basically just failed solutions to the wrong problems.</p></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">




<p>Real world data analysis projects are often quite complicated.
They can involve multi-gigabyte input files, complex data cleaning procedures, week-long computations, and elaborate reports.
Making changes and then tracking down the parts that need to be recomputed becomes close to impossible.
In this article I describe my approach for dealing with this problem, which is based on a lesser known build automation tool - redo<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote"><sup>◦</sup></a>.</p>

<h2 id="redo">Redo</h2>

<p>Data science projects typically have complex pipelines involving input files, code, results, and reports.
Analyses can be computationally intensive and take hours if not days or weeks to complete.
Hence data science practitioners need to be able to make changes without restarting the whole pipeline from scratch.
Workflow management becomes essential and many projects turn to build automation tools like Make<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote"><sup>◦</sup></a>.
However Make has its warts, in particular when applied to data analysis, and so people end up designing their own variants, such as SCons<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote"><sup>◦</sup></a>, Snakemake<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote"><sup>◦</sup></a>, and Drake<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote"><sup>◦</sup></a>, among others.</p>

<p>One lesser known alternative to the above mentioned tools goes by the name of “redo”.
Redo is a recursive build automation system that promises to be simpler and more powerful than Make.
Unlike Make or its derivatives redo is tiny, recursive, and has no special syntax of its own.
It allows us to declare target dependencies straight from within the code being executed, which enables writing scripts that “know” they will need to rerun themselves whenever their input data changes all without maintaining a separate dependency configuration file.
In this demonstration we will be using the redo version by “apenwarr”<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote"><sup>◦</sup></a> who rediscovered, documented, and popularized the idea and is the author and current maintainer of its most comprehensive implementation<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote"><sup>◦</sup></a>.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>A typical data analysis workflow has four parts: 1) obtaining the data; 2) cleaning the data; 3) estimating a model; 4) producing a report.
Similarly our dummy project will consist of four steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Obtain a dataset of chicken weights and their feed supplements.</li>
<li>Subset the data by only selecting one type of feed supplement.</li>
<li>Produce a “model” for the selected supplement using empirical density estimation.</li>
<li>Summarise the obtained results in a report.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each step will produce an output and save the results to a separate file.
To keep things simple all the scripts for the steps above will be written in R.
The overall goal is to construct a pipeline that can detect changes in our stored data files or our code and automatically reproduce the final report with all its dependencies.
This demonstration will start simple and add complexity along the way.</p>

<h2 id="doingandredoing">Doing and redoing</h2>

<p>Let’s start with the most basic redo command.
In the first step we have to obtain a dataset of chicken weights plus the type of supplements they were fed and store it in a file.
The dataset is already freely available from within R so all we have to do is save it.
We enter the commands to do the task in a file named <code>'rawdata.rds.do'</code>:</p>

<pre><code>1.  #!/usr/bin/env Rscript
2.
3.  outfile &lt;- commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE)[3]
4.
5.  saveRDS(chickwts, file = outfile)
</code></pre>

<p>Then to obtain the data file we go to a command line and call redo:</p>

<pre><code>$ redo rawdata.rds

redo:  rawdata.rds
</code></pre>

<p>Which creates the <code>'rds'</code> file named <code>'rawdata.rds'</code> containing the data and informs us about the result.</p>

<p>Some explanation is necessary.
The redo command simply takes an argument and tries to produce a file of the same name.
In this case the argument was <code>'rawdata.rds'</code> and, given the command, redo starts looking for instructions about how to produce it.
The rule for storing instructions is quite simple - they are stored in a separate file with a name constructed by adding a <code>'.do'</code> suffix to the original argument.
In other words - redo looks for instructions about producing <code>'rawdata.rds'</code> file in a file named <code>'rawdata.rds.do'</code>.</p>

<p>The file itself is treated as a shell script.
This is why it is started with a hash-bang<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote"><sup>◦</sup></a> sequence followed by a path to a program that will be used to interpret the instructions.
We want to write our script in R so we specify Rscript.</p>

<p>Finally, when redo calls our script with <code>'redo rawdata.rds.do'</code> it passes three arguments to it:
1) The target name itself - <code>'rawdata.rds'</code>, 2) The basename of the target file - <code>'rawdata'</code>, 3) The temporary file to save the data in - <code>'rawdata.rds.redo.tmp'</code>.
After the execution finishes the file stored in the temp file (3rd argument) will be moved to the target (1st argument).
This mechanism makes sure that in the case of failed computation the existing target will not be corrupted.
And that is why we do not specify the output filename within the script ourselves but rather use the 3rd variable provided by redo.</p>

<p>The dataset is obtained and stored and so the first step of this project is now complete.</p>

<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>

<p>What happens if we execute the previous redo command again? - nothing spectacular:</p>

<pre><code>$ redo rawdata.rds

redo  rawdata.rds
</code></pre>

<p>Redo executed the instruction file again and reproduced the output.
But there exists another command called <code>redo-ifchange</code> that behaves a bit differently:</p>

<pre><code>$ redo-ifchange rawdata.rds
</code></pre>

<p>After calling this command - nothing happens.
<code>redo-ifchange</code> differs from redo in an important way: it checks if any dependencies needed to reproduce the specified output have changed.
In our case redo knows only a single dependency for our <code>'rawdata.rds'</code> file - the ‘do’ instruction file itself.
It hasn’t changed so <code>redo-ifchange</code> halts and does not reproduce the target.</p>

<p>So let’s move on to the second step of the project and select a feed type.
To achieve this we produce a separate R file called <code>'subdata.rds.do'</code>:</p>

<pre><code>1.   #!/usr/bin/env Rscript
2.
3.   outfile &lt;- commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE)[3]
4.
5.   system("redo-ifchange rawdata.rds")
6.   rawdata &lt;- readRDS("rawdata.rds")
7.
8.   subdata &lt;- rawdata[rawdata$feed == "soybean", ]
9.
10.  saveRDS(subdata, file = outfile)
</code></pre>

<p>Take a closer look at the 5th line in the file above.
Here, before loading the data, we call the <code>redo-ifchange</code> command on it.
At this step the script temporarily halts and checks if our requested data file, <code>rawdata.rds</code>, needs to be recomputed.
If the target file is missing or some of its dependencies have changed it will be regenerated by calling the <code>'rawdata.rds.do'</code> script.
And if nothing changed the 5th line passes without redoing anything and the already existing data file is used.</p>

<p>Now, to obtain the output for the second step, we request the file with redo, just like before:</p>

<pre><code>$ redo subdata.rds

redo subdata.rds
</code></pre>

<p>All done, the result is stored in <code>'subdata.rds'</code>.
Currently we have the following files in our project:</p>

<pre><code>$ tree
.
├── rawdata.rds
├── rawdata.rds.do
├── subdata.rds
└── subdata.rds.do
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s remove all the <code>'rds'</code> data files and try reproducing the <code>'subdata.rds'</code> again:</p>

<pre><code>$ rm *.rds
$ redo subdata.rds

redo  subdata.rds
redo    rawdata.rds
</code></pre>

<p>Here we asked for <code>'subdata.rds'</code> but redo was smart enough to reproduce both of the data files.
What we did, in essence, is declared a dependency between two R scripts from within the script itself.</p>

<h2 id="defaultinstructions">Default instructions</h2>

<p>Before moving on we have to spend some time on a few redo implementation details.
By convention when we call <code>'redo a.b.rds'</code> command redo starts looking for an <code>'a.b.rds.do'</code> script.
But if the file doesn’t exist redo will search for a different file named <code>'default.b.rds.do'</code> which should store general instructions for producing any <code>'*.b.rds'</code> file.
As an example we rename our previous <code>'subdata.rds.do'</code> file to <code>'default.subdata.rds.do'</code>.
Now this do script will get executed whenever we use redo to request a file that ends with <code>'subdata.rds.do'</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ mv subdata.rds.do default.subdata.rds.do
$ redo a.subdata.rds b.subdata.rds

redo a.subdata.rds
redo b.subdata.rds
</code></pre>

<p>Since both files generated above were produced by the same script <code>'default.subdata.rds.do'</code> they are identical - they both hold the data for soybean feed.
Those files will no longer be needed for our demonstration so we can get rid of them:</p>

<pre><code>$ rm *subdata.rds
$ tree
.
├── default.subdata.rds.do
├── rawdata.rds
└── rawdata.rds.do
</code></pre>

<h2 id="parameters">Parameters</h2>

<p>The default instructions introduced above can be exploited to implement parameters in our do scripts.
In the current stage we have a script - <code>'default.subdata.rds.do'</code> that is executed whenever we request an ‘rds’ file that ends with <code>'subdata.rds'</code>.
It always produces the data for the soybean feed but we can make it return different outputs based on the prefix of the target file.</p>

<p>Currently the feed types we are selecting are hard-coded in the code itself.
It would be nicer if we can specify them as parameters passed to the R script.
We rewrite <code>'default.subdata.rds.do'</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>1.   #!/usr/bin/env Rscript
2.
3.   outfile &lt;- commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE)[3]
4.   feed    &lt;- strsplit(outfile, "\\.")[[1]][1]
5.
6.   system("redo-ifchange rawdata.rds")
7.   rawdata &lt;- readRDS("rawdata.rds")
8.
9.   subdata &lt;- rawdata[rawdata$feed == feed, ]
10.
11.  saveRDS(subdata, file = outfile)
</code></pre>

<p>Two changes were made:
1) the 4th line uses the prefix of the output file in order to decide which feed type should be returned;
2) the 9th line then uses the selected feed type in order to subset the data.
This allows us to request various types of feed data:</p>

<pre><code>$ redo soybean.subdata.rds

redo soybean.subdata.rds

$ redo casein.subdata.rds

redo casein.subdata.rds
</code></pre>

<p>And now we have separate types in separate files.</p>

<h2 id="redoingwithparameters">Redoing with parameters</h2>

<p>In the third step we need a do script that, given subsetted feed data, estimates the density function and stores the result to a separate file.
Like the previous script, we want it to be general and produce the results for any selected feed type.
For this to work we have to know which input file to load based on the given output file.
If the script will be called by <code>'redo soybeen.density.rds'</code> command our target will be <code>'soybean.density.rds'</code>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article id="post-149171"><div><div><div><div><div><p>Not only the editors and testers were surprised by sudden instabilities of the new GeForce RTX 3080 and RTX 3090, but also the first customers who were able to get board partner cards from the first wave. An interesting pattern of behavior emerged that did not affect all cards or manufacturers and the problems only occurred at certain boost clock rates above or just around 2 GHz. To make matters worse, NVIDIA has obviously also slightly undermined the quality management of the board partners (AIC) due to the secrecy – unconsciously, of course, but with plausible consequences. A chain of adverse circumstances? This could well be the case, because this explains the somewhat diffuse error pattern from the most diverse forums.</p><h3><span><strong>Start of production without real function control?</strong></span></h3><p>Let’s start with the latter, before I get lost in the technical analyses. You probably remember when I wrote that the board partners couldn’t use working drivers yet and only work with a very limited driver and NVPunish. Since the driver problem lasted until shortly before the launch, but the first wave of cards had to be produced already, the functional testing of the first models was obviously limited to power-on and thermal stability. Running, not running. However, this does not say much about the chip quality and the possible maximum frequencies that the respective chip can safely handle.</p><p>Thus, it would at least be plausible that cards could have been sold as OC cards, which wouldn’t have passed a real quality test at the manufacturer with the delivered settings. Real binning? Nothing. Subsequent selection of particularly overclocked cards? Impossible, in fact. And so it is by no means impossible that one or the other “Potato” chip could also have gotten lost on such an OC card. We know the consequences from the posts of the buyers in the relevant forums.</p><h3><span><strong>Wrong component selection? Plausible!</strong></span></h3><p>Now let’s come to the fact that even good chips have dropped out now and then. That they are good, you can see for yourself e.g. by the boost cycle and the temperatures. So it is quite easy to find out with a selected card. This brings us now to a point that I was actually very unconsciously haunting the back of my mind at first, and which then solidified into a realization when comparing the boards of different models So let’s go directly to the “reference board” PG132, which can also be understood as a so-called Base Design. Especially the backside and especially the area below the BGA is interesting. What is interesting about such drawings and the so-called BoM (Bill of Materials) is that you are offered different placement alternatives.</p><p><a href="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Bottom-POSCAP-vs-MLCC.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Bottom-POSCAP-vs-MLCC.jpg" alt="" width="980" height="765" srcset="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Bottom-POSCAP-vs-MLCC.jpg 980w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Bottom-POSCAP-vs-MLCC-300x234.jpg 300w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Bottom-POSCAP-vs-MLCC-768x600.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px"></a></p><p>I will (have to) simplify the following for better understanding. Below the BGA we see the six NECESSARY capacitors for filtering high frequencies on the voltage rails, i.e. NVVDD and MSVDD. Apart from the fact that there is still enough high-frequency “garbage” from the voltage converters, it is mainly the so-called GPU load including all jumps caused by boost, which leads to very broadband frequency mixtures, which become more extreme the higher the boost clock goes. The BoM and the drawing from June leave it open whether large-area POSCAPs (Conductive Polymer Tantalum Solid Capacitors) are used (marked in red), or rather the somewhat more expensive MLCCs (Multilayer Ceramic Chip Capacitor). The latter are smaller and have to be grouped for a higher capacity.</p><p>According to the list and specifications of Nvidia, both are possible. In terms of quality, however, good MLCCs are better able to filter the very high frequency components in particular. In the end, this is simple practical knowledge, which only often enough collides with the world view of a financial controller.&nbsp; If one searches the forums, it seems that the Zotac Trinity is particularly affected when it comes to instabilities starting at certain boost clock rates from around 2010 MHz. A feat, because Zotac is relying on a total of six cheaper POSCAPs.</p><p><a href="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Zotac-Trinity.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Zotac-Trinity.jpg" alt="" width="980" height="390" srcset="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Zotac-Trinity.jpg 980w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Zotac-Trinity-300x119.jpg 300w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Zotac-Trinity-768x306.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px"></a></p><p>And what does NVIDIA do with its own Founders Editions? One does it obviously better, because I could not reproduce these stability problems with any FE even very clearly beyond 2 GHz (fan to 100%). If something went wrong, it was almost certainly a driver problem. If we take a look at the FE, we see only four SP-CAPs (red) and in the middle two MLCC groups of 10 individual capacitors each (green). This is definitely the better solution and the optimal compromise. because especially the middle areas should best be provided with suitable filters (short circuit of the high-frequency frequency mixtures).</p><p><a href="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Founders-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Founders-1.jpg" alt="" width="980" height="406" srcset="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Founders-1.jpg 980w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Founders-1-300x124.jpg 300w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Founders-1-768x318.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px"></a></p><p>If it is only about NVVDD, a single MLCC block may be sufficient to solve the most serious problems. For example, MSI uses only one on the Gaming X Trio, which is theoretically enough, but could have been better solved if, for example, the 2.1 GHz were to be used with water. Whether this is still enough would of course have to be tested. PC Partner, Zotac’s mother company, seems to have recognised this and is obviously changing its cards. By the way, the following example is from a soldering experiment that was NOT made by Zotac, but which confirmed the effectiveness of MLCC smoothing very impressively. One can almost be envious of these soldering skills.</p><p><a href="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Hand-made-MLCC.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Hand-made-MLCC.jpg" alt="" width="980" height="497" srcset="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Hand-made-MLCC.jpg 980w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Hand-made-MLCC-300x152.jpg 300w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Hand-made-MLCC-768x389.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px"></a></p><p>By the way, you also have to praise a company here that recognized the whole thing from the start and didn’t even let it touch them, as the Asus TUF RTX 3080 Gaming consequently did without POSCAPs and only used MLCC groups. My compliments, it fits!</p><p><a href="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Asus-TUF-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Asus-TUF-1.jpg" alt="" width="980" height="439" srcset="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Asus-TUF-1.jpg 980w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Asus-TUF-1-300x134.jpg 300w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Asus-TUF-1-768x344.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px"></a></p><p>Interestingly, all board partners are silent on this issue, no matter who you ask. No answer is also an answer, because this behaviour is the absolute exception and almost resembles a muzzle decree. This is because components are normally spoken freely when the launch has already taken place. But here comes nothing but meaningful silence. This also applies to the question of whether the BoM was subsequently changed again to completely exclude the exclusive use of POSCAPs/SP-CAPs.</p><p>Sometimes things are so obvious that you really have to look several times to see them. But once you have understood it, many things suddenly go from nebulous to plausible. NVIDIA, by the way, cannot be blamed directly, because the fact that MLCCs work better than POSCAPs is something that any board designer who hasn’t taken the wrong profession knows. Such a thing can even be simulated if necessary. I will of course stay on it, because my interest is naturally aroused.</p><p>Please read also the latest follow up to that sory:</p><h2><a href="https://www.igorslab.de/en/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-und-rtx-3090-and-the-crash-why-the-capacitors-are-so-important-and-what-are-the-object-behind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 and the crashes – Why capacitors are so important and what’s behind them</a></h2><p><iframe title="Aufgedeckt: Gründe, warum eine NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 oder RTX 3090 oberhalb 2 GHz crashen könnten!" width="1320" height="743" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7YQ7rNgoqMA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p> </div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="tps_slideContainer_15397"><div>

<p>When people envision technology overtaking society, many think of The Terminator and bulletproof robots. Or Big Brother in George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four<em>, </em>a symbol of external, omnipotent oppression.</p>
<p>But in all likelihood, dystopian technology will not strong-arm us. Instead, we’ll unwittingly submit ourselves to a devil’s bargain: freely trade our subconscious preferences for memes, our social cohesion for instant connection, and the truth for what we want to hear.</p>
<p>Indeed, as former insiders at Google, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube attest in our new documentary, <a href="http://thesocialdilemma.com/" data-link-name="in body link">The Social Dilemma</a><em>, </em>this is already happening. We already live in a version of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World<em>.</em> As Neil Postman puts it in his 1985 book Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>In Huxley’s vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity, and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The technology that threatens our society, democracy, and mental health is lurking in our bedrooms, sometimes lying on our pillows, as we fall asleep. We awake to its call, bring its chiming notifications to dinner, and blindly trust where it guides us. We scroll insatiably, unsuspecting that the technology that connects us, especially now in a distanced world, is also controlling us.</p>

<p>Our social media platforms are powered by a surveillance-based business model designed to mine, manipulate, and extract our human experiences at any cost, causing a breakdown of our information ecosystem and shared sense of truth worldwide. This extractive business model is not built <em>for </em>us but built to <em>exploit</em> us.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/25/americans-going-online-almost-constantly/" data-link-name="in body link">third</a> of American adults, and nearly half of those aged 18-29, say they are online “almost constantly”. But, unlike the citizens of Brave New World, we’re miserable. As our time online has gone up, so have anxiety, depression and suicide <a href="https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/185/3/203/2915143" data-link-name="in body link">rates</a>, particularly among youth.</p>
<p>Social media is also derailing productive public discourse. A largely ignored <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-it-encourages-division-top-executives-nixed-solutions-11590507499" data-link-name="in body link">internal memo</a> to senior executives at Facebook in 2018 explained: “Our algorithms exploit the human brain’s attraction to divisiveness.” Left unchecked, the algorithms will feed users “more and more divisive content in an effort to gain user attention and increase time on the platform”.</p>
<p>In 2014, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/" data-link-name="in body link">Pew Research Center</a> found that partisan antipathy and division in America is “deeper and more extensive than at any point in the last two decades”. Over the past six years, social media has only exacerbated these sentiments. In 2019, 77% of Republicans and 72% of Democrats <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/10/10/partisan-antipathy-more-intense-more-personal/" data-link-name="in body link">said</a> voters in both parties “not only disagree over plans and policies, but also cannot agree on the basic facts”.</p>
<div>
<p><img alt="'Facebook's recent measures do not address the fundamental problem of their exploitative business model.'" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/791367d1f965680b32dec327b89de8cd12a16632/348_608_2957_1775/master/2957.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=6ab86e610ff41614d84794d1015c51b3" height="1775" width="2957"></p>
</div>
<p>In The Social Dilemma, Tristan Harris, a former Google design ethicist and the co-founder of the <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/" data-link-name="in body link">Center for Humane Technology</a>, points out that far before technology overpowers human strengths, it will overwhelm human weaknesses. Sophisticated algorithms learn our emotional vulnerabilities and exploit them for profit in insidious ways.</p>
<p>By surveilling nearly all of our online activity, social media platforms can now predict our emotions and behaviors. They leverage these insights and auction us to the highest advertising bidder, and they have consequently become some of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/opinion/sunday/surveillance-capitalism.html" data-link-name="in body link">richest companies in the history of the world</a>.</p>
<p>But users aren’t just being sold a pair of shoes. The targeting capabilities of these platforms give anyone with a motive the power and precision to influence us cheaply and with phenomenal ease. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/technology/government-disinformation-cyber-troops.html" data-link-name="in body link">Disinformation campaigns</a> have been cited in more than 70 countries, and doubled from 2017 to 2019.</p>
<p>The whistleblower Sophie Zhang has <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-ignore-political-manipulation-whistleblower-memo" data-link-name="in body link">revealed</a> how pervasive the problem is on Facebook’s platform, and how little the company acts on it. Facebook recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/technology/facebook-election-chaos-november.html" data-link-name="in body link">rolled out</a> a series of updates to mitigate political misinformation in the upcoming US presidential election, including a bar on political ads one week before election day, but these measures are too little, too late, and they do not address the fundamental problem of their exploitative business model.</p>
<p>After nearly three years of working on this film, I now see “the social dilemma” as a foundational problem of our time, underlying many of the other societal conflicts that require compromise and a shared understanding to fix. If two sides are constantly fed reflections of their pre-existing ideologies and outrageous straw men of opposing views, we will never be able to build bridges and heal the challenges that plague humanity.</p>
<p>But there is hope. In The Terminator sequels, Arnold Schwarzenegger comes back as a good guy. “Who sent you?” John Connor asks. The Terminator answers, “You did. Thirty-five years from now, you reprogrammed me to be your protector.”</p>
<p>In the absence of time travel, the solution needs to incorporate the work and voices of devoted activists, organizations, scholars, and those who have experienced the harms of exploitative technology, which amplifies systemic oppression and inequality. We can’t rely on the people who created the problem to be the ones to solve it. And I won’t trust these social media companies until they change their business model to serve us, the public. Humans created this technology, and we can – and have a responsibility to – change it.</p>

September 27, 2020 | https://fredwu.me/blog/2020-09-27-tips-for-job-interviews-as-a-junior-software-developer/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://fredwu.me/blog/2020-09-27-tips-for-job-interviews-as-a-junior-software-developer/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As coding bootcamps such as <a href="https://coderacademy.edu.au/">Coder Academy</a> and <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a> churn out more and more software developers, and as more and more people start to realise the importance of software, companies these days are facing an increased amount of candidates applying for junior dev roles.</p>
<p>Recently we had to take down our job ad for a junior full stack React and Elixir role only a few days after posting it due to having received about 300 applications. Suffice to say, the competition is fierce at the entry-level end of the software engineer spectrum.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">Software is eating the world.</a> - Marc Andreessen</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the past three months alone I've had to sit through over a hundred interviews, many of which were for junior roles. Some candidates did really well but unfortunately the vast majority did quite poorly. In this article I am hoping to offer some tips and insights as a seasoned interviewer and hiring manager, to those who might be struggling landing an entry-level software engineer role.</p>
<p>I'll break the tips into three sections: before an interview, during an interview and after an interview.</p>
<h2>Before an Interview</h2>
<p>This is arguably the most important stage of your interview - before it happens! Prepare yourself with enough knowledge and confidence in both software development and conversational skills in order to ace the interview and stand out amongst a sea of candidates.</p>
<h3>Study Software Engineering Fundamentals</h3>
<p>I get it, bootcamps and many online tutorials and courses focus on teaching the practical things to turn code into products. But just like running or even walking without correct postures, it can be incredibly dangerous over time.</p>
<p>My recommendation is to read on the basics of object-oriented programming, functional programming and some design patterns. For instance, build up some basic understanding of how the JavaScript prototype works or how the Ruby object model works can be extremely beneficial in progressing your technical capability on application design and architecture.</p>
<h3>Get More Project Experience</h3>
<p>Not having any substantial project experience on your CV is a sure way to significantly lower your chance of getting an interview.</p>
<p>Do junior developers really need substantial project experience, you may ask? Abso-fucking-lutely!</p>
<p>Build your own side projects, participate in open source projects, pick up some freelancing work - the choice is yours. These won't be your most technically accomplished work, but they will help you accumulate experience, and more importantly to demonstrate your capability to your interviewers with real world experience.</p>
<h3>Why Software Development?</h3>
<p>I want you to put your hand on heart and answer this question honestly. If your answer is more money or FOMO, that's okay, but be prepared to be disappointed with the reality - if you are not in this field because of your passion for building products or solving problems, you will find this a long and hard slog.</p>
<p>If you are passionate about building software, then let me tell you this - when you are starting your career you will have to give up your work life balance for a bit. That is, if you want to boost your career and progress quickly beyond being a junior developer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My interest is in the future, because I am going to spend the rest of my life there. - Charles Kettering</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking back at when I started my software career many moons ago, I never regretted giving up my social life early on in my career: I worked extremely hard, often did many jobs - a day job as a dev, a night job as a dev, freelancing and doing open source work all at the same time. Some would probably frown and say that I had no life, but I choose to believe that I was making sacrifices so I can become good at what I love doing in the shortest amount of time.</p>
<h3>Research the Company You Apply For</h3>
<p>If you are one of those who spam your CVs to every job opening, please consider changing your tactic. A well written cover letter will not only increase your chance of getting an interview, but also allow you to ask relevant questions during the interview.</p>
<p>Check out the company's website and any social media pages on LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram, etc. Do a bit of "stalking" on the people who work in the company, sometimes this will give you some insights into the type of work environment and culture the company has.</p>
<p>Doing enough research is not only for your own good - knowing whether you will enjoy working there should you end up getting a job offer, but also demonstrates your ability to do research and independent thinking to your interviewers.</p>
<h3>Read, Listen and Communicate</h3>
<p>This one might not be immediately obvious because it's very high level and somewhat vague, bear with me.</p>
<p>Some people might be deep thinkers but really struggle to get their points across, and to communicate their ideas and thought process in a clear, concise and useful way. My advice is to read blogs, listen to talks and learn from other people on how they communicate. When you read and listen, pay more attention to how sentences are structured and how titbits of information are given.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most powerful person in the world is the story teller. - Steve Jobs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And don't forget to practice! Get comfortable talking to others on various topics in software development.</p>
<h2>During an Interview</h2>
<p>Hopefully the tips given thus far would help you secure an interview. Now it's show time!</p>
<h3>Turn Up On time, Have Equipment Sorted</h3>
<p>Whether you are attending an on-location interview, or more likely during Covid, an online interview, make sure you turn up on time!</p>
<p>If it's an online interview, also make sure you have whatever software needed (Zoom, etc) installed and tested. I've had a few occasions where the first five minutes of the interview was spent on the candidate trying to get their mic or speaker working - it's not a huge deal, but it does show the lack of preparation and organisational skills.</p>
<h3>A Smile Goes a Long Way</h3>
<p>Understandably, interviewing is stressful. However, remember to put on a smile when you greet your interviewer and when you do small talks. Everything needs a balance of course, when you're giving technical answers it's probably not a good idea to smile.</p>
<p>If you know you get uncomfortable talking to strangers or when under pressure - do more practices! If you can't find a friend or don't have a partner to practice with, use a mirror!</p>
<h3>Learn to Say "No, I don't know"</h3>
<p>When you don't know something or can't recall the details of something, just say it. As an interviewer, when I ask you a technical question I can see through your hmms and ahs. A "sorry, I don't know" is a much better answer than one that doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>Bonus point: "Sorry I don't know, but I will look it up after this interview."</p>
<h3>Read Social Cues</h3>
<p>This one can be extremely easy or extremely hard depending on your personality. For those who might struggle with reading social cues, try pay more attention to what type of questions you were asked.</p>
<p>If it was an introduction of yourself to kick off the interview, make it more than just two sentences but also under five minutes - this is usually a warm up for you to find your feet and calm your nerve, and for the interviewer to extract any interesting information as a discussion point later. It doesn't have to be your memoir and you shouldn't robotically talk through your entire education and work history.</p>
<p>If it was a technical question, always try to time-box it. Don't drag on and repeat yourself just because you have already answered it quickly and concisely. When in doubt, ask the interviewers whether they have anything in particular they were looking for.</p>
<p>If it was an open ended question, try to explain your thought process as you explain it. As an interviewer, I'd hate to ask an open ended question and get a short yes/no back. At the same time, give interviewers room to interject and ask follow-up questions by pacing yourself.</p>
<h3>Don't Speak Too Fast</h3>
<p>Okay, you might be very nervous, or English might not be your first language, so you tend to speak fast to "get through it".</p>
<p>If that's the case, work on your speech pattern, make it concious enough that you will recognise it when you speak too fast. If interviewers can't get your points clearly, they might not always ask you to clarify - because if you kept doing it repeatedly, you would already be written off as a suitable candidate.</p>
<h3>Be Humble</h3>
<p>I totally understand that in a competitive job market you want to present yourself in the best light. Just be confident and speak the truths.</p>
<p>As someone who's been doing interviews for years, I really dislike people who overstate their capability either on their CV or during the interview because these are often very obvious. Claiming to be an Elixir expert but not knowing how the supervision tree works is a sure way to score a black mark, for example.</p>
<h3>Show Passion and Drive</h3>
<p>To counter the point on over-selling yourself, what works better is to show interviewers your willingness and determination to learn. Remember, you are still a junior therefore we don't expect you to know everything we know.</p>
<p>What we do expect, is your commitment to learning - not by saying it, but by demonstrating it. Remember the earlier tip on getting more project experience?</p>
<h3>Ask Questions</h3>
<p>Usually towards the end of the interview, we'd ask you if you have any questions. Don't say "no".</p>
<p>Doesn't matter how much research you've done on a company, there are always insights someone who's working at the company can give you. How do they manage the delivery? How do they support learning? What makes them enjoy working at the company?</p>
<p>Use this opportunity to gain insights into why you should be working at this company, and to demonstrate your interests in working at the company to the interviewers too.</p>
<h2>After an Interview</h2>
<p>After completing an interview, it's an opportunity to do a little retrospective and do a follow up when necessary.</p>
<h3>Close the Knowledge Gap</h3>
<p>Don't over-analyse on what you could have or should have said. Instead, spend your energy on solidifying …</p></div></div>

September 27, 2020 | https://julian.digital/2020/09/25/is-this-real-life/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://julian.digital/2020/09/25/is-this-real-life/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
 		
<p>In his bestselling book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens">Sapiens</a>, Yuval Harari argues that humans became the dominating species of planet earth because we are the only animal that can cooperate in large numbers. This, he claims, is due to humans’ ability to believe in purely imaginative things and concepts. A company like Google, for example, doesn’t <em>really</em> exist. Sure, there’s the Google.com website and physical Google offices with real Google employees – but the idea of Google as a company is just a fictional concept. It only exists because multiple people believe in it. The same is true for legal systems, nations, religion or money. Every large human cooperation system is based on a fictional idea that only lives in our collective minds.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/qanon.gif" media="min-width: 600px">What Harari doesn’t discuss in his book is the extreme other end of this cognitive ability: Conspiracy theories. I’ve been fascinated by <a href="https://reallifemag.com/this-is-not-a-game/">Jon Glover’s recent essay on QAnon</a>, in which he compares conspiracy theorizing to alternate-reality games. Participating in QAnon conspiracies, he says, feels like playing a real-life multiplayer game based on secret insider knowledge.</p>



<p>Social media has made conspiracy theorizing so addictive and immersive that the line between story and reality can become incredibly blurry. </p>



<p><i>“A lot of these groups are like cults […] They have beliefs that border on religiosity … And when you contradict them, it’s like telling them Jesus isn’t real.”</i></p>



<p>The religion analogy is interesting because it’s a perfect example of why fact checking as a countermeasure is useless. <a href="https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/about">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/programs/third-party-fact-checking">Facebook</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-factcheck/with-fact-checks-twitter-takes-on-a-new-kind-of-task-idUSKBN2360U0?il=0">co</a> have all introduced fact checks and fake news labels to combat conspiracy theories. It’s naive to think that they will work.</p>



<p>Think about it: Science (which, you could argue, is also a form of fact checking) has been around for centuries trying to debunk most religious beliefs – and yet religion still plays a major role in Western society. If entire education systems teaching millions of people about science haven’t worked, why do you think adding a small fact check disclaimer below a YouTube video would?</p>



<p>In fact – as you would expect from a perfect alternate-reality game – fact checks (and how to circumvent them) have <a href="https://twitter.com/elisethoma5/status/1303630697567928320">actually long been part of the game</a>.</p>



<p>It’s worth pointing out that science is also just another belief system. We laugh about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_flat_Earth_societies">flat earthers</a>, but how many people can actually explain why the world is round in a scientifically correct way? Most of us don’t <em>know</em> science, we <em>believe</em> in science.</p>



<center><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/reality.gif"></center>



<p>What should give us hope though is the fact that many people believe in *both* science and religion despite their contradictions. This means that multiple realities can co-exist even when they are at odds with each other.</p>



<p>We don’t live in just one reality – we switch between different realities (and play different characters within them). It’s a bit like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westworld_(TV_series)">Westworld</a>, where guests can explore different theme parks: Westworld, Shogunworld, Warworld, etc.</p>



<p>Similar to Westworld, it’s increasingly becoming more difficult to distinguish between what’s real and what isn’t. As Aaron Z. Lewis points out in his brilliant essay <a href="https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2019/05/29/you-can-handle-the-post-truth/">You Can Handle the Post-Truth</a>, we have created a fragmented reality with hyper-realistic CGI influencers, bots, deepfakes, AI pretending to be humans and humans pretending to be AI. We don’t live in a single timeline with a single history, but in a variety of “<em>contradictory reality bubbles</em>“.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/narrativeviolations.png"></p><p>Bruno Maçães paints a similar picture in his excellent book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52914599-history-has-begun">History Has Begun</a>. America, he believes, is in the process of transforming into a new, post-liberal society, distinct from current Western civilization. It’s a society that has not only been heavily shaped by television but one where reality and fantasy overlap.</p>



<p>This transformation has been in the making for a while: Kennedy had the aura of a movie star and leveraged his image through the medium of television. Nixon created the first political soap opera with the Watergate scandal. And with Reagan an actual movie star moved into the White House.</p>



<p>Trump is the ultimate culmination of this trend. His entire presidency feels scripted. His tweets end with <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1265819308699070464?lang=en">cliffhangers</a>. A House of Cards screenwriter would not have been able to come up with a better story.</p>



<p>Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger used the social capital and entertainment skills they acquired as actors to appear more likable and competent as politicians, but at least they tried to be politicians. Trump, on the other hand, uses politics as another stage for his acting performance.</p>



<p><em>“Americans see the world as an action movie”</em> Maçães writes. I think this became especially apparent during the current covid-19 crisis and the most recent wildfires in California. People in my social media timelines seemed only superficially worried. Instead, their posts contained an underlying sense of excitement about real life finally catching up with the science fiction aesthetics of Blade Runner and Akira.</p>



<p>Perhaps this is Hollywood’s greatest achievement: It gets us excited about our dystopian future. The world might be ending, but at least it’s an ending that’s entertaining to watch.</p>



<p><iframe width="100%" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x_m9TUP_t_Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>If Hollywood created the fantasy worlds that reality is catching up with today, who is creating the fantasy worlds of tomorrow?</p>



<p>Maçães thinks the answer is Silicon Valley, which he describes as <em>“a fantasy land where engineering talent and capital come together to power the serious project of creating new worlds out of nothing”</em>. It’s one of the most idiosyncratic descriptions of how startups work that I have read. VCs are the new Hollywood studios; founders are the directors and actors.</p>



<p>A founder’s job is essentially to create the most compelling narrative of what their company will look like in 10 to 20 years time. <a href="https://alexdanco.com/2020/09/17/are-founders-allowed-to-lie/">It’s not lying, it’s telling pre-truths</a>. Being contrarian just means that you came up with a novel fantasy plot no one else had thought of yet.</p>



<p>Sometimes founders are able to re-create the fantasy narratives of their pitch decks. Sometimes you end up with Theranos.</p>



<p>And even when you do end up with Theranos, at least you get material for an exciting new Netflix series. Perhaps VCs should buy the movie rights to the startups they invest in as a hedge against their biggest portfolio failures?</p>



<p>The concept of the tech industry as a creator of fantasy worlds immediately reminded me of a conversation I had with my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/cutler_max">Max</a> recently. His theory is that it’s not the lack of tech talent or venture capital that explains why Europe hasn’t been able to create a tech ecosystem on par with the US. It’s the absence of religiosity that has kept Europe from creating its own Google or Facebook. The US is able to create larger companies because it’s able to believe in larger and more ambitious narratives.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/escher.png"></p><p>Silicon Valley is not just creating new fantasy worlds, it is building tools that allow others to create their own fantasy worlds. Enter social media.</p>



<p>If TV has taught us to think of ourselves as characters in the story of our lives, then social media has allowed us to actually write and edit the script and build fictional characters. Social media is essentially the democratization of virtual world building.</p>



<p>As I wrote in <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling-as-a-Service</a>, Twitter, Snapchat and Facebook are just massive virtual status arenas that allow us to build social capital through signaling. Some of that social capital might be built on top of real stories and actual achievements, but most of it is not based on reality. Every time you are applying an Instagram filter, you are already changing reality.</p>



<p>It’s not just that we bend reality in our social media narratives, we also play different characters. As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3Zs74IH0mc">Chris Poole already pointed out</a> years ago, we all have multiple (online) identities. There is not just one reflection of yourself – identity is prismatic. Twitter-Julian (armchair intellectual) is not the same as Instagram-Julian (hobby photographer) or Facebook-Julian (high-school drinking buddy). Google Circles and Facebook Lists always got this wrong: They let us change who we shared <em>with</em>, but not who we shared <em>as</em>.</p>



<p>This is why social networking is not a winner-take-all market. We need different channels for our different, contradicting online personas. </p>



<p>The problem is not that we live in multiple realities or that these realities are sometimes at odds with each other. What’s problematic is that we sometimes get so immersed in one virtual world, that we forget about all the other realities – which brings us back to the problem of online conspiracies.</p>



<p>In Christopher Nolan’s Inception, Dom Cobb uses <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQPy88-E2zo">a spinning tractricoid top that tells him if he is awake or still dreaming</a>. You can think of the mechanisms I describe in <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/08/06/proof-of-x/">Proof of X</a> as social media’s equivalent of the spinning top. As <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/10/you-can-rent-a-grounded-private-jet-to-take-instagram-photos.html">influencers rent grounded private jets</a> to pretend living a billionaire lifestyle, social networks introduce new proof-of-work hurdles to make sure our status games remain grounded in truth. Proof of reality.</p>



<p>It feels like some of the new virtual realities we have created need more than that. A kill switch that automatically brings us back to base reality.</p>



<p>So if you have reached this point of my essay, perhaps now would be a good time to close your browser window and enjoy real life. Or at least <a href="https://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html">the closest simulation you have thereof</a>. </p>

<p>The graphics may be a bit flickery, with a lot of color clashing when
things overlap, but the pixel fill rate is outstanding.

</p><p>The per-object overhead is fairly high, especially for objects that move.
You can observe this by slowing the movement rate of a player projectile
to a crawl (<code>515a:20 00</code>) and tapping the space bar rapidly.
Performance with two dozen projectiles in flight is rather poor; compare
it to the very good performance of the title demo (19-rectangle Epoch logo
and 8 stars), and space region 5 (1 ship and up to 32 stars).</p>

<p>Even so, the cost of moving and projecting objects is lower than it is
in games like Elite or Stellar 7, because Epoch takes a few shortcuts.</p>


<h2>General</h2>

<p>Epoch uses a left-handed three-dimensional coordinate system, with
the viewer at (0,0,0), +X to the right, +Y downward, and +Z away (into the
screen).  The viewer is always at (0,0,0), looking directly down the Z axis
with +Y upward, so object coordinates are always in eye (camera) space.
The view area is treated as square, using a perspective projection with a
45-degree FOV, so an object at (100,100,100) would be at the bottom-right
corner of the screen, as would an object at (200,200,200).</p>

<p>The "far" plane is at Z=+32767, so X/Y are limited to (-32767,+32767).
Anything that moves outside the view frustum is discarded.  If it moves past
the near plane at Z=0, player collision tests are applied.</p>


<p>All math, including object movement and perspective projection, is done
with simple arithmetic and about 4KB of lookup tables.</p>

<p>The points, lines, and rectangles that make up an object are always
drawn parallel to the viewer.</p>

<p>The game uses the full hi-res screen, which is 280 pixels wide.
That's more than will fit in a single byte, so screen X coordinates are
expressed as a signed value in the range [-139,139] (one byte holds the
magnitude, another byte holds the sign).  Y coordinates are simply [0,191].
Because the screen itself is not square, rendered element widths are
effectively multiplied by (280/192)=~1.46 (assuming ideal projection).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://6502disassembly.com/a2-epoch/objects.html">objects</a> page explains how objects are
defined.  The most important thing to know is that each object is defined
as a set of elements, which may be points, horizontal lines, vertical lines,
or filled rectangles in different colors.</p>


<h2>Movement</h2>

<p>There are three sources of movement:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Projectiles, enemy ships, and explosion chunks have nonzero
    movement vectors.  (Stars, bases, and time portals don't move
    on their own.)</li>
  <li>The player can move forward.</li>
  <li>The player can turn.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the coordinates were maintained in world space, player rotation
would be something applied at the very end, right before projection.
Because they're always in eye space, every object's position and motion
vector must be updated when the player rotates.</p>

<p>To see why this is, consider what happens when a player projectile
('#') is fired:</p>

<pre>  [player] ...# --&gt;
</pre>
<p>The projectile is moving directly away from the player, with a velocity
vector (0,0,N).  If the player instantly pitched up 45 degrees, the
projectile should be at the bottom of the screen, moving down and away:</p>
<pre>  [player] .
            .
             .
              #

                \
                 v
</pre>
<p>This clearly requires updating the object's position, using a rotation
equation that keeps it at a constant distance.  We also need to update the
movement vector, because if we don't, the projectile will move away as if
it were fired from a position below the player, rather than being fired
by the player:</p>

<pre>  [player] .
            .
             .
              # --&gt;
</pre>

<p>The effects of player rotation on movement are absent or minimal for most
things, because the object is either motionless or moving relatively slowly.
The main exception is player projectiles, which disappear quickly enough
that small errors will go unnoticed.</p>

<p>To see this in the game, reduce the player projectile velocity, fire a
shot, then pitch the camera so the projectile is at the edge of the screen
and check the new vector.  In one test, the vector changed from
xyz=[$0000,0000,0090] to [$0000,0064,0072], which isn't perfect
(speed of 151 vs. 144) but is pretty close, and the projectile doesn't
appear to rise or fall as it recedes into the distance.</p>

<p>One potential area of difficulty is that the game is always dealing with
movement deltas.  When pitching upward in the earlier experiment, the game
updated the vector each frame based on the joystick offset in that frame.
This is different from a conventional world-space approach, in which the
rotations are based on absolute position and orientation.  The reason deltas
can be problematic is that, if the math is imprecise, small errors can
add up over time.</p>


<h4>Double-Plane Quirk</h4>

<p>The 100-point alien ship is defined as two planes, one behind
the other.  The rear plane is defined last, which means it's drawn
on top of the front plane, which causes some erasure artifacts.
But there's a far stranger quirk.</p>

<p>If you disable the ship's forward movement in its object definition
(<code>4aa2:00 00</code>), and apply the game tweaks mentioned on
the main page to create a region of space with one alien ship and
nothing else, you can fly right up to the ship and examine it.  As
you get close, the difference in Z-depth between the two planes
starts to expose the limitations of the coordinate accuracy.</p>

<p>Because shapes are defined without a common center point, the
planes will start to move independently.  If you get fairly close
and move the crosshairs around for a bit, you can see the pieces
start to separate:</p>

<a href="https://6502disassembly.com/a2-epoch/images/drift-before.gif"><img src="https://6502disassembly.com/a2-epoch/images/drift-before.gif" alt="drift-before" width="140" height="96"></a>
<a href="https://6502disassembly.com/a2-epoch/images/drift-after.gif"><img src="https://6502disassembly.com/a2-epoch/images/drift-after.gif" alt="drift-after" width="140" height="96"></a>

<p>If you get really close, the rear part (which you can identify by the
lack of a flashing dot in the middle) will actually start to wander off:</p>

<a href="https://6502disassembly.com/a2-epoch/images/drift-active.gif"><img src="https://6502disassembly.com/a2-epoch/images/drift-active.gif" alt="drift-active" width="140" height="96"></a>

<p>In other games that scale with distance, such as Elite or Stellar 7,
this doesn't happen because the position is determined by a point at the
center of the object.  Epoch applies position adjustment to the element
coordinates individually, which works fine so long as all points are at
the same Z depth.  In practice this effect isn't really noticeable when
playing the game because the enemy ship will fly past before it has time
for the two parts to drift noticeably.</p>

<h4>Movement Implementation</h4>

<p>There are two parts, object movement and element movement.</p>

<p>Epoch doesn't store a position for the object, so the object move
routine is only responsible for updating the object movement vectors.
For enemy ships this is done periodically, to give the ships a little
more life than a homing drone (which they mostly feel like anyway).
For everything else, this is only done when the joystick causes the
view angles to change.  This change must be applied to the object's
movement vector, for the reasons discussed earlier.</p>

<p>The element movement code updates each element's position (defined
as left/top and possibly right and/or bottom) with the object's
motion vector, adds the player's forward motion, and applies the
joystick angles to the positions.  The latter isn't quite right, for a
couple of reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Changes to the joystick position don't change the Z coordinates.
    So rotating something from the center to the side makes it farther away.
    However, the projection scaling is based purely on Z distance, so
    things don't actually get smaller as they move away from the center
    of the screen.</li>
  <li>All elements remain parallel to the screen.  Elements should
    appear to rotate so they face toward the viewer as the viewer rotates,
    not slide sideways.  This doesn't feel off because it's just Epoch's
    visual style.  (FWIW, Doom did the same thing with equipment and
    corpses.)</li>
</ol>

<p><i>(Details TBD; math tables at $1000, $ac00, and $b500 require
further examination.  Tables in C++ form
<a href="https://6502disassembly.com/a2-epoch/extra/math_tab.cpp">here</a>.)</i></p>


<h2>Drawing and Erasing</h2>

<p>The basic redraw loop looks like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For each object:
    <ul>
      <li>For each element in the object:
        <ul>
          <li>Erase element from previous position</li>
          <li>Draw element in new position</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Pretty straightforward, notable only in that we erase and redraw each
element before moving on to the next, which means that we'll create some
visual artifacts when an object is in motion if the new position of an
element overlaps the old position of a later element.  Doing it this way
is important to reduce flicker when not using page-flipping.  Erasing the
entire object before redrawing it would increase the amount of time that the
pixels are black, making it more likely that the screen refresh would
show a blank space.</p>

<p>Every element can have one or two of the six hi-res colors assigned.
If two colors are assigned, the renderer will alternate between them at
a rate specified within the element.  As an optimization, black elements
are erased, but not explicitly drawn.  This can cause some interesting
effects when elements overlap.</p>

<h4>Unrolled Loops</h4>

<p>The fastest way to draw a rectangle on the hi-res screen is to draw it
in vertical stripes.  Part of this is because, with 7 pixels per byte
(more or less), the bit patterns for odd columns and even columns are
different.  By drawing columns, we reduce the number of times we have to
switch color patterns.</p>

<p>But the most important reason is that we can use something like this:</p>
<pre>    sta   $2000,y
    sta   $2400,y
    sta   $2800,y
    sta   $2c00,y
    sta   $3000,y
    sta   $3400,y
    sta   $3800,y
    sta   $3c00,y
    ...
</pre>

<p>This is faster than doing the same operation in a loop, because we
don't have to update the loop counter or execute a branch instruction.
Call this with the value to store in the A-reg and the column in the Y-reg,
and we can write bytes to the screen about as fast as can be done on a 6502
(5 cycles per byte).</p>

<p>If we want to blend with existing pixels rather than overwrite them,
we can do something like this:</p>
<pre>    txa
    ora   $2000,y
    sta   $2000,y
    txa
    ora   $2400,y
    sta   $2400,y
    txa
    ora   $2800,y
    sta   $2800,y
    ...
</pre>
<p>This time we pass the value to blend in the X-reg.  For this we have
to spend 11 cycles per byte.</p>

<p>This is a great …</p></div>

    <!--summary-->

<p>Today, we’ll cover a cool <a href="https://terraspace.cloud/">Terraspace</a> feature. It allows you to deploy all of your infrastructure in a single command.</p>



<p>Terraspace calculates the dependencies and deploys your code in the right order.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="terraform-recommendations">Terraform Recommendations</h2>

<p>First, let’s talk about some Terraform recommendations. They recommend separating your code on a <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/guides/recommended-practices/part1.html#one-workspace-per-environment-per-terraform-configuration">per configuration and environment basis</a>. Here are examples straight from the docs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>billing-app-dev</li>
  <li>billing-app-prod</li>
  <li>networking-dev</li>
  <li>networking-prod</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s a table to help explain these “scoped configurations” in different contexts:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Product</th>
      <th>Scope</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Terraform Cloud</td>
      <td>A workspace</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Terraform OSS</td>
      <td>A terraform module with a separate statefile</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Terraspace</td>
      <td>A stack</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Believe the reasons for the strategy are because:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It avoids a monolithic structure and statefile that can take forever to run. See: <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/18981">Terraform takes a very long time to run</a>. It’s not fun to wait 20+ minutes for your <code>terraform apply</code>.</li>
  <li>It’s safer to update. Since the changes are more limited in scope, the blast radius is reduced.</li>
  <li>It helps decouple the code to logically reusable units.</li>
</ol>

<p>You deploy these “scoped configurations” separately.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>One of the main issues with separating your code into separate stacks is that you have to deploy them independently. For example, you must manually deploy the VPC and then the instance afterward. You lose a significant advantage of what Terraform does: orchestration.</p>

<h2 id="enter-terraspace-all">Enter Terraspace All</h2>

<p>The <code>terraspace all</code> commands solves this problem by calculating the dependency graph and deploying the stacks in the correct order for you. Terraspace also parallelizes the batches. Here’s a dependency graph example.</p>

<p><img src="https://img.boltops.com/boltops/tools/terraspace/dependencies/deploy-all-a1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Let’s deploy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ terraspace all up
Will run:
   terraspace up b2 # batch 1
   terraspace up c1 # batch 1
   terraspace up c3 # batch 1
   terraspace up d1 # batch 1
   terraspace up b1 # batch 2
   terraspace up c2 # batch 2
   terraspace up b3 # batch 3
   terraspace up a1 # batch 4
Are you sure? (y/N)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you confirm, Terraspace deploys the batches in parallel. Essentially, Terraspace handles the orchestration.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Are you sure? (y/N) y
Batch Run 1:
Running: terraspace up b2 Logs: log/up/b2.log
Running: terraspace up c1 Logs: log/up/c1.log
Running: terraspace up c3 Logs: log/up/c3.log
Running: terraspace up d1 Logs: log/up/d1.log
terraspace up b2:  Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
terraspace up c1:  Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
terraspace up c3:  Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
terraspace up d1:  Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
Batch Run 2:
Running: terraspace up b1 Logs: log/up/b1.log
Running: terraspace up c2 Logs: log/up/c2.log
terraspace up b1:  Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
terraspace up c2:  Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
Batch Run 3:
Running: terraspace up b3 Logs: log/up/b3.log
terraspace up b3:  Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
Batch Run 4:
Running: terraspace up a1 Logs: log/up/a1.log
terraspace up a1:  Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
Time took: 41s
$
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Terraspace provides a reduced-noise summary of the runs. The full logs are also written for further inspection and debugging. The <a href="https://terraspace.cloud/reference/terraspace-log/">terraspace log</a> command is useful for viewing the logs.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-configure-dependencies">How to Configure Dependencies</h2>

<p>To configure dependencies, you merely wire stack outputs to inputs variables of another stack. Here is an example of an instance stack that depends on a vpc stack.</p>

<p>app/stacks/vpc/outputs.tf</p>

<div><div><pre><code>output "vpc_id" {
  description = "VPC ID"
  value       = aws_vpc.this.id
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>app/stacks/instance/variables.tf</p>

<div><div><pre><code>variable "vpc_id" {
  description = "VPC to launch instance in"
  type        = string
  default     = null
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Wire them together with the <code>terraform_output</code> helper in the instance tfvars file.</p>

<p>app/stacks/instance/tfvars/base.tfvars</p>

<div><div><pre><code>vpc_id = &lt;%= terraform_output('vpc.vpc_id') %&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Terraspace infers the dependency from this connection. It’s that simple.</p>

<p>Learn more: <a href="https://terraspace.cloud/docs/dependencies/deploy-multiple/">Deploy Multiple Stacks</a>.</p>

<h2 id="visualizing-with-graphs">Visualizing with Graphs</h2>

<p>You can create a visual dependency graph diagram with:</p>



<p>The earlier example dependency graph was generated with this command. Here’s the graph again:</p>

<p><img src="https://img.boltops.com/boltops/tools/terraspace/dependencies/deploy-all-a1.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="targeting-subgraphs-and-subtrees">Targeting Subgraphs and Subtrees</h2>

<p>You can also target subgraphs by specifying stack names. Example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>terraspace all graph b1 b3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Produces:</p>

<p><img src="https://img.boltops.com/boltops/tools/terraspace/dependencies/deploy-all-a1-sub-b1-b3.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can filter for stacks with any of all commands. Here’s an example with up:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ terraspace all up b1 b3
Will run:
   terraspace up c1 # batch 1
   terraspace up c3 # batch 1
   terraspace up d1 # batch 1
   terraspace up b1 # batch 2
   terraspace up c2 # batch 2
   terraspace up b3 # batch 3
Are you sure? (y/N)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This targets the b1 and b3 stacks and their dependencies.</p>

<h2 id="tearing-it-all-down">Tearing it All Down</h2>

<p>Finally, to tear down all the infrastructure.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ terraspace all down
Will run:
   terraspace down a1 # batch 1
   terraspace down b3 # batch 2
   terraspace down b1 # batch 3
   terraspace down c2 # batch 3
   terraspace down b2 # batch 4
   terraspace down c1 # batch 4
   terraspace down c3 # batch 4
   terraspace down d1 # batch 4
Are you sure? (y/N)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you’re ready, type <code>y</code> and enter.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Are you sure? (y/N) y

<h2 id="the-best-of-both-worlds">The Best of Both Worlds</h2>

<p>Terraspace helps you solve the issue of having to deploy individual stacks manually. Instead of having to run <code>terraspace up</code> individually, it allows you to deploy all stacks with a single command:</p>



<p>Additionally, you can target <a href="https://terraspace.cloud/docs/dependencies/subgraphs/">subgraphs</a> to deploy:</p>



<p>Lastly, you can always drop down and run the individual stack to debug. Example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>terraspace up c1
terraspace up b1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Terraspace gives you the best of both worlds. To learn more about Terraspace check out <a href="https://terraspace.cloud/">terraspace.cloud</a>.</p>

  <p>Leveraging feedback loops to solve almost any&nbsp;problem</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was the fat kid. Then puberty hit and I shot up. I started playing basketball, slimming down in the process. Just as my body got used to that, I entered the study-all-day-to-get-into-college phase. Mixed with comfort feeding, I was back to my chubby self.</p>

<p>How does my body work? Why? Is it as simple as eating less and exercising more?</p>

<p>Turns out, it isn’t. But this question introduced me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Systems Theory</a>. Practical processes I could apply to my body to understand fat-ness. The best part? The ideas apply to so much more than this single human body.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*vhnSQ4YTu9wK1dSDcQMaew.gif" alt=""><em>(I’m at my 2-pack self&nbsp;now)</em></p>

</figure>

<p>What’s a system, anyway? It’s a collection of parts working together. That’s rather broad: it includes the earth, the government, the beach and us.</p>

<p>What’s not a system, then? Anything that’s a part standing alone. This includes: A screw, a grain of sand, an atom — depending on the resolution you’re looking at. We can argue, that a screw is a system as well, since it’s a collection of atoms working together, staying in the correct shape to make a screw.</p>

<p>Since almost everything is a system, we can leverage concepts from System Theory to solve almost any problem.</p>

<p>Let’s descend into systems. Here’s what caught my attention — feedback loops.</p>

<p>Feedback is a mechanism to send information back to the system. The feedback affects the system. If A causes B, it becomes possible that B causes A too.</p>

<p>A great example of a feedback loop is the <strong>Winner take all effect.</strong></p>

<p>You begin the year with a product that is 1% better than your competitors. So, you gain 1% more customers than your competitors. You win this year.</p>

<p>The feedback is more customers, which equals a greater revenue. With the greater revenue, you have more resources to improve your product.</p>

<p>The next year, thanks to extra resources, your product becomes 2% better than your competitors. So, you gain 2% more customers. You win again.</p>

<p>The feedback is a lot more revenue to further improve your product. Soon, your competitor goes bankrupt trying to keep up, and you, the winner, takes all the market share.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Greater revenue can create a better product, as much as a better product can create greater revenue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What if you could see these feedback loops and use them to solve problems? Welcome to the world of Systems Thinking.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If A causes B, it becomes possible that B causes A&nbsp;too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First off — the building blocks. There are only two. Together, they make up every system imaginable.</p>

<h4 id="balancing-feedbackloops">Balancing Feedback&nbsp;Loops</h4>

<p>They attempt to bring a system to an equilibrium state. They provide negative feedback, and hence, also known as <strong>negative feedback loops.</strong></p>

<p>This has nothing to do with the loops themselves being good or bad.</p>

<h4 id="reinforcing-feedbackloops">Reinforcing Feedback&nbsp;Loops</h4>

<p>They attempt to exponentiate a system. They provide positive feedback, and hence, also known as **positive feedback loops.<br>
**Every system which can multiply itself has potential for creating a reinforcing loop.</p>

<p>The Winner take all effect is a reinforcing loop in the business world system.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>That is all there is to systems. What then makes even Mark cry when dealing with self-created systems?</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*3lGZg_CxEQjzVglN.jpg" alt=""><em>(Getty Images / Chip Somodevilla)</em></p>

<p>Consider Facebook. You have an algorithm which decides what shows up in the feed. If it’s something people love, people will stick to Facebook and tell their friends about how awesome facebook is. A reinforcing loop. This leads to more time spent on Facebook, hence more revenue for Facebook. A better earnings quarter gives more confidence to shareholders, driving the stock price up — another reinforcing loop. With the stock market, there is a fear of crashing down — a balancing loop, moderating investment.</p>

<p>A better share price, higher revenue attracts more tech talent to Facebook. <strong>And that results in&nbsp;… a better feed algorithm.</strong> The ultimate reinforcing loop. Would be all rainbows and butterflies if the story ended here, right? The flip side, is that the loop works both ways — make a mistake with the algorithm, or sell data to a third party which the world finds out about, and people start distrusting Facebook, people start deleting Facebook, acquired start up founders start leaving Facebook, which drives down revenue, which drives down share price and drives down hiring. <strong>And that results in&nbsp;… a worse feed.</strong> Thus, the reinforcing loop continues.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">

<p>What makes learning about systems worthwhile is this key insight by Donella Meadows in <a href="https://amzn.to/2KLQ7mr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thinking in Systems</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Systems with similar feedback structure produce similar dynamic behaviours</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The determinant of a system’s behaviour is its function or purpose. As Charlie Munger would put it —</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Show me the incentives, and I’ll show you the&nbsp;outcomes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s a framework of systems. For a more complete introduction, check out <a href="https://amzn.to/2KP5Lh4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thinking in Systems</a>. I can’t recommend this book enough!</p>

<p><strong>The competing loops</strong></p>

<p>In every case, we have two or more loops pulling our system in different directions, towards different goals.</p>

<p>Both balancing and reinforcing loops are goal-seeking. The difference is the type of goal. Both have goals in opposite directions, hence the competition.</p>

<p>At any point, the system is moving towards one goal, or is in equilibrium. The loop moving the entire system to its goal is the <strong>dominant loop</strong>.</p>

<p>Given enough time, the dominant loop keeps changing. This concept of changing loops is <strong>shifting dominance.</strong></p>

<p>With the definitions out of the way, we can get into the interesting parts — actually exploring a system!</p>

<h4 id="the-population-cycle">The Population cycle</h4>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*-45c0Z2vKBrcX05c" alt=""><em>(<a href="https://unsplash.com/@adroman?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a>)</em></p>

<p>Time for a thought experiment. How does population work?</p>

<p>What can you see affecting the size of the population?<br>
Births and deaths.</p>

<p>More births leads to a higher population — which leads to even more births! A reinforcing loop.</p>

<p>More deaths lead to a smaller population — which leads to a smaller number of deaths! A balancing loop.</p>

<p>Together, they form the population cycle.</p>

<p>If the population is moving up, births are the dominant loop.<br>
If the population is moving down, deaths are the dominant loop.<br>
If the population is constant, the system is in equilibrium.</p>

<h4 id="the-investment-cycle">The Investment cycle</h4>

<p>The legendary <a href="https://medium.com/@raydalio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ray Dalio</a> explains how the economic machine works.</p>

<p>
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PHe0bXAIuk0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>Can you see the loops involved?</p>

<h4 id="shifting-dominance">Shifting dominance</h4>

<p>The loop that’s dominant now, might not be dominant always.</p>

<p>It leads to complexities, since now you’re trying to understand the trend of the system. In money markets, it’s all about the loop dominance — is the market going up or down? When will the dominance change? <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/crypto-slang-lambos-on-the-moon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When moon, when lambo?</a></p>

<p>Who is in control of the system? The better you understand the system, the better you can answer that. The better you know how the system behaves over time, the better off you’ll be.</p>

<h4 id="delays">Delays</h4>

<p>What happens when the feedback is delayed?</p>

<p>Another thought experiment. Imagine you’re a car sales manager. You order new cars every week based on how many cars you need to make 30 total every week. That’s your balancing feedback loop.</p>

<p>You start with a 30 cars. Sell 20 the first week, order 20. Sell 5 the next week, order 5. Sell 15 the next week, order 15. You end up with 30 every week, your expected stock. All’s good.</p>

<p>Things don’t work that way in real life though. There’s a delay between when you order and when the cars come to you. Let’s say it takes a week for the cars to come to you. What happens then?</p>

<p>You start with 30 cars. Sell 20 the first week, order 20. Total cars at 10. Sell 5 the next week, order 25, since you only have 5 cars left. Your 20 order shipment comes in, total at 25. You sell 15, total goes down to 10 and you order 20. The next week, your shipment comes in for the 25 cars. Now you have 35 cars.</p>

<p>See the pattern? It’s an oscillation.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*V_BnGPPmvcYPA4CnG_xfLQ.png" alt=""><em>(Image from Donella Meadows — Thinking in&nbsp;Systems)</em></p>

<p>Does this help you see the systems now? Everything is a system.</p>

<p>Do you get frustrated with fixing the hot-cold level in the bath? That’s a system with delays. You’ve got to wait for the water to get from the geyser to the shower head before making the next decision.</p>

<p>Coming back to the system where it all began for me,</p>

<p>The weight loss system.</p>

<p>Your inputs to the system, the body, is what you eat <strong>and what you don’t eat</strong>.</p>

<p>The output is poop and sweat. Since that’s hard to measure, we use a proxy, the weight of the body as a metric for healthiness. I’ve been tracking my weight everyday for the past few months.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*E_uC6s1vRZY4x849rRsPQg.png" alt=""><em>(The numbers for days: day since&nbsp;birth)</em></p>

<p>There are three ways I’m establishing root cause —</p>

<ol>
  <li>Thought experiments</li>
  <li>Medical research</li>
  <li>Real world experiments</li>
</ol>

<p>The in-depth analysis, working through this feedback loop, how to understand a complex system, <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/understanding-systems.html">I’ll leave for another post</a>.</p>

<p>I’m still figuring things out with my body — over the past year, I got a 4 pack, changed countries, went back to a family pack, and now, with a homely 2 pack — I think weight isn’t the best metric to judge health.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To end, here’s something to think about, linking feedback loops and the 80/20 principle, by <a href="https://amzn.to/2QyIS6I" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard Koch</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>In the absence of feedback loops, the natural distribution of phenomena would be 50/50–inputs of a given frequency would lead to commensurate results. It is only because of positive and negative feedback loops that causes do not have equal results. Yet it also seems to be true that powerful positive feedback loops only affect a small minority of the inputs.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This writing runs on feedback loops.</p>

<p>Our society runs on feedback loops.</p>

<p>Our government, the policies run on feedback loops.</p>

<p>Nature runs on feedback loops.</p>

<p>We run on feedback loops.</p>

<p>Makes sense, right? Since everything is a system.</p>

<p>God...dammit</p>


<p>It's hard to see a child outside today without some kind of iDevice pumping high fidelity 192kbps stereo lossless audio into their shiny white headphones, but <em>BACK IN MY</em> <em>DAY, </em>the iPod hadn't been invented yet. &nbsp;Pickings were slim. &nbsp;Walkmen were outdated, CD players were pricey and would skip if bumped around despite their ESP features, MiniDisk was another stillborn Sony format, and MP3 players were still ugly and ridiculously expensive (at least Apple fixed the ugly part).</p>
<p>Thus, Tiger Electronics, pioneers in the high tech market of McDonald's Happy Meal toys, invented "Hit Clips"</p>
<p><iframe width="584" height="438" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N9pgMmDmd8w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hit Clips were small cheap digital audio players that could play music off of little plastic cartridges. &nbsp;The audio was mono, sounded terrible, and only included a 60 second sample of a song.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="IMG_5621" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621-449x300.jpg 449w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>Better hold on to that patent Tiger...</p>
<p>Still, the songs were officially licensed and included bands like The Backstreet Boys, Aaron Carter, Sugar Ray, and ...Dreamstreet</p>

<p>The 00s were a very strange time for all of us...</p>
<p>Anywho, while helping my 17 year old cousin move some furniture, we came across a large collection of hit clip cartridges, but no player. &nbsp;Struck with a wave of nostalgia, I asked if I could take one to do a tear down.</p>
<p>Thus this post.</p>

<p>The hit clip cartridge has 8 metal contacts on the back:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="IMG_5620" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>Taking it apart, I was hoping to find some identifiable piece of hardware, but instead found the chip-on-board construction that is so popular with super-low-cost low-power electronics along with a few discrete components.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="IMG_5625" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625-449x300.jpg 449w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>Under this blob of epoxy is a wire-bonded chip of silicon. &nbsp;The song is likely hard coded directly into the silicon wafer rather than being programmed there after the fact using flash or OTP memory. &nbsp;It's cheaper that way if you make enough units.</p>
<p>This didn't give me a whole lot to work from, but assuming the capacitor is a bypass capacitor (decent assumption), I at least had some idea of how to power the thing. &nbsp;Poking around for a bit gave me this schematic:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="hitclipschem" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem-300x225.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem-400x300.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>I'm not sure what the two No Connect pins do, but apparently there was a version of the Hit Clip that allowed music to be recorded to special cartridges, so I'm guessing they have something to do with that.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure how much voltage the part needed, but a quick search on Ebay gave me some idea:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay.png"><img loading="lazy" title="ebay" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay.png" alt="" width="720" height="475" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay.png 720w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay-300x197.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay-454x300.png 454w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></a></p>
<p>3 AAAs means 4.5V. &nbsp;Also, can you believe people are bidding $40+ for these things?</p>
<p>Before I could get serious about debugging, I needed some way to connect traces to the board easily. &nbsp;I ended up soldering on some header pins and plugging it into a breadboard:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="IMG_5629" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629-449x300.jpg 449w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>My original assumption was that the bottom-left pin was ground as it connected to the mystery chip more times than the other power-pin. &nbsp;You'll note the scratch-outs indicate that I was wrong. &nbsp;In that configuration, the chip drew 200+mA during the half-second that I left it connected. &nbsp;Presumably there's a reverse bias protection diode that I was blowing up.</p>
<p>Swapping the power pins around, the current started at around 280<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>A before dropping to zero.</p>
<p>Convinced that I had it right, I moved to the other pins. &nbsp;There were four pins to chose from and a voltage measurement showed me that two of them were at the 4.5V rail while the other two were settled close to 0V.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Low</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>High</td>

<tr>
<td>4</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Since I had already identified my two power pins, I had to assume that these four pins were used for data somehow and that the two high pins had internal pull up resistors.</p>
<p>Connecting Pin1 to ground sinks about 12mA from that pin. &nbsp;12mA is much to high to be from a simple pull-up resistor. &nbsp;My guess is that it's some kind of output pin to tell the player that the cartridge is inserted all the way. I decided to leave it alone and move on to Pin 3.</p>
<p>Connecting Pin 3 to ground caused the circuit's current draw to rise from zero up to 300<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>A. Removing this short did nothing to change the current increase although it did settle down after about 60 seconds.</p>

<p>This is when I knew I was on to something. &nbsp;60 seconds of current draw meant that this part was outputting its music sample! &nbsp;I was expecting the player to need to do something more complicated like pull bytes of music off the cartridge over a SPI bus or at least provide a clock source, but it turns out that the cartridge can handle that all by itself. &nbsp;I'm guessing that the two on-board series resistors are used for fine-tuning its internal clock source after the chip has been printed.</p>
<p>I quickly whipped out my oscilloscope and took a trace of Pin 2:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scopetrace.png"><img loading="lazy" title="scopetrace" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scopetrace.png" alt="" width="1191" height="816" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scopetrace.png 1191w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scopetrace-300x205.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scopetrace-1024x701.png 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scopetrace-437x300.png 437w" sizes="(max-width: 1191px) 100vw, 1191px"></a></p>
<p>Data!</p>
<h2>Update</h2>
<p><em>While doing a similar job on a different Hit Clip (Who Let the Dogs Out by the Baha Men), I discovered different behavior. &nbsp;Connecting Pin 3 to ground did nothing while commenting pin 1 to&nbsp;ground toggled between data and no data. &nbsp;I'm not sure if there was a change in the Hit Clip design through generations, or if I took imprecise notes. &nbsp;The PCB layouts of the two clips is clearly different, and it looks like pin 3 is NC on the second clip.</em></p>
<p>I noticed an intermittent square wave with a period of almost exactly 24kHz and a duty cycle that varied with time. &nbsp;Pin 4 had similar data.</p>
<p>So there was definitely something going on here, and it was definitely digital somehow, but I needed some way to capture loads of digital data to later analyze. &nbsp;Fortunately, Santa gave me an 8 bit Saleae logic analyzer for Christmas:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="saleae" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-449x300.jpg 449w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>I actually picked up the Hit Clip while looking for a good project to test this thing out. &nbsp;It's a really nice device, and the Windows/Mac/Linux compatible software is really slick.</p>
<p>Anywho, with the Saleae connected to Pin 2 and Pin 4, I reactivated the circuit and took a trace at a 24MHz sample rate. &nbsp;I came up with this:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace.png"><img loading="lazy" title="saleae trace" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace.png" alt="" width="1647" height="986" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace.png 1647w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace-300x179.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace-1024x613.png 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace-500x300.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1647px) 100vw, 1647px"></a></p>
<p>It was strange at first to see how the two data lines appeared to take turns, but once I remembered that Hit Clips only output in mono, it made a lot more sense. &nbsp;These two lines are encoding the same mono stream of audio.</p>
<p>Looking closer at the low-going blips, I noticed that they were quantized. &nbsp;The length of each blip was always near some integer multiple of 0.3333<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s.</p>
<p>Knowing what I know about audio amplifiers, I theorized that these two outputs are meant to directly drive the push and pull FETs of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-D_amplifier">class D amplifier</a> in real time. &nbsp;In other words, a blip on one line pulls the waveform output voltage up while a blip on the other pulls it down. &nbsp;The width of the blip indicates how hard (or for how long) it pulls.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>Redditor urquan points out that this kind of modulation is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-sigma_modulation">Sigma-Delta Modulation</a>.</p>
<p>While it's technically a digital output, it's encoded in such a way that it can be fed directly into an analog circuit.</p>
<p>I figured that if I could give myself a stream of this data, I could probably simulate the output digitally. &nbsp;To cut down on the number of samples, I exported the trace to a CSV file that only records timestamps when something changes.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-output.png"><img loading="lazy" title="saleae output" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-output.png" alt="" width="534" height="810" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-output.png 534w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-output-197x300.png 197w" sizes="(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px"></a></p>
<p>In order to make use of this data, I just needed to record how much time passed between a signal dropping low and rising up again, and I should have such data points arriving at almost exactly 24kHz. &nbsp;All of the data from one pin was given a positive value while the data from the other pin was given a negative value.</p>
<p>I also tried quantizing the data by dividing the time delays by 0.33333<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s, and while this worked for small numbers, I noticed that some of the larger numbers fell pretty far from a solid integer.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3.png"><img loading="lazy" title="divby3" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3.png" alt="" width="603" height="555" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3.png 603w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3-300x276.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3-325x300.png 325w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px"></a></p>
<p>It looked like 0.33333<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s was a bad estimate of the actual quantization time. &nbsp;Thinking a little more critically, I noticed that a 24kHz wave has a period of 41.67<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s. &nbsp;When divided by my quantization time, this comes out to almost exactly 125 which is pretty darn close to 128, a power of two.</p>
<p>Changing my quantization time to 0.3255<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s or <span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_d7efcee3110178fb773e908bd2b03eda.gif" alt=""></span> yielded much better results:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255.png"><img loading="lazy" title="divby3255" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255.png" alt="" width="603" height="555" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255.png 603w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255-300x276.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255-325x300.png 325w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px"></a></p>
<p>Now the question is what to do with these numbers.</p>
<p>My first attempt involved just pumping them into a WAV file and taking a listen. &nbsp;With this setup, all of the negative numbers were negative points on the waveform. &nbsp;Here's the first 400 samples:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav.png"><img loading="lazy" title="straightwav" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav.png" alt="" width="937" height="523" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav.png 937w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav-300x167.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav-500x279.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 937px) 100vw, 937px"></a></p>
<p>I took these values, gained them up to fill a 16 bit WAV file and took a listen:</p>
<p><audio controls="controls"><source src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support the audio element</audio></p>
<p>Firstly, I was shocked to get anything even closely resembling audio. &nbsp;Especially something so recognizable. &nbsp;That being said, the audio quality isn't the best. &nbsp;The raw values out of the cartridge only extend from around -60 to +60 which leads me to believe that it's encoded as a 7-bit signed integer (-64 to +63). &nbsp;7-bit audio isn't exactly lossless, but I wasn't convinced that this was the best I could do.</p>
<p>I found two problems with the way I was decoding the audio:</p>
<h3>Empty samples</h3>
<p>I noticed looking at the Saleae trace that there were many periods in the 24kHz digital data stream where neither trace showed a blip.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip.png"><img loading="lazy" title="noblip" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip.png" alt="" width="1055" height="905" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip.png 1055w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip-300x257.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip-1024x878.png 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip-349x300.png 349w" sizes="(max-width: 1055px) 100vw, 1055px"></a></p>
<p>Because my script was only looking at the blips, I simply skipped passed these data points. &nbsp;The end result was that the music played slightly faster than it should have. &nbsp;This was obvious when my output WAV file was shorter than my original trace.</p>
<p>I modified the script to detect when more than <span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_e8eaa034768987e29c645972e4862a53.gif" alt=""></span> passed between consecutive blips and interpolate blips at the proper places by just repeating the previous value.</p>
<h3>Push Pull simulation</h3>
<p>I noticed later on that I wasn't really simulating the push-pull driver that the Hit Clip likely used. &nbsp;The digital encoding is actually more of a derivative of the output waveform rather than the waveform itself. &nbsp;In other words, a positive value doesn't guarantee that the output will be positive, but rather that it will have a positive slope. &nbsp;A larger value specifies a larger slope.</p>
<p>I modified my script to keep a running value starting from zero where the incoming value from the cartridge is added to the previous value to generate the next one. &nbsp;There was a problem of DC drift because the values don't all add up to zero. &nbsp;My first time through, I found that the largest value was 1 while the smallest value was somewhere around -50,000 which overflowed my signed 16 bit WAV output.</p>
<p>I solved this by …</p></div></div>

	<p>When I start at a new company, I always do a refresher on my key security.</p>

<p>One thing I always hate about SSH is that the encryption scheme is pretty basic actually, and once your ssh-agent is loaded- anything can just request a sign/authorize.</p>

<p>So, in tried and true “over engineering” fashion, I’ve taken to using my GPG key as my ssh key instead, and using gpg-agent instead of ssh-agent.</p>

<p>Another thing is to use elliptic curves instead of RSA, RSA is still secure, but ECC (ECDSA) is faster and theoretically more resistant, and everything from 2016 onwards supports it, so it’s fair to assume it is supported in my SSH programs of choice. :)</p>

<p>First, to create a ECDSA key we have to use expert mode with the <code>--full-gen-key</code>:</p>

<p>Now we need to add a key which can be used for authorization, for this we can create a subkey, remove the encryption capability and enable the authorization one.<br>
(Failing this, we can ask for setting our own capabilities during the initial key creation above)</p>

<p>Make sure it’s <code>ECC (set your own capabilities)</code> when selecting a key type.</p>

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

<p>And finally we need to tell the gpg-agent which key we want to load, however this is done by using the ‘keygrip’, not the ‘keyID’, you can get the keygrip with the following:</p>

<p>Look for the keygrip which is associated with the <code>[A]</code> capability in my case:</p>

<pre><code>ssb   nistp521 2020-08-16 [A]
      Keygrip = 1DB1E97B20FD54DF2BAB906EA64C30081DEA8C32
</code></pre>

<p>And enable the “A” key by adding it to the bottom of the sshcontrol file:</p>

<pre><code>echo '1DB1E97B20FD54DF2BAB906EA64C30081DEA8C32' &gt; ~/.gnupg/sshcontrol
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p>AWS does not like strong keys, so for AWS I did the same as above but when I added a key for authorization I chose RSA:4096 instead.</p>

<h2 id="background">background</h2>
<p>i bought a macbook pro (16", 2019) in May as my XPS died (motherboard fried maybe?). personally i dont like apple at all, but fuck it, i had never used a mac before, so why not? i really love to try new things</p>
<p>for my experience i am satisfied with my macbook, except for some stupid issues, one of which is what im going to dig into in this article</p>
<p><strong>shutdown/restart hang (caused by a kernel panic)</strong></p>
<p>i found many users have encounterd the (almost) same panic: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/constant-kernel-panics-userspace-watchdog-timeout-no-successful-checkins-from-com-apple-windowserver.2222878/">https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/constant-kernel-panics-userspace-watchdog-timeout-no-successful-checkins-from-com-apple-windowserver.2222878/</a></p>
<p>Also on reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/hwk0o5/how_to_stop_watchdog_timeout_kernel_panics/">it's the exactly same panic</a></p>
<p>if you look at the posts you will find they are actually having different problems except all the problems lead to (the same) watchdog timeout</p>
<p>my panic report looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>panic(cpu 2 caller 0xffffff7f881a1aae): watchdog timeout: no checkins from watchdogd in 302 seconds (11 totalcheckins since monitoring last enabled), shutdown in progress

<p>everytime the hang happens, it eventually gives me a backtrace like this</p>
<p>i called customer service, the friendly tech support suggested that i should reinstall the system (if i cant figure out how to reproduce the panic),
so i erased the partition table and restarted from scratch, then the hang happened again after a few shutdowns</p>
<p>i was really upset, but as i cant reproduce the panic, i cant even ask apple to fix it</p>
<p>then i decided to look into the panic myself</p>
<h2 id="the-backtrace">the backtrace</h2>
<p>the first glance at panic report tells me it might be something wrong with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Management_Controller">SMC</a>, i followed apple's guide to reset SMC, without luck</p>
<p>apple diagnostics reports no issue</p>
<p>so it must be in the kernel right?</p>
<p>lets start reading the backtrace</p>
<p>by reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">Call Stack</a> you will have a basic understanding of how kernel subroutines get executed</p>
<p>so how is it executed? just read from brace bottom to top</p>
<p>first thing first, the panic report only gives me related kernel extensions, to find out exactly what code is causing the panic, we have to get symbols from the kernel (extensions)</p>
<p>we dont need to download anything to debug such a problem, the kernel is installed on our machine, just copy it, along with all the related extensions:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>/System/Library/Kernels/kernel <span># kernel</span>
/System/Library/Kernels/Extensions <span># extensions</span>
</pre></div>
<p>follow <a href="https://www.repleo.nl/wordpress/symbolicate-os-x-kernel-panics-using-lldb/">https://www.repleo.nl/wordpress/symbolicate-os-x-kernel-panics-using-lldb/</a> to locate symbols</p>
<p>the kernel slide bytes, and AppleSMC text base address can be found in the panic report, like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>Kernel slide:     0x0000000007400000

com.apple.driver.AppleSMC(3.1.9)[4589419D-7CCC-39A9-9E2F-F73FE42DD902]@0xffffff7f881a9000-&gt;0xffffff7f881c7fff
</pre></div>
<p><img alt="lldb" src="https://jm33.me/img/mac_panic/lldb.webp"></p>
<p>from this screenshot we can see more clearly about what's going on, the backtrace tree is now symbolicated</p>
<h2 id="lets-reverse-some-code">lets reverse some code</h2>
<p>as far as i know AppleSMC kext is proprietary, the only way to know what it does is to reverse it</p>
<p>from lldb, we dont see anything worthy of reversing, its just a watchdog timeout call</p>
<p>anyways, AppleSMC module seems interesting, lets reverse it</p>
<p>after loading the AppleSMC binary, we have to rebase the binary so it matches the address at runtime: Edit, segment, rebase program</p>
<p>press G then paste the address <code>0xffffff7f881b6d9c</code>, we get:</p>

<p>I don't think the <code>while (1)</code> loop is ever going to end. When <code>thread_policy_set</code> fails, it enters the loop and never breaks out.</p>
<p><code>v13</code> represents 1 sec I think. Basically this loop puts a mutex io lock, then feeds watchdog (when the timer pointer plus 248 is null or whatever), finally it sleeps for 1 sec, repeats the loop.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!*</span><span>((</span><span>_BYTE</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span>this</span> <span>+</span> <span>248</span><span>))</span>
    <span>IOWatchdog</span><span>::</span><span>checkWatchdog</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>);</span>
</pre></div>
<p>When it stops feeding the watchdog, watchdog timeouts after about 3 min, hence the panic.</p>
<h2 id="whats-watchdog">whats watchdog</h2>
<p>from <code>man watchdogd</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>watchdogd ensures that the system is healthy and able to make forward progress throughout the system lifecycle.
    If watchdogd or the Watchdog KEXT determine that the system is unhealthy they will attempt to take corrective action and ultimately may panic the system to get it back to a usable state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, in the case of the Linux operating system, a user-space watchdog daemon may simply kick the watchdog periodically without performing any tests. As long as the daemon runs normally, the system will be protected against serious system crashes such as a kernel panic. To detect less severe faults, the daemon[4] can be configured to perform tests that cover resource availability (e.g., sufficient memory and file handles, reasonable CPU time), evidence of expected process activity (e.g., system daemons running, specific files being present or updated), overheating, and network activity, and system-specific test scripts or programs may also be run.[5]</p>
<p>Upon discovery of a failed test, the Linux watchdog daemon may attempt to perform a software-initiated restart, which can be preferable to a hardware reset as the file systems will be safely unmounted and fault information will be logged. However it is essential to have the insurance of the hardware timer as a software restart can fail under a number of fault conditions. In effect, this is a dual-stage watchdog with the software restart comprising the first stage and the hardware reset the second stage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>from my understanding, <code>SMCWatchDogTimer</code> stopped kicking watchdog somehow (at <code>IOLockUnlock()</code>), then watchdog realizes <code>AppleSMC</code> might be dead, it initiates a panic, reboot and throw the panic report to user</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="850" height="480" src="https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/free-college-pros-vs-cons-850x480.png" alt="Should college be free: the pros and the cons." srcset="https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/free-college-pros-vs-cons-850x480.png 850w, https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/free-college-pros-vs-cons-600x340.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 25vw, 850px"></figure>
<p>Did you know that there is free college education in <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/countries-with-free-college">25 countries</a> and at least <a href="https://studyabroadaide.com/free-universities-united-states/">20 U.S. schools and universities</a>?</p>
<p>However, tuition-free college is still debated on the federal level, and the question remains on the table.</p>
<p>So, <strong>what are the arguments for and against tuition-free college?</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a list of the weightiest arguments and an in-depth analysis of their validity.</p>
<h2>Pro 1: It’s more affordable for students.</h2>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="850" height="480" src="https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/college-more-affordable-850x480.png" alt="College is more affordable." srcset="https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/college-more-affordable-850x480.png 850w, https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/college-more-affordable-600x340.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 25vw, 850px"></figure>
<p>One argument in favor of tuition-free college is that college is out of reach for many Americans.</p>
<ul><li><strong>True</strong>: At least 71% of adults find it <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/2012/05/17/college-graduation-weighing-the-cost-and-the-payoff/?PublicationID=2261">more difficult to pay tuition</a> than it was for their parents’ generation. </li><li><strong>True</strong>: College costs increase <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/07/24/price-of-college-increasing-almost-8-times-faster-than-wages/">more than 7 times</a> faster than salaries.</li><li><strong>True</strong>: More than 60 percent of college students have taken out student loans.</li><li><strong>False</strong>: In 2020, college students spent <a href="https://www.lexingtonlaw.com/blog/credit-cards/college-student-spending-habits.html#:~:text=College%20students%20spend%20a%20combined,billion%20on%20personal%20care%20products.">$21 billion</a> on clothing and shoes plus $15 billion on personal care products.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Takeaway: </strong>For most Americans, the cost of college tuition is not affordable. However, college students in the US overspend billions on non-essentials.</p>
<h2>Con 1: Not enough jobs for college graduates.</h2>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="850" height="480" src="https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/college-graduate-not-enough-jobs-850x480.png" alt="There are not enough jobs for college graduates." srcset="https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/college-graduate-not-enough-jobs-850x480.png 850w, https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/college-graduate-not-enough-jobs-600x340.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 25vw, 850px"></figure>
<p>One argument against free college is that it is a job requirement. Now that there aren’t enough jobs to accommodate every graduate, why offer free college education for everyone?</p>
<ul><li><strong>True</strong>: Too many college graduates have diplomas that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/jan/25/too-many-graduates-are-mismatched-to-their-jobs-whats-going-wrong">do not match</a> job opportunities.</li><li><strong>True</strong>: At least 43% of US college graduates are <a href="https://whattobecome.com/blog/college-graduates-unemployment-rate/">underemployed</a> in their first jobs.</li><li><strong>False</strong>: Many colleges prepare students for jobs that <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/making-sense/how-colleges-are-preparing-students-for-jobs-that-dont-exist-yet">don’t exist</a> in the present, including robotics, artificial intelligence, and telemedicine.</li><li><strong>False</strong>: College education is not only about preparing for careers. It’s also about learning communication, empathy, money management, and so on.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Takeaway: </strong>Aside from offering free college to all, there is a need to implement better job prediction, job-matching, and enrolment choice as well as to create a healthier economy that increases job opportunities.</p>
<h2><strong>Pro 2:</strong> It’s an important basic need.</h2>

<p>If we view higher education as a fundamental right, some college options would have to be free of charge and funded by the taxpayers.</p>
<ul><li><strong>True</strong>: Higher education has become more important due to rapid industrialization and technological innovations. More jobs in the near future will <a href="https://georgetown.app.box.com/s/tll0zkxt0puz45hu21g6">require college-educated workers</a>.</li><li><strong>True</strong>: Free-tuition colleges nationwide can help students who most need financial help, as well as states that need to have a skilled workforce.</li><li><strong>False</strong>: Other basic <a href="https://www.gettingsmart.com/2018/10/students-basic-needs-must-be-met-before-they-can-learn-deeply/">needs must be met</a> before students can learn effectively, such as nutrition, exercise, transportation, and <a href="https://www.kellymentalhealth.com/thoughts/student-success-the-importance-of-having-your-basic-needs-met">neighborhood environments</a>.</li><li><strong>False</strong>: A steady source of income is more important than free college tuition.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: Free college tuition is not the most important of all basic human needs.</p>
<h2>Con 2: The government cannot afford it.</h2>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="850" height="480" src="https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/cost-of-education-is-too-high-850x480.png" alt="The government cannot afford free college for all." srcset="https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/cost-of-education-is-too-high-850x480.png 850w, https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/cost-of-education-is-too-high-600x340.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 25vw, 850px"></figure>
<p>Another argument against offering free college nationwide is that it will require a huge amount of money that the government doesn’t have.</p>
<ul><li><strong>True</strong>: Eliminating tuition at all public colleges and universities would cost at least $79 billion a year, according to a <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_333.10.asp?current=yes">Department of Education</a> report, and taxpayers would need to foot the bill.</li><li><strong>True</strong>: America must meet repayment schedules for its foreign debt, such as $1.18 trillion to China, $1.03 trillion to Japan, Brazil, Ireland, the U.K., <a href="https://www.itsuptous.org/blog/who-does-us-owe-money-to">and others</a>.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>False</strong>: Only <a href="https://www.nzpuss.hr/an-indepth-look-at-a-list-of-countries-by-education-budget/">5.4%</a> of America’s GDP goes to education. The US public education budget is more than<a href="https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=66"> $700 billion</a> or about<a href="https://www.nzpuss.hr/education-is-the-key-to-success/"> $11,825.89</a> per student.</li><li><strong>False</strong>: There’s money set aside for higher education every year. For 2020, the US government already allocated approximately <a href="https://www.usgovernmentspending.com/us_education_spending_20.html">$8.12 trillion</a> for higher education.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Takeaway: </strong>The government has the money to fund tuition-free college for all.</p>
<h2>Pro 3: It improves academic output.</h2>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="850" height="480" src="https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/more-research-is-needed-850x480.png" alt="It improves academic input." srcset="https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/more-research-is-needed-850x480.png 850w, https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/more-research-is-needed-600x340.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 25vw, 850px"></figure>
<p>Another common discussion is that forgiving all student debts will improve academic output of current and future students.&nbsp;</p>
<ul><li><strong>True</strong>: There will be fewer working students and more graduates. College students working more than 20 hours a week are <a href="https://www.prb.org/us-college-attainment/">less likely</a> to earn a degree in six years.</li><li><strong>True</strong>: More students will complete college degrees. For instance, those who enroll at a for-profit institution are 59 percent <a href="https://www.prb.org/us-college-attainment/">less likely</a> to earn a degree compared to those who enroll in public institutions.</li><li><strong>False</strong>: Free tuition is not the primary factor in academic performance. The strongest factors of student achievement include <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/books_teacher_quality_execsum_intro/">teacher quality</a>, quality of teaching environment, and materials, as well as physical and mental <a href="https://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/learning/7-important-factors-that-may-affect-the-learning-process/6064">student health</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>False</strong>: Loan forgiveness is not proven to affect academic output. There are existing loan-forgiveness programs based on <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-driven">income-driven repayment</a> plans and, “depending on the plan, remaining loans are forgiven at the end of a 20- or 25-year period,” says an <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/07/10/738506646/student-debt-forgiveness-sounds-good-what-might-happen-if-the-government-did-it">NPR report</a>.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: Free tuition and loan forgiveness are not proven to improve academic performance and output. Other elements strongly affect education quality.</p>
<h2>Con 3: State schools will spend less per student.</h2>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="850" height="480" src="https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bad-schools-850x480.png" alt="Free education worsens our schools." srcset="https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bad-schools-850x480.png 850w, https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bad-schools-600x340.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 25vw, 850px"></figure>
<p>There are growing concerns that a combination of federal and local tax dollars will decrease per-student support, which is not the goal.</p>
<ul><li><strong>True</strong>: State subsidies can motivate state institutions to spend less on each student.</li><li><strong>True</strong>: Many for-profit colleges are under large, publicly-traded companies that game the Federal financial aid system by socializing losses and privatizing profits.</li><li><strong>False</strong>: Institutional <a href="https://blog.prepscholar.com/checks-and-balances-definition-examples">checks and balances</a> can curb any discovered abuses and ensure fiscal responsibility.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: Public accountability will ensure that tax dollars provided to free colleges will be maximized. At the same time, issues of education output quality, cost transparency, and corruption must be addressed.</p>
<h2><strong>Pro 4: It can jumpstart the economy.</strong></h2>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="850" height="480" src="https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/economic-growth-850x480.png" alt="More education would be a boost to our economy." srcset="https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/economic-growth-850x480.png 850w, https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/economic-growth-600x340.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 25vw, 850px"></figure>
<p>One argument in favor of free college at the national level is that forgiving all student loans can revitalize the economy.&nbsp; The $1.6 trillion federal student loan debt is “about twice the current budget for the Defense Department and around 22 times the budget for the Education Department,” says an <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/07/10/738506646/student-debt-forgiveness-sounds-good-what-might-happen-if-the-government-did-it">NPR report</a>.</p>
<ul><li><strong>True</strong>: Improving economic performance is a key reason why countries <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/education-training-advantages.asp">use tax revenues</a> to pay for basic education. College-educated workers have advanced literacy and critical thinking skills.</li><li><strong>True</strong>: In the long term, it can also <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/07/10/738506646/student-debt-forgiveness-sounds-good-what-might-happen-if-the-government-did-it">decrease unemployment</a> by creating up to 1.5 million jobs a year and increase America’s GDP by up to $108 billion a year.</li><li><strong>False</strong>: Cancelling the student loan debt of all 45 million borrowers can motivate students to borrow more knowing that it will be wiped clean by the government or give them potentially <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2019/12/03/student-loans-debt-forgiven-impact/#ab2015874e94">higher leverage</a>.</li><li><strong>False</strong>: In the next 10 years, the five fastest-growing jobs in the USA will earn an average of $24,000 a year and <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/ecopro.pdf">will not require</a> four-year college diplomas: solar panel installers, wind turbine technicians, home health aides, personal care aides, and occupational therapy assistants.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: Forgiving all college student loan debts can jumpstart the economy. At the same time, there are other high wage-earning options that do not require four-year college degrees.</p>
<h2>Con 4: Education will be devalued.</h2>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="850" height="480" src="https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/useless-degrees-850x480.png" alt="Free college = useless degrees?" srcset="https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/useless-degrees-850x480.png 850w, https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/useless-degrees-600x340.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 25vw, 850px"></figure>
<p>Yet another argument is that offering free education to young people will be a waste of money because they’re less likely to take it seriously.</p>
<ul><li><strong>True</strong>: Free tuition addresses the price of college attendance but does not improve teaching <a href="https://econfip.org/policy-brief/the-economics-of-free-college/">quality</a>. In fact, free tuition without a budget to add resources to colleges with increased enrollment can lower education quality.</li><li><strong>True</strong>: Students who don’t pay for college are not worried about the effects of <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/datastory/chronicabsenteeism.html">skipping classes</a>, not completing a course, or of dropping out of college.</li><li><strong>True</strong>: Free college can decrease persistence and success. In challenging or rigorous classes, many avoid failure by withdrawing, which requires payment to repeat a course. If tuition is free, there’s <a href="https://nortonnorris.com/free-college-bad-idea/">no incentive to finish</a> what they start.</li><li><strong>False</strong>: Degrees with guaranteed job placement have a high value.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Takeaway: </strong>Price is not the only value element of free college education, so its devaluation is unlikely. However, issues of education quality, persistence to completion, and job closures must be addressed.</p>
<h2>Pro 5: <strong>It improves workforce competencies.</strong></h2>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="850" height="480" src="https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/better-workforce-850x480.png" alt="Better education, better workforce" srcset="https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/better-workforce-850x480.png 850w, https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/better-workforce-600x340.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 25vw, 850px"></figure>
<p>Another argument for free college is that it is now a requirement for most jobs, so much so that people use up their savings and even assume massive debts to get a college degree.</p>
<ul><li><strong>True</strong>: The value of college degrees has changed along with changes in technology, the economy, and lifestyles. Now, it’s easier to get a <a href="https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/3pathways/">steady, decent-paying job</a> with a college degree.</li><li><strong>True</strong>: A high-quality free college education can teach values, ethics, critical thinking, abstract problem-solving, and “learn how to learn,” an increasingly important skill in times of <a href="https://econfip.org/policy-brief/the-economics-of-free-college/">rapid change</a>. Technological change will make these skills <a href="https://econfip.org/policy-brief/the-economics-of-free-college/">more valuable</a> than ever.</li><li><strong>True</strong>: Year on year, bachelor’s degree holders can earn at least<a href="http://www.aplu.org/projects-and-initiatives/college-costs-tuition-and-financial-aid/publicuvalues/employment-earnings.html"> $32,000 more</a> than those with a high school diploma.</li><li><strong>False</strong>: Employers say that students are <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/employee-relations/pages/employers-say-students-arent-learning-soft-skills-in-college.aspx">not learning</a> soft skills and workplace competencies in college. It takes<a href="https://www.aacu.org/publications-research/periodicals/it-takes-more-major-employer-priorities-college-learning-and"> more than a major</a> to be prepared for the job market. In fact, skills training <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/10/why-skills-training-cant-replace-higher-education">cannot replace</a> higher education.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Takeaway: </strong>Although tuition-free college can improve workplace competencies, a college degree does not always guarantee a job or significant wealth.</p>
<h2>Con 5: Tuition isn’t the only barrier to college education.</h2>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="850" height="480" src="https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/college-is-not-for-everyone-850x480.png" alt="College is not for everyone." srcset="https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/college-is-not-for-everyone-850x480.png 850w, https://salarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/college-is-not-for-everyone-600x340.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 25vw, 850px"></figure>
<p>One significant argument in this list of cons is that free tuition does not address the most significant barriers to college education.</p>
<ul><li><strong>True</strong>: The<a href="http://www.ihep.org/sites/default/files/uploads/docs/pubs/ihep_advocacy_nontuition_costs_v7_web.pdf"> non-tuition costs</a> of food, clothing, housing, transportation, and personal expenses increase the cost of college from 50% to 80%. Surveys show that about 58,000 college students are food insecure and homeless.</li><li><strong>True</strong>: The financial aid application <a href="https://www.theedadvocate.org/financial-aid-complicated/">process is complex</a> for many students. Federal financial aid, grant awards, and loan eligibility standards cannot be <a href="https://www.educationnext.org/dont-ruin-college-by-making-it-free-threats-quality-innovation/">easily retrieved anytime</a> from a website by every potential college student.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: To ensure the viability of a national tuition-free college program, many other barriers to a college diploma should be directly addressed.</p>

<p>Landfill is an interesting product. The price fluctuates far enough that it can fluctuate from positive to negative and back again. If someone is building a tunnel, you can probably get paid to <i>take</i> landfill. If someone is building an island, you can probably get paid for <i>supplying</i> landfill. There are projects that can only go ahead at certain times: the Hornsby quarry remediation project was only viable because the north connex was being built.</p><p>That's slightly obscure, and there's not much you can do with landfill other than, well, fill land. But we are about to hit a very unusual combination of circumstances which will create some head-scratching economics.</p><p>Solar panels are getting cheaper. The learning rate for solar energy is (probably) the steepest of any energy technology yet deployed. So we can be pretty much assured that within the next decade we'll have enough solar power to power anything we want (as long as it is day time). We'll overprovision our houses and factories (and offices if they still exist) with generation capacity so that in the morning or evening when the sun is hitting at an oblique angle, we still have enough for our needs.</p><p>That means that at peak times, we'll have <i>more</i> than enough solar energy. What do we do with that surplus energy?</p><p>Actually, it's slightly worse than that, because there are some (non-renewable) power plants that can't fully idle. A nuclear reactor can't fully turn off for a few minutes in the middle of the day. Neither can a coal power plant. So they will be running at a time when nobody has a need for power. That may be OK -- if you make a lot of money generating power overnight, you might be prepared to pay some small penalties during the day for overproduction if that's what it takes to keep the system running.</p><p>Which means that someone, somewhere is going to get paid to create a dummy electrical load. We've never (as far as I can tell) seen "grid stability" <i>payments</i> <i>for</i> <i>using</i>&nbsp;electricity before. But it's the inevitable conclusion of where we are the moment: discounted rates for consumers who can change their requirements to help with grid stability exist already; there's no reason that this wouldn't still be necessary when the price of electricity hits zero.</p><p>Therfore, there will be times of the day (in certain weather conditions) when some companies will get <i>paid</i> to use electricity.</p><p>The kinds of consumers that will get paid are likely to be doing something that is energy inefficient (obviously), and not particularly capital intensive (since their equipment will be idle a lot of the time), and making something that can be stored indefinitely (because you definitely can't do just-in-time manufacturing if you are waiting for times when the price for electricity goes negative). But quite a lot of products could be made to fit that.</p><p>A possible product that I think is likely to play out this way is water desalination. Desalinated water is very expensive because of the embedded energy cost: it's often described as "bottled electricity". Currently we tend to use reverse osmosis because it's more energy efficient; but if you don't have to worry about energy costs, you might choose instead to boil water and distil it: since the capital costs are cheaper.</p><p>Now things get even weirder. Let's say you are getting paid 0.5c per kWH (a not unreasonable price) that you use. You might find that you can sell the water for -0.01c per kL. Yes, you can make a profit: not just giving it away, but you could still be profitable while paying someone to consume it.</p><p>If this all plays out, we might have water and electricity (at times) having a negative price. These are common inputs to other processes, so it doesn't end there: there might be a business that requires water and electricity occasionally, but the input costs normally make the business unviable. They in turn might be able to make some money selling the end product at a negative price if their inputs have a negative price.</p><p>If this sounds all a bit unbelievable, remember that up until very recently, many economists thought that it was impossible to have negative interest rates... right up until the moment when they started happening. We already have examples of products that oscillate between positive and negative prices, it's just that they were never fundamental inputs to other processes. My prediction is that by 2030 we will have a small part of the economy ticking away profitably making negative price products.</p><p>(Post scriptum: now for the completely weird: how do negative price products interact with negative interest rates?)</p>

September 27, 2020 | https://picolisp.com/wiki/?PilBox | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://picolisp.com/wiki/?PilBox">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><h2>PilBox - Building Android Apps in PicoLisp</h2>
<p><b>Build your Apps in PicoLisp without an Android SDK</b></p><p>
PilBox ("PicoLisp Box") is a generic Android App which allows to write Apps in
pure PicoLisp, without touching Java, and without the need of an Android SDK.</p><p>
You do not need to root your device. And - if you prefer - you do not need a
separate development machine (PC or laptop): All can be done in a terminal on
the device, and even in a Lisp REPL while the App is running.</p><p>
Note: <b>PilBox needs Android &gt;= 5.0!</b></p><p>
It comes with PicoLisp binaries for Arm64 pre-installed. If your device has an
Arm32 CPU, you can - after installing the PilBox App but before starting it -
download and install the emulator version <a href="https://software-lab.de/arm32.zip">https://software-lab.de/arm32.zip</a>.
If this was done by mistake, you can revert to Arm64 binaries with
<a href="https://software-lab.de/arm64.zip">https://software-lab.de/arm64.zip</a>.</p><h3>How does it work?</h3><p>
The PilBox App itself (called the "PilBox kernel") is written in Java, the
normal Android way. It displays a WebView GUI, and starts a PicoLisp <b>binary</b>
compiled for Arm64 CPUs. This binary may now run any PicoLisp program, by
setting up a local web server where the WebView component connects to, possibly
opening a database, and doing whatever is desired.</p><p>
The PilBox kernel provides an interface to the Android Java runtime environment.
To the PicoLisp code it looks like a remote database, where Java objects are
mapped to PicoLisp DB objects, and Java functions and methods are executed via
remote procedure calls.</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/457.d" alt="PilBox.png"></p><p>
If a ZIP file is passed to the PilBox kernel upon start-up, it is unpacked, and
may override or extend whatever is installed already. This is done typically by
clicking on a downloaded ZIP, or by "sharing" it from some other App.</p><p>
Then it looks for a file "App.l" in the App's working directory, <span>load</span>s it,
and listens at the port number found in a file "Port". Out of the box, "Port" is
8081, and "App.l" is a meta-App which provides a convenient runtime environment
for managing Apps installed via the ZIP mechanism.</p><h3>Getting started</h3><p>
You can download the PilBox App from Google Play store, or get it directly from
<a href="https://software-lab.de/pilBox.apk">https://software-lab.de/pilBox.apk</a>. In the latter case, you may need to
enable "Unknown Sources" in your settings.</p><p>
To try the examples in this article, download these files:
</p><ul>
   <li><a href="https://software-lab.de/hello.zip">https://software-lab.de/hello.zip</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://software-lab.de/calc.zip">https://software-lab.de/calc.zip</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://software-lab.de/demo.zip">https://software-lab.de/demo.zip</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://software-lab.de/crash.zip">https://software-lab.de/crash.zip</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://software-lab.de/radio.zip">https://software-lab.de/radio.zip</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://software-lab.de/browser.zip">https://software-lab.de/browser.zip</a></li>
</ul><p>
<span>pilBox.apk</span> contains the PilBox kernel App as an APK ("Android Package"), and
the ZIP files are small demo applications.</p><p>
Then go to Apps -&gt; PilBox -&gt; Permissions and enable "Location" and "Storage".</p><h3>The pre-installed generic App</h3><p>
Initially, when started without any ZIP file, the PilBox kernel shows an empty
white screen with a PicoLisp logo on the top-left and a settings icon on the
top-right (the screenshots were taken on a tablet, so on a phone the proportions
may differ):</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/426.d" alt="emptyPilBox.png"></p><h4>The REPL</h4><p>
If you tap on the PicoLisp logo on the left, it opens a REPL (Read-Eval-Print
Loop) - a kind of terminal window into the App:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/430.d" alt="repl1.png"></p><p>
The REPL gives you control over many aspects of the App. It has a large text
field for displaying results and editing text, a single-line text field at the
bottom for command input, and the three buttons "Eval", "Edit" and "Clear
Cache".</p><p>
The main purpose is to enter commands, and look at their results in the text
area. As the "Eval" button is the first on the page, it is implicitly activated
if you hit <span>Enter</span> when typing a command.</p><p>
As a special case, if a command starts with a dollar-sign:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/431.d" alt="repl2.png"></p><p>
it is taken as a Shell command, here <span>ls -l</span>, and shows the listing in the text
area:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/432.d" alt="repl3.png"></p><p>
Otherwise (not starting with a dollar-sign), the command line is evaluated as a
Lisp expression. For example, after typing <span>(pp 'gps)</span>, we get:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/433.d" alt="repl4.png"></p><p>
If you type a file or path name like <span>App.l</span> in the command line,</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/434.d" alt="repl5.png"></p><p>
and press the "Edit" button, the file is opened in the text area and may be
edited:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/435.d" alt="repl6.png"></p><p>
Press the "Done" button to close the file again.</p><p>
The "Clear Cache" button invalidates the <span>WebView</span> cache, and is useful after
changing an App's CSS file.</p><p>
Tapping on the PicoLisp logo takes you back to the start screen.</p><p>
Normally, you won't edit your App's sources in the REPL, but instead edit them
in a terminal program like <span>Termux</span> with <span>vim</span> or <span>emacs</span>, and pass them as a
ZIP file to PilBox as described below.</p><h4>Settings</h4><p>
If you tap on the settings icon on the right of the start screen, it opens a
default settings page. Initially it shows two tabs, one with all standard
PicoLisp localizations</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/436.d" alt="settings1.png"></p><p>
and one listing the installed PILs (PicoLisp Apps):</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/437.d" alt="settings2.png"></p><p>
Initially the list is empty.</p><p>
The REPL behavior and the default settings page are normally overridden by
installed Apps, and are available only on the start screen.</p><h3>Installing your own App(s)</h3><p>
The empty PilBox kernel is not very useful, except for perhaps exploring the App
environment in the REPL.</p><p>
To install your own App, prepare a ZIP file with a directory containing
</p><ul>
   <li>One or more <span>*.l</span> Lisp files, where one of them must be named <span>App.l</span></li>
   <li>Optionally a CSS file named <span>lib.css</span></li>
   <li>Optionally an icon in a file named <span>logo.png</span></li>
   <li>Optionally a directory called <span>loc/</span> with localizations</li>
</ul><p>
The file <span>App.l</span> is mandatory, and is <span>load</span>ed to start the App. If one of the
<span>*.l</span> files is named <span>settings.l</span>, then it overrides the behavior of the
settings icon while this App is active.</p><p>
The first Lisp expression in <span>App.l</span> is <span>read</span> in, and should be a string
giving the App's name.</p><p>
You pass your ZIP file to the PilBox kernel by "sharing" it from another App
(e.g. the "Downloads" App). As I use the <span>Termux</span> App for local development, I
usually generate the ZIP file directly on the device, pass it to the
<span>termux-share</span> utility, using the world-readable <span>storage</span> area:
</p><pre>   $ zip -rFS ~/storage/downloads/myApp.zip myApp/
   $ termux-share ~/storage/downloads/myApp.zip
</pre><p>

When the PilBox kernel starts, it scans all top-level directories for other
files named "App.l". Each of those directories is taken as a PIL App. If only a
single one is found, it is started immediately, otherwise a list of buttons with
the App names is displayed.</p><h3>Hello World</h3><p>
For a minimal example for a PIL App, look at
<a href="https://software-lab.de/hello.zip">https://software-lab.de/hello.zip</a>. It consists of a directory <span>hello/</span> with
a single file <span>App.l</span>. This file contains:
</p><pre>   "Hello World"

   (menu "Hello World!"
      (&lt;h1&gt; "center blue" "Hello World!") )
</pre><p>

The first line gives the App's name, and the <span>menu</span> expression displays a
header line in blue with "Hello World!".</p><p>
If you pass this ZIP to the PilBox kernel, it immediately shows this screen
(because it is the first and only App installed so far):</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/440.d" alt="helloApp.png"></p><p>
A tap on the PicoLisp icon has no effect now (we are no longer on the PilBox
kernel start screen), but the settings page is still the default one. If we open
the "PILs" tab, we see that there is a single package "PIL-hello" installed:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/441.d" alt="helloSettings.png"></p><h3>Calculator</h3><p>
Let's move on to something more interesting than the obligatory "Hello World".
The package </p><li><a href="https://software-lab.de/calc.zip">https://software-lab.de/calc.zip</a></li><p> contains a calculator App.</p><p>
After we pass it to the PilBox, the start screen now shows <i>two</i> Apps:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/443.d" alt="calcPilBox.png"></p><p>
The calculator can be started by hitting the topmost button:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/445.d" alt="calculator.png"></p><p>
Play with it around a little. It employs PicoLisp's big numbers, so it can only
handle integers (of unlimited size though).</p><p>
If we go to the "PILs" tab in the settings, we see that now there are two
packages,</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/447.d" alt="settings3.png"></p><p>
and clicking on the "PIL-calc" link lists the package's contents:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/450.d" alt="pil-calc.png"></p><p>
The back-arrow brings you back to the "PILs" tab.</p><p>
Enabling the checkboxes in the "PILs" tab allows for the removal of the selected
packages. It removes <i>all</i> files in the package, so it must be handled with
care!</p><p>
The PilBox kernel start screen can be reached by clicking on the PicoLisp icon.
There we can also get to the REPL again.</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/451.d" alt="repl7.png"></p><h3>The Demo App</h3><p>
Finally, there is <a href="https://software-lab.de/demo.zip">https://software-lab.de/demo.zip</a>, an extensive but rather
silly Demo App. It contains examples for conventional GUI components, as they
are needed in database applications,</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/452.d" alt="demoFields.png"></p><p>
but also or accessing the Android toolbox, like taking pictures or scanning
QR-Codes, reading GPS coordinates, and posting notifications:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/454.d" alt="demoNotify.png"></p><p>
Feel free to install it, play around, and study the code.</p><h3>Using the Android API</h3><p>
PilBox is only useful if it can communicate with the Android API on the device.
Therefore, it loads the Android library "lib/android.l" in the PicoLisp
distribution (which in turn is built upon the Java reflection API).</p><p>
The central function in "lib/android.l" is <span>java</span>. It maps Lisp function calls
to the Java virtual machine, supporting eight types of calls:
</p><pre>   (java "cls" 'T ['any ..]) -&gt; obj       New object
   (java 'obj 'msg ['any ..]) -&gt; any      Send message to object
   (java 'obj "fld" ["fld" ..]) -&gt; any    Value of object field
   (java "cls" 'msg ['any ..]) -&gt; any     Call method in class
   (java "cls" "fld" ["fld" ..]) -&gt; any   Value of class field
   (java T "cls" ["cls" ..]) -&gt; obj       Define interface
   (java 'obj) -&gt; [lst ..]                Reflect object
   (java "cls") -&gt; cls                    Get class
</pre><p>

Depending on the type of the first one or two arguments (transient symbol,
internal symbol, or <span>T</span>) it behaves differently.</p><p>
This is not trivial, and requires some understanding of the Java side. For
example, to aquire a <span>WakeLock</span>, Java code samples do
</p><pre>   PowerManager powerManager = (PowerManager)getSystemService(POWER_SERVICE);
   WakeLock wakeLock = powerManager.newWakeLock(PowerManager.PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK, "MyWakelockTag");
   wakeLock.acquire();
</pre><p>

To implement the same in PicoLisp, we must first look up the constant values
<span>POWER_SERVICE</span> and <span>PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK</span>. They are found in
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#POWER_SERVICE">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#POWER_SERVICE</a>
as "power" and in
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager.html#PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager.html#PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK</a>
as 1. With that, the corresponding Lisp code is:
</p><pre>   (java
      (java (java CONTEXT 'getSystemService "power") 'newWakeLock 1 "MyWakelockTag")
      'acquire )
</pre><p>

The gobal constant <span>CONTEXT</span> is defined in …</p></div></div>

	<p>Data backups are an inglorious but vital part of IT operations. They are most challenging in “big data” deployments, such as analytical databases. This article will explore the plumbing involved in backing up ClickHouse and introduce the clickhouse-backup tool for automating the process.</p><p>The <a href="https://altinity.com/webinarspage/2020/04/29/strength-in-numbers-introduction-to-clickhouse-cluster-performance">native replication support built into ClickHouse</a> provides high availability and resilience against individual node failures. However, rare disaster scenarios may require recovering data from backups. These include data corruption and the failure of all replicas in a shard or cluster.</p><p>A critical component of any ClickHouse backup scheme is “freezing” tables. As with all databases, consistent backups depend on ClickHouse being in a “quiesced” state. Instead of having to halt the database entirely, ClickHouse has native support for “freezing” tables for backup or migration. This is a no-downtime operation.</p><p><h2>Manual Backups in Four Easy Steps</h2>
</p><p>ClickHouse includes native support for instantaneous point-in-time backups, through its ‘ALTER TABLE… FREEZE’ feature.</p><div><ol>
<li>Confirm your shadow directory is empty:<strong><br></strong><code>ls /var/lib/clickhouse/shadow/</code></li>
<li>Ask ClickHouse to freeze your table:<br><code>echo -n 'alter table events freeze' | clickhouse-client</code></li>
<li>Save your backup in case of disaster:<br><code>cd /var/lib/clickhouse/<br>sudo mkdir backup<br>sudo cp -r shadow/ backup/my-backup-name</code></li>
<li>Finally, clean up the backup source for next time:<br><code>sudo rm -rf /var/lib/clickhouse/shadow/*</code></li>
</ol>
</div><p>ClickHouse uses filesystem hard links to achieve instantaneous backups with no downtime (or locking) for ClickHouse services. These hard links can be further leveraged for efficient backup storage. On filesystems that support hard links, such as local filesystems or NFS, use cp with the -l flag (or rsync with the –hard-links and –numeric-ids flags) to avoid copying data.&nbsp;</p><p>When hard links are utilized, storage on disk is much more efficient. Because they rely on hard links, each backup is effectively a “full” backup, even though duplicate use of disk space is avoided.</p><p><h5>Test Your Backup</h5>
</p><p>It is rightly said that a backup is worthless if the restoration process hasn’t been tested. Perform regular test restores to ensure your data will be there when you need it.</p><p>Here are the steps for manual recovery:</p><div><ol>
<li>Drop your test table, or find another server for testing.</li>
<li>Create your test table for recovery:<br><code>cat events.sql | clickhouse-client</code></li>
<li>Copy your backup to the table’s `detached` directory:<br><code>cd /var/lib/clickhouse<br>sudo cp -rl backup/my-backup-name/* data/default/events/detached/</code></li>
<li>Attach the detached parts:<br><code>echo 'alter table events attach partition 202006' | clickhouse-client</code></li>
<li>Confirm your data has been restored:<br><code>echo 'select count() from events' | clickhouse-client</code></li>
</ol>
</div><p><h2>Automate the Backup Process with <code>clickhouse-backup</code></h2>
</p><p>The clickhouse-backup tool, created by <a href="https://github.com/AlexAkulov">Alex Akulov</a>, helps to automate the manual steps above: <a href="https://github.com/AlexAkulov/clickhouse-backup">https://github.com/AlexAkulov/clickhouse-backup</a>.  We like clickhouse-backup and have implemented several new features, which are described here for the first time. </p><p>To get started you’ll need to install <code>clickhouse-backup</code>.  Full instructions are in the <a href="https://github.com/AlexAkulov/clickhouse-backup/blob/master/ReadMe.md">ReadMe.md</a> file.  Here’s an example of installation from a tarball. RPMs, Debian packages, and Docker images are also available. </p><div><pre>wget https://github.com/AlexAkulov/clickhouse-backup/releases/download/v0.5.2/clickhouse-backup.tar.gz
tar -xf clickhouse-backup.tar.gz
cd clickhouse-backup/
sudo cp clickhouse-backup /usr/local/bin
clickhouse-backup -v</pre>
</div><p>The API features and new storage options like ‘remote_storage’ described in this blog article are not yet available in an official build.  You either need to build from source or run the latest docker image.  Here’s an example of the latter.  </p><div><pre>docker run --rm -it --network host \
  -v "/var/lib/clickhouse:/var/lib/clickhouse" \
  -e CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD="password" \
  -e S3_BUCKET="clickhouse-backup" \
  -e S3_ACCESS_KEY="access_key" \
  -e S3_SECRET_KEY="secret" \
  alexakulov/clickhouse-backup:master --help</pre>
</div><p>For the rest of the article we assume you have a build that has the new features.  When used on the command line, clickhouse-backup requires a configuration file. Here is a minimal example.  </p><div><pre>$ cat /etc/clickhouse-backup/config.yml
general:
  remote_storage: none</pre>
</div><p>You will need to add additional configuration options for non-default ClickHouse installations or authentication. A full config example can be created by running <code>clickhouse-backup default-config</code>. This is a great starting point for your use, showing all available settings.</p><p>Once configured, clickhouse-backup provides a variety of subcommands for managing backups. </p><div><pre>$ clickhouse-backup help
NAME:
clickhouse-backup - Tool for easy backup of ClickHouse with cloud support
...
COMMANDS:
  &nbsp;tables&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Print list of tables
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;create&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Create new backup
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upload&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upload backup to remote storage

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;help, h &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shows a list of commands or help for one command</pre>
</div><p>Just like the manual backup example above, you will need to use <code>sudo</code> or run <code>clickhouse-backup</code> as the clickhouse user.</p><p>The configuration file allows for certain databases or tables to be ignored. The <code>tables</code> subcommand will show you which tables will be backed up:</p><div><pre>$ clickhouse-backup tables
default.events
system.metric_log &nbsp; (ignored)
system.query_log&nbsp; &nbsp; (ignored)
system.query_thread_log (ignored)
system.trace_log&nbsp; &nbsp; (ignored)</pre>
</div><p>Creating a backup is as easy as:</p><div><pre>$ sudo clickhouse-backup create
2020/07/06 20:13:02 Create backup '2020-07-06T20-13-02'
2020/07/06 20:13:02 Freeze `default`.`events`
2020/07/06 20:13:02 Skip `system`.`metric_log`
2020/07/06 20:13:02 Skip `system`.`query_log`
2020/07/06 20:13:02 Skip `system`.`query_thread_log`
2020/07/06 20:13:02 Skip `system`.`trace_log`
2020/07/06 20:13:02 Copy metadata
2020/07/06 20:13:02 &nbsp; Done.
2020/07/06 20:13:02 Move shadow
2020/07/06 20:13:02 &nbsp; Done.</pre>
</div><p>As you can see in the example above, the backup completed within the same second.</p><p>You can review existing local backups:</p><div><pre>$ sudo clickhouse-backup list
Local backups:
- '2020-07-06T20-13-02' (created at 06-07-2020 20:13:02)</pre>
</div><p>Note that `Size` is not computed for local backups for performance reasons.</p><p>Internally, <code>clickhouse-backup</code> utilizes hard links when possible, as described above. The backup is stored in <code>/var/lib/clickhouse/backup/BACKUPNAME</code>. The backup name defaults to a timestamp, but you can optionally specify the backup name with the –name flag. The backup contains two directories: a `metadata` directory, with the DDL SQL statements necessary to recreate the schema, and a `shadow` directory with the data as a result of the <code>ALTER TABLE ... FREEZE</code> operation.</p><p>Restoring from a backup is also easy. For example:</p><div><pre>$ echo 'drop table events' | clickhouse-client

$ sudo clickhouse-backup restore 2020-07-06T20-13-02
2020/07/06 20:14:46 Create table `default`.`events`
2020/07/06 20:14:46 Prepare data for restoring `default`.`events`
2020/07/06 20:14:46 ALTER TABLE `default`.`events` ATTACH PART '202006_1_1_4'

</div><p>The <code>restore </code>subcommand automates both schema and data restoration. In case you only want to restore the schema, use the optional <code>--schema</code> flag. Or if you only want to restore the data (assuming the schema already exists), you can use the <code>--data</code> flag. The latter case is especially useful in restoring to a server that already has existing data.</p><p>Another useful feature is support for specifying a table pattern with most commands, such as create and restore. The <code>--table</code> argument allows you to backup (or restore) a specific table. You can also use a regex to, for example, target a specific database: <code>--table=dbname.*</code>.</p><p><h3>Remote Backup Destinations</h3>
</p><p>Of course, you could rsync your backup to a remote destination, save it to an object store like S3, or archive it using an existing backup solution. Local storage is usually insufficient to meet data durability requirements.</p><p>The clickhouse-backup tool supports uploading and downloading backups from a remote object store, such as S3, GCS, or IBM’s COS. A minimal AWS S3 configuration looks like:</p><div><pre>s3:
&nbsp;&nbsp;access_key: &lt;YOUR AWS ACCESS KEY&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;secret_key: &lt;YOUR AWS SECRET KEY&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;bucket: &lt;YOUR BUCKET NAME&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;region: us-east-1
&nbsp;&nbsp;path: "/some/path/in/bucket"</pre>
</div><p>Once you have configured your credentials and destination bucket, <code>clickhouse-backup</code> can take care of the rest:</p><div><pre>$ clickhouse-backup upload 2020-07-06T20-13-02
2020/07/07 15:22:32 Upload backup '2020-07-06T20-13-02'
2020/07/07 15:22:49 &nbsp; Done.

The remote backup can be downloaded to local storage before restoration:
$ sudo clickhouse-backup download 2020-07-06T20-13-02
2020/07/07 15:27:16 &nbsp; Done.</pre>
</div><p>The <code>clickhouse-backup</code> config file supports <code>backups_to_keep_local </code>and <code>backups_to_keep_remote </code>settings – tune them to meet your data retention requirements. For example, <code>set backups_to_keep_local: 7</code> and <code>backups_to_keep_remote: 31</code> to retain a week’s worth of nightly backups locally and a month’s worth remotely. Set both to 0 to disable backup pruning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There is also a <code>--diff-from</code> option to the upload subcommand. This feature compares files to a previous local backup, only uploading new/changed files. It is essential you retain the previous backup in order to do a restore from the new backup.</p><p>Data transfer time and cost are critical aspects of remote storage. How long will it take to restore a large table to a new server? This will be largely dependent on …</p></div></div>

      <p>If you like circles, spheres and shapes that fit nicely together, you’ll probably like spherical circle packings. In this post, I’ll describe how I turned one into a lamp.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>A circle packing is an arrangement of circles that fit tightly together, so that no circle can be enlarged without causing overlaps. Circle packing is a nice mathematical rabbit hole<sup id="fnref:circle_packing" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:circle_packing">1</a></sup>, but this post focuses on Steiner chains, which is the type of packing I used for building the lamp (more pictures of which can be found <a href="https://stuffmatic.com/projects/circle-lamp">here</a>).</p>

<h2 id="steiner-chains">Steiner chains</h2>

<p>A Steiner chain<sup id="fnref:steiner_chain" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:steiner_chain">2</a></sup> is constructed by surrounding a circle with a ring of additional circles that are all also tangent to a larger circle. In other words, a Steiner chain consists of circles packed in a circle (a concept I’ve previously explored in <a href="https://stuffmatic.com/projects/copper-circles">this project</a>).</p>

<div>
  
    <p><img src="https://stuffmatic.com/assets/posts/circle_packing_lamp/steiner.png" alt="A simple Steiner chain.">
    </p>
    
  
  <p>A simple Steiner chain with a center circle surrounded by a ring of 9 smaller circles, all tangent to the bounding circle (dashed).</p>
  
</div>

<p>The fact that a Steiner chain fits tightly in a circle can be used to construct nested packings by repeatedly replacing the center circle with a smaller Steiner chain. Here’s an animation illustrating the idea.</p>

<div>
  
    <p><img src="https://stuffmatic.com/assets/posts/circle_packing_lamp/steiner.gif" alt="Nesting Steiner chains">
    </p>
    
  
  <p>Nesting Steiner chains.</p>
  
</div>

<p>The lamp is built from a total of 13 circles, forming a nested Steiner chain with two rings, each containing 6 circles.</p>

<h2 id="deforming-a-circle-packing">Deforming a circle packing</h2>

<p>It’s intuitively clear that a circle packing can’t be arbitrarily deformed without “ruining” it. For example, stretching a packing in one direction turns the circles into ellipses. Luckily, there is a class of circle preserving planar deformations, so called Möbius transformations<sup id="fnref:mobius_transformation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:mobius_transformation">3</a></sup>, that can be used to parametrically control the shape of a circle packing. This is really useful for parametric design purposes.</p>

<div>

  <p>Möbius transformations applied to a circle packing.</p>
  
</div>

<h2 id="going-spherical">Going spherical</h2>

<p>The Möbius transformations described in the previous section turn out to be the only options for transforming a circle packing in the plane. However, if we venture into three dimensional space, there is another option: <em>inverse stereographic projection</em><sup id="fnref:stereographic" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:stereographic">4</a></sup>. Loosely speaking, this transformation can be used to wrap a circle packing around a sphere.</p>

<p>For this project, I put together a parametric design tool to explore interesting spherical circle packings. This tool generates packings in three steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a nested Steiner chain</li>
  <li>Apply a Möbius transformation</li>
  <li>Wrap the packing around a sphere using inverse stereographic projection</li>
</ol>

<p>Here’s an animation showing the tool in action.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="generating-the-blueprint">Generating the blueprint</h2>

<p>The previous sections outline a method for creating nice spherical circle packings. In order to create physical objects from these packings, I wrote some code for procedural generation of laser cutter blueprints. One cruical thing to keep in mind when making a pendant lamp is the center of mass. To ensure the lamp is hanging properly, the center of mass and the wire hole need to lie on the same vertical line. The center of mass calculation is simplified by the fact that it only has to deal with circles (the contribution from the joints is negligible).</p>

<h2 id="building-the-lamp">Building the lamp</h2>

<p>Once I had generated a blueprint and manufactured the parts, assembling the lamp went pretty smoothly. All circles, joints and joint holes were numbered so I would not have to think too much during assembly.</p>

                    <p>Starting a newsletter is exciting. I remember my first newsletter about remote work back in 2015. It was so cool having an actual audience of people to write to every week. It was like I had my own TV show or magazine or something. I later on realized that you could actually make money from this by finding people who would pay you for sponsoring or having an ad in your newsletter. Now, I'll share that with you how.</p><h2 id="my-story-short-version-">My story (short version)</h2><p>Since then I've progressed to running <a href="https://klart.io/pixels">Pixels</a>, a newsletter with curated designs and I'm sending it to more than 4000 people every week making money through sponsors.</p><p>Here's what I've learned.</p><p>Good question. As I see it, a sponsor is paying you money because they like what you're doing and they want to be related to you, in some way. You can see it as a mutual agreement, which both parties enjoy, possibly for a longer period of time.</p><p>Ads are more like a transactional thing. X pay money to Y to be have something displayed in front of people.</p><p>Everyone doesn't want to monetize their newsletter and that's cool. I've started a few myself just for fun and because I like writing and curating interesting content. But if you do want to earn money I think sponsors are the way to go. Read on!</p><p>There's really no number on how many subscribers you need to be able to land your first sponsor. Personally I got my first sponsor for Pixels at about a thousand subscribers but I could probably have reached out way sooner than that. If I was starting fresh today, I'd probably start to reach out when I'm around 100 subscribers. It's good to build relationships early, and companies are not stupid so they won't pay if they don't like what's in it for them anyway. Worst thing you can get is a no.</p><h2 id="define-your-audience">Define your audience</h2><p>One of the most important things when reaching out to potential sponsors is that you've defined your audience. Who's reading your newsletter? Are they developers? designers? photographers? yoga instructors? This will be key, so better figure this one out.</p><h2 id="find-relevant-companies">Find relevant companies</h2><p>When you go out looking for potential sponsors you shouldn't just "find any company". If your sponsor is not aligned with your readers it will probably come out in a weird spammy way as those old banner ads in the 90's. &nbsp;This will lead to poor ad performance and unhappy subscribers and sponsors. Everybody lose.</p><p>If you however manage to find a relevant sponsors, for example a new database system as a sponsor for your newsletter about open source, your readers will probably find it interesting, and your sponsor will get great ad performance. Win-win!</p><h2 id="who-should-you-email">Who should you email?</h2><p>This depends a little bit. I've found that it's a lot easier to get a referral down rather than up. So start with the CEO if it's a relatively small company and otherwise, try the marketing manager.</p><p>If you can't find an email address to anyone, try the general info email and ask who you should contact about email sponsorships. There are services like <a href="https://hunter.io/">Hunter.io</a> that you can use to find email addresses to people given a domain name.</p><h2 id="reach-out">Reach out</h2><p>Found a bunch of relevant companies to reach out to? Great! Now it's time to send a few emails.</p><p>Since you've already defined your audience this will be easy. In the subject, state what the company will get out of your offering and explain this further in your email.</p><p>This is an example of a first outreach email to sponsors for a newsletter about mobile cameras:</p><figure><pre><code>Subject: Reach Hobby Photographers

Hi Company!

My name is Foo from Bar. I run a weekly newsletter about the latest trends in mobile cameras.

Since you're making an app to develop photos I figured you would enjoy reaching this audience.

Are you interested in an exclusive sponsorship?

Best,

Foo</code></pre><figcaption>Example outreach email</figcaption></figure><p>Keep it short, personal and mention your audience. If they're interested they will probably get back to you for more information.</p><h2 id="follow-up-follow-up-follow-up">Follow-up, Follow-up, Follow-up</h2><p>Most of the time you'll probably not get a reply on the first email and that's why you have to follow-up. You might have heard this before but I can't stress this enough. It has happened so many times that I've closed a deal on the 7th or 8th email 3 months or so after I sent the first one.</p><p>Keep track of everything in a spreadsheet, one column for the email, one for the next follow-up. I usually do something like this:</p><ul><li>First email</li><li>After 3 days: Second email</li><li>Another 4 days: Third email</li><li>Another 5 days: Fourth email</li><li>... At least make it here. Bonus points for continuing...</li></ul><p>One you start doing this at scale you might want to consider a CRM system to not get completely overwhelmed by all your follow-ups. This is also the reason I started <a href="https://wobaka.com/">Wobaka</a>, to make automating follow-ups and keeping track of contacts super smooth.</p><h2 id="make-it-easy-for-them">Make it easy for them</h2><p>Once you do get a reply from someone you should make it super easy for them. Sponsoring you is probably a very small piece of their marketing budget so it's essential that the process is smooth, otherwise they could just increase their Twitter or Facebook ad budget instead, right?</p><p>Have a payment link ready that they can use, propose a date and state what you need from them. Don't bother with calendars and booking apps. Keep it simple. You can use a tool like <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> or <a href="https://paypal.com/">Paypal</a> for the payments.</p><p>This is an example for our photographer newsletter:</p><figure><pre><code>Subject: Re: Reaching Hobby Photographers

Thanks for getting back to me!

There are currently 1257 people reading the newsletter every friday. Open rate is 51% and click rate is 27%. This is an example: LINK

The sponsorship is AMOUNT and I'd be happy have you on as early as next week. If that's interesting I need the following for the ad:

- Title: Short
- Text: Less than 300 characters
- Image: 16:9 aspect ratio, png format

You can use this link for payment: LINK.

To reserve your spot I need the payment, the rest is ok to deliver a day or two before the newsletter.

Best,

Foo</code></pre><figcaption>Sponsorship details email example</figcaption></figure><h2 id="how-much-should-you-charge">How much should you charge?</h2><p>I strongly advice not getting into CPM and the likes. This is because I really don't think it's the same to appear in a generic Google or Facebook ad compared to backing a newsletter their potential customers actually enjoy reading. I would stick to fixed prices per newsletter.</p><p>About the price, I actually advice you to shoot from the hip. Try something, if it works, maybe raise it, if not, maybe lower it. Keep experimenting!</p><h2 id="don-t-listen-to-the-negative-folks">Don't listen to the negative folks</h2><p>Most people will be happy that you've got sponsors. That just means that you'll be able to spend more time writing the newsletter they love. Some people may however don't like it. It has never happened to me but I've heard about it. If it happens to you, just don't bother, instead focus on all the people you can spend more time writing to!</p><h2 id="enjoy-the-process-">Enjoy the process!</h2><p>Writing a newsletter is super rewarding. I love reading comments on how people enjoy reading mine. I hope you'll be able to keep writing and maybe even make a living on your newsletter.</p><p>Best of luck!</p><p><em>Fredrik</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="description">
<p>Google is the biggest internet company in the world today.&nbsp; And it seems that this giant, successful company is going to have a birthday. As a present, we came up with a few interesting facts in honor of the birthday <b>big boy</b> company.</p>
<h2>1. People do not seem to know Google’s exact birth date.</h2>
<p>Yes, it is true. People do not know the exact date of Google’s birthday. It has been reported that Google has been given six different dates for their official birthday. Eventually they decided they need a fixed date, so that people know when to celebrate. Google later determined that <b>September 27th</b> will be the day.</p>
<h2>2. Google may even happen to be 25 years old.</h2>
<p>There are some indications that the real birth date might come even earlier than ’98. Google could be in fact, over the age needed to purchase alcohol in the US, legally. Although Google already has encoded their official starting date with the cryptic “98 9 27” doodle, it all must have started even earlier. In 1995, in the dormitory of Standford, the two main Google guys initiated the miracle power behind the most popular search engine in the world. Some say that during the infant years of Google development, the two founding men were frequently in disagreement with each other. However, we have the search engine today as proof they eventually shook hands and decided to put aside their differences and get to work.</p>
<h2>3. Google has a T-rex dinosaur on-site as a special reminder.</h2>
<div><p>Indeed, there is a T-rex on-site at Google’s headquarters. The dyno structure features a bone from a real Tyrannosaurus. When an amateur paleontologist initially discovered the bone by accident, they thought it comes from a different type of dinosaur. Stan, the name of the bone construction, is a vivid reminder that adaptation is key to survival.</p><p>Apart from being a preferred gathering <a href="https://www.demilked.com/google-campus-dinosaur-stan-flamingos/" target="_blank">spot for flamingos meeting</a>, Stan is there to remind Google employees they need to give their best all the time. Or risk having their company become extinct, just like a dinosaur.</p></div>
<h2>4. A T-rex game likes to hide in Google Chrome.</h2>
<div><p>Google is fond of dinosaurs, we noticed. Apart from the giant structure at their HQ, they also made a digital dyno version. When you browse the net on Google Chrome, a warning will appear about Google not being able to connect.</p><p>When the dinosaur is visible, if you push the space bar on your keyboard, a game will begin where you are a running dinosaur jumping over obstacles. The game length is theoretically infinite and has been an arena for peculiar competition for the highest score.</p></div>
<h2>5. Many things are hiding in Google’s products.</h2>
<p>You can find many Google easter eggs by doing a simple search. These hidden gems become quite apparent once you begin to understand what they are.&nbsp; For example, searching with the word “askew” will return search results in a tilted view. You can also try “zerg rush,” “blink HTML” or the classic “Google in the 1998”.</p>
<h2>6. Google was not at all pleased that the name of the company became a generic search term.</h2>
<p>“Google” and “just Google it” are common words, but the company thought that could undermine all their efforts. There is, however, no way to stop such a trend. We have little control over how language use evolves. Marketing departments would say they want the brand name should circulate as much as possible. Still, Google has reached a level where the term becomes forever embedded in our culture. At this point, the process of “genericization” becomes unstoppable and out of control, even Google’s.</p>
<h2>7. Google devours more businesses than people genuinely think.</h2>
<p>Some estimate that Google purchases more than one company per week. Most of the companies tend to be small, but some can be rather large. Most of the acquired products get blended in with others that are already part of an applied marketing strategy.&nbsp; However, Android resides firmly within Google’s realm on its own accord and is very well known.<br>Google does not usually sell the companies that it buys. </p>
<h2>8. The “I’m Feeling Lucky” Google button cost more than tens of millions of dollars per year.</h2>
<p>This button is really fun. But for Google, it is an expensive add-on. The simple task of taking a person directly to the top result page without the advertising makes Google miss a lot of potential revenue. That lost income estimates put it at around $110 million. When addressed directly, Google officials responded that without the feeling lucky button Google will look like a corporate beast with an exclusive focus on money. The fact that the button remains on the main google page is a true testament that Google understands the search engine is for the real people out there.</p>
<h2>9. The first Google storage building blocks come from Lego.</h2>
<p>Google, one of the largest companies in the world today, has many demands, most of them understandably also pretty big. For example, all the countless public photos, videos and emails needs a place to stay, and there are building-size structures that come to the rescue. But back in 1996, things were different for the Google founders, when they had to find a solution for their first storage device need. The hard drives they found were too bulky, so they produced unique server boxes made out of Lego parts.</p>
<h2>10. Google proves to be very generous to the spouses of employees who die while working for the company.</h2>
<p>Losing a loved one on the job is always tough. Dying while working in a comfortable, air-conditioned office is not the same as, say, a coal mine accident. However, one thing is sure: death comes unexpectedly, and it is a hard stone to all sides involved. Google understands that and pays the husband or wife of the decreased fifty percent of their salary for the next ten years! Even the children of those unfortunate enough to perish on the job have benefits too – they are set with compensatory payments till they reach adulthood.</p>
<h2>11. One search on Google requires more computing power than it took to send astronauts of Apollo 11 to the moon. </h2>
<div><p>Isn’t that a funny statistic? Searching with Google is made so simple now. Most people don’t believe when they hear the actual computing and networking power behind every simple search querry.</p><p>Searching the internet today takes more resources than were necessary to put people on the moon. Even your smartphone has better capabilities than the equipment NASA had when they attempted the first moonwalk. </p></div>
<h2>12. One time Google experienced a crash for five minutes, and almost half of the whole internet went down too.</h2>
<div><p>What if you can’t use your computer for five minutes? No bid deal, right? You can take a walk and come back again. Five minutes for Google is too much.</p><p>It was on August 19, 2013, when the famed Google stopped operating for a total of five minutes. This short interruption sufficed for Google to take down around 40% of all internet traffic.</p><p>While it is true that many companies have risen to the occasion and provide search opportunities for people, Google still dominates the more substantial part of the internet. Google has grown to the point where it almost became a synonym for the internet itself. When Google has a problem, the chances are that so does most of the world wide web.</p></div>
<h2>13. Google employs goats.</h2>
<div><p>There is a lot of beautiful green space around Google offices. And that could require a lot of mowing for sure. So they come up with the ingenious idea to have some goats to take care of the grass for them.</p><p>According to Google employees, they love goats because for a score of reasons. Goats are not as noisy, don’t cause any pollution, and, most of all, are more cure and cuddly than lawnmowers.</p></div>
<h2>14. Google has lots of dogs on site.</h2>
<div><p>Speaking of goats, Google also loves all kinds of animals and lets people bring their pets to work. Having your best friend around you is a huge booster for morale and productivity.</p><p>Note that cats are not banned from Google. It’s just that cats don’t usually get along with dogs, so there are fewer of them on-site. But there are still quite a few.</p></div>
<h2>15. Google has given a dog the title of Top Dog.</h2>
<p>According to Google’s official history, the dog of the owner of Google, whose name is Yoshka, is the first and only dog to be given the name Top Dog back in 1999. A post appeared on Google by Yoshka, stating that all dogs are welcome to come to Google. Yoshka is not the only dog in the company, but it was the first. The dog owner was non-other than Urs Hölzle. He was the person responsible for reducing the power needed for Google data centers by half!</p>
<h2>16. Google centered their logo on the main search page in 2001.</h2>
<div><p>Google’s homepage is simple, a much-needed requirement when millions around the world visit it on a daily. Any changes to that page, even the tiniest ones, will be indeed significantly noticed.</p><p>In the early days of the search engine, the Google logo resided to the left side of the page. But in 2001, they moved it to the center and has been there ever since. This seemingly slight change is pretty significant. It changed how the main page is perceived forever.</p></div>
<h2>17. Google continues to make small changes.</h2>
<div><p>There have been some rather small adjustments to the Google logo, in time. Those changes include the layout of the letters of the word “Google.”</p><p>Small changes are the general approach, but Google also goes big. They came up with different ways to arrange the words, which included a new font too.</p></div>
<h2>18. Changes include the name.</h2>
<p>In recent years, the most significant and notable change occurred when the company changed its name from Google to Alphabet. That change was prompted by the fact the company was dominating most of the search, information, internet and other aspects of the business.</p>
<h2>19. Google Instant.</h2>
<p>Google Instant means that you will see results immediately as soon as you start typing if your connection allows it.&nbsp; Google can then collect ample information on you about your browsing patterns to get you where you want to go even faster. Google Instant changes the autocomplete options, and the suggested search results in an …</p></div></div>

<p>He had a bell tied to his computer. Every time he made a sale, the bell would chime. Amazon started out selling only books, and sales back then were only far and between.</p>
<p>Eventually, the bell started chiming continiously, and he had to take it down.</p>
<p>A lot of popular software tools have similar functionality built in. Each time you get a new subscriber, Mailchimp sends you an alert email. Each time you make a sale, Stripe sends you a payment notification.</p>
<p>When you first start making stuff online, there's no better feeling than knowing that someone out there wants to pay money to use your product or follow your work. And there's no better pick-me-up when you've had a tough day.</p>
<p>I have a similar set up for one of my apps. Each time a customer upgrades to a "premium" plan, I have a script that randomly fetches a gif from Giphy with the keyword "money". This is then included in an email that contains information about who bought, what they bought, and how munch money I made. </p>
<p><img src="https://images.postmake.io/resources/blog/founder-dopamine-hits/alert_email.gif" alt="Sample Alert Email"></p>
<p>I've had this setup for more than a couple of years now, and these emails are still the highlight of my days. But as much as I enjoy getting these emails, I hope I'll eventually reach a point where I'll have to turn them off. </p>
<p>I guess for now, these dopamine hits will have to do.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Using SPF on HELO/EHLO hostnames is repurposing SPF to validate a different thing</h2>

	<p><small>September 26, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Back in June I discovered that <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/spam/SPFForHELOs">in theory we should have SPF records
for EHLO hostnames too</a>. The conventional explanation
for this (apart from 'big email providers say so', the usual reason
to do anything in modern SMTP) comes from, for example, <a href="https://bridge.grumpy-troll.org/2020/07/small-mailserver-bcp/">this
writeup of small mailserver best current practices</a>,
and goes like this (I'm paraphrasing):</p>

<p>People use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework">SPF</a>
to validate the envelope sender domain (the SMTP MAIL FROM). However,
when you send a bounce, it has a null sender and thus no sender
domain to use for SPF checks. So the sender domain is taken from
the EHLO hostname, for lack of a better place to get it from (since
there is no SMTP level 'the bounce claims to have been sent by X
domain' information to be had, although this is commonly in the
message headers).</p>

<p>This is of course kind of bogus. What is really happening here is that
receiving mail servers are attempting to validate that the EHLO/HELO
hostname itself is not forged and are using SPF for this purpose. This
is a complete repurposing of SPF, which we can see since 'Sender' is
right in the name 'Sender Policy Framework' and there's no 'sender' of
the bounce that is visible at the SMTP level (and no entirely standard
way that it's visible in the mail headers, either).</p>

<p>There are some lessons here for email related 'standards' and in general
any Internet standards, which I can summarize this way: if there's a
hole that people think needs filling, any nearby peg will get hammered
into it regardless of what the peg was originally designed for.</p>

<p>PS: This elaborates on <a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1307064512302940161">a recent tweet of mine</a> that was
sparked by adding SPF DNS records for our EHLO hostnames (and writing
the official explanation of the change for our records).</p>

<h3>Sidebar: This explanation and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208">RFC 7208</a></h3>

<p>RFC 7208 says two things in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208#section-2.3">section 2.3, <em>The "HELO" Identity</em></a>:</p>

<ul><li>it's RECOMMENDED that you check the HELO identity (but carefully)
all the time, and do so before checking MAIL FROM.</li>
<li>if the envelope sender is the null sender, the message is presumed
to come from 'postmaster@&lt;HELO name&gt;' and this is used as the
MAIL FROM to check (even if you already checked the HELO identity).</li>
</ul>

<p>I haven't gone through RFC 7208's section on doing SPF checks to see
if it treats HELO and MAIL FROM checks somewhat differently in its
algorithm, because frankly I'm not interested enough.</p>

<p>This means that RFC 7208 itself is a superset of the conventional
explanation I summarized above. In RFC 7208, you have SPF records
for your EHLO hostnames both because of bounces and because receivers
are recommended to check them all the time. This implies that all
of your mail sending machines should have SPF records, not just the
ones that can send bounces.</p>

<p>(Now that I've looked that up, I may need to update some of our
DNS records. Again.)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>We rebooted all of our servers remotely (more or less) and it all worked</h2>

	<p><small>September 26, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Even under normal circumstances, we don't routinely reboot our Linux
servers. Reboots are disruptive to our users (especially to the
people who are logged in to the servers that reboot), and local
policies require us to schedule an after-hours downtime for large
scale user visible things like this, which is disruptive to our
lives. We do reboot them periodically, either for significant enough
Ubuntu kernel security issues or just because we want to get them
back on up to date kernels. However, all of this is under normal
circumstances, when we are actually physically in the office to
deal with machines that fail to go down or come up cleanly.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">The current situation is not normal</a>. We've been out
of the office since early March, and even in March our systems had
been rather a while since a reboot (through the magic of our
Prometheus metrics and dashboards, I can tell you that at the end
of March 12th, the last day I was in the office, most of our systems
had been up for about 259 days).  Since we were out of the office,
we didn't even think about rebooting for a very long time, and by
early September many of our machines had been up for over 400 days
without a reboot. Things reached a critical point and we (by which
I mean my co-workers, as I was on vacation) decided that we should
take the risk to reboot everything, while taking some steps to
mitigate the risks for very important machines.</p>

<p>(Said steps being that the reboot of those machines was scheduled for
early morning, when a co-worker who is an extreme morning person would
stop by the office.)</p>

<p>What happened was, well, nothing. Everything rebooted quietly,
everything came back up again without problems, and I believe that the
co-worker in the office didn't need to do anything. The not as user
visible machines that we rebooted before hand all worked, the user
visible machines that we rebooted during the downtime worked too, and
none of our fears came to pass.</p>

<p>(Well, we did discover a machine or two with odd BIOS settings
that caused problems, but they weren't particularly user visible
machines; they were generic machines in <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/SlurmHasCreatedCattle">our SLURM cluster</a>.)</p>

<p>It would be nicer to have remote power control and a KVM over IP setup
for all of our machines, so that we could deal with everything from
home; that would make reboots almost completely risk free (and an
unexpected hardware failure is hard to deal with during a scheduled
downtime anyway). But it's reassuring to have a positive experience
even just with the basics. It will also probably encourage us to do it
again, sooner than last time around.</p>

<p>(Also, it's nice for a potentially risky operation to just work.
A quiet day is its own reward, and sometimes our small successes
deserve a little celebration.)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rust is a strange language.</p><p>It has modern and promising design idea, and good performance compared to C++. It's proved to be an alternative system language that can use for writing OS, although there's no product level rust OS yet, there're several implementations as the potential players. It's the highest expected, trying the whole bag of tricks to grow, gaining popularity in the young crowds...all these are very good to a novel and health community.</p><p>On the other hand, this language seems no idea where to go. No, I'm not talking about its dreaming goal, of course I know its goal is explicitly expressed: safety, speed, and concurrency. What I'm confusing is the way it choose towards its goal. Rust community choose an iterative model rather than waterfall model to develop Rust language. That is to say, the code and interfaces keeps changing while the design is still not confirmed. Although it's the popular development model in today's internet industry on business software, I doubt if it's the best way for a foundational foresight programming language. However, it's too early to say whether the development model is bad in nowadays' industry. We can see many companies are trying to use Rust even its design is still unstable. In the past, such kind of activity is insane to take risks in a serious product. But today's industry is in a rapid iterating, maybe our understand is too old for it, and maybe Rust's model is the brand new way to improve the industry. People can adapt the fast changing things even it's their fundamental langugage, and there could be stronger auto tools to rely on. Who knows, let's give it a try, warriors, the boss pays for it.</p><p>This article is about the Rust frontend on GCC. It's reasonable for me (or any potential contributors) to blame Rust's development model, since it's interfering the efforts of its own GCC frontend.</p><p>So far, the only reliable implementation is the officially supported LLVM front-end. I don't know if there're more, but I will not choose if it's not based on a mainstream compiler infrastructure. After all, it's system level language, once you choose, it's not expected to be changed in a decade. To my experiences to lead the software development in past decade, it's not so simple to change fundamental things, from libs to compilers to languages. It's not impossible, but why waste time to do it when you have lots of other workloads to deal with?</p><p>Stop, it's not a criticism article against Rust. So I'm not going to blame it more.</p><p>OK, that's enough, now that we're trying to work for the Rust front-end on GCC, it's reasonable to say we're interested in this language. And we hope to promote it better. As a perennial GNU hacker, it's natual for me to think about Rust on GCC. I have several experiences on writing language front-ends, the architecture is similar, and the theory is similar too. However, gcc-rust is a very hard project that couldn't be done successfully by one-man effort. In this article, I'll introduce the ideas and efforts around FOSS community.

Hydra Cave</h2><p>Rust on GCC is a Hydra. Why? Because there're at least 3 possible ways to go. Oh well, three heads of a dragon.</p><p>These 3 ways are originally mentioned by @redbrain who is one of the enthusiasts of Rust on GCC (<a href="https://github.com/redbrain/gccrs/issues/2#issuecomment-563255365" target="_blank">https://github.com/redbrain/gccrs/issues/2#issuecomment-563255365</a>). Unfortunately, he has dropped his efforts, but his work of Rust on GCC is still inspiring.</p><p>The first way is the most lightweight way. The original Rust compiler provides a IR (Intermediate Representation) named MIR, so the idea is really simple, we can take advantage of the front-end of Rust on LLVM then convert MIR to GENERIC which is the general IR in GCC. The pros is that we don't have to deal with the occasionally changing of Rust's grammar. This idea is achievable, since the original Rust compiler is in the similar architecture to convert MIR to LLVM-IR. The only problem is that this Rust on GCC frontend has to require the original rustc, and this may bring the LLVM dependencies chain. Then people may wonder why we still bother to implement Rust on GCC, it doesn't reduce the dependencies in the development environment nor likely to be widely accepted by GCC folks. No mention the license issue.</p><p>The second way is to use GCC JIT interface on top of the original Rust compiler. This architecture implies to add a new backend (libgccgit <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/cp/index.html" target="_blank">https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/cp/index.html</a>) to the original Rust compiler. So it's not the Rust on GCC as most people expected, it's a new feature request to Rust developer to support yet another compiler backend and maintain the code by Rust community. This is the perfect approach only if Rust developers accept it. However, the hard part would be license issue, and it all depends on the willing of Rust community.</p><p>The third way is the traditional way, full C++ implementation of Rust on GCC. There's an existing good example, gccgo, which is the Go language front-end on GCC. It's the hardest way to build a Rust compiler from scratch. The pros is that the developers can expect to do everything they like to build an efficient Rust compiler to challenge the orginal one, and it doesn't require LLVM as the prerequisite. Finally, no any license issue, we can make it GPLv3+. However, there must be a strong group to maintain this front-end. Gccgo has a strong team hired by Google. No mention you have to keep updating the volatile Rust grammar periodically.</p><p>All these approaches are independent from each other, so it's impossible to combine all these 3 forces. The MIR way is working by @sapir <a href="https://github.com/sapir/gcc-rust/tree/rust" target="_blank">https://github.com/sapir/gcc-rust/tree/rust</a>, and it's still in progress; The libgccjit way requires the connection to Rust community that is out of my reach, and I don't know who is working on it; as a GNU hacker, I think my prefered way is the third one. The third way was dropped by @redbrain, but there's some inspiring code left.</p><h2>What we've got so far?</h2><p>My plan is not to secretly working on it then throw a release suddenly to shock people. I have too many projects in my TODO, I do want to have gcc-rust, and I do want to have more friends on it. Let me emphersize it again, it's impossible to do it by one-man effort.</p><p>Fortunately, @SimplyTheOther have done fully-operational and working lexer, parser of a recent Rust syntax. It's great work. I have enough experiences to write parsers for practical languages, it's time consuming work. That's why I appreciate @SimplyTheOther's work so much. Of course, I agree with @SimplyTheOther that the most time consuming work would be the type checking part, at least for Rust, I'm afraid that it could be true.</p><p>After I helped to fix tiny bugs to make it work smoothly, I started to write an enhanced AST dumper. It's reasonable for us, first, I need to get familiar with @SimplyTheOther's AST design; second, we need to output a human-readable AST for debugging.</p><p>Let me show you a silly example:</p><pre spellcheck="false"><span><span>fn</span> <span>abc</span></span>(x:<span>u32</span>, y:<span>u32</span>) -&gt; <span>u32</span> {
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>return</span> x+y;
}

<span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span></span>() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>1</span>+<span>1</span>;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>println!</span>(<span>"Hello World!"</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abc(<span>1</span>, <span>1</span>);
}
</pre><p>Alright, it's silly meaningless code, let's see how the AST dump looks like.</p><p>Assuming you stored the source code to test.rs, then run AST dump:</p><pre spellcheck="false">rust1 -frust-<span>dump</span>-parse test.rs
</pre><p>The output could be:</p><pre spellcheck="false">Crate:
&nbsp;inner attributes: none
&nbsp;items:

<span>u32</span> abc(x : <span>u32</span>, y : <span>u32</span>)
BlockExpr:
{
&nbsp;outer attributes: none
&nbsp;inner attributes: none
&nbsp;statements:
&nbsp;ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp; <span>return</span> ArithmeticOrLogicalExpr: x + y
&nbsp;final expression: none
}

void main()
BlockExpr:
{
&nbsp;outer attributes: none
&nbsp;inner attributes: none
&nbsp;statements:
&nbsp; ExprStmtWithBlock:
&nbsp;&nbsp; BlockExpr:
&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outer attributes: none
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inner attributes: none
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; statements:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ArithmeticOrLogicalExpr: <span>1</span> + <span>1</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; final expression: none
&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp; <span>println!</span>(<span>"Hello World!"</span>)
&nbsp;ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp; outer attributes: none
&nbsp;&nbsp; StructExpr:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PathInExpr:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abc(<span>1</span>, <span>1</span>)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inner attributes:none
&nbsp;final expression: none
}
</pre><p>It's good for us to debug or extend the parser. After all, if we can't make sure the parser is correct, how can we move forward to type checking and IR transformation?</p><p>The project repo is here, patches are welcome: <a href="https://github.com/philberty/gccrs" target="_blank">https://github.com/philberty/gccrs</a></p><h2>What's next?</h2><p>Before answer this question, I guess you may wonder why I used `rust1` rather than a traditional name `gccrust` or something else.</p><p>`rust1` is the Rust compiler, while `gccrust` is a collection that calling compiler, assembler, and linker like a chain. We haven't done the IR transformation yet, so there won't be anything can be assembled and linked except for the AST. Oh my poor Rust compiler!</p><p>It's not so hard to transform AST to GENERIC which is the current toplevel IR of gcc. However, it's meaningless to rush if we haven't made sure the parser work correctly for the Rust grammar. No mention the critical feature of Rust, the linear type system.</p><p>If you understand what I've said so far, then I can answer the question "what could be the next".</p><p>1. The type system, too big to talk about it here.</p><p>2. The static analysis.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the advantages of llvm-rust was that it used the static analysis of LLVM. Fortunately, David Malcolm finished his GCC static analysis framework recently <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/806099/" target="_blank">https://lwn.net/Articles/806099/</a>. I'm not sure if there could be any hook for front-end to interact with, or maybe we can't touch it once we pass the authority to the next level IR. Anyway, it's an exciting feature of GCC to research.</p><p>3. The new middle-IR for Rust specific pre-optimizing.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea is largely inspired by gccgo because they've inserted a specifically designed IR for Go language before transforming it to GENERIC. This IR was named GOGO. Gccgo will do some pre-optimizing with GOGO. From the compiler design perspective, it's reasonable to do so, since some information may lose after …</p></div></div>

<p>In this week's post, you will learn how to build a command line tool that
manipulates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files</a>.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>In this example, I have medical data on some hospital patients:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>data.csv</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>id,height_ft,weight_lb,glucose_mgdL
PT-9357,5.96,189,124
PT-5315,5.53,180,106
PT-7733,6.15,222,126
PT-9667,6.10,174,104
PT-8893,6.00,232,98
PT-1125,5.97,187,85
PT-1222,5.82,237,104
PT-7681,6.00,198,134
PT-7043,5.98,227,78
PT-2623,5.55,204,125
PT-7031,5.50,216,107
PT-4947,5.91,199,105
PT-9711,6.13,237,107
PT-3737,6.03,179,111
PT-2931,5.78,187,87
</code></pre>
<p>Here's what the columns mean:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>id</code> - the patient's id number.</li>
<li><code>height_ft</code> - the patient's height (units <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit)">ft</a>).</li>
<li><code>weight_lb</code> - the patient's weight in (units <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)">lb</a>).</li>
<li><code>glucose_mgdL</code> - the patient's fasting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar_level">blood glucose</a> levels (units <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#SI_multiples">mg</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre#SI_prefixes_applied_to_the_litre">dL</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>From this data, I want to make several calculations:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to calculation the patients' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index">body mass index</a> (BMI) from their
height and weight.</li>
<li>I want to classify the patients' weight based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index">BMI</a>, e.g. "obese",
"underweight".</li>
<li>I want to classify the patients' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes">diabetic status</a> based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar_level">blood
glucose</a>, e.g. "diabetic", "prediabetic".</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's how I can use <code>csv-proc</code> to accomplish this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ ./csv-proc data.csv '
_height_m = float(row.height_ft) * 0.3048
_weight_kg = float(row.weight_lb) * 0.453592
bmi = _weight_kg / _height_m ** 2
bmi = round(bmi, 1)
if bmi &lt; 18.5:
    bmi_cat = "underweight"
elif 18.5 &lt;= bmi &lt; 25:
    bmi_cat = "normal"
elif 25 &lt;= bmi &lt; 30:
    bmi_cat = "overweight"
elif 30 &lt;= bmi:
    bmi_cat = "obese"

_glucose_mgdL = float(row.glucose_mgdL)
if _glucose_mgdL &lt; 100:
    glucose_cat = "normal"
elif 100 &lt;= _glucose_mgdL &lt; 126:
    glucose_cat = "prediabetic"
elif 126 &lt;= _glucose_mgdL:
    glucose_cat = "diabetic"
'
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(This uses the functions <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float">float</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round">round</a>.)</p>
<p>I could also accomplish this by defining some helper functions using the
<code>--init</code> flag:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ ./csv-proc data.csv '

_height_m = N(row.height_ft) * 0.3048
_weight_kg = N(row.weight_lb) * 0.453592
bmi = round(_weight_kg / _height_m ** 2, 1)
bmi_cat = classify_bmi(bmi)
_glucose_mgdL = N(row.glucose_mgdL)
glucose_cat = classify_glucose(_glucose_mgdL)

' --init '

from bisect import bisect_right
from functools import partial

N = float

def classify(x, *, cutoff, label):
    return label[bisect_right(cutoff, x)]

classify_bmi = partial(
    classify,
    cutoff=[18.5, 25, 30],
    label="underweight normal overweight obese".split(),
)

classify_glucose = partial(
    classify,
    cutoff=[100, 126],
    label="normal prediabetic diabetic".split(),
)

<p>(This uses functions <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float">float</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.partial">functools.partial</a>, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect_right">bisect.bisect_right</a>.)</p>

<p>I use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html">csv</a> module to read and write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files</a>.
The method <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.Sniffer.sniff">csv.Sniffer.sniff</a> analyzes a sample of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV file</a> and guesses the "dialect" (delimiter, quoting, etc.).
I use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictReader">csv.DictReader</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictWriter">csv.DictWriter</a> instead of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader">csv.reader</a> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.writer">csv.writer</a> because I want to expose the rows as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict">dictionaries</a> instead</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#compile">compile</a> to prepare text to be executed as code by <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec">exec</a>.
To determine the new columns to add to the output, I examine how
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict">collections.OrderedDict</a> <code>env_local</code> changes after processing a row.
I ignore local variables that start with <code>_</code> because I wanted an easy way to
create "temporary variables" that won't show up in the output.</p>
<p>When I process each row of the input <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV file</a>, I create a <code>RowProxy</code> object
that allows accessing <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict">dictionary</a> entries as attributes. E.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rp = RowProxy({"cat": 3})
rp["cat"]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>3
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rp.cat
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>3
</code></pre>

<p>In this week's post you learned how to a command line tool that manipulates
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files</a>.
You learned how to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html">csv</a> module to read and write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files</a>, as well as how to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.Sniffer">csv.Sniffer</a> to automatically deduce the
"dialect" of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV file</a>.
You also learned how to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#compile">compile</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec">exec</a> to run text as Python code.</p>
<p>My challenge to you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Build a tool like <code>csv-proc</code> that allows you to filter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files</a>
based on some criteria.
For example, if you only want to view prediabetic patients from <strong>data.csv</strong>,
you could call your program like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ csv-filter data.csv '100 &lt;= float(row.glucose_mgdL) &lt; 126'
</code></pre>

</p>

<h2><span>Work in Progress</span></h2>
<p>
<i>
Generating random Pac-Man mazes is a deceptively difficult problem that I spent some months working on.  It is not easy to describe clearly.  I hope you are patient.  This page is an effort to begin communicating how the algorithm works.  It will slowly be refined (your feedback appreciated) until it is all stated as clearly as possible.
</i>
</p>

<h2>Contraints</h2>
<p>
The mazes are built carefully to closely match design patterns deduced from the original maps found in Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Map is 28x31 tiles.</li>
<li>Paths are only 1 tile thick</li>
<li>No sharp turns (i.e. intersections are separated by atleast 2 tiles).</li>
<li>There are 1 or 2 tunnels</li>
<li>No dead-ends.</li>
<li>Only I, L, T, or + wall shapes are allowed, including the occasional rectangular wall.</li>
<li>Any non-rectangular wall pieces must only be 2 tiles thick.</li>
</ul>

<h2>It's like Tetris</h2>

<p>
We start by stacking tetris pieces on a 5x9 grid. Gravity pulls the pieces in the left direction rather than down.  The edges of the resulting tetris pieces correspond to walkable paths in the maze.  This grid is then mirrored across the left vertical axis to create a symmetric map, then scaled by 3 to form an original-size 28x31 map.
</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>
For clarity, I call the squares in the initial 5x9 grid, <b>cells</b>, and the squares in the final 28x31 grid, <b>tiles</b>.  So, this algorithm first creates the <b>cells</b> and transforms them into <b>tiles</b>
</p>

<h2>Simple Model</h2>

<p>
Shown in the above diagram titled "Simple Model" is the 5x9 grid of tetris pieces.  The pieces are created one cell at a time using some algorithm to limit the type of pieces at certain locations (they are numbered to show the order of creation).
</p>

<p>
The ghost pen and the edge between rows 7 and 8 at column 1 are present in every map, since the starting location of Pac-Man and the ghost pen location are constant.
</p>

<h2>Height and Width Adjustments</h2>

<p>
Cells are directly transformed into a 3x3 group of tiles. Unfortunately, this creates a resulting map that is too short by 1 tile and too wide by 1 tile.  So, we increase the height of one cell for every column, and decrease the width of one cell for every row, allowing the generated map to fit in the exact dimensions of the original game.
</p>

<p>
Shown in the above diagrams titled "Height Adjustments" and "Width Adjustments", the highlighted cells are the candidate cells whose size can be changed without creating ugly walls (i.e. walls that have non-uniform thickness).
</p>

<p>
Arrows occupy cells which have been chosen for size adjustment.  Care is taken to prevent discontinuities in the edges as a result of the shifting of cells from the size change.
</p>

<h2>Border Cells and Tunnels</h2>

<p>
I won't explain too much about this right now.  But the above diagram titled "Border Cells and Tunnels" has arrows to indicate the tunnel candidates.  The highlighted cells show the type of tunnel candidates by color.  Some cell edges are erased to create some variation in how walls connect with the boundary of the map (shown in green).  The tunnel creation algorithm is sophisticated in how it chooses different types of tunnels.
</p>

<h2>Final Paths</h2>

<p>
When the cells are finally transformed into tiles, what you are left with is shown in the diagram above titled "Final Paths".  Here you can directly map a cell to a 3x3 group of tiles.  You can even pick out the cells whose height are width have been adjusted by 1 tile in this map.
</p>

<h2>Final Tiles</h2>

<p>
See how the above diagram titled "Final Tiles" differs from "Final Paths".  The paths are shifted from the tile <em>edges</em> toward the tile <em>centers</em>.  Each tile with a path going through its center is turned into a path tile.  Finally, any tile that touches a path tile becomes a wall tile.  The map structure is now complete.

<p>Terra Nil is a relaxing city builder about ecosystem reconstruction.</p>
<p>Turn a barren wasteland into an ecological paradise complete with different flora and fauna, then clean up after yourself to leave the environment pristine.&nbsp;This strategy game/city builder/puzzler subverts the conventional goal of the city builder genre.&nbsp;Terra Nil is about the restoration of a ravaged environment, where the lightest touch is best.</p>

<p>The whole game can be played with the mouse:&nbsp;</p>
<ul><li>left/right click select/deselect</li><li>middle button to pan&nbsp;</li><li>scroll wheel to rotate / zoom</li></ul>
<p>There are also keyboard controls:</p>
<ul><li>arrows or wasd to pan&nbsp;</li><li>z/x to zoom&nbsp;</li><li>r to rotate</li></ul>
