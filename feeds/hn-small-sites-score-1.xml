        <h2><b>How to sell data to hedge funds</b></h2>

<p><img src="https://alternativedata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Crossing-the-Chasm-Selling-Data-to-Investors-01.png" alt="" width="5705" height="4298"></p><h3><b>Step 1: Know your audience</b></h3>
<p><span>Hedge funds are not all the same. Below are the main types.</span></p><h5>Quantitative Investing (a.k.a. Quant, Systematic, Algorithmic)</h5>
<p><span>Quant funds utilize automated trading strategies based on algorithms and data. They are not looking to be right on every trade. They just want to be right more than they’re wrong and trade a lot of securities.</span>

<span>They typically purchase data that</span></p><ul>
 	<li><span>Apply to 100s or 1,000s of securities</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Has a long history of data they can backtest</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Is published frequently. 5 years of historical data, published quarterly provides a weaker backtest than 5 years of historical data published daily</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The best part about selling to quant funds is that their business model is based on data, so they employ professionals to speak to data vendors, understand their data and make compelling proposals when valuable. </span>

<span>The difficult part about selling to quant funds is if your dataset does not meet the above attributes, you’re probably not going to sell them anything. But you’ll learn that pretty fast. </span>

<span>More Info:&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.streetofwalls.com/finance-training-courses/quantitative-hedge-fund-training/quant-firms/"><span>Largest Quantitative Hedge Funds</span></a></p><h5>Fundamental Investing (a.k.a. Discretionary, Stock-Picking)</h5>
<h6><i><span>Platform Funds (a.k.a. Pod, Multi-Manager, Multi-Strategy)</span></i></h6>
<p><span>Platform Funds consist of many individual teams of PMs &amp; Analysts who share centralized resources such as assets under management, trading &amp; execution, compliance, data, office space, training and more. </span>

<span>Platform funds with discretionary strategies typically purchase data that</span></p><ul>
 	<li><span>Is highly correlated with a company KPI (“Key Performance Indicator”) or key investor question of specific securities</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Has a history of data they can backtest</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Is unique</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Since platform funds provide infrastructure shared among their investing teams (or “pods”), they often employ data sourcing professionals similar to Quant funds. These are also quick and pleasant conversations to have that require minimal sales infrastructure.</span>

<span>More info:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/forums/what-ive-learned-about-hedge-fund-structure-and-compensation"><span>Multi-Manager Funds</span></a></p><h6><i><span>Long/Short Equity Hedge Funds</span></i></h6>
<p><span>Long/Short Equity Hedge funds pick stocks. They tend to purchase similar data to Platform Funds</span>

<span>The Long/Short Equity Hedge Funds who spend the most on data:</span></p><ul>
 	<li><span>Have a large amount of Assets Under Management (AUM)</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Trade frequently. The more often they trade, the more data they want to look at. A rough proxy for this is “Turnover %” on a 13F database such as </span><a href="https://whalewisdom.com/"><span>Whale Wisdom</span></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Make concentrated bets. The larger their positions, the more they can spend. A proxy for this is “% of Portfolio” on Whale Wisdom</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>More Info: </span><a href="http://www.institutionalinvestorsalpha.com/profile/3287866/4689/hedge-fund-100-firm-profiles.html"><span>Institutional Investors Top 100 Hedge Funds</span></a><span> (also includes Quant and Platform funds)

</span></p><h6><i><span>Event Driven Funds</span></i></h6>
<p><span>These firms invest based on specific catalysts such as a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, spinoff or legislation. If your dataset allows investors unique insights into key events, they may be a good match for Event Driven Funds.</span></p><h5><strong>Other Types of Funds</strong></h5>
<p><span>The above designations are neither mutually exclusive nor collectively exhaustive. Many funds are combinations of the above or something else entirely, including:</span></p><ul>
 	<li><span>Long Only/Mutual Funds: much longer term oriented investors with a different business model</span></li>
 	<li>Macro Funds: These firms invest across broader trends that affect a lot of stocks. If your data speaks to broader trends like inflation, currencies, weather, interest rates or global events they may be a good match for Macro Funds.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Credit Funds: invest in debt</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Family Offices: manage funds of an individual family or group of families</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Fund of Funds: invests in other funds</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Sovereign Wealth Funds / Pension Funds: manages money of countries, endowments</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Private Equity/Venture Capital: make large investments in mainly private companies</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Step 2: Understand key use cases for your data&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p><span>For background on why hedge funds value alternative data, see </span><a href="http://mattturck.com/the-new-gold-rush-wall-street-wants-your-data/"><span>Matt Turck’s excellent piece on the subject</span></a><span>. High level, it helps to divide the institutional investor market into quantitative funds and discretionary funds, as the two have very different requirements and use cases for data.</span>

<span>To attract quant funds, your data should speak to a lot of companies and have a long time series. A good example is a panel of consumer transactions touching many public companies, that has a positive correlation with share prices. Once a quant fund has an understanding of your dataset, they can run a backtest to establish value. </span>

<span>To attract fundamental investors, it’s easier to start with a few case studies about specific public companies. Pick a few that your data can best speak to and run a correlation to their KPIs (e.g., Revenue, GMV, Gross Profit). The best companies are:</span></p><ul>
 	<li><span>Stock price is driven by a key metric or investor question your data can speak to</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Large market cap / average trading volume</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>High volatility </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Always nice: high hedge fund ownership (examples on </span><a href="https://insight.factset.com/hubfs/Hedge%20Fund%20Ownership/Hedge%20Fund%20Ownership%20Q4%202016_2.18.17.pdf"><span>page 5</span></a><span>)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The right company will vary by dataset, but a few examples:</span></p><ul>
 	<li><span>Panel of Mobile App Usage: Correlate to observed app usage with reported DAUs for SnapChat, Facebook or Twitter</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Panel of Consumer Transactions: Correlate to same store sales of retailers or GMV/sales of ecommerce companies </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Social Sentiment: Correlate shifts in sentiment to revenue or share price of consumer / apparel brand companies</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Step 3: Start with early adopters: quant funds and platform funds</b></h3>
<p><span>Both types of organizations employ teams of people looking to speak with data owners, can move quickly and offer you a price for your data. </span>

<b>You can speak to these people directly and don’t need to work with a data broker or other intermediary, who can demand a revenue share of 50% or more. </b></p><h3><b>Step 4: Sign up early adopters quickly with a limited distribution.</b></h3>
<p><span>Selling data is a multi-stage game. Price discovery and productization can take years. Don’t overthink your first contracts or hold out for the last dollar. Speak to a handful of early adopters, negotiate fair, 1 year contracts with a limited distribution, say 5-10 funds. You can decide the specific number based on conversations with the funds.</span>

<span>Do it quickly so you can then focus your your time and resources on understanding exactly how investors are using your data and determine your strategy when renewals come around.</span></p><h3><b>Step 5: Productize your data</b></h3>
<p><span>Quant, platform and other large hedge funds employ data teams who can extract value from data in nearly any format. Selling into a broader audience of funds requires additional QA and analysis investments into your data product. For more information on developing this team see our post on How to </span><a href="https://alternativedata.org/how-yipitdata-integrates-investment-analysts-data-analysts-and-engineers/"><span>Integrate Investment Analysts, Data Analysts and Engineers</span></a><span>.</span>

<span>Productizing your data means providing additional QA and analysis to enable you to understand it’s value and enable a fund without a large data team to extract value from it. </span>

<span>Productizing your data, regardless of your customer distribution, will make it easier to use by more individuals at your customers, increasing its value.</span></p><h3><b>Step 6: Determine the size of your eventual market</b></h3>
<p><span>Once your first year contract is up, you will need to decide whether you want to expand the size of your distribution. The more funds you sell to, the less valuable your data will be to your customers.</span>

<span>Reasons you may be able to increase your distribution and sell to more types of funds:</span></p><ul>
 	<li><span>It is the #1 dataset of its kind</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Your dataset applies to lots and lots of companies</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>The data is granular and multi-dimensional. It’s more than a single datapoint and different types of investors use it to answer different types of questions</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>You can sell other services on top of the data</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Compliance departments generally prefer datasets with a broader distribution</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>You can develop different data products for different customer types at different price points, so not everyone is getting the same experience </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Diversify your revenue stream across more customers</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Reasons you may want to maintain a limited distribution: </span></p><ul>
 	<li><span>Reduce complexity</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Reduce need for marketing, sales and customer service expenses</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Enjoy higher ASP, higher margins</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>The primary use case of your data is a KPI estimate, which is more quickly commoditized than a granular dataset. Are you providing a revenue estimate or a way to understand an entire industry?</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></h2>
<h3><b>How much money will I make?</b></h3>
<p><span>Reasons you may have unrealistic expectations of the value of your dataset:</span></p><ul>
 	<li><span>The value of your dataset will depend heavily on details such as accuracy, time series, compliance, release schedule</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>It will also depend on factors specific to the target company such as the existence of competitor datasets, the precision of sellside consensus, key investor questions, or the existence of legal/macro/regulatory overhangs</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Investors will pay a large premium for the #1 dataset in a category. Are you #1?</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Rumors of datasets commanding enormous premiums are more viral than ones about datasets nobody wants </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>What about contracts and compliance?</b></h3>
<p><span>Hedge fund customers will demand certain representations about your dataset. The </span><a href="http://yipitdata.com/agreements/msa"><span>YipitData Master Services Agreement</span></a><span> can give you a sense of what to expect. </span>

<span>You should consult a lawyer to help you with contracts relating to your specific dataset and to help you through your customer compliance reviews.</span><span>
</span><b></b></p><h3><b>What should I never do?</b></h3>
<p><span>Provide material, non-public information in violation of securities laws or personally identifiable information.</span>

<span>Provide misleading, doctored or “data-mined” historical correlations.</span>

<span>Conceal significant data outages or other issues that may affect your data's accuracy.</span></p><h2><b>CONCLUSION</b></h2>
<p><span>We think a reasonable go-to-market strategy for hedge funds is:</span></p><ul>
 	<li><span>Start with platform funds and quant funds</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Set up one year contracts with a limited number (5-10) of buyers as soon as possible</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Spend your next year productizing your data and learning about its use cases</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Determine whether or not you want to expand the size of your distribution</span></li>
</ul>

November 1, 2020 | http://www.ronaldjjwong.com/2020/10/31/lazadas-personal-data-breach-and-rethinking-cost-benefit-of-pdpa-compliance/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.ronaldjjwong.com/2020/10/31/lazadas-personal-data-breach-and-rethinking-cost-benefit-of-pdpa-compliance/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-13410">
		<!-- .entry-header -->

	
	<div>
		
<p><a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/lazada-redmart-data-breach-personal-information-millions-account-13415688"><span>Lazada reported</span></a><span> that its Redmart customers’ personal data had been illegally accessed and sold online. The stolen data includes names, phone numbers, email and mailing addresses, </span><i><span>encrypted passwords and partial credit card numbers</span></i><span> of </span><b>1.1 million accounts</b><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>The Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) has been informed. If Lazada is eventually found to have failed to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data, it will be subject to penalties.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Yet, </span><b>one wonders how effective the penalties are on making organisations, especially large profit-making ones, from taking users’ personal data seriously</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p><span>Considering that companies who purport technology as the core driver of their business e.g. in e-commerce and digital services deal with a significant amount of consumers’ personal data as a matter of its core business, one would expect that they would take personal data seriously. Is this the case?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Take, for example, Ninja Van. In Ninja Logistics Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 39, it was found to have knowingly allowed </span><b>1.26 million individuals’ </b><span>data to be at risk of disclosure or unauthorised access–including their name, address, the Tracking ID, and/or the name and signature of the person who had accepted the delivery. The fine was $90,000. That’s 7 cents per individual.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Ninja Van is valued at about $750 million in 2020 based on its Series D funding round of S$395 million. What’s the cost of getting the technological infrastructure secure before the application can go live? It likely costs way more. Did consumers or customers turn elsewhere after the PDPC decision? One wonders.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In Grabcar Pte Ltd [2020] SGPDPC 14, the PDPC noted that </span><b><i>it was the second time the company made the same error</i></b><span> albeit on a different system. It proceeded with the application update without adequate risk assessment of the vulnerability of personal data exposure. About 21,500 individuals’ data was involved. It was fined only $10,000.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Simply put, </span><b>it is possible that for some of these companies, the cost-benefit analysis weighs in favour of taking the risk of personal data breaches than security</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Of course, there is the outlier case of Singapore Health Services Pte. Ltd. &amp; Ors. [2019] SGPDPC 3, involving SingHealth and IHIS, where personal data of more than 1.5 million of SingHealth’s patients and outpatients, including medical records, were accessed and copied following a cybersecurity attack on its system by hackers. What made it more embarrassing was that </span><a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-economy/ihis-fined-record-s750000-singhealth-with-s250000-for-singapores-worst-data"><span>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s medical data</span></a><span> was among that data. Given the highly sensitive nature of the data and the scale, the penalties were $250,000 and $750,000 respectively.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In other cases where the personal data breach appears to be more a matter of ignorance and one-time mistakes, fines in the similar range as Grabcar Pte Ltd [2020] SGPDPC 14 were imposed. For example, in The Travel Corporation (2011) Pte. Ltd. [2019] SGPDPC 42, an employee lost her laptop which contained personal data. Through the incident, it was found that the organisation failed to implement adequate policies and to appoint a Data Protection Officer, and it was fined $12,000. Even so, this raises the same question. </span><b>Is it cheaper to breach the PDPA in such a case than to incur the necessary costs to engage consultants and/or undertake a review and implementation of data protection systems?</b><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Under Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), the maximum fine is $1 million. With recent proposed </span><a href="https://www.mci.gov.sg/public-consultations/public-consultation-items/closing-note-to-pc-on-draft-pdp-(amendment)-bill-including-related-amendments-to-spam-control-act"><span>amendments to the PDPA</span></a><span>, companies with more than $10 million turnover may also possibly face a fine of up to 10% of annual gross turnover. This would possibly give the Act more teeth.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In comparison, under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Article 83(4), GDPR stipulates fines of up to 10 million euros, or up to 2% of its entire global turnover of the preceding fiscal year, whichever is higher for less severe violations. For especially severe violations, Article 83(5), GDPR, stipulates fines of up to 20 million euros, or up to 4 % of their total global turnover of the preceding fiscal year, whichever is higher</span></p>
<p><span>The </span><a href="https://dataprivacymanager.net/5-biggest-gdpr-fines-so-far-2020/"><span>largest penalties</span></a><span> imposed under the GDPR have been substantially more than what we see in Singapore, with EUR 50 million on Google and EUR 35.2 million on retail giant H&amp;M. (See <a href="https://enforcementtracker.com/">GDPR enforcement cases here</a>.)<br>
</span></p>
<p><span>In the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2020/10/ico-fines-british-airways-20m-for-data-breach-affecting-more-than-400-000-customers/">British Airways case</a>, the Information Commissioner’s Officer (ICO) initially fined a whopping GBP 183 million for failing to put in place adequate security measures, resulting in personal data of 400,000 customers being unlawfully accessed. The fine was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54568784">later reduced to GBP 20 million</a> in the light of the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.<br>
</span></p>

<p><span>One hopes that a firmer stance on certain types of companies and businesses will be taken. The amendments to the PDPA on maximum penalty may be the signal for this . We need a culture where organisations, especially for profit companies who deal with significant amounts of personal data will recalibrate their cost-benefit analysis and take users’ personal data seriously with adequate security measures and risk assessments.&nbsp;</span></p>

The experimental programming language Keris extends Java with explicit support
for software evolution. Keris introduces extensible modules as the basic
building blocks for software. Modules are composed hierarchically revealing
explicitly the architecture of systems. A distinct feature of the module
design is that modules do not get linked manually. Instead, the wiring of
modules gets infered. The module assembly and refinement mechanism of Keris
is not restricted to the unanticipated extensibility of atomic modules. It
also allows to extend fully linked systems by replacing selected submodules
with compatible versions without needing to relink the full system.
Extensibility is type-safe and non-invasive; i.e. the extension of a module
preserves the original version and does not require access to source code.

You can download a beta version of the Keris compiler <i>KeCo</i> together with
the extensible Java compiler <i>JaCo</i> here:


<br>

The Keris compiler is implemented as an extension of the extensible
Java compiler <i>JaCo</i> (a reimplementation of the compiler available
<a href="http://zenger.org/jaco/">here</a>). Both, JaCo and
its extension KeCo are implemented in Keris. The source code for both
systems is available for download. It consists of approximately 55000
lines of code split up into 120 source files occupying 3.2MB.
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/">Jakarta Ant</a> is required for
executing the build script which bootstraps the compiler.


<br>

Keris is a conservative extension of Java 2. Keris modules are compiled to
standard Java classfiles. The execution of Keris modules does not require a
special runtime system, nor does it rely on a custom class-loader. For running
the compiler or for executing Keris modules, only a Java Runtime Environment 
of at least version 1.3 is required.

<h2>Spreading the “gospel” to the world</h2>
<p>If you deeply believe something, along the lines of “if everyone did it, the world would be much better off.” and have tried convincing other people to do that thing, then you will realize it’s almost impossible to change others’ opinions or behaviors.</p>
<p>Maybe you’re not that ambitious to convince everyone, so you start small: you share it with your friends, but then discovered nobody actually cares or realizes its significance. A mild version is like <a href="https://www.deathbulge.com/comics/206">showing your favorite TV show and they don’t care</a>:</p>

<p>My faith in evidence-based learning strategies is informed by my personal experience and <a href="https://www.masterhowtolearn.com/2020-02-25-how-to-learn-about-meta-learning-my-resource-list">my meta-learning list</a>. I wholeheartedly believe Spaced Repetition Software (SRS) like SuperMemo and Anki is the key to effective and efficient learning. If you believe education is the future, then the knowledge about evidence-based learning strategies is one big key to unlocking that future, both individually and collectively.</p>
<h2>“Doing this every day seems very tiring.”</h2>
<p>Two years ago I was doing my Anki reps. One friend glanced over and was interested in what I was doing.</p>

<p>We ate lunch together while I was giving her a little presentation. I talked <em>very enthusiastically</em> about spaced repetition, basic memory science and Anki operations. Of course I had to show her the infamous forgetting curve:</p>

<p>She sounded excited about the possibility of finally mastering a second language. But at one point she was confused:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If I hadn’t learned it how could I recall it from memory?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I explained that assessment <strong>for</strong> learning (testing as a means of learning) is different from assessment <strong>of</strong> learning (finding out what you’ve learned). The act of “recalling from memory” is itself a learning process. Then I was aware that her confusion was probably due to a common misconception about memory: human memory works like computer memory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The functional architecture of how humans forget, remember, and learn is <strong>unlike</strong> the corresponding processes in man-made devices […] We think of ourselves as working like computers, we become prone to assuming that exposing ourselves to information and procedures will lead to storage (i.e., recording) of such information or procedures in our memories—that the information will write itself in one’s memory.</p>
<p>If we think of human memory equals to memory in a computer, we are unlikely to appreciate that retrieving information from our memory increases the subsequent accessibility of that information, while retrieving information from computer memory leaves the status of that information unperturbed. <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9780203842539/chapters/10.4324%2F9780203842539-6">On the Symbiosis of Remembering, Forgetting, and Learning</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Side note: this story might give you the impression that I liked to show off what I know. No not really. I like to be convinced with evidence, and I thought others were the same. I was wrong. Also, I included the above quotes for the sake of convincing you, the reader. I didn’t obfuscate the subject matter further with phrases like assessment <strong>for</strong> learning and assessment <strong>of</strong> learning.</p>
<p>She looked… befuddled. Sort of like this:</p>

<p>I remember I was so excited and nervous at the same time that I was fumbling for words, trying to simplify it as much as I could. In retrospect, I was making things worse.</p>
<p>She’d listen to me quite intently, signaling that she was thinking and trying to figure it out, but I could tell she was still confused. And the more I explained, the deeper the rabbit hole went (like keep clicking hyperlinks in Wikipedia), and the more confused she became, so I stopped talking to stop making the whole situation uncomfortable. The following monologue is how I imagine what she was thinking at the time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He’s so passionate about this stuff and so sure of himself that I guess he’s right.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m not really sure what he means. I do want to learn Japanese but the stuff he’s talking about is so confusing…”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I was indeed interested in the beginning, but I don’t really care at this point. I’m just going to pretend I understand and end this whole conversation asap.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will never forget what she said at one point,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Doing this every day seems very tiring.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was like “Yeah…” I never followed up on her progress. I figured if she was truly interested, when she bumped into problem she would ask for my help. As expected, we never talked about it and I never mentioned Anki again.</p>

<p>These has happened countless times. I usually look nonchalant on the outside but dying on the inside. People looked interested (probably due to my enthusiasm and it’s impolite to look otherwise) and then never actually bothered to use Anki. Some would actually try, make a few cards, do the reps for a few days and then say, “I tried and Anki doesn’t work.”</p>
<p>I’m probably over my head, but sometimes it feels like I’m personally attacked, that what I’m saying is not valuable. I understand it’s not true, but it took me years to study the learning science and to gain the experience with Anki/SuperMemo. The fact that they’re dismissing the software feels like they’re dismissing my knowledge and experience.</p>
<h2>The problems of giving advice on how to learn</h2>
<h3>#1. Nobody cares <em>that</em> much, alright?</h3>
<p>When I first discovered Anki I was like, “How come no one around me knows this?! I need to share this to everyone!” So I would tell my friends about Anki but nobody was interested. I’ve introduced Anki to people and every time it’s a very frustrating experience. (Surprise surprise, not SuperMemo. The learning curve of Anki is much lower. What chance do I have if I preached SuperMemo when they even think Anki is too hard to use?)</p>
<p>Update: I was never a missionary and randomly went out my way to tell people about Anki all the time like this:</p>

<p>Very early on I did give unsolicited advice once to my best friend by intentionally bringing up Anki. Then I did bring up Anki on multiple occasions, but only when the opportunity presented itself, like the story above.</p>
<p>People may be interested in how you’ve developed a skill or become fluent in a foreign language, but just not <strong>that</strong> interested. And they certainly don’t expect to be suddenly lectured on how learning and memory work.</p>
<p>I never liked following up to people with questions like “So how’s Anki? Have you used it?” It feels like pushing an agenda to them. Also, since most would not even bother buying and downloading the app, their response is usually, “I forgot about it. I’ll do it later.” and the conversation would end in an awkward tone.</p>
<h3>#2. I’m not sure if I actually want it, alright?</h3>
<p>Sometimes people keep lamenting “I want to learn X or I want to get better grades.” How many times do you hear people say they want to learn a second language? This is like that friend who keeps saying “I want to lose weight”. Probably after all, they’re just lamenting and not yet ready to put in the effort to change.</p>
<p>Trying to convince others to use Anki/SuperMemo is like trying to convince your friends to go to the gym regularly. You can talk about the benefits of exercising/weight-lifting, how good you’ll feel afterwards, how much more productive you’ll be and so on. But nothing will work if they don’t try it in the first place, and it doesn’t help that spaced repetition doesn’t work in the short-term since using Spaced Repetition Software is a life-long pursuit (just as learning is):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This long term focus may explain why explicit spaced repetition is an uncommon studying technique: the pay-off is distant &amp; counterintuitive, the cost of self-control near &amp; vivid. <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition">Gwern’s Spaced Repetition for Efficient Learning</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>#3. Why are you so hyped about it?</h3>
<p>It’s rare if people could understand and realize the significance and application of Spaced Repetition Software in a casual 10-min chat. It’s not about the complexity (it’s not rocket science after all), but rather it’s about awareness: problems with current learning approaches and how Anki/SuperMemo could solve the problems. In other words, if I don’t see the problems, why bother changing?</p>
<p>I have a friend who was learning German. She copied German vocabulary on one side and the equivalent English on the other in a notebook. I showed her my Korean Anki cards: “Take a look at these beautiful images! Gifs! Sentence cards! Audio clips! Mass Immersion Approach! (Former: All Japanese All The Time (AJATT)), Stephen Krashen’s Input Hypothesis!” Then I had another friend who was studying to become a nurse. I told him about Anki: “Image occlusion for anatomy!” It felt wrong of me to be hiding Anki (<a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1374772155">Image Occlusion</a> to be specific) from him. Deep down I want to shove their faces to this table:</p>

<p>I was exaggerating but you get the point: it’s not possible to convey the significance and application of it all in a casual 10-min chat. With the benefit of hindsight, all my attempts could’ve been a lot better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe I was so convinced and have so much faith in Spaced Repetition Software that I came off as condescending, giving off the impression like “you don’t know how to study; let me teach you.”</li>
<li>Maybe it’s the bold claims: “You’ll get 2x results with half the study time.” (How many are really true whenever you hear such claim?)</li>
<li>Maybe it’s the situation: all he or she wants is someone to listen about the difficulty of studying, not some real advice or suggestions.</li>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>I am busy preparing a blog post for quantum Shor’s factorization algorithm. Shor’s algorithm is complicated if the reader would like to understand all of its mathematics from scratch. I have created several building-block posts toward Shor’s algorithm, including <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Discrete-Fourier-Transform/">“Discrete Fourier Transform”</a>, <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Euclidean-Algorithm/">“Euclidean Algorithm”</a>, and <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Composite-Number-Factorization/">“Composite Number Factorization Using Modular Exponentiation Period”</a>. Each of them is self-contained and is a must to fully understand Shor’s algorithm mathematically.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to finish the last building-block post toward Shor’s algorithm which is an interesting mathematical property of the application of discrete Fourier transform on $0/1$ periodic sequences.</p>

<h3 id="discrete-fourier-transform-for-01-periodic-sequences">Discrete Fourier Transform for 0/1 Periodic Sequences</h3>

<h4 id="01-periodic-sequences">0/1 Periodic Sequences</h4>

<p>The $0/1$ periodic sequence is a periodic sequence in which for each period all the values are $0$ except for one value is $1$. For example, $\{0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0\}$ is such kind of periodic sequence whose unique subsequence is $\{0,0,1,0\}$. $\{0,0,1,0\}$, $\{1,0,0,0\}$, $\{0,0,0,1\}$ are also considered to be valid unique subsequences. The period of this sequence is $4$.</p>

<h4 id="discrete-fourier-transform-for-01-periodic-sequences-1">Discrete Fourier Transform for 0/1 Periodic Sequences</h4>

<p>To see the effect of discrete Fourier transform on $0/1$ periodic sequences, let’s take a look at some examples first. Here I have prepared four real valued $0/1$ periodic sequences, the length of each of them is $N = 2^8 = 256$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
f_1 &amp;= \{ \underbrace{ 0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,\cdots,0,0,1,0}_{N = 2^8}\} \\
f_2 &amp;= \{ \underbrace{ 0,0,1,0,0,1,\cdots,0,0,1,0}_{N = 2^8} \} \\
F_1 &amp;= \{ \underbrace{ 0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,\cdots,0,0,1,0}_{N = 2^8} \} \\
F_2 &amp;= \{ \underbrace{ 0,0,1,0,0,1,\cdots,0,0,1,0}_{N = 2^8} \} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Actually they are two sequences since $f_1 = F_1$ and $f_2 = F_2$. I used different notations for same sequences because $f$ would be applied discrete Fourier transformation, whereas $F$ would be applied inverse discrete Fourier transformation. The unique subsequence for $f_1$ and $F_1$ is $\{0,0,1,0\}$, and the unique subsequence for $f_2$ and $F_2$ is $\{0,0,1\}$. Therefore, the period for $f_1$ and $F_1$ is $4$, and the period for $f_2$ and $F_2$ is $3$. Note that the period for $f_1$ and $F_1$ divides $N = 2^8$ whereas the period for $f_2$ and $F_2$ does not.</p>



<p>The sequence could also be complex-numbered. The magnitude $\rho$ of a complex number $a + b i$ is $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. If the complex number is represented using polar coordinates $\rho e^{i\theta}$, the magnitude is just $\rho$ then. So the magnitude of the sequence is represented by $\rho_{f}$ or $\rho_{F}$.</p>



<p>We further define the “normalized probability” for a sequence. The concept of “probability” is less useful in this context, but it will become extremely useful when we discuss quantum computing and Shor’s factorization algorithm. The normalized probability for each element $f[i]$ in the sequence is defined as</p><p>

\[p_f[i] = \frac{\rho_{f}[i]^2}{\sum_{j=1}^{N}\rho_{f}[j]^2}\]

</p><p>or</p><p>

\[p_F[i] = \frac{\rho_{F}[i]^2}{\sum_{j=1}^{N}\rho_{F}[j]^2}\]

</p><p>If we apply discrete Fourier transform and inverse discrete Fourier transform to such sequence, let’s see what will happen. We will use a Python program for demonstration.</p>

<p>In fact, the magnitude of the output sequences from discrete Fourier transform and inverse discrete Fourier transform are also perfect $0/1$ periodic sequences for $f_1$ and $F_1$ and almost $0/1$ periodic sequences for $f_2$ and $F_2$. Suppose the period of $0/1$ periodic sequences before discrete Fourier transform or inverse discrete Transform is $r$, then the period of the output sequences is exactly $\frac{N}{r}$ for sequences whose period $r$ divides $N$, such as $f_1$ and $F_1$, and around $\frac{N}{r}$ for sequences whose period $r$ does divide $N$, such as $f_2$ and $F_2$.</p>



<p>The period of $f_1$ is $4$, the period of $f_2$ is $3$, and $N = 2^8 = 256$. We found the period of the magnitude or probability of the output sequence from discrete Fourier transform is $64$ for $f_1$ and $85$ for $f_2$. Note that $64 = \frac{256}{4}$ and $85 \approx \frac{256}{3}$.</p>



<p>The same effect also holds for inverse discrete Fourier transform.</p>



<p>Therefore, formally, suppose the input $0/1$ periodic sequence has period $r$ and length $N$, after discrete Fourier transform or inverse discrete Fourier transform, the normalized probabilities of the output sequence will have period $r^{\prime}$ exactly equal to $\frac{N}{r}$ if $r$ divides $N$, or $r^{\prime}$ around $\frac{N}{r}$ if $r$ does not divide $N$. The highest normalized probabilities will occur at positions $k \frac{N}{r}$ where $k = 0, 1, \cdots, r-1$. The normalized probabilities for all the rest of the positions will be $0$ if $r$ divides $N$ or almost $0$ if $r$ does not divide $N$.</p>

<h4 id="mathematical-proof">Mathematical Proof</h4>

<p>To explain this phenomenon mathematically, I would like to derive a proof for inverse discrete Fourier transform and the scenario where $r$ divides $N$. For the scenario where $r$ does not divide $N$, I would also try to explain intuitively with mathematics. For discrete Fourier transform, it could be proved using similar mathematical processes.</p>



<p><em>Proof</em></p>



<p>The inverse Fourier transform is mathematically defined as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
f[n] &amp;= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k = 0}^{N-1} F[k] e^{i \frac{2\pi k n}{N}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We defined offset $b$ as the distance between the beginning of the unique sequence and the position of $1$ in the unique sequence. Then we must have</p><p>

\[f[b] = f[b + kr]\]

</p><p>where $k$ is any non-negative integer, as long as $b + kr &lt; N$.</p>



<p>Assuming $r$ divides $N$, the inverse discrete Fourier transform for $0/1$ periodic sequence becomes</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
f[n] &amp;= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k = 0}^{N-1} F[k] e^{i \frac{2\pi k n}{N}} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{N} \bigg( \underbrace{ F[b] e^{i \frac{2\pi b n}{N}} + F[b + r] e^{i \frac{2\pi (b + r) n}{N}} + \cdots + F[b + (\frac{N}{r} - 1) r] e^{i \frac{2\pi (b + (\frac{N}{r} - 1) r) n}{N}} }_{\frac{N}{r}} \bigg) \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{N} \big( \underbrace{ F[b] e^{i \frac{2\pi b n}{N}} + F[b] e^{i \frac{2\pi (b + r) n}{N}} + \cdots + F[b] e^{i \frac{2\pi (b + (\frac{N}{r} - 1) r) n}{N}} }_{\frac{N}{r}} \big) \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{N} F[b] \big( \underbrace{ e^{i \frac{2\pi b n}{N}} + e^{i \frac{2\pi (b + r) n}{N}} + \cdots + e^{i \frac{2\pi (b + (\frac{N}{r} - 1) r) n}{N}} }_{\frac{N}{r}} \big) \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{N} F[b] e^{i \frac{2\pi b n}{N}} \big( \underbrace{ 1 + e^{i \frac{2\pi r n}{N}} + \cdots + e^{i \frac{2\pi (\frac{N}{r} - 1) r n}{N}} }_{\frac{N}{r}} \big) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Note that $\{1, e^{i \frac{2\pi r n}{N}}, \cdots, e^{i \frac{2\pi (\frac{N}{r} - 1) r n}{N}} \}$ is a geometric sequence. We would have to compute the sum of the geometric sequence.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\underbrace{ 1 + e^{i \frac{2\pi r n}{N}} + \cdots + e^{i \frac{2\pi (\frac{N}{r} - 1) r n}{N}} }_{\frac{N}{r}} &amp;=
\begin{cases}
  \frac{N}{r} &amp; \text{if $e^{i \frac{2\pi r n}{N}} = 1$}\\
  \frac{1 - \big(e^{i \frac{2\pi r n}{N}}\big)^{\frac{N}{r}} }{1 - e^{i \frac{2\pi r n}{N}}} &amp; \text{else}\\
\end{cases} \\
&amp;= 
\begin{cases}
  \frac{N}{r} &amp; \text{if $e^{i \frac{2\pi r n}{N}} = 1$}\\
  \frac{1 - e^{i 2\pi n} }{1 - e^{i \frac{2\pi r n}{N}}} &amp; \text{else}\\
\end{cases} \\
&amp;= 
\begin{cases}
  \frac{N}{r} &amp; \text{if $e^{i \frac{2\pi r n}{N}} = 1$}\\
  \frac{1 - 1 }{1 - e^{i \frac{2\pi r n}{N}}} &amp; \text{else}\\
\end{cases} \\
&amp;= 
\begin{cases}

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>New work from home (WFH) policies might have you thinking about whether it’s worth it to stay in California or move to a state with a lower cost of living, lower real estate prices, and lower taxes. When thinking about what’s right for you and your family, there’s a lot to consider. Will there be cost-of-living salary adjustments? Will you be closer to or further from family? What do future job opportunities look like elsewhere? Is working from home a good long-term fit for you, or are you happier or more productive at the office?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But there’s one important consideration that may not be on your radar yet. How long will you have to keep paying taxes in California after you leave?&nbsp;</p><p>For tech employees with equity compensation, it’s usually not a clean break, even after establishing residency in a different state. In some cases, you might pay taxes in California for years after leaving.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The tax you pay depends on the type and timeline of your equity compensation. Where you live at <em>grant date</em>, <em>vest date</em>, <em>exercise date</em> (if any), and <em>sale date</em> is what matters. We’ll break it all down for you across each type of equity compensation, so you know when you’ll finally be done paying tax to California whether you’re a <strong>CA resident</strong> or a <strong>non-CA resident</strong>.</p><p>The tax you pay depends on the type and timeline of your equity compensation.

We’ll break it all down for you across each type of equity compensation, so you know when you’ll finally be done paying tax to California.</p><ul role="list"><li>Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)</li><li>Non-Qualified Stock Options (NSOs)</li><li>Incentive Stock Options (ISOs)</li><li>Employee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPP)</li></ul><h3><strong>RSU Taxation</strong></h3><p>Let’s start with how taxes on Restricted Stock Units typically work. RSUs are generally taxable like salary when shares vest. The taxable income incurred on each vest is calculated as follows:</p><p><strong>RSU Wage Income</strong> = (# of shares vesting) x (share price on date of vest)</p><p>This is standard for the IRS, but what about from a state perspective? Because tax laws differ across states, it all depends on where you live on three key dates: when RSUs are granted, when RSUs vest, and when RSUs are sold.</p><p>If you are a <strong>CA resident</strong> when the stock was granted through when it vests, the entire value is taxable income in CA. But what if you leave California after grant but before vesting?</p><blockquote>EX: As a CA resident, your new job started on June 1, 2018, and you received a grant of 10,000 RSUs at a public company. Your RSUs have a 4-year vesting schedule with a 12-month cliff, and shares vest annually thereafter. On May 1, 2020 you moved to Austin, TX. How are the 2,500 RSUs that vest on June 1, 2020 taxed now that you are a resident of Texas?</blockquote><p>As a CA resident on the grant date but not the vesting date, California applies a “days worked” calculation to determine how much of the taxable income for RSUs vesting on June 1, 2020 is attributable to services performed while living in CA.&nbsp;</p><p>The calculation is called the Allocation Ratio, and it’s calculated by taking the total number of workdays you spent <em>in California</em> between grant date (6/1/18) and vest date (6/1/2020), and dividing it by the total number of workdays between 6/1/2018 and 6/1/2020.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Allocation Ratio</strong> = (total workdays in CA between grant and vest) ÷ (total workdays between grant and vest)</p><p>To find your allocation ratio,<a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/date/workdays.html"> this online calculator</a> is a great place to start. Be sure to exclude vacation/holidays and weekends, and include the end date.</p><p>Once you know your Allocation Ratio, multiply your total RSU income from the 6/1/2020 vest date by your Allocation Ratio.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CA Taxable Income</strong> = (Total RSU income from vest) x (Allocation Ratio)</p><p>And keep in mind that when your shares vest in 2021 and 2022, a portion will still be taxable in California.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have RSUs at a private company, the logic is the same as explained above, but the allocation ratio is determined by grant date and liquidity date (your ability to sell) rather than vest date.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d60577d7a6c5d1ac084a849/5ee78cc02dbae84d9c56cc82_RSU%20Summary.PNG" alt=""></p></figure><h3><strong>NSO Taxation</strong></h3><p>Non-Qualified Stock Options are typically taxed at two key events. The first is when you exercise the right to purchase vested shares. The second time taxes are triggered is when you sell your shares.&nbsp;</p><p>So let’s focus on the first tax trigger. The amount that’s taxable when you exercise the right to purchase shares is the <em>spread</em>, which is the difference between the fair market value (FMV) of the stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price. Like salary, the <em>spread </em>&nbsp;is taxed as wage income.</p><p><strong>NSO Wage Income</strong> = (# of shares exercised) x (FMV - exercise price)&nbsp;</p><p>If you were a <strong>CA resident</strong> when the shares were granted and exercised, all income is attributable to work performed in CA, so the entire <em>spread</em> is taxable in CA.</p><p>However, if you were a <strong>CA resident </strong>at grant<strong> </strong>but a <strong>non-CA resident</strong> when you exercised, CA uses the “days worked” calculation to determine how much of the wage income is attributable to services performed while in CA.</p><blockquote>EX: As a CA resident, your new job started on June 1, 2018, and you received a grant of 10,000 NSOs at a $1 exercise price. Your NSOs have a 4-year vesting schedule with a 12-month cliff, and shares vest annually thereafter. On June 2, 2019 the FMV is $2 and you exercised the 2,500 NSOs that vest. On May 1, 2020 you move to Austin, TX. On June 1, 2020 another 2,500 NSOs vest and you exercise them on June 3, 2020 when the FMV is $3. Assuming no shares have been sold, what are the tax implications?&nbsp;</blockquote><p>Since you were a <strong>CA resident</strong> from grant date through the first exercise, 100% of the <em>spread </em>is attributable to services performed in CA for 2019 taxes.</p><p>2020 CA taxable income from NSO wages is determined by the Allocation Ratio for the number of days worked <em>in California</em> between grant date (6/1/2018) and exercise date (6/3/2020), and dividing the total number of workdays between those dates.</p><p><strong>CA Taxable Income </strong>= (NSO Wage Income) x (Allocation Ratio)</p><p>The allocation ratio for future exercises is determined by the date of exercise.</p><p>Now let’s address that second key time that taxes are triggered for NSOs. If you leave CA after exercise but before you sell your shares, any capital gain or loss on the sold stock as a <strong>non-CA resident </strong>is not considered CA income. However, if you re-establish residency in California prior to sale, CA will tax 100% of the capital gains proceeds.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d60577d7a6c5d1ac084a849/5ee78d054a550d0f0039df88_NSO%20Summary.PNG" alt=""></p></figure><h3><strong>ISO Taxation</strong></h3><p>Incentive Stock Options are taxable at exercise and at sale, like NSOs. Unlike NSOs, exercising ISOs <em>may or may not</em> trigger a tax. The ISO <em>spread</em> is included in the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) calculation rather than the traditional tax calculation like NSO wage income.&nbsp;</p><p>State and federal AMT calculations are complex and beyond the scope of this essay. As you’ll see on the table at the end of this section, California applies the Allocation Ratio to determine the tax implications of exercising ISOs because CA has its own AMT calculation. If you want to dive down the AMT rabbit hole you can learn more in the <a href="https://www.upstartwealth.com/blog/your-definitive-guide-to-equity-compensation#amt">AMT section</a> of our equity comp guide.</p><p>For now, let’s focus on the decision we know will impact your taxes - selling ISOs.</p><blockquote>EX: As a CA resident, your new job started on June 1, 2018, and you received a grant of 10,000 ISOs at a $1 exercise price. Your ISOs have a 4-year vesting schedule with a 12-month cliff, and shares vest annually thereafter. On June 2, 2019 the FMV is $2 and you exercised the 2,500 ISOs that vest. On May 1, 2020 you move to Austin, TX. On June 1, 2020 another 2,500 ISOs vest and you exercise them on June 3, 2020 when the FMV is $3. What are the tax implications if on July 15, 2020 you sell all 5,000 of your exercised ISOs?</blockquote><p>When an ISO is sold it is either a <em>qualifying disposition </em>or a<em> disqualifying disposition.</em></p><p><em>Qualifying dispositions</em> apply to ISOs sold at least 24 months after the grant date <em>and</em> 12 months from exercise. Qualifying dispositions are taxed at long-term capital gains rates on the difference between the sale price and the exercise price. The 2,500 ISOs exercised in June 2019 meet the 24-month and 12-month thresholds, and would be a qualifying disposition. Since you were a <strong>non-CA resident</strong> at sale, none of the gain is taxable in California.</p><p><em>Disqualifying dispositions</em> apply to ISOs sold within 24 months of grant date <em>or</em> 12 months of exercise. The July 2020 sale was within 12 months of the June 2020 exercise, so the gain on these 2,500 shares is taxed like NSOs because they do not qualify for the special tax treatment. This means the Allocation Ratio comes into play to determine the <em>spread</em> attributable to days worked in CA, which is included as wage income.&nbsp;</p><p>Although there are too many possible scenarios to model all the CA tax implications for ISOs, the table below can help you prepare for questions to ask your tax preparer in advance of your decision to exercise or sell.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d60577d7a6c5d1ac084a849/5ee78de5b214fd3ee43cc897_ISO%20Summary.PNG" alt=""></p></figure><h3><strong>ESPP Taxation</strong></h3><p>ESPP shares are generally included in taxable income when you sell the shares. The <em>spread </em>between the FMV at purchase and the purchase price is included as wages at sale. Similar to ISOs, ESPP sales are either <em>qualifying</em> or <em>disqualifying dispositions</em>. The difference between sale price and FMV at purchase is taxed at capital gains rates based on how long the shares were held.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are a <strong>CA resident</strong> at the beginning of the buying period (think grant date), but a <strong>non-CA resident</strong> when you sell, CA will tax you on a portion of the proceeds based on the number of days you worked in CA during the buying period (think exercise or vest date). But that tax is still only triggered at sale, even if that’s several years after moving out of CA.</p><p>The “days worked” formula is different for ESPP shares than for RSUs. Here, CA only counts the days between the beginning and the end of the buying period (when the shares transfer to you and are eligible for sale).</p><p>The Allocation Ratio based on days worked is multiplied by the wage income from the <em>spread</em>. Any gain or loss beyond that discount would only be taxable in CA if you were a CA resident upon sale.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d60577d7a6c5d1ac084a849/5ee78e17920b37ec97af3dcb_ESPP%20Summary.PNG" alt=""></p></figure><h4><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong></h4><p>If you’re thinking …</p></div></div>

    <div id="ExplainGitCommit-Container">
      <p>
        We are going to skip instructing you on how to add your files for commit in this explanation.
        Let's assume you already know how to do that. If you don't, go read some other tutorials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pretend that you already have your files staged for commit and enter <span>git commit</span>
        as many times as you like in the terminal box.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitTag-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git tag name</span> will create a new tag named "name".
        Creating tags just creates a new tag pointing to the currently checked out commit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tags can be deleted using the command <span>git tag -d name</span> (coming soon).
      </p>
      <p>
        Type <span>git commit</span> and <span>git tag</span> commands
        to your hearts desire until you understand this concept.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitBranch-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git branch name</span> will create a new branch named "name".
        Creating branches just creates a new tag pointing to the currently checked out commit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Branches can be deleted using the command <span>git branch -d name</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Type <span>git commit</span> and <span>git branch</span> commands
        to your hearts desire until you understand this concept.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitCheckout-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git checkout</span> has many uses,
        but the main one is to switch between branches.<br>
        For example, to switch from master branch to dev branch,
        I would type <span>git checkout dev</span>.
        After that, if I do a git commit, notice where it goes. Try it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to checking out branches, you can also checkout individual commits. Try it.<br>
        Make a new commit and then type <span>git checkout bb92e0e</span>
        and see what happens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Type <span>git commit</span>, <span>git branch</span>,
        and <span>git checkout</span> commands to your hearts desire
        until you understand this concept.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitCheckout-b-Container">
      <p>
        You can combine <span>git branch</span> and <span>git checkout</span>
        into a single command by typing <span>git checkout -b branchname</span>.
        This will create the branch if it does not already exist and immediately check it out.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitReset-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git reset</span> will move HEAD and the current branch back to wherever
        you specify, abandoning any commits that may be left behind. This is useful to undo a commit
        that you no longer need.
      </p>
      <p>
        This command is normally used with one of three flags: "--soft", "--mixed", and "--hard".
        The soft and mixed flags deal with what to do with the work that was inside the commit after
        you reset, and you can read about it <a href="http://git-scm.com/2011/07/11/reset.html">here</a>.
        Since this visualization cannot graphically display that work, only the "--hard" flag will work
        on this site.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ref "HEAD^" is usually used together with this command. "HEAD^" means "the commit right
        before HEAD. "HEAD^^" means "two commits before HEAD", and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that you must <b>never</b> use <span>git reset</span> to abandon commits
        that have already been pushed and merged into the origin. This can cause your local repository
        to become out of sync with the origin. Don't do it unless you really know what you're doing.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitRevert-Container">
      <p>
        To undo commits that have already been pushed and shared with the team, we cannot use the
        <span>git reset</span> command. Instead, we have to use <span>git revert</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>git revert</span> will create a new commit that will undo all of the work that
        was done in the commit you want to revert.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitMerge-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git merge</span> will create a new commit with two parents. The resulting
        commit snapshot will have the all of the work that has been done in both branches.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there was no divergence between the two commits, git will do a "fast-forward" method merge.<br>
        To see this happen, checkout the 'ff' branch and then type <span>git merge dev</span>.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitRebase-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git rebase</span> will take the commits on this branch and "move" them so that their
        new "base" is at the point you specify.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should pay close attention to the commit IDs of the circles as they move when you do this exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason I put "move" in quotations because this process actually generates brand new commits with
        completely different IDs than the old commits, and leaves the old commits where they were. For this reason,
        you never want to rebase commits that have already been shared with the team you are working with.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitFetch-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git fetch</span> will update all of the "remote tracking branches" in your local repository.
        Remote tracking branches are tagged in grey.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitPull-Container">
      <p>
        A <span>git pull</span> is a two step process that first does a <span>git fetch</span>,
        and then does a <span>git merge</span> of the remote tracking branch associated with your current branch.
        If you have no current branch, the process will stop after fetching.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the argument "--rebase" was given by typing <span>git pull --rebase</span>, the second step of
        pull process will be a rebase instead of a merge. This can be set to the default behavior by configuration by typing:
        <span>git config branch.BRANCHNAME.rebase true</span>.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitPush-Container">
      <p>
        A <span>git push</span> will find the commits you have on your local branch that the corresponding branch
        on the origin server does not have, and send them to the remote repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        By default, all pushes must cause a fast-forward merge on the remote repository. If there is any divergence between
        your local branch and the remote branch, your push will be rejected. In this scenario, you need to pull first and then
        you will be able to push again.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitClean-Container">
      <p>
        One simple example of the use of <span>git reset</span> is to completely restore your local repository
        state to that of the origin.<br>
        You can do so by typing <span>git reset origin/master</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that this won't delete untracked files, you will have to delete those separately with
        the command <span>git clean -df</span>.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitFetchRebase-Container">
      <p>
        Below is a situation in which you are working in a local branch that is all your own. You want to receive the latest code
        from the origin server's master branch. To update your local branch, you can do it without having to switch branches!
      </p>
      <p>
        First do a <span>git fetch</span>, then type <span>git rebase origin/master</span>!
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitDeleteBranches-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git branch -d</span> is used to delete branches.
        I have pre-created a bunch of branches for you to delete in the playground below.
        Have at it.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitFree-Container">

October 31, 2020 | https://liuliu.me/eyes/a-core-data-alternative-crossed-platform-to-linux/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://liuliu.me/eyes/a-core-data-alternative-crossed-platform-to-linux/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the past a few months, I’ve worked on <a href="https://dflat.io/">Dflat</a>, among <a href="https://liuliu.me/eyes/migrating-ios-project-to-bazel-a-real-world-experience/">many</a> <a href="https://liuliu.me/eyes/loading-csv-file-at-the-speed-limit-of-the-nvme-storage/">other</a> <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc/">things</a>. The theme is to explore a workflow using <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> as the build and deployment system, and <a href="https://swift.org/">Swift</a> as the main language for data exploration, modeling, and production system.</p>

<p>Dflat appears to be an outlier for this theme. I simply have the urge to implement what I considered to be the one-true-way of doing structured data persistence on mobile, and to share it with the wider community. It was designed squarely for mobile data persistence needs, much like Core Data before. Case in point, the backing data engine has always been SQLite.</p>

<p>Up until recently. As I dug deeper in this <em>Swift for data exploration, modeling and production system</em> theme, it is increasingly likely that I need some data persistence mechanism. It may not be as fancy as for mobile, where I can observe changes and rely on one-way data flow to update UI. But it is darned nice to specify schema explicitly, persisting to a proper database, and don’t worry about schema upgrade at all.</p>

<p>For the past couple of the days, I’ve worked on porting <a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com/liuliu/dflat">Dflat to Linux</a>. With some minimal work (mostly around <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/dflat/blob/unstable/external/sqlite3.BUILD#L13">figuring out the right SQLite compilation flags</a> and moving code from one place to another to make Swift Linux runtime happy), it is done. I’ve also added some <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/dflat/blob/unstable/dflat.bzl#L33">Bazel rules</a> for code generation, so if you use Bazel, Dflat would work wonders out of the box.</p>

<p>What does this mean? If you use <a href="https://swift.org/download/#releases">Swift in Linux</a>, you don’t need to interact with SQLite directly any more. Dflat handles SQLite concurrency control, proper SQLite configuration, strongly-typed queries, data schema management, transparent (and read-only) backward compatible upgrades. Beyond that, it offers query subscription so for a long-running program, you can simply subscribe to a query and update based on the changed results.</p>

<h3 id="an-example">An Example</h3>

<p>If you happen to do Bazel + Swift on Linux, using Dflat is simple. In <code>WORKSPACE</code> file, add following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

3
4

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>For the binary that requires to persist some user settings, you can start to edit the schema file: <code>user.fbs</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td><td><pre>table User {
    username: string (primary);
    accessTime: double;

<p>In your <code>BUILD.bazel</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

<h3 id="beyond-server--client-relationship">Beyond Server / Client Relationship</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/dflat/blob/unstable/BUILD#L30">Bazel</a> and <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/dflat/blob/unstable/Package.swift#L21">Swift Package Manager</a> version of Dflat for Linux packaged <a href="https://swift.org/download/#releases">SQLite 3.33.0</a> in source-form. It enables some interesting ideas. With a little bit more work, we may as well compile Dflat to run <a href="https://swiftwasm.org/">in WebAssembly</a>. Wasm can be the ideal form to be deployed at edge nodes. When worked on Snapchat app in the past, I’ve long theorized that we could deploy peering nodes for customers, and the server / device communication can be replaced with server / peering node / device with peering node and device <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/update_hook.html">syncing materialized views incrementally</a> through some kind of <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/binary-log-overview.html">binlog</a> mechanism. It looks like this kind of architecture can be done, if we have some kind of uniformity between peering nodes and mobile devices.</p>

<h3 id="beyond-sqlite">Beyond SQLite</h3>

<p>Even Dflat now supports Linux, it doesn’t mean this is a server software. Advanced features such as <a href="https://dflat.io/runtime-api/#data-subscription">live query subscription</a> can only happen if you go through a single <code>Workspace</code> instance. To make Dflat work in Linux, we actually deepened the SQLite and Dflat relationship by promoting some code from SQLiteDflat to Dflat.</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean we cannot change the backing data engine. Dflat could potentially help server-grade databases such as PostgreSQL in other ways. <a href="https://dflat.io/notes/upgrade/">The smooth schema evolution</a> would be an interesting way to formalize what <a href="https://eng.uber.com/schemaless-part-one-mysql-datastore/">people like Uber already did</a>.</p>

<p>A server-grade database such as <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-listen.html">PostgreSQL could also potentially support live query subscription</a> across many <code>Workspace</code> instances with some substantial redesign of Dflat internals.</p>

<h3 id="exploration-ahead">Exploration Ahead</h3>

<p>Supporting Dflat on Linux enables some interesting design space exploration (for one, I need to change <code>Workspace.shutdown()</code> semantics to better work with short-lived command-line programs). Whether a mobile-focused database would work for a variety of Linux-based workflows is a question without definitive answer still. I would continue my exploration in the meantime and report back on any substantial findings.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>TORONTO -- 
	Lisa Carr never thought her work would lead to armed threats, a firebombing, a shooting and a conspiracy to kill her.</p>
<p>
	The Carr Law office is in a nondescript strip mall in Vaughan, Ont., north of Toronto. It’s closed now, after the litigation lawyer says police told her they could no longer protect her.</p>
<p>
	She was shuttled to another country where she spent five long months in hiding. Carr has never before told her story, but agreed to meet for an interview as part of a W5 investigation into the shady underbelly of an industry that forced her to give up her business and almost cost her, her life: The tow truck industry.</p>
<p>
	Over the last number of years, criminal elements have been battling for lucrative control of the major highways around the Toronto area. It has resulted in more than 50 arsons, multiple shootings and at least four murders.</p>
<p>
	So why is there so much violence over a couple of hundred-dollar tows at the side of the road? Because that one tow can net tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>
	Here’s how it works: The tow truck driver gets a kickback from an unscrupulous auto body shop, which then submits wildly inflated repair fees to an insurance company.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="york police" src="https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4954903!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_960/image.jpg"></p>
<p>
	The insurance industry estimates that fake repair bills tally up to $2 billion a year in Canada. And that’s why Carr was in the crosshairs. She was hired by an insurance company to challenge bogus claims.</p>
<p>
	Over the course of a number of months, Carr’s law firm was the target of increasingly violent attacks. First a firebombing and then her office was set on fire.</p>
<p>
	Months later, in broad daylight, a colleague leaving work had a gun put to her head and was told, “Stop suing our friends.” Shortly after that, again in broad daylight, someone opened fire through the front door of the busy office.</p>
<p>
	Carr says it is incredible no one was struck by the flurry of bullets.</p>
<p>
	“I looked down the hall and I saw my receptionist on her hands and knees surrounded by glass. And one of the other girls came running at me saying, ‘Shots fired, shots fired. Call 911.’”</p>
<p>
	While the violence surrounding the tow truck industry has made headlines in the Greater Toronto Area, the story that has never been told is that York Regional Police (YRP) uncovered a plot to kill Carr.</p>
<p>
	It was such a credible threat that they gave her an hour to pack up her belongings and leave her home. Carr and her husband were then whisked out of the country and spent five months in hiding.</p>
<p>
	Three separate police services – YRP, Toronto Police Service and Ontario Provincial Police – joined forces to launch Project Platinum to investigate the violence associated with the tow truck industry.</p>
<p>
	They carried out a series of raids this past spring, which netted dozens of high-powered weapons and led to the arrests of 35 people who face almost 500 charges, including the attempted murder of Carr.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="weapon" src="https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4954983!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_960/image.jpg"></p>
<p>
	Now back in Canada, Carr says police have told her she is likely no longer in danger, but with one caveat.</p>
<p>
	“The police said we believe the risk is low. As long as you don't go back to work, as long as you don't restart the firm,” she says.</p>
<p>
	“So they have effectively ended my career. We lost everything. They won.”</p>
                                              </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The new EC2 Nitro Enclaves enable virtual machines to process private data without exposing its encryption key to the parent instance. In this post we will explore how Nitro Enclaves are used to securely process private keys stored in ACM.</p>
<p>This is part 2 in a two-part article. In the first part we review why Nitro Enclaves matter and how they can benefit your sensitive workloads: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sentiatechblog.com/acm-for-nitro-enclaves-its-a-big-deal">ACM for Nitro Enclaves - It’s a Big Deal</a>.</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This article follows the steps outlined in AWS’ documentation: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave-refapp.html">AWS Certificate Manager for Nitro Enclaves</a>. In their article, AWS builds the following architecture.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/4volL2Vsj6GH8kyvLASvYq/ceb73ac4e50f8779794628e56900f2b7/refarch.png?fit=scale&amp;w=1330" alt="ACM Reference Architecture"></p>
<p>As discussed in <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sentiatechblog.com/acm-for-nitro-enclaves-its-a-big-deal">part 1</a>, it’s essential for private keys stored in ACM to never be exposed. As such, it’s interesting to see how AWS keeps these private keys secure, while still hosting them on your (relatively insecure) EC2 instance. The answer, of course, lies in the new <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-isolated-ec2-environments-to-process-confidential-data/">Nitro Enclaves</a>.</p>
<p>The two main topics for this post are:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are private keys transmitted (and can we intercept them)?</li>
<li>How are permissions assigned to the Nitro Enclave (and can we assume them)?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Launching an EC2 instance</h3>
<p>The first step is to launch an Enclave-enabled EC2 instance. From the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave.html#nitro-enclave-reqs">requirements</a> we learn this can be any Nitro instance with an Intel or AMD processor. Further digging shows that the minimum size is an <code>m5a.xlarge</code>.</p>
<p>The operating system needs to be Linux. On Amazon Linux 2 the Nitro CLI is available in a yum repository. Installation instructions for other operating systems can be found on the Nitro Enclaves CLI <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-cli">Github page</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon has provided ready-to-go AMIs with NginX and the Nitro CLI pre-installed, so for this article we will use those. We will assign an IAM role with admin permissions to the instance so we won’t be limited in exploring access methods.</p>
<p>With the pre-build AMI deployed in a default VPC and an IAM role with admin permissions, our current architecture looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/4HFodRfnVjsleJ2YI6pVgg/66fce88c7b5ea3ba5234ae1bdee35d5e/deployment-1.png?fit=scale&amp;w=1330" alt="Deployment 1"></p>
<h3>Creating an ACM certificate</h3>
<p>ACM certificates are free, but we do need a valid domain name. I’ve once purchased <code>vpcdemo.net</code>, so that’s what I will use for this article.</p>
<p>After we’ve moved through the steps of requesting a certificate, it shows as <code>Issued</code> and has an ARN. We will need this ARN in the next step.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/5Oxxf6wRYgkMm7QgYxHyq/6933f73ec20c723ed0bd6a790e43b9d9/valid_cert.jpg?fit=scale&amp;w=1330" alt="Valid Certificate"></p>
<h3>Associating the IAM role with the certificate</h3>
<p>This is where it gets interesting. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave-refapp.html#role-cert">next step</a> in the process is to “Associate the role with the ACM certificate”.</p>
<p>The command to achieve this is <code>aws ec2 --region [region] associate-enclave-certificate-iam-role --certificate-arn [certificate_ARN] --role-arn [role_ARN]</code></p>
<p>This means we’re telling ACM that our EC2 instance role is allowed to access this certificate and private key. But we haven’t created a Nitro Enclave yet, and this role is assigned to an EC2 instance <strong>we</strong> control. Does that mean we will be able to access the private key from our instance? Let’s find out.</p>
<p>Running the command above yields the following output:</p>
<pre><code>aws ec2 --region eu-central-1 associate-enclave-certificate-iam-role --certificate-arn arn:aws:acm:eu-central-1:123412341234:certificate/f2bb1a6e-5704-4702-beb7-a2c3f36e7103 --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123412341234:role/admin-role
{
    "EncryptionKmsKeyId": "cb8e3d89-cd82-4560-867c-641c0008fab2", 
    "CertificateS3BucketName": "aws-ec2-enclave-certificate-eu-central-1-prod", 
    "CertificateS3ObjectKey": "arn:aws:iam::123412341234:role/admin-role/arn:aws:acm:eu-central-1:123412341234:certificate/f2bb1a6e-5704-4702-beb7-a2c3f36e7103"
}
</code></pre>
<p>This output obviously refers to three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>An S3 bucket (owned by AWS)</li>
<li>An S3 object (that likely contains our certificate and private key)</li>
<li>A KMS key (that is likely used to decrypt sensitive data)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next step, AWS describes we should assign new permissions to our EC2 instance’s IAM role:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "s3:GetObject"
        ],
        "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::aws-ec2-enclave-certificate-eu-central-1-prod/*"]
    },
    {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "kms:Decrypt"
        ],
        "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:eu-central-1:*:key/cb8e3d89-cd82-4560-867c-641c0008fab2"
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>These permissions allow our role to fetch an object from the AWS-owned S3 bucket, and to use the AWS-owned KMS key to decrypt data. Let’s update our architecture diagram with these new components.</p>

<h3>Retrieving the file from S3</h3>
<p>The <code>CertificateS3BucketName</code> and <code>CertificateS3ObjectKey</code> clearly identify where the ACM files are stored. Since our IAM Role now has all the necessary permissions, we can try to download the file.</p>
<pre><code>[ec2-user@ip-172-31-42-108 ~]$ aws s3 cp s3://aws-ec2-enclave-certificate-eu-central-1-prod/arn:aws:iam::123412341234:role/admin-role/arn:aws:acm:eu-central-1:123412341234:certificate/f2bb1a6e-5704-4702-beb7-a2c3f36e7103 .
download: s3://aws-ec2-enclave-certificate-eu-central-1-prod/arn:aws:iam::123412341234:role/admin-role/arn:aws:acm:eu-central-1:123412341234:certificate/f2bb1a6e-5704-4702-beb7-a2c3f36e7103 to ./f2bb1a6e-5704-4702-beb7-a2c3f36e7103
</code></pre>
<p>Lo and behold: it worked! We now have the ACM certificate files on our local machine. The million dollar question is what they contain.</p>
<h3>Analyzing the file contents</h3>
<p>We’ll output the file and run it through <code>jq</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/XdI3Sa3jYldy7criKPzHb/7ca202e4e65aaec1061f4400ee683073/file-contents.png?fit=scale&amp;w=1330" alt="File Contents"></p>
<p>The contents are in JSON format, with four keys:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>certificate</code></li>
<li><code>certificateChain</code></li>
<li><code>encryptedPrivateKey</code></li>
<li><code>encryptionMethod</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The first two values are unencrypted, but these are the public certificate files anyone visiting <code>vpcdemo.net</code> would receive. No secrets there.</p>
<p>The third value is the private key we’re looking for. Obviously, it’s been encrypted. However, we also got access to a KMS key… Let’s see if we can use that to decrypt this value!</p>
<h3>Decrypting the private key</h3>
<p>First we’ll store the <code>encryptedPrivateKey</code> in a variable: <code>PRIVKEY=$(cat f2bb1a6e-5704-4702-beb7-a2c3f36e7103 | jq -r '.encryptedPrivateKey')</code>.</p>
<p>Then we’ll run the private key through KMS: <code>aws kms --region eu-central-1 decrypt --ciphertext-blob fileb://&lt;(echo $PRIVKEY | base64 -d) --output text --query Plaintext</code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, but expectedly, this results in the following output:</p>
<pre><code>An error occurred (AccessDeniedException) when calling the Decrypt operation: The ciphertext refers to a customer master key that does not exist, does not exist in this region, or you are not allowed to access.
</code></pre>
<p>So this doesn’t work. Let’s find out why. We’ll start by looking at CloudTrail. It shows an interesting line:</p>
<pre><code>"errorMessage": "User: arn:aws:sts::123412341234:assumed-role/admin-role/i-025be0b6a191a2cde is not authorized to perform: kms:Decrypt on resource: arn:aws:kms:eu-central-1:194321236082:key/cb8e3d89-cd82-4560-867c-641c0008fab2",
</code></pre>
<p>This shows us that the KMS key is stored in account <code>194321236082</code>, and that our role was not allowed to use it. This is interesting, because we did exactly follow AWS’ instructions, which added permissions for our role to use this KMS key. The answer must lie somewhere in the Nitro Enclaves.</p>
<h3>Running NginX with Nitro Enclaves</h3>
<p>After walking through the last few steps in the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave-refapp.html#config-nginx">AWS docs</a> we’ve got a running server with HTTPS:</p>
<pre><code>➜  ~ curl -I -XGET https://vpcdemo.net
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.18.0
Date: Fri, 30 Oct 2020 13:24:26 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 3520
Last-Modified: Wed, 24 Jun 2020 18:17:11 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
ETag: "5ef398a7-dc0"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
</code></pre>
<p>In the NginX configuration at <code>/etc/pki/nginx/nginx-acm.conf</code> we see the following lines:</p>
<pre><code>ssl_certificate_key "engine:pkcs11:pkcs11:model=p11ne-token;manufacturer=Amazon;token=nginx-acm-token;id=%01;object=acm-key;type=private?pin-value=8c9d293b5fcbe9bc5f70fa400822a936";
ssl_certificate "/run/nitro_enclaves/acm/nginx-cert-6e67696e782d61636d2d746f6b656e.pem";
</code></pre>
<p>So the Nitro Enclave was able to download and decrypt my certificate, even though the parent instance wasn’t. The next question is how AWS has secured their KMS key so the parent instance can’t use it, but the Nitro Enclave using the same IAM Role <em>can</em>.</p>
<h3>Attestation</h3>
<p>The answer can be found in Jeff Barr’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-isolated-ec2-environments-to-process-confidential-data/">blog post</a> and the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/set-up-attestation.html">Cryptographic attestation</a> chapter in the documentation. When a new enclave image file (the OS and code that runs in the enclave) is created, it will automatically hash its contents in various ways. These are then returned as platform configuration registers (PCRs). There are eight PCRs:</p>
<ul>
<li>PCR[0]: a hash of the enclave image file</li>
<li>PCR[1]: a hash of the Linux kernel and bootstrap</li>
<li>PCR[2]: a hash of the application</li>
<li>PCR[3]: a hash of the IAM role assigned to the parent instance</li>
<li>PCR[4]: a hash of the Instance ID of the parent instance</li>
<li>PCR[8]: a hash of the Enclave image file signing certificate</li>
</ul>
<p>The first one (PCR0) can be used in a KMS condition. From the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/policy-conditions.html">KMS docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The kms:RecipientAttestation:ImageSha384 condition key allows the kms-decrypt, kms-generate-data-key, and kms-generate-random operations from an enclave only when the image hash from the signed attestation document in the request matches the value in the condition key. The ImageSha384 value corresponds to PCR[0] in the attestation document. This condition key is effective only when you call these APIs from an enclave using the Nitro Enclaves SDK.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And from Jeff Barr’s blog post: “In a real-world environment, I would create a KMS key policy that checks the PCR value as part of a Condition statement:”</p>
<pre><code>"Condition": {
"StringEqualsIgnoreCase": {
 "kms:RecipientAttestation:ImageSha384": "ecfd7aa6d1dcca1e0bba646e7d49ede2761651c68f13cee68b1141c182cd836baae37d05dd8e6260aa847369a7b27e24"
}
</code></pre>
<p>In simple terms: every enclave image has a signature that changes when the content of the enclave image changes. By setting the PCR[0] value at the time the image was built as a condition in KMS, the <code>Decrypt</code> operation will only be allowed when executed by this exact version of the enclave image. When somebody tampers with the image - or tries to use the role from the parent instance as we did above - the PCR0 will change, the KMS condition will no longer match, and access will be denied.</p>

    <p>
Vectorization is when you take some minecraft-style raster image and make a crisp vector picture out of it.
    </p>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Bitmap_VS_SVG.svg">
    
    <p>
It's especially useful when you want to turn a satellite photo into a map. Or if you want to scan some blueprint and turn it into a CAD model. Or if you want to reissue an old game and you don't want to redraw all the artwork from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
The algorithm I'm going to show you has nothing to do with all these things. It's a basic vectorization technique which, in its original form, has little to none applications in the industry.
    </p>
    <p>
On the plus side, it illustrates the approach rather well. It shows how things like bilinear interpolation, gradient descent, and parametric splines work together to solve a real-world problem. At the very least, it makes learning about all these things a little more compelling.
    </p>

    <h2>
An input image
    </h2>
    <p>
A raster image is essentially a rectangular table of things. If it's a full-color RGB, then it's a table of color pixels. Color pixels are the triplets of 8-bit integer values where each value represents an amount of red, green, and blue color.
    </p>
    <p>
Medical images, such as obtained from computed tomography, are usually the tables of 12-bit or 16-bit integers. It's not a color really since the values come from invisible X-ray radiation, but they are called gray values nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
Satellite images may have a lot of channels. Apart from the colors of the visible specter they may contain ultra-violet and infra-red luminosity. Channels may be represented by integers or floating point values.
    </p>
    <p>
Our image will be a simple gray-scale bitmap.
    </p>
    <canvas id="greyscale_canvas" width="640" height="640"></canvas>
    <p>
Technically, we can already turn it into vectors rather easily. Let's just agree on some threshold, and mark the contour of all the pixels that have the values exceeding this threshold.
    </p>
    <canvas id="greyscale_canvas_contour" width="640" height="640"></canvas>
    <p>
Well, it's simple, but it's not what we wanted. We want curves, not corners. And for that, we have to make our image less cornery.
    </p>
    <h2>
<span id="index_image_interpolation">Image interpolation</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
Let's say our image is not a table of values. Let's say we only know the values in the centers of the pixels, and we have to guess the values between them somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
This is called interpolation. The simplest case would be the nearest neighbor interpolation, where for every point on an image, the value is the value from the nearest pixel's center. But this simply turns it back into a table.
    </p>
    <p>
A little more advanced is the <span id="index_bilinear_interpolation">bilinear interpolation</span>. The value is the linear sum of the four neighboring values. It looks like this.
    </p>
    <div>
    <pre id="code_1">// pixel value with out of bounds checks
function pixel_in(pixels, i, j) {
    if(i &gt;= pixels.length)
        return pixel_in(pixels, pixels.length-1, j);
    if(i &lt; 0)
        return pixel_in(pixels, 0, j);
    if(j &gt;= pixels[0].length)
        return pixel_in(pixels, i, pixels[0].length-1);
    if(j &lt; 0)
        return pixel_in(pixels, i, 0);
    return pixels[i][j];
}

// linear interpolation
function value_in(pixels, x, y) {
    var j = Math.floor(x - 0.5);
    var tj = x - 0.5 - j;
    var i = Math.floor(y - 0.5);
    var ti = y - 0.5 - i;
    return pixel_in(pixels, i, j) * (1 - ti) * (1 - tj)
         + pixel_in(pixels, i, j+1) * (1 - ti) * (tj)
         + pixel_in(pixels, i+1, j+1) * (ti) * (tj)
         + pixel_in(pixels, i+1, j) * (ti) * (1 - tj);
}
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
If we darken the pixels where the interpolated value meets the threshold, we'll get some kind of a contour.
    </p>
    <canvas id="interpolation_canvas" width="640" height="640"></canvas>
    
    <p>
There are other methods. Plenty of them. But linear interpolation solves the cornery border problem just fine. Although, the border we see is just the borderline of some threshold. It's not a vector representation yet.
    </p>

    <h2>
Turning an interpolated image into a contour
    </h2>
    <p>
We can borrow an idea from the <a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/the_simplest_possible_smooth_contouring_algorithm.html">simplest possible smooth contouring</a> algorithm. We'll build an initial border from the source pixels, and then we'll use our linearly interpolated image to find the best place to put each contour point so the image value will meet the threshold value.
    </p>
    <p>
When you have a <span id="index_distance_field">distance field</span>, it's easy. A distance field is when for any point in space you can tell how far it lies from the surface you want. It's basically a function from point in space to distance.
    </p>
    <p>
You take its gradient, take the difference between the value you have and the threshold value. Since it's the distance field, the value difference is exactly the distance you should move your point for. And the gradient is the exact opposite direction. You just inverse, multiply, add — and you're there.
    </p>
    <p>
Unfortunately, we don't have a distance field. We have a continuous image which only resembles one.
    </p>
    <p>
But the principle still works. If you traverse against the gradient, you will get closer to the threshold value. And the more the difference, the further you have to go. It's just you wouldn't always get there in one try.
    </p>
    <p>
So let's try several times then. Let's make an <a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/interactive_introduction_to_iterative_algorithms.html">iterative algorithm</a> out of it.
    </p>
    <div>
    <pre id="code_2">// gradient
function gradient(pixels, x, y) {
    const eps = 1e-5;
    return [(value_in(pixels, x + eps, y) - value_in(pixels, x, y)) / eps,
            (value_in(pixels, x, y + eps) - value_in(pixels, x, y)) / eps];
}

// how far should you shift the point to meet the isoline
// if value_in were a distance function
function gradient_shift(pixels, threshold, x, y) {
    var g = gradient(pixels, x, y);
    var g_norm = Math.sqrt(g[0]*g[0] + g[1]*g[1]);
    var d = threshold - value_in(pixels, x, y);
    return [g[0] * d / g_norm / g_norm, g[1] * d / g_norm / g_norm];
}

// brings a point closer to the threshold isoline
function fit_point_better(pixels, threshold, point) {
    const ok_error = 1/255;
    if(Math.abs(value_in(pixels, point[0], point[1]) - threshold) &lt; ok_error)
        return point;
    gs = gradient_shift(pixels, threshold, point[0], point[1])
    var new_point = [point[0] + gs[0], point[1] + gs[1]];
    return fit_point_better(pixels, threshold, new_point);
}
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
We'll move our contour points against the gradient until we're close enough to the threshold
    </p>
    <canvas id="fitting_canvas" width="640" height="640"></canvas>
        
    <p>
That's good but we can do better. Let's make the contour smooth.
    </p>

    <h2>
Cubic splines
    </h2>
    <p>
All we have to do to make the contour smooth is to turn each line segment into a parametric cubic curve.
    </p>
    <p>
It's probably sounds more complicated than it is. A parametric cubic curve is just a pair of polynomials. If you have the points and partial derivatives in this points, you can get the coefficients for them from this pair of <a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/programmers_introduction_to_linear_equations.html">linear systems</a>:
    </p>
    <div><p>
Px(t<sub>1</sub>)' = 3a<sub>x</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2b<sub>x</sub>t<sub>1</sub> + c = dx<sub>1</sub>/dt
<br>
Px(t<sub>1</sub>) = a<sub>x</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>3</sup> + b<sub>x</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + c<sub>x</sub>t<sub>1</sub> + d = x<sub>1</sub>
<br>
Px(t<sub>2</sub>) = a<sub>x</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup> + b<sub>x</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + c<sub>x</sub>t<sub>2</sub> + d = x<sub>2</sub>
<br>
Px(t<sub>2</sub>)' = 3a<sub>x</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2b<sub>x</sub>t<sub>2</sub> + c = dx<sub>2</sub>/dt
    </p><p>
    
Py(t<sub>1</sub>)' = 3a<sub>y</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2b<sub>y</sub>t<sub>1</sub> + c = dy<sub>1</sub>/dt
<br>
Py(t<sub>1</sub>) = a<sub>y</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>3</sup> + b<sub>y</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + c<sub>y</sub>t<sub>1</sub> + d = y<sub>1</sub>
<br>
Py(t<sub>2</sub>) = a<sub>y</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup> + b<sub>y</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + c<sub>y</sub>t<sub>2</sub> + d = y<sub>2</sub>
<br>
Py(t<sub>2</sub>)' = 3a<sub>y</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2b<sub>y</sub>t<sub>2</sub> + c = dy<sub>2</sub>/dt
    </p></div>
    <p>
The curve itself will then look like this.
    </p>
    <canvas id="cubic_canvas" width="640" height="640"></canvas>
    <p>
Even more, since we get to choose the parameter range, we can make it [0..1]. This greatly simplifies our system and makes it really easy to solve.
    </p>
    <p>
Here is the function that makes one array of polynomial coefficients from two pairs of point and tangent values.
    </p>
    <div>
    <pre id="code_3">// solver specific to [0..1] parametrized splines
function spline_for(p1, p1d, p2, p2d) {
//     A = [
//         [1, 0, 0, 0],
//         [0, 1, 0, 0],
//         [1, 1, 1, 1],
//         [0, 1, 2, 3]];
//     B = [p1, p1d, p2, p2d]
    return [
        p1,
        p1d,
        3*p2 - p2d - 3*p1 - 2*p1d,
        p2d + p1d - 2*p2 + 2*p1
    ];
}
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
The polynomial is then computed in every <i>t</i> with this function.
    </p>
    <div>
    <pre id="code_4">// polynomial
function polynomial_in_t(A, t){
    var pt = 0.0;
    for(var i = 0; i &lt; A.length; ++i){
        pt += A[i] * Math.pow(x, i);
    }
    return pt;
}
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
So for every line segment with tangents, we can make a parametric polynomial. There is one problem though. We don't have tangents.
    </p>
    <p>
We have the gradient, which is orthogonal to the tangent, but there are two possible tangents in every point. The tangent can be oriented left or right from the gradient.
    </p>
    <p>
But this is solvable. Let's just pick the direction we like and keep it consistent.
    </p>
    <p>
Let the curves that originally come from horizontally oriented segments always have both tangents that way that <i>dx &gt; 0</i>. And the ones that come from vertically oriented segments, will have <i>dy &gt; 0</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
It looks like we have enough parts to assemble an algorithm.
    </p>
    <h2>
Creating splines from the pixels
    </h2>
    <p>
Let's split our vectorization into two parts. First, we'll get points and tangents for every line segment from the pixels. Then we'll turn it all into polynomial splines.
    </p>
    <p>
The function that does the first part looks like this.
    </p>
    <div>
    <pre id="code_5">function turn_pixels_into_points_and_tangents(pixels, threshold) {
    var points = [];
    var tangents = [];

    // "horizontal" pieces
    for(var i = 0; i &lt;= pixels.length; i += 1) {
        var old_point = [];
        var old_tangent = [];
        for(var j = 0; j &lt;= pixels[0].length; j += 1) {
            // if right, left, top, and bottom pixels have a sign change,
            // there should be a spline there
            var sign_change_on_the_right  =
                (pixel_in(pixels, i-1, j+0) - threshold) *
                (pixel_in(pixels, i+0, j+0) - threshold) &lt; 0;
            var sign_change_on_the_left   =
                (pixel_in(pixels, i-1, j-1) - threshold) *

<p>If you were born mid-90’s or earlier, you probably remember being bored. We used to talk to ourselves, play “make believe”, taking walks, listening to records, etc. We learned to entertain ourselves, imagine, and create.</p>
<p>Today, my children and children born into the age of the virtual world have not experienced boredom, at least not in the same way. In a sense, those who grew up in the 24-hour news cycle, with social media have never and will never experience being alone. They’ve rarely experience the <a href="https://austingwalters.com/the-last-free-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sense of freedom</a> that comes from thinking to oneself.</p>
<p>A personal concern, is that children’s personalities appear to develop in the absence of technology. They play with toys and make their world come to life. My two year old believes, with all his heart, that his toys are sentient. That our Roomba has feelings and needs to be “fed”. He’s learning reason, learning to manipulate the world, talking to us, and so much more.</p>
<h2>Tools of Gods</h2>
<p>Throughout all human history technology has been an extension of ourselves. Part of childhood is learning to use and create tools. However, today we don’t need to build tools. With phones, we have near infinite information, entertainment, and communication at our finger tips, we can connect to anyone or anything – instantly. Capture audio, video and picture with a tap. Search our memories with a voice command. Calculate any/all the math equations we can think of, etc. Our technology makes us ever more godlike.</p>
<p>To provide this godlike device to a child is irresponsible. Arguably, even in hands of adults, our devices do more harm than good.</p>
<p>The difference between adults and children, is that children need to <em>learn-to-learn</em>. It’s the most important thing a child can learn. How well a child <em>learns-to-learn </em>will shape their entire life, their potential is defined by how well they can learn. There are several important lessons in learning how to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning to self-reflect</li>
<li>Nurturing curiosity</li>
<li>Defining ones goals</li>
<li>Indexing knowledge</li>
<li>Finding motivation</li>
</ul>
<p>There is probably more than goes into learning-to-learn, but that’s a good list for now.</p>
<p>For me, a defining moment was learning to sculpt my character in an effort to find motivation. I spent quite a bit of time reflecting on who I was and who I wanted to be. I defined myself and found the motivation I needed, with constant self-reflection to change. Without my time riding bikes, running, playing in the woods, soccer, walking alone, I wouldn’t be who I am today.</p>
<h2>Empathy is Derived from Self</h2>
<p>Having a godlike tool able solve most problems is a double edge sward. A phone is addictive by design. Mobile phones track us and companies learn everything about us, with that information being weaponized against us to maximize “screen time”. Is social media useful? Quite frankly, I’d argue no, social media has a net negative effect. Importantly, social media and games on your mobile device keep you constantly stimulated and often push others agenda(s)[<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>].</p>
<p>I question if most of the newer generations, born into their environment, have really learned to live in the physical world. Has the newer generation(s) learned to live with and identify themselves? Is there self-reflection and growth? Without an internal dialog, a lot of things break down: personality, autonomy, comfort with being alone, understanding alternative viewpoints… empathy.</p>
<p>Perhaps, [even more concerning] without an internal identity / dialog one doesn’t develop a “classic” ego. If a self-image is typically defined by an internal image and that internal image doesn’t develop, what guides us? Likes? Karma?</p>
<p>This would explain the rise in more extreme moral stances. Such as building a hierarchy based on gender, race, etc. Lack of empathy for others, at the same time garnering more karma, for karma is the value system people can hold themselves to. We no longer need to contemplate who we want to be, because we can receive instant feedback on our actions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I suspect this optimizes for short-term gain, but long-term loss to society.</p>
<p>We’ve seen the start of the incredibly destructive cycle, where contemplating or a nuanced opinion is simply not acceptable, because others can’t relate.</p>
<center><iframe data-lazy-type="iframe" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2cMYfxOFBBM?start=314" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>
<h2>Who are you?</h2>
<blockquote><p>I am free, no matter what rules surround me. If I find them tolerable, I tolerate them; if I find them too obnoxious, I break them. I am free because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything I do.</p>
<p>– Robert A. Heinlein</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m a firm believer that life is and should be tough. Growth comes from adaptation, confidence is derived from overcoming challenges. When life is tough, you have to create goals and blaze a trail to somewhere better. This is what it means to be “free”, free to have self-determination, which few embrace.</p>
<p>I wasn’t born to my current “class”. I would say, I was born “big-mac” rich, where you could buy a “big-mac” once a month without worrying about budget. My parents provided shelter, food and clothes, but I started mowing lawns at 12 and working a job by 14 to buy anything I needed beyond food and shelter. Yet today, (14 years &amp; a couple kids later), I’d call myself “iPhone” rich, I can buy something of equivalent cost monthly without worrying about it.</p>
<p>This doesn’t happen in a vacuum.</p>
<p>My wife and I regularly create two and five year plans. These goals provide motivation. We can ask ourselves,</p>
<blockquote><p>Does this activity help hit our five year objective?</p></blockquote>
<p>If the answer is no, then it’s probably not worth doing it. We work hard, we reflect regularly and we try to improve; always iterating towards something better.</p>
<p>To have self-determination, people need to think for themselves. They need to contemplate what they want from life. They need to talk to themselves. Self-determination requires goals, it also requires grappling (or ignoring) others and importantly saying “no” and “yes” based on <em>objectives</em> not <em>desires</em>. In the end, this will make people happier.</p>
<p>It all starts with talking to ones-self, spending time alone and deciding what <em>you</em> want.</p>
<h2>A Bleak Outlook</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the god-like tools we’ve all grown accustom to (especially, when given to kids), seem to disrupt the ability to talk to one-self. In a sense, our phones, media, and general virtual world has taken all our time; this leaves us without time for self-reflection, self-thought, self-actualization. In this stunted world, the AI which manipulates our news replaces the ego we once had.</p>
<p>Complex discussions, real empathy, motivation — are going to be something most of us lose. I’m not sure if society is ready for what we created. It’s a mob of people who’ve never experienced real hardship, who’ve learned a social system designed by virtue signaling (aka trying to game the “karma” systems) and not really learning to live in the real world. Then again, these people will be shaping the real world, for better or worse.</p>

As of now, there is no viable way to store large or wholesale amounts of electricity for later use.  The utilization of battery storage for energy is cost prohibitive.  As a result, <strong>the demand for electricity must be met exactly by the supply in real time.  </strong>We’ll explain how power markets balance supply and demand in a later post, but for now keep in mind that supply and demand must be balanced.  </p><h3>Generation  </h3><p>So how is electricity produced, and how does it reach the end consumer?&nbsp; Electricity is produced by generators, the suppliers of electricity.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1600192343421_162364"><p>Generators must do work in order to produce electricity, and excluding solar farms, all plants use turbines that drive electromagnetic generators to produce electricity.&nbsp; (We won’t go into detail about generators here, but look out for our post on all things generation.)</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1601412188771_141807"><div><p>While transmission lines are good conductors, some loss still occurs when electricity is moved through the lines.&nbsp; To reduce this loss, electricity is moved at high voltages on these transmission lines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Transformers, Transmission and Distribution</h3><p>Once the electricity is produced at a generator, it must be transformed to this higher voltage, which happens at a step up transformer.&nbsp; Step up transformers utilize alternating currents to increase voltage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The electricity is then moved onto high-voltage transmission lines, capable of carrying electricity over long distances.&nbsp; Once the electricity has been moved closer to the end user, the voltage needs to be transformed to a lower voltage for safer distribution. This happens at a step down transformer.&nbsp; Now the electricity is ready for delivery to a distribution substation.&nbsp; </p><p>From the distribution substation, electricity is carried on distribution lines, which are the equivalent of residential roads in the highway analogy.&nbsp; From the distribution lines, electricity is stepped down one last time at a residential step down transformer before being used in homes and businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>Back in January, I introduced what is to become a monthly series which would feature contents surrounding cinema. The first of which was <a href="https://ebrandme.biz/2020/01/31/ray-harryhausen-monsters-myths-lore/"><em>“Ray Harryhausen: Monsters, Myths &amp; Lore.”</em></a> February came, languished for 29 days this time around, but I didn’t manage to share a follow-up.</p>
<p>On this note, we’ll begin March with one of my favorite movies, <a href="https://amzn.to/3csQPTc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Big Short</em></a>, based on the true story surrounding the housing market crash from the viewpoints of Mark Baum, Charlie Geller, Jamie Shipley, and Michael Burry (then head of Scion Capital).</p>
<p>The movie starts with a favorite quote of mine, which is attributed to Mark Twain:</p>
<blockquote><p>It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you in trouble. It’s what you know for sure just ain’t so.</p></blockquote>
<p>Based on the true story of events leading up to the 2008 market crash, we’re first presented with Lewis Ranierie and how he “changed the banking industry” with the introduction of&nbsp; mortgage-backed securities (MBS), under the impression that they were a safe investment with high yield because, “who doesn’t pay their mortgage?”&nbsp; “Who, who,” said the owl.</p>
<p>Proudly, he thinks this is a AAA rated bond. Signed. Sealed. Delivered. Bankers were enjoying their lush paychecks, and at least in the movie, scantily clad ladies.</p>
<p>In comes Michael Burry, who smells that something’s afoot in 2005, and begins to look at the state of the mortgages contained in the 20 top selling mortgage bonds.&nbsp; With his findings, he decides to approach several banks and short them to the sum of $1.3 billion through the purchase of credit default swaps.</p>
<p>Next we’re introduced to Mark Baum, whose firm FrontPoint Partners gets a tip-off from a wrong number. They meet with Jared Venett (nicknamed Chicken Little &amp; Bubble Boy) who proceeds to tell them that the worst mortgage bonds are then repackaged as a collatorized debt obligations (CDO) and rated AAA by the rating agencies.&nbsp; Fast forward and FrontPoint shorts to the amount of $50 million in Garibaldi IV, BBB swaps. Then another $500 million following a meeting with a CDO manager at the American Securitization Forum in Vegas, who Mark Baum tells “I didn’t realize there was anything to manage with CDOs.” Here we learn that not only are there CDOs, but synthetic ones as well. The plot thickens without flour or cornstarch.</p>
<p>We meet Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley of Brownfield Fund in the lobby of JPMorgan Chase for a 4:50PM meeting (bank closes at 5PM), seeking an ISDA agreement not knowing that the capital requirement was $1.5 billion. At the time, their fund was worth a respectable $30 million having started with $110,000. They later find out about the housing bubble prediction through a friend of Charlie Geller’s and with funding from Ben Rickert, a suspicious retired banker who felt the NSA had too much authority, also bet against the housing market.</p>
<p>Then 2008 happened and “boom” goes the dynamite. Except that it wasn’t funny considering the impact.</p>
<p>One of the most humanizing parts in the movie was when Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley were celebrating shorting some AA tranches of CDOs, and Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) said: “Do you gave any idea what you just did? You just bet against the American economy. Which means, if we’re right, people lose homes. People lose jobs. People lose retirement savings. People lose pensions. […] Every 1% unemployment goes up, 40,000 people die.”</p>
<p>The movie ends with Michael Burry sending an e-mail to investors as he prepares to close down the hedge fund:</p>
<blockquote><p>[…] People want an authority to tell them how to value things, but they choose this authority not based on facts or results. They choose it because it seems authoritative and familiar… and I am not, and never have been familiar. So I’ve come to the sullen realization that I must close down the fund.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Michael J. Burry, M.D.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s said that the investing Michael Burry continues to do is focused on water. Water which should be a basic human right… so is clean air, but you actually purchase cans of it.</p>

, I structured my lessons around primary sources such as the Bitcoin white paper and the Ethereum yellow paper.</p><p>This way, my students learned not only what I know, but also what’s the source of the knowledge. Now that they’re graduated, they know where to look for when they have questions.</p><p>Even though the course was four weeks long for each batch I could not answer some excellent questions in detail. Instead, I had to resort to black boxes.</p><p>How do digital signatures work? A black box.</p><p>What about ZK-STARKs? Another black box.</p><p>Black boxes help to teach a subject. Not so much for understanding in detail.</p><p>To understand Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more on a deeper level, one should know the pillars they are built on.</p><p>You understand the strength of the Bitcoin network when you know how does SHA-256 work.</p><p>You understand how your contracts run once you know the inner-working of the EVM.</p><p>You understand the security of the protocols you invest in when you, well, know a lot.</p><p>Thus, as you understand these subjects, you will realize how important blockchain really is. You will probably want to contribute to these exciting projects.</p><p>The more you will know, the more you will be able to participate in the governance of blockchains.</p><p>What should be the block size?</p><p>What’re your opinions on various layer 2 protocols?</p><p>How can you help us approaching the open questions on scalability?</p><p>All you need to do is to join the conversations, as long as you know about the subject in depth.</p><p>I recently realized that the most technical issues are getting the least participation.</p><p>Then, I decided to create this blog series with the goal of having new voices on the future of blockchain governances.</p><p>New voices that understand the contemporary issues very well.</p><p>This is one of the best things I can do for crypto.</p><blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One bull market to learn the lesson. Second bull market to make retirement money. Third bull market to ask not what crypto can do for you but what you can do for crypto.</p>— Qiao Wang (@QwQiao) <a href="https://twitter.com/QwQiao/status/1299500501604667396?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 29, 2020</a></blockquote><h2 id="intended-audience">Intended Audience</h2><p>The series will demand the reader to be comfortable with computer science papers. In fact, the content will be the papers.</p><p>My job is to curate the papers, explain their contexts in the blockchain space, and clarify them with my reading notes.</p><p>Ultimately, the series will offer a fundamental understanding of blockchain technologies to eager readers, be it economics students or CS professors.</p><h2 id="the-papers">The Papers</h2><p>I’m proud to present you 67 primary sources on the science of blockchains.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="str-vOKpYe5nW" data-connect-field="content"><p>Spreadsheet services like Google Sheets or Airtable have already used by many people, teams, and companies. What makes them more interesting is, they introduce non-tech users to the no-code movement, open doors for interesting possibilities.</p><p>No-code is like Starbuck, a kind of coffee also for people who don’t drink coffee. What great about Starbuck isn’t the taste, but it allows more people to enjoy coffee. In other words, <strong>no-code is a programming language for non-programmers</strong>.</p><p>Recently, I’ve examined using Google Sheet as a database service when integrating to <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Finverr.com">Inverr</a> — a no-code builder. It can possibly operate for sites or apps with less than 5M visits/month, with big enough data storage for small apps. Though, it comes with some limitations.</p><p>In this post, I’ll address a few technical issues when using Google Sheets as a database service, its effects, and how to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-search-is-inconvenient">1. Search is Inconvenient</h3><p>The main functions of the database are store, retrieve, and search for data. While Google Sheets is doing excellent at storing and retrieving data, the searching part in Google Sheets is a bit tricky.</p><p>On many apps, search provides discoverability. For example, when you’re building a movie discovery app, users search a movie by name, filter by a category, or popularity. Without search, the movie app is no different than a movie list.</p><p>To use the searching feature, Google Sheets APIs provide a property called “developerMetadata”. It’s an additional data on each cell, and invisible to Google Sheets users. When searching, it will use these additional data.</p><p>“developerMetadata” has a <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.google.com%2Fsheets%2Fapi%2Fguides%2Fmetadata%23metadata_storage_limits">limit</a> of 30,000 characters for each spreadsheet. It’s too small to do anything great. Though, you can optimize for sentence, paragraph by only store important terms.</p><h3 id="2-quota-and-storagenbsplimits">2. Quota and Storage&nbsp;Limits</h3><p>Google Sheets has a storage limit at 5,000,000 cells (including blank ones), and up to 256 columns per sheet.</p><p>Let’s take an example as a movie discovery app, it needs at least 6 properties (id, title, description, release date, rating, category). As a rough estimation, you can only store up to 5,000,000 / 6 = <strong>~833k movies</strong>. Since there are currently <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fpressroom%2Fstats%2F">555,913 movies</a> released, in theory, it’s still acceptable.</p><p>Another limitation when using Google Sheet APIs is its request quota. Starting at 500 requests per 100 seconds (or 5 requests per second), and start charging when excessed. In many cases, using proper caching techniques will reduce the number of requests to Google Cloud APIs services.</p><h3 id="3-acceptable-performance-on-a-largenbspdataset">3. Acceptable Performance on a Large&nbsp;Dataset</h3><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HrJxokwIWMsvLqb_4KFB6Q.png" alt=""></p><p><em>Query Performance Google&nbsp;Sheets</em></p><p>This is an unrealistic measure, but to test the limit and get a better overview, I tried getting data from a spreadsheet with a large dataset.</p><p>The above graph demonstrates the performance of retrieving thousands of cells per second from Google Sheets. It took around 2 seconds when getting 100k cells all at once, which 100k / 6 = ~16k movies. This is acceptable performance, and grows as the number of cells grows.</p><h3 id="4-no-schema-and-proper-restriction">4. No Schema and Proper Restriction</h3><p>Google Sheets is like a database with its own presentation. For example, you have a spreadsheet for monthly expenses. It contains a list of expenses, their category. And in the end, it can have a <strong>total expense value</strong> by the sum of all expenses in the month.</p><p>The layout freedom is convenient when using it as a spreadsheet, but a nightmare for a database. Because there is always some kind of fixed layout that the database follows. It allows the database engine to calculate the distance and navigate between rows of data. And no database designed without a layout.</p><p>Besides, unless you decided that no-one will ever touch the spreadsheet, someone might accidentally screw it up by renaming the tab or remove it.</p><hr><p>To conclude, Google Sheets is widely used as a tool. But as a database, it comes with some limitations. With proper caching and optimization, it is safe to use it as a database for webs/apps with &lt; 5.000.000 visits monthly.</p><p>Besides, its search limitation can be a huge bottleneck in many scenarios. You can use “developerMetadata” to enable data lookup. With 30k characters limits, it’s a good practice to store only “meta” data.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Finverr.com">Try to build a website with Google Sheet, or your own database →</a></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Sometimes I would get some interesting questions from my friends about internet security, such as whether it is possible to leak the bank account password when logging to the online bank via an untrusted network, whether it is possible that the message you received from someone via an untrusted network got modified maliciously, and whether it is possible that someone pretends to be you and send messages in your name. My answers to those questions are as long as your computer and cell phone are uncontaminated they are almost impossible thanks to our modern public-key crytosystems and digital signatures.</p>



<p>There are a couple of introductions to the public-key crystosystems and digital signature available online. However, I think most of them are incomplete or hard to understand. In this blog post, I am going to describe the public-key crystosystems and digital signatures using extremely simple math, so that there would be no ambiguity at all.</p>

<h3 id="usages">Usages</h3>

<p>The modern cryptosystems are public-key encryption systems in which everyone has a public-key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The public-key is seen by everyone, but the private is only accessible by the owner. The public-key encryption systems could also generate digital signatures which could be used to verify whether the message you received is unmodified and truly sent from the sender.</p>



<p>RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a typical algorithm for the public-key cryptosystems used by modern computers to encrypt and decrypt messages. However, we are not going to introduce the RSA algorithm in this blog post. Instead, we would describe the public-key cryptosystems and digital signatures at a high level.</p>

<h3 id="essential-features">Essential Features</h3>

<p>Each user has their own encryption and decryption functions, $E$ and $D$, using public-key and private key respectively. We use $M$ to represent the message to be encrypted and sent. There are four features that are essential to a public-key cryptosystem.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Decrypting an encrypted message gives you the original message (Of course!). Specifically,</li>
</ul><p>

\[D(E(M)) = M\]

</p><ul>
  <li>Encrypting a decrypted message gives you the original message (Hmm…). Specifically,</li>
</ul><p>

\[E(D(M)) = M\]

</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p>$E$ and $D$ are easy to compute. This means the encryption and decryption process should be fast.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The publicity of $E$ does not compromise the secrecy of $D$. This means you could hardly find a way to decrypt the encrypted message, even if you know how to encrypt the message.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We would ignore how to satisfy the four features in this blog post.</p>

<h3 id="message-encryption-and-decryption">Message Encryption and Decryption</h3>

<p>Suppose we have two people, Alice and Bob. Both of them are using the same public-key cryptosystems. This means Alice and Bob both have their private keys stored secretly and have their public key published to some authorities. From the authorities, we could find the public keys of Alice and Bob unambiguously. We denote encrypting the message using Alice and Bob’s public keys to be $E_A$ and $E_B$ respectively, and decrypting the message using Alice and Bob’s private keys to be $D_A$ and $D_B$ respectively.</p>



<p>One day, Alice wanted to send a private message $M$ to Bob. Alice found the public key of Bob, encrypted the message $M$ using Bob’s public key. The encrypted message for Bob is denoted as $C$.</p><p>

\[E_B(M) = C\]

</p><p>Once Bob received the encrypted message $C$, he could decrypt $C$ using his private key.</p><p>

\[D_B(C) = D_B(E_B(M)) = M\]

</p><p>Even if the network was compromised and someone intercepted $C$, it is still almost impossible to decrypt $C$ because of that $D_B$ is unknown and the feature “the publicity of $E$ does not compromise the secrecy of $D$” for public-key cryptosystems.</p>



<p>The message content is safe because of the public-key encryption systems. However, it does not provide any assurance about the sender. For example, James could send Bob a message $M^\prime$ which specifically says the message is from Alice, encrypt it using $E_B$, and send it to Bob. If there is no author verification procedure and Bob is not careful enough, Bob might actually think the message is sent from Alice. In some other scenarios, James might have intercepted the encrypted message $C$ sent out from Alice to Bob, prevented the message transmission to Bob, replaced the original message to $M^\prime$ which specifically says the message is from Alice, encrypt it using $E_B$, and send it to Bob. Bob might also be convinced that the message content $M^\prime$ was actually the original message Alice has sent. Specifically,</p><p>

\[E_B(M^\prime) = C^\prime \\
D_B(C^\prime) = D_B(E_B(M^\prime)) = M^\prime\]

</p><p>Digital signatures, derived from the public-key cryptosystems, are designed to solve these authentication problems.</p>

<h3 id="digital-signatures">Digital Signatures</h3>

<p>In addition to the encrypted message $C$ that Alice sent to Bob, Alice would also have to send her digital signature $S$ to Bob. Namely,</p><p>

\[E_B(D_A(M)) = S\]

</p><p>Alice could find $E_B$ using Bob’s public key and $D_A$ using her private key.</p>



<p>Once Bob received both $S$ and $C$, he could decrypt both $S$ and $C$ using his private key and Alice’s public key. Specially,</p><p>

\[D_B(C) = D_B(E_B(M)) = M \\
E_A(D_B(S)) = E_A(D_B(E_B(D_A(M)))) = E_A((D_A(M))) = M\]

</p><p>We found actually the two decrypted messages from $S$ and $C$ are exactly the same. This is expected if the message was sent from Alice and the content of the message was not modified. Let’s further see what will happen if someone pretends to be Alice to send a message to Bob, or the content of the message has been modified.</p>



<p>James, again, wanted to send Bob a message $M^\prime$ which specifically says the message is from Alice, or had intercepted an encrypted message $C$ from Alice, blocked it and created a message $M^\prime$ which specifically says the message is from Alice. To make the message readable by Bob, James encrypted $M^\prime$ using $E_B$, send the encrypted message $C^\prime$ to Bob.</p><p>

\[E_B(M^\prime) = C^\prime\]

</p><p>Because Bob does not accept any message without a signature, James had to make up a signature. However, because James knew nothing about Alice’s private key, he used a decryption function $D_J$ which is different from Alice’s secrete $D_A$. The signature James generated would be</p><p>

\[E_B(D_J(M^\prime)) = S^\prime\]

</p><p>Once Bob received both $S^\prime$ and $C^\prime$, he could decrypt both $S$ and $C$ using his private key and Alice’s public key as usual. Specially,</p><p>

\[D_B(C^\prime) = D_B(E_B(M^\prime)) = M^\prime \\
E_A(D_B(S^\prime)) = E_A(D_B(E_B(D_J(M^\prime)))) = E_A((D_J(M^\prime))) = M^{\prime\prime}\]

</p><p>In this case, Bob would see the two decrypted messages are not the same. Bob would then realize that there is something unusual happened and he should not trust anything about the message.</p>

<h3 id="hacking-the-public-key-cryptosystems">Hacking the Public-Key Cryptosystems</h3>

<p>As long as the four features of the public-key cryptosystems hold, cracking it is almost impossible. If somedayy, when the almighty quantum computer is available, the feature “the publicity of $E$ does not compromise the secrecy of $D$” would be compromised, therefore the modern public-key cryptosystems would no longer be reliable. I may talk about this topic in the future.</p>



<p>There is another way to send fake messages to Bob in name of Alice, without using a quantum computer. If James could somehow crack the account name and password of Alice on the web application, replace the Alice’s public encryption function from $E_A$ to $E_J$, when Bob tried to retrieve Alice’s encryption function, he would get $E_J$ instead of $E_A$. The decryption of signature $S^\prime$ would become $M^\prime$ instead of $M^{\prime\prime}$ then. Concretely,</p><p>

\[E_J(D_B(S^\prime)) = E_J(D_B(E_B(D_J(M^\prime)))) = E_J((D_J(M^\prime))) = M^{\prime}\]

</p><p>In this case the two decrypted messages match. Bob would be convinced that the message is from Alice and it has not been modified.</p>



<p>It should be noted that James was replacing Alice’s public encryption function from $E_A$ to $E_J$, instead of replacing his private decryption function from $D_J$ to $D_A$. In principle, $D_A$ would only be kept on Alice local computer and not anywhere else. Even if James has Alice’s account name and password on the web application, he would not get a copy of $D_A$ unless he specifically hacked Alice’s physical computer.</p>



<p>This reminds us that actually keeping our password safe is the most important.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	
	<p>
Floating-point numbers are fine. They are decently designed and well standardized, they provide a good compromise between performance and precision. They work great most of the time. Until the day when they suddenly don't and nobody knows why.
	</p>
	<p>
For me, that day came when I encountered a bug in the Taubin estimator. <a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs468-01-fall/Papers/taubin-smoothing.pdf">Taubin smoothing</a> takes a triangle mesh, a pair of magic numbers called λ and μ, a little time to think, and it makes the input mesh smooth. It also makes sure that the mesh isn't reduced to a perfectly smooth but rather uninteresting sphere or a point.
	</p>
	<p>
The first magic number λ is something between 0 and 1. When it's 0 — nothing happens at all, and when it's 1 — nothing good happens either. It should be somewhere in between. Nobody really knows how to pick this number but an experienced engineer can at least make an educated guess. 
	</p>
	<p>
The second magic number governs shrinkage compensation. It's a negative number slightly greater than λ in its absolute value. Nobody knows how to pick it either but this time even an educated guess is a challenge.
	</p>
	<p>
That's why you need an estimator. Something that picks the μ for you. And we have one. And it was bugged. And I was the one to fix it.
	</p>
	<p>
The first day of the investigation showed that the estimator is in fact entirely correct. The second day of the investigation  showed that the tests covering the bug are correct just as well. The third day of the investigation brought a promising hypothesis that the whole story is just a bad dream and all it takes to solve the mystery is to wake up. The fourth morning killed that hypothesis and left me completely clueless.
	</p>
	<p>
Luckily I have a friend who is smarter than me and he advised to fuzz the input a little and see what happens then. I did. And something happened. The bug didn't go away but the μ changed a lot. Way unproportionally to the small changes in the input. Fascinating!
	</p>
	<p>
We can expect a computation to work with some error. It's fine, we get input data from sensors and they embed some error, to begin with. We print out our finished models, and the printers have some limited precision as well so a small error doesn't upset anyone. It's all good while the error is small. But what if it isn't?
	</p>
	<p>
As it turns out, in my case, a completely correct algorithm had a computational error of about 1. Not 1e-16 or 1e-5 but 1. Just 1. So if you expect your μ to be somewhat close to -0.7, and the estimator says it's 0.3, it is in fact correct. It is still a correct estimation within its error range.
	</p>
	<p>
Correct but entirely useless.
	</p>
	<h2>
Challenge your intuition with a “Guess the Error” game
	</h2>
	<p>
Ok, so it's not the computational error per se that causes trouble but only the unexpected and unpredictable error. Can we predict it though?
	</p>
	<p>
Well, of course, we can. There is a whole field of numerical error analysis for that but let's be honest, most of the time we use our intuition instead. So how good is our intuition exactly?
	</p>
	<p>
I propose a game to find out. Let's take a cubic equation solver. It's a relatively complex computation with a very simple way to validate its precision. We will pick some roots first and then we will generate the cubic equation for these roots. Then we'll make the cubic solver find our roots back through the computation. The difference between the original and the computed value for each root will be our measurable error. This error divided by the original value will be our relative error.
	</p>
	<p>
Here is the exact code for the experiment. It's also <a href="https://github.com/akalenuk/wordsandbuttons/blob/master/exp/rational_bounds/rationale/cubic_solver_example.cpp">available on GitHub</a>.
	</p>

Now if we pick our roots as 1, 2, and 3, the equation produced will be:
	</p>
	<p>
(x - 1) (x - 2) (x - 3) = 0
	</p>
	<p>
Expanding the brackets we get this:
	</p>
	<p>
x<sup>3</sup> - 6x<sup>2</sup> + 11x - 6 = 0
	</p>
	<p>
And when we run our solver we get:
	</p>
	<p>
x = 1, x = 2, x = 3
	</p>
	<p>
Well, yes. On the equation this simple there is no error whatsoever. The computation works flawlessly. So let's start making it worse.
	</p>
	<h2>Round 1</h2>
	<p>
The slider below lets you pick an interval in the logarithmic scale. The interval may start at 10<sup>-12</sup> and end at 10<sup>12</sup>. It's impossible to predict the exact error up to a single number so you should just pick an appropriate interval that covers the error<span id="shown_note_1"><u onclick="show('note_1')">*</u>.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
Let's say we have the roots of 0.001, 2, 3 000. So to which interval, in your opinion, the maximum relative error for a cubic solver belongs?
	</p>
	<canvas id="interval_1" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	
	

	<h2>Round 2</h2>
	<p>
Now let's make our roots even more diverse in magnitude. How about 1e-6, 2, and 3e6?
	</p>
	<p>
Where do you think the error might be?
	</p>
	<canvas id="interval_2" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	
	

	<h2>Round 3</h2>
	<p>
And what about 1e-9, 2, and 3e9?
	</p>
	<canvas id="interval_3" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	
	
	<h2>Meet the <span id="index_rational_bounds">rational bounds</span></h2>
	<p>
It's not the error per se that is bad. Error is omnipresent. Every measuring device has its error, every 3D printer and every milling machine has its maximal precision. The error is fine.
	</p>
	<p>
It's only the unpredictability that makes it unpleasant.
	</p>
	<p>
People address errors in multiple ways. In metrology, a measured value is supplemented with its absolute error. You don't say that the temperature outside is 10°, you say it's 10° ± 0.5°. This might seem redundant since this is a small error for the weather outside, but in some other context, this very error might become significant. If you're measuring body temperature, a 1-degree difference is enough to tell a sick person from a perfectly healthy one. You can not afford a whole 1-degree error in this scenario.
	</p>
	<p>
If you have this input error written down, you can pull it through your computation to see if the resulting error is still tolerable. To do that, you need to exchange your measured numbers for intervals. A number with error becomes an interval: 10° ± 0.5° becomes [9.5, 10.5]°.
	</p>
	<p>
You can sum these intervals just as you add numbers:
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_4" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
+
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_5" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
=
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_6" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
You can multiply them as well.
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_7" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
×
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_8" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
=
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_9" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
So with intervals, you can accommodate the input error. You can drag it through the computation and see how it plays with other values with their own error. In the end, you will have your computed value within some interval and the size of this interval will indicate the output error. But what about the error of the computation itself?
	</p>
	<p>
A computational error occurs when we can't store the operation result in the same types we keep our operands in and we're forced to throw some data away. Let's say we have Python-style “unlimited” length integers. This means that if our computation only consists of addition, subtraction, and multiplication, we would never face any computational error.
	</p>
	<p>
Of course, with division, things get a little bit different. E. g. we can't store <nobr>16 ¾</nobr> in integers so we have to truncate it into 16. In this case, the whole fractional part becomes our error.
	</p>
	<p>
We can use pairs of integers to represent rational numbers. This will solve the division issue. However, this type of rational number, while does not accumulate errors, accumulates digits. The more digits it has, the slower the computation goes. At some point, it may simply become impractically slow. Just like with the uncontrollable error, uncontrollable size becomes an issue.
	</p>
	<p>
We want a compromise. Some entity that grows error controllably yet still operates in constant speed. And we can get it, for example, by merging two ideas: intervals and rational numbers together.
	</p>
	<p>
Let's say, we want to write a number as an interval of its tenths. We can do that most intuitively by throwing away all the digits after the first one.
	</p>
	<table><tbody><tr>
	<td></td>
	<td>≤</td>
	<td></td>
	<td>≤</td>
	<td></td>
	</tr></tbody></table>
	<p>
Just like we can do this with decimal fraction, we can do this with any rational number. We can put it between a pair of rational numbers made by finite integers. In this case, every integer is in the range [0, 1, ..., 99].
	</p>
	<table><tbody><tr>
	<td></td>
	<td rowspan="2">≤</td>
	<td></td>
	<td rowspan="2">≤</td>
	<td></td>
	</tr><tr>
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
	</tr></tbody></table>
	<p>
Ok, this is not entirely true. If the number is greater than 99, then we can't really store it in our tiny rationals but we can say that it's larger than 99 by assigning the 0 divisor to its upper bound. Of course, it's just a dirty hack but let's leave it like that.
	</p>
	<p>
Now if we want to accommodate both input error and computational error, all we have to do is to represent an input interval in its finite rational numbers. A finite rational lower bound of this interval and a finite rational upper bound of the same interval.
	</p>
	<table><tbody><tr>
	<td></td>
	<td rowspan="2">≤</td>
	<td></td>
	<td rowspan="2">≤</td>
	<td></td>
	<td rowspan="2">≤</td>
	<td></td>
	</tr><tr>
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
	</tr></tbody></table>
	<p>
This entity — a pair of finite rational bounds, represents a real number along with both its input error and representational error. It also grows computational error explicitly while the size of the entity remains constant.
	</p>
	<p>
The implementation example is <a href="https://github.com/akalenuk/wordsandbuttons/tree/master/exp/rational_bounds/sketch_in_cpp">available on GitHub</a>. Please note that it's just a proof of concept and not the best possible solution in terms of neither error minimization nor speed.
	</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>
The computational error may become a problem at the least appropriate moment. Both rational numbers and intervals are well-known alternatives for floating-point numbers when the error becomes an issue.
	</p>
	<p>
Rational bounds, being a chimeric product of both ideas, let you manage both measurement error and computational error in a coherent way without compromising performance all that much.
	</p>

<h2 id="network-address-translation-nat">Network Address Translation (NAT)</h2>

<p>We use NATs (Network Address Translation) for several reasons. The most useful feature of NAT is that it allows a single public IP address to be shared among multiple systems. It does this by creating a local network, providing local IP addresses to all machines that connect, and when one of those systems reaches out to the Internet, it rewrites packets going out to use the public IP so responses come back to the NAT, and vice versa, rewriting desination IP to specific client's IP. </p>

<p>It's the responsibility of the NAT to differentiate connections to the same addresses/ports (google.com:443) from internal hosts as ultimately their outbound port, destination ip and source ip will all be the same. If two different internal peers attempt to connect from the same source port, modern NATs will alter one of the source ports (some networks do this to all TCP/UDP source ports).</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samyk/slipstream/main/img/lan.png" alt="NAT"></p>

<h3 id="connection-tracking">Connection Tracking</h3>

<p>From <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Netfilter">Wikipedia ala Wikiwand</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>One of the important features built on top of the Netfilter 
framework is connection tracking. Connection tracking 
allows the kernel to keep track of all logical network 
connections or sessions, and thereby relate all of the packets
which may make up that connection. NAT relies on this 
information to translate all related packets in the same way, 
and iptables can use this information to act as a stateful 
firewall.</code></pre></div>

<p>If a machine behind your NAT sends a packet out and your router expects the remote host may respond, it keeps track of information, specifically the source and destination ports, source and destination IP addresses, and your internal IP, then returns any packets matching it back to your internal IP.</p>

<p>If another host on your LAN attempts to make the same connection with the same source and destination ports + IPs, your NAT wouldn't be able to discriminate it (the source IPs are different on your LAN but are rewritten to the same public IP on the WAN side), so it alters the source port, but rewrites it when sending back to you.</p>

<h3 id="application-level-gateway">Application Level Gateway</h3>

<p>ALGs allow NAT to track a multi-port protocol like FTP to go out from your system to an FTP server, then track when you request a file to be sent to your internal IP on a specific port, the ALG can rewrite the packet to include your public IP, then forward the FTP's server connection back to you. Had it not rewritten your IP, the FTP server would try to connect back to you on your internal IP (or not try at all if it expects the source IP to be the same as the signaling connection).</p>

<p>From <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Application-level_gateway">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>In the context of computer networking, an application-level 
gateway consists of a security component that augments a 
firewall or NAT employed in a computer network. It allows 
customized NAT traversal filters to be plugged into the 
gateway to support address and port translation for certain 
application layer "control/data" protocols such as FTP, 
BitTorrent, SIP, RTSP, file transfer in IM applications, etc. 
In order for these protocols to work through NAT or a 
firewall, either the application has to know about an address/
port number combination that allows incoming packets, or the 
NAT has to monitor the control traffic and open up port 
mappings (firewall pinhole) dynamically as required. 
Legitimate application data can thus be passed through the 
security checks of the firewall or NAT that would have 
otherwise restricted the traffic for not meeting its limited 
filter criteria.</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="router-investigation--firmware-dumping">Router Investigation / Firmware Dumping</h2>

<p>I'd first like to see how common gateways actually treat packets and multi-port protocols like FTP, SIP, etc. To do this, we’ll want to reverse engineer the firmware from common routers. We could dump the flash from physical routers, however if we can get unencrypted firmware from the manufacturers, we’ll be able to investigate more router models and much faster.</p>

<p>We'll start with a common router, the Netgear Nighthawk R7000. A <a target="_blank" href="http://bfy.tw/NjZh">quick search</a> helps us …</p></div></div>

              <p>Whether you’re using logistic regression or a neural network, all models require data in order to be trained, tested, and deployed. Managing and creating the data sets used for these models requires lots of time and space, and can quickly become muddled due to multiple users altering and updating the data.</p><p>This can lead to unexpected outcomes as data scientists continue to release new versions of the models but test against different data sets. Many data scientists could be training and developing models on the same few sets of training data. This could lead to many subtle changes being made to the data set, which can lead to unexpected outcomes once the models are deployed.</p><p>This blog post discusses the many challenges that come with managing data, and provides an overview of the <strong>top tools for machine learning and data version control</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-01-at-20.03.51.png" alt="Summary Comparison Table" srcset="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-01-at-20.03.51.png 600w, https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-01-at-20.03.51.png 1000w, https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-01-at-20.03.51.png 1600w, https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-01-at-20.03.51.png 1897w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Summary Table - read further for a more detailed comparison</figcaption></figure><p>Managing data sets and tables for data science and machine learning models requires a significant time investment from data scientists and engineers. Everything from managing storage, versions of data, and access require a lot of manual intervention.</p><h2 id="storage-space">Storage Space</h2><p>Training data can take up a significant amount of space on Git repositories. This is because Git was developed to track changes in text files, not large binary files. So if a team's training data sets involve large audio or video files, this can cause a lot of problems downstream. Each change to the training data set will often result in a duplicated data set in the repositories’ history. This not only creates a large repository but also makes cloning and rebasing very slow.</p><h2 id="data-versioning-management">Data Versioning Management</h2><p>When trying to manage versions, whether it be code or UIs, there is a widespread tendency— even among techies—to “manage versions,” by adding a version number or word to the end of a file name. In the context of data, this means a project might include data.csv, data_v1.csv, data_v2.csv, data_v3_finalversion.csv, etc. This bad habit is beyond cliché, with most developers, data scientists, and UI experts in fact starting out<em> </em>with bad versioning habits.</p><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517490232338-06b912a786b5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" alt="Nine Eight Seven" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517490232338-06b912a786b5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=600&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517490232338-06b912a786b5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517490232338-06b912a786b5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1600&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517490232338-06b912a786b5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2400&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@steve_j?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Steve Johnson</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="multiple-users">Multiple Users</h2><p>When working in a production environment, one of the greatest challenges is dealing with other data scientists. If you’re not using some form of version control in a collaborative environment, files will get deleted, altered, and moved; and you will never know who did what. In addition, it will be difficult to revert your data to its original state. This is one of the biggest obstacles when it comes to managing models and datasets.</p><p>Data versioning is one of the keys to automating a team's machine learning model development. While it can be very complicated if your team attempts to develop its own system to manage the process, this doesn’t need to be the case.</p><p>Let’s explore six great, open source tools your team can use to simplify data management and versioning.</p><h2 id="dvc">DVC</h2><p><a href="https://dvc.org/">DVC</a>, or Data Version Control, is one of many available open-source tools to help simplify your data science and machine learning projects. The tool takes a Git approach in that it provides a simple command line that can be set up with a few simple steps. DVC doesn’t just focus on data versioning, as its name suggests. It also helps teams manage their pipelines and machine learning models. In the end, DVC will help improve your team's consistency and the <a href="https://thegradient.pub/independently-reproducible-machine-learning/">reproducibility of your models</a>.</p><h3 id="pros">Pros</h3><ul><li>Lightweight, open-source, and usable across all major cloud platforms and storage types.</li><li>Flexible, format and framework agnostic, and easy to implement.</li></ul><h3 id="cons">Cons</h3><ul><li>DVC version control is tightly coupled with pipeline management. This means if your team is already using another data pipeline tool, there will be redundancy.</li><li>DVC is lightweight, which means your team might need to manually develop extra features to make it easy to use.</li></ul><h2 id="delta-lake">Delta Lake</h2><p><a href="https://delta.io/">Delta Lake</a> is an open-source storage layer to help improve data lakes. It does so by providing ACID transactions, data versioning, metadata management, and managing data versions.</p><p>The tool is closer to a data lake abstraction layer, filling in the gaps where most data lakes are limited.</p><h3 id="pros-1">Pros</h3><ul><li>Offers many features that might not be included in your current data storage system, such as ACID transactions or effective metadata management.</li><li>Reduces the need for hands-on data version management and dealing with other data issues, allowing developers to focus on building products on top of their data lakes instead.</li></ul><h3 id="cons-1">Cons</h3><ul><li>Delta Lake is often overkill for most projects as it was developed to operate on Spark and on big data.</li><li>Requires using a dedicated data format which means it is less flexible and not agnostic to your current formats.</li><li>Tool’s primary purpose is to act more like a data abstraction layer, which might not be what your team needs and can detour developers in need of a lighter solution.</li></ul><h2 id="git-lfs">Git LFS</h2><p><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-lfs">Git LFS</a> is an extension of Git developed by a number of open-source contributors. The software aims to eliminate large files that may be added into your repository (e.g., photos and data sets) by using pointers instead.</p><p>The pointers are lighter weight and point to the LFS store. Thus when you push your repo into the main repository, it doesn’t take long to update and doesn’t take up too much space.</p><p>This is a very lightweight option when it comes to managing data.</p><h3 id="pros-2">Pros</h3><ul><li>Integrates easily into most companies' development workflows.</li><li>Utilizes the same permissions as the Git repository so there is no need for additional permission management.</li></ul><h3 id="cons-2">Cons</h3><ul><li>Git LFS requires dedicated servers for storing your data. This, in turn, eventually leads to your data science teams being locked in as well as increased engineering work.</li><li>Git LFS servers are not meant to scale, unlike DVC, which stores data into a more general easy-to-scale object storage like S3.</li><li>Very specific and may require using a number of other tools for other steps of the data science workflow.</li></ul><h2 id="pachyderm">Pachyderm</h2><p><a href="https://pachyderm.io/">Pachyderm </a>is one of the few data science platforms on this list. Pachyderm’s aim is to create a platform that makes it easy to reproduce the results of machine learning models by managing the entire data workflow. In this regard, Pachyderm is “the Docker of data.”</p><p>Pachyderm leverages Docker containers to package up your execution environment. This makes it easy to reproduce the same output. The combination of both versioned data and Docker makes it easy for data scientists and DevOps teams to deploy models and ensure their consistency.</p><p>Pachyderm has committed itself to its <a href="https://www.pachyderm.com/dsbor/">Data Science Bill of Rights</a>, which outlines the product’s main goals: reproducibility, data provenance, collaboration, incrementality, and autonomy, and infrastructure abstraction.</p><p>These pillars drive many of its features and allow teams to take full advantage of the tool.</p><h3 id="pros-3">Pros</h3><ul><li>Based on containers, which makes your data environments portable and easy to migrate to different cloud providers.</li><li>Robust and can scale from relativity small to very large systems.</li></ul><h3 id="cons-3">Cons</h3><ul><li>More of a learning curve due to so many moving parts, such as the Kubernetes server required to manage Pachyderm’s free version.</li><li>With all the various technical components, it can be difficult to integrate Pachyderm into a company’s existing infrastructure.</li></ul><h2 id="dolt">Dolt</h2><p><a href="https://www.dolthub.com/docs/tutorials/installation/">Dolt</a> is a unique solution as far as data versioning goes. Unlike some of the other options presented that simply version data, Dolt is a database.</p><p>Dolt is an SQL database with Git-style versioning. Unlike Git, where you version files, Dolt versions tables. This means you can update and change data without worrying about losing the changes.</p><p>While the app is still new, there are plans to make it 100% Git- and MySQL-compatible in the near future.</p><h3 id="pros-4">Pros</h3><ul><li>Lightweight and partially open source.</li><li>SQL interface, making it more accessible for data analysts compared to more obscure options.</li></ul><h3 id="cons-4">Cons</h3><ul><li>Dolt is still a maturing product in comparison to other database versioning options.</li><li>Dolt is a DB, which means you must migrate your data into Dolt in order to get the benefits.</li><li>Built for versioning tables. That means that it won’t cover other types of data (e.g images, freeform text).</li></ul><h2 id="lakefs">LakeFS</h2><p><a href="https://lakefs.io/">LakeFS</a> lets teams build repeatable, atomic, and versioned data lake operations. It's a newcomer on this scene, but it packs a punch. It provides a Git-like branching and version control model that is meant to work with your data lake, scaling to Petabytes of data.</p><p>Similar to Delta Lake, it provides ACID compliance to your data lake. However, LakeFS supports both AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage as backends, which means it doesn't require using Spark to enjoy all the benefits.</p><h3 id="pros-5">Pros</h3><ul><li>Provides advanced capabilities such as ACID transactions for easy-to-use cloud storage such as S3 and GCS, all while being format agnostic.</li><li>Scales easily, supporting very large data lakes. Capable of providing version control for both development and production environments.</li></ul><h3 id="cons-5">Cons</h3><ul><li>LakeFS is a relatively new product, so features and documentation might change more rapidly compared to other solutions.</li><li>Focused on data versioning, which means you will need to use a number of other tools for other steps of the data science workflow.</li></ul><p>For all the benefits of data versioning, you don’t always need to be investing a huge effort in managing your data. For example, much of data versioning is meant to help track data sets that change a great deal over time.</p><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1484069560501-87d72b0c3669?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" alt="Where is the love sung by The Black Eye Peas recreated in a tunnel underpass." srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1484069560501-87d72b0c3669?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=600&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1484069560501-87d72b0c3669?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1484069560501-87d72b0c3669?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1600&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1484069560501-87d72b0c3669?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2400&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@emilymorter?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Emily Morter</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Some data, like web traffic, is only appended to. Meaning that data is added but rarely if ever changed. This means that the data versioning that is required to create reproducible results is the start and end dates. This is important to note, as in such cases, you might be able to avoid all the setup of the tools referenced above. You will still need to manage the start and end dates to ensure you’re testing on the same data every time, as well as the models you are creating. However, in these cases you won’t necessarily need to commit all the data to your versioning system.</p><p>Managing data …</p></div></div>

  <article>
<p>It’s halloween and time for another Gleam release! This time it’s an extra
special release as it also includes the first version of <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/otp">Gleam’s type safe
actor system</a>, compatible with Erlang’s OTP.</p>

<h2 id="mutual-recursion">Mutual recursion</h2>

<p>Historically functions in Gleam had to be defined in a module prior to being used.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>helper</span><span>()</span> <span>// Compile error! Function `helper` not found</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>helper</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>0</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This has proven to be an annoyance as even though our code <em>should</em> compile
(all the required functions have been defined in the module) the compiler
won’t succeed unless we carefully maintain a specific order of functions in
the module.</p>

<p>This limitation also forced the programmer to write any helper functions at
the top of the file, before the functions that make use of them. Many people
like to write their code in the opposite order with their entry-point at the
top (such as a <code>main</code> function), and then helper functions below. That way
the module reads top-to-bottom, introducing new functions in the order they
are used.</p>

<p>Lastly it also meant that two functions could not call each other, making
useful techniques such as mutual recursion impossible.</p>

<p>With this release statements in a module can be written in any order, and
they still don’t require any type annotations to be fully type checked.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>barry</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>io</span><span>.println</span><span>(</span><span>"To you!"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>paul</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>paul</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>io</span><span>.println</span><span>(</span><span>"To me!"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>barry</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s the only major change to the language this time. For a full list of
changes see the <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v0120-rc4---2020-10-31.">compiler changelog</a>.</p>

<p>Next up, Gleam’s new type safe actor system!</p>

<h2 id="gleam-otp">Gleam OTP</h2>

<p>Gleam’s actor system is built with a few primary goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Full type safety of actors and messages.</li>
  <li>Be compatible with Erlang’s OTP actor framework.</li>
  <li>Provide fault tolerance and self-healing through supervisors.</li>
  <li>Have equivalent performance to Erlang’s OTP.</li>
</ul>

<p>Two notable non-goals are that we are not explicitly supporting the BEAM’s
hot code upgrades, and we do not provide type safety for distributed
computing where two BEAM nodes on different computers send messages to each
other.</p>

<p>The core concepts of Gleam OTP are processes, channels, actors, and
supervisors. Let’s take a look at each of them.</p>

<h3 id="processes">Processes</h3>

<p>The core concurrency primitive in Gleam OTP is the process, which is a
lightweight green thread implemented by the BEAM virtual machine. These
processes are extremely cheap to create and run, and a single BEAM instance
can happily run millions of processes at the same time. It’s highly
sophisticated preemptive scheduler will ensure they make full use of all the
cores of the CPU, and no malicious or buggy process can block others from
running.</p>

<p>There’s a wealth of information online about the BEAM’s processes so we won’t
cover it all here, but know that Gleam’s actor system performs well thanks to
decades of excellent work by the Erlang community.</p>

<p>Use processes in Gleam we import the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_otp/0.1.1/gleam/otp/process/"><code>gleam/otp/process</code></a> module which
provides functions for creating and working with them.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>io</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>otp</span><span>/</span><span>process</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>process</span><span>.start</span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>io</span><span>.println</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello from the new process!"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>})</span>

  <span>io</span><span>.println</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello from the parent process!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this code snippet we create a new process using the
<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_otp/0.1.1/gleam/otp/process/#start"><code>process.start</code></a> function, before printing a message to
the console.</p>

<p>The newly created process also prints a message, but because the two
processes run asynchronously (and likely run on different CPU cores) we don’t
know which will be printed first. It could be the new one first, or it could
be the parent, and it could be different each time the program runs.</p>

<p>One important thing to note is that there’s no need for an <code>async/await</code>
syntax or callbacks. Asynchronous code in Gleam looks exactly the same to
regular synchronous code and doesn’t require any special types such as
futures or promises.</p>

<p>This should hopefully feel familiar to people familiar with concurrent
programming in languages such as Erlang, Elixir, and Go.</p>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<p>It’s not good enough to merely be able to create processes, we need processes
to be able to communicate and cooperate. Erlang and Gleam don’t have mutable
state so locks and shared mutable state is not an option- instead Gleam uses
channels.</p>

<p>Channels allow one process to send a message to another in a type safe
fashion, and they may be familiar to Go and Rust programmers.</p>

<p>A channel is made of a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_otp/0.1.1/gleam/otp/process/#Sender"><code>Sender</code></a>, which messages as sent into,
and a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_otp/0.1.1/gleam/otp/process/#Receiver"><code>Receiver</code></a>, which messages are pulled out of by the
channel owner process.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>io</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>otp</span><span>/</span><span>process</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Create a new channel owned by the current process</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>tuple</span><span>(</span><span>sender</span><span>,</span> <span>receiver</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>process</span><span>.new_channel</span><span>()</span>

  <span>process</span><span>.start</span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>io</span><span>.println</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello from the new process!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>// Send a message to the parent process</span>
    <span>process</span><span>.send</span><span>(</span><span>sender</span><span>,</span> <span>"Done"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>})</span>

  <span>// Receive a message from the child, waiting up to 100ms</span>
  <span>process</span><span>.receive</span><span>(</span><span>receiver</span><span>,</span> <span>100</span><span>)</span> <span>// This returns Ok("Done")</span>
  <span>io</span><span>.println</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello from the parent process!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here the code has been updated to use a channel to coordinate the processes.
The parent process creates a channel and waits for the child to send a
message over the channel before printing. Because of this we know that the
child process will now always print to the console before the parent does.</p>

<p>Here we’re just using a simple string message to synchronize processes but
any type we want can be sent over channel, enabling sharing of data in
concurrent programs.</p>

<p>The Gleam compiler can full type check channels. Because the message sent
with the sender is a <code>String</code> the compiler knows messages pulled from the
receiver must also be strings and will print a helpful error with any program
that doesn’t use these messages correctly.</p>

<h3 id="actors">Actors</h3>

<p>In programs written in Erlang using OTP we tend to not use raw processes
frequently, instead we use a higher level abstraction called <code>gen_server</code>
that builds upon a process to provide additional features making it more
suited to being used in a long-lived Erlang application. Gleam is similar,
though our higher level abstraction is called <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_otp/0.1.1/gleam/otp/actor/"><code>actor</code></a> and
differs in design to <code>gen_server</code> in order to provide type safety.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>io</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>otp</span><span>/</span><span>actor</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>otp</span><span>/</span><span>process</span><span>.</span><span>{</span><span>Sender</span><span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>type</span> <span>Message</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Request</span><span>(</span><span>reply_channel</span><span>:</span> <span>Sender</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span>))</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>actor</span> <span>=</span> <span>actor</span><span>.start</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>handle_message</span><span>)</span>

  <span>// Send a message to the child and wait for a response</span>
  <span>process</span><span>.call</span><span>(</span><span>actor</span><span>,</span> <span>Request</span><span>,</span> <span>100</span><span>)</span> <span>// This returns Ok("Done")</span>
  <span>io</span><span>.println</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello from the parent process!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>handle_message</span><span>(</span><span>msg</span><span>:</span> <span>Message</span><span>,</span> <span>state</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>io</span><span>.println</span><span>(</span><span>"The actor got a message"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>process</span><span>.send</span><span>(</span><span>msg</span><span>.reply_channel</span><span>,</span> <span>"Done"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>actor</span><span>.Continue</span><span>(</span><span>state</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here the code has been adapted to use an actor rather than a low-level
process, and instead of explicitly creating a new channel we use the
<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_otp/0.1.1/gleam/otp/process/#call"><code>call</code></a> function. This function is similar to Erlang’s
<code>gen_server:call</code> in that it provides a way to send a message to a process
and then wait until a reply is received.</p>

<p>Since an actor is being used here rather than a raw process it doesn’t shut
down after running the function once, instead the handler function is called
once per message received and the actor continues to run until either it is
requested to shut down or it returns <code>actor.Stop</code> from its handler function.</p>

<p>Any of OTP’s debug or system messages sent to the actor are automatically
handled by the actor implementation, while they would need to be manually
handled when using a raw process.</p>

<h3 id="supervisors">Supervisors</h3>

<p>Supervisors are special actors that start other actors and then monitor them
to ensure they are healthy. If one of the children crashes the supervisor
restarts it along with any younger children, restoring the program to a
healthy state now that any transient problems have ended.</p>

<p>If the problem is not transient and the child continues to crash then the
supervisor will shut down and then the supervisor’s supervisor can attempt a
restart now that more possibly invalid or corrupt state has been reset.</p>

<p>By using this supervision functionality OTP applications can achieve high
reliability by shedding state in an incremental fashion until the program
self-heals. This is kind-of similar to how Kubernetes and other container
orchestrators handle failure in microservices, though faster and more precise
thanks to it being integrated at all levels of the program.</p>

<p>Here we have a supervisor for a pretend Gleam web application. It has 3
children of the type <code>worker</code>, a database connection, an actor responsible
for monitoring, and a HTTP handling actor. If we were adding a supervisor
child we could use the <code>supervisor</code> function instead of <code>worker</code>.</p>

<h3 id="going-forward">Going forward</h3>

<p>Gleam OTP v0.1 is the result of approaching 2 years of research and
implementation, mostly focusing on how to strike a good balance between type
safety and compatibility with existing Erlang OTP patterns.</p>

<p>Rather than build on top of Erlang’s <code>supervisor</code> and <code>gen_server</code> Gleam OTP
has a small core written in Erlang which implements the <code>Receiver</code> half of
channels, and the rest is implemented in Gleam. Thanks to this we can have
greater confidence in the viability of the core abstractions as they have
been sufficient to implement the rest of Gleam OTP in a type safe fashion.</p>

<p>These APIs (particularly supervisor) are experimental and open to breaking
changes as we discover new ways to improve them, but we’ve reach a point
where we can start writing programs using it.</p>

<p>If you write something using Gleam OTP please do get in touch and let us know
how you find it!</p>

<h2 id="discord-chat">Discord chat</h2>

<p>Lastly, we’ve got a new home for the community! The Gleam IRC channel has
been replaced by the Gleam Discord chat server to great success. Since
opening we’ve seen a big increase in activity and lots of new exciting Gleam</p></article></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>For the last 13 years, I’ve been some form of professional web developer, and for the last 21 months, I’ve been a dad. We’re lucky enough that my salary means Sophie (my wife) is able to be a stay at home mum. We both love this arrangement, as we don’t need to sort out child care, and as I work remotely from home, our daughter gets to spend a lot of time with us.</p> <p><em><strong>Note:</strong> We decided before she was born that we didn’t want our daughter to have an online presence until she was old enough to decide for herself. This is why I won’t be referring to her by name. My apologies if that makes this a little awkward to read.</em></p> <p>In August this year, Sophie had to be rushed into hospital for life-saving surgery, which thankfully was successful. She did however have a long recovery period, so for two weeks after the surgery, I didn’t work.</p> <p>I spent that two weeks being a full time dad, carer, and house husband.</p> <p>Under normal circumstances, I work 9:00 to 5:00 Monday to Friday, while Sophie looks after our daughter and the house. Outside of those hours we share the housework and childcare. One downside to this is that Sophie gets to spend a lot more time one-to-one with our daughter than I do.</p> <p>However, during those first two weeks of Sophie’s recovery, I did all the childcare, and all the house work. My days started at 7:00am, and usually didn’t finish until 8:00pm, when we’d had dinner and I’d done the washing up. I’d get a couple of hours off in the afternoon when our daughter was napping, although that was often spent doing house work. And this was seven days a week.</p> <p>It was the longest days I’d ever worked, and by far the hardest job I’ve ever had. But it was also the most rewarding.</p> <p>This new routine also highlighted the effect my usual sedentary lifestyle was having on my health and fitness, as at the end of the first few days of being a full time dad, I’d lay down in bed with aching legs. I’d not done anything specifically strenuous on those days. Simply running round with a very active toddler all day was far more exertion than my puny legs were used to. It’s prompted me to get back into running, as well as look into setting up a sit/stand desk (I did have a standing desk for a while, but ultimately abandoned it. That’s s story for another post).</p> <p>I loved getting to spend so much time one on one with our daughter, and we definitely connected more. She’s such a joy to be around, at an age where she’s putting a lot of small, adorable, and often hilarious sentences together. This also means she is able to express how she feels, and even engage in something resembling a conversation.</p> <p>I also had a lot of learning to do, things like what washing machine setting to use when washing bedding, and how to time preparing our daughter’s meals. One of the most important lessons for me was learning more of her abilities, and just how much she is able to do now. As a result, I feel more at ease when she is experimenting and exploring. I’ve always been the more cautious parent, which I think is in part because I don’t spend as much time with our daughter, so I’m less aware of her capabilities.</p> <p>We also learned new ways of making each other laugh, which often ends up in a positive feedback loop turning from giggles into uncontrollable laughing fits.</p> <p>I enjoy programming, and I love my job, but at the end of those two weeks, when Sophie was feeling well enough to return to a more normal routine, I honestly didn’t want to go back to work.</p> <p>I feel incredibly lucky to be able to do the job I do. It’s physically easy (although often mentally exhausting), the pay is great, and I can do it from the comfort of my own home.</p> <p>That being said, if money wasn’t a factor, I’d chose being a full time dad every time. It’s the best job I ever had.</p> <p><em>– Matt</em></p> </div> </article> </div></div>]]>

<section>
	<h2>WorldWideWeb</h2>
	<div>
		<p>The idea of hypertext preceded the World Wide Web by decades. But nearly all hypertext systems worked on local files. Tim Berners-Lee wanted to create a system that would work across networks so that people could link from a file on one machine to another file on another machine.</p>
		<p>WorldWideWeb wasn't just a programme for browsing files. It was a browser and editor. The introductory text reads:</p>
		<blockquote>HyperMedia Browser/Editor, An excercise in global information availability by Tim Berners-Lee</blockquote>
		<p>Today it's hard to imagine that web browsers might also be used to create web pages. It turned out that people were quite happy to write HTML by hand—something that Tim Berners-Lee and colleagues never expected. They thought that some kind of user interface would be needed for making web pages and links. That's what the WorldWideWeb browser provided. You could open a document in one window and "mark" it. Then, in a document in another window, you could create a link to the marked page.</p>
		<p>You'll notice as you use the WorldWideWeb browser that you need to double-click links to open them. That's because a single click was used for editing.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Browsing</h2>
	<div>
		<p>The user interface of the WorldWideWeb browser somewhat blurred the lines between documents on your own computer and documents out on the network. To "browse" directly to a document out on the network, you need to know its URL. But you can't simply type that URL into an address bar; there is no address bar. Instead you have to follow a sequence of steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>From the "WorldWideWeb" menu, select "Document".</li>
			<li>Now from the newly-opened "Document" menu, select "Open from full document reference".</li>
			<li>Type the URL into the field marked "reference".</li>
			<li>Press the "Open" button</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Once you've got a web-based document (or web page, as we would say today) open in WorldWideWeb, you can navigate by double-clicking on links. Every link you double-click will open in a new window.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Linking</h2>
	<div>
		<p>At its heart, WorldWideWeb is a word processor …but with links. And just as you <em>can</em> use a word processor purely for reading documents, the real fun comes when you write your own. Especially when you throw hyperlinks into the mix.</p>
		<p>To create a document:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>From the "WorldWideWeb" menu, select "New File..."</li>
			<li>Type the name of the file you want to create e.g. example.html</li>
			<li>In the boilerplate document, click on the heading to edit. Same with the text.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Once you've got a document written, it's time to turn from regular text into <em>hyper</em>text:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>From the "WorldWideWeb" menu, select "Links"</li>
			<li>To link to another document, you need to have that other document open in another window. Click on its title bar to focus it.</li>
			<li>With that document in focus, select "Mark all" from the "Links" menu.</li>
			<li>Now switch back to your example.html document and highlight the text you want to be a link.</li>
			<li>From the "Links" menu, select "Link to marked".</li>
		</ol>
		<p>You can even save your new document on to your hard drive. Click on "Save a copy offline" under the "Documents" menu.</p>
		<p>Once you've downloaded the file to your computer, you can open it up with a text editor to see what the HTML would have looked like.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Editing</h2>
<div>
	<p>To edit any document, whether it's one you created, or a page on the world wide web:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Click on the text you want edit.</li>
		<li>Edit it.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>That's it.</p>
	<p>If you want to keep a copy of the edited document, choose "Save a copy offline" from the "Documents" menu.</p>
	</div>

October 31, 2020 | https://www.nabla.com/blog/gpt-3/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.nabla.com/blog/gpt-3/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You may have heard about GPT-3 this summer, the new cool kid on the AI block. GPT-3 came out of OpenAI, one of the top AI research labs in the world which was founded in late 2015 by Elon Musk, Sam Altman and others and later backed with a $1B investment from Microsoft.</p>
<p>You’ve probably also heard about the ongoing AI revolution in healthcare, thanks to promising results in areas such as automated diagnosis, medical documentation and drug discovery, to name a few.
Some have claimed that algorithms now outperform doctors on <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/10/ai-can-outperform-doctors-so-why-dont-patients-trust-it">certain tasks</a> and others have even announced that robots will soon receive <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insights-intelai/2018/09/21/the-ultimate-physicians-assistant/">medical degrees</a> of their own! This can all sound far-fetched... but could this robot actually be GPT-3?</p>
<p>Our unique multidisciplinary team of doctors and machine learning engineers at Nabla had the chance to test this new model to tease apart what’s real and what’s hype by exploring different healthcare use cases.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp0.jpg" alt="Primary care and GPT-3"></p>
<h2>But first, coffee</h2>
<p>In machine learning, a language model like GPT-3 simply tries to predict a word in a sentence given the previous words, called the context. It’s a supercharged autocomplete system like the one you may use with Gmail. Being able to predict the next word in a sentence seems deceptively simple at first, but this actually enables many compelling use cases, such as chatbots, translation or Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, GPT-3 is the most complex language model ever trained, with a whopping 175 billion parameters in total - that’s as many knobs that are fine-tuned over weeks of intensive cloud computing to make the AI magic work. Certainly a huge number, but still way below the 100 (or maybe 1000+) trillion synapses in the human brain that enable reasoning, perception and emotions.</p>
<p>Thanks to the large size of the model, GPT-3 can be applied on new tasks and ‘few-shot’ demonstrations without any further fine-tuning on specific data. In practice, this means the model can successfully understand the task to perform with only a handful of initial examples. This property is a huge improvement compared to previous, less complex language models, and is much closer to actual human behavior - we don’t need thousands of examples to distinguish a cat from a dog.</p>
<p>Despite obvious biases learned from the data used for training - basically books plus the whole Internet, from Wikipedia to the New York Times - GPT-3's ability to transform natural language into websites, create basic financial reports, solve langage puzzles, or even generate guitar tables has been very promising so far. But what about healthcare?</p>
<h2>Then, the obvious disclaimer</h2>
<p>As Open AI itself warns in GPT-3 guidelines, healthcare “is in the high stakes category because people rely on accurate medical information for life-or-death decisions, and mistakes here could result in serious harm”. Furthermore, diagnosing medical or psychiatric conditions falls straight in the “unsupported use” of the model. Despite this we wanted to give it a shot and see how it does on the following healthcare use cases, roughly ranked from low to high sensitivity from a medical perspective: admin chat with a patient, medical insurance check, mental health support, medical documentation, medical questions &amp; answers and medical diagnosis. We also looked at the impact of some parameters of the model on the answers - spoiler alert, it’s fascinating!</p>
<h2>GPT-3, your next medical assistant?</h2>
<p>Our first tests showed that GPT-3 seemed to work for basic admin tasks such as appointment booking, but when digging a bit we found that the model had no clear understanding of time, nor any proper logic. Its memory also sometimes fell short - for the appointment in the example below, the patient’s initial 6pm constraint is overlooked as GPT-3 suggests booking for 7pm after a few messages.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp1.jpg" alt="Medical assistant example with GPT-3"></p>
<h2>What about insurance checks?</h2>
<p>Similar to the admin tasks above, GPT-3 could help nurses or patients to quickly find a piece of information in a very long document, like finding insurance benefits for specific medical examinations. In the example below we seeded the model with a 4-page standard benefits table that shows a $10 copay for an X-ray, $20 for an MRI exam, and then asked 2 simple questions. GPT-3 was able to get the copay for an X-ray but could not sum up the copays for several exams, which again highlights a lack of basic reasoning.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp2.jpg" alt="Insurance checks example with GPT-3"></p>
<h2>Recycle to relieve stress!</h2>
<p>Relax on your living room sofa and talk, GPT-3 will listen to your problems endlessly and may even give you some actionable tips! This is probably one of the best use cases for GPT-3 in healthcare, and it’s not so surprising given the already good results from the Eliza algorithm back in 1966, which managed to give a human touch with only pattern matching rules operating behind the scenes.</p>
<p>One key difference between the two approaches though is that rule-based systems like Eliza were in full control of the computer’s response. In other words, we are certain that nothing potentially harmful could be said.</p>
<p>This contrasts with the example below in which GPT-3 sadly tells us that committing suicide is a good idea…</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp4.jpg" alt="Kill switch example with GPT-3"></p>
<p>The model can also shoot unexpected answers where it suggests recycling more to ease stress - using a rationale which, while being convoluted, is actually quite sensible!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp3.jpg" alt="Recycling and stress example with GPT-3"></p>
<h2>Medical documentation</h2>
<p>GPT-3 has already shown promising results in summarizing and simplifying text, something that could be very useful for patients to understand medical reports often full of jargon, or for doctors to quickly get the gist of a patient’s long medical history. Well, GPT-3 is probably not quite ready for this (yet?). Our tests show dangerous oversimplifications, difficulties to associate causes and consequences, and once again a lack of basic deductive reasoning.</p>
<h2>Medical Q&amp;A: not as good as good ol’ Google yet</h2>
<p>When looking for specific scientific information, drug dosages or prescription support, our experiments show that GPT-3 is not reliable enough to be safely used as a trustworthy support tool for doctors. One serious concern is that GPT-3 very often gives wrong yet grammatically correct answers, with no scientific reference that a physician could check. A tired doctor caught in the rush of an emergency department could easily confuse a syntactically sound statement for a medically valid one. For example the first answer below is correct but not the second.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp5.jpg" alt="Q&amp;A medical example with GPT-3"></p>
<h2>Diagnosis: at your own risk</h2>
<p>A more complex Q&amp;A task is diagnosis: input symptoms and get possible underlying conditions that may explain these symptoms. Recent symptom checker systems (Babylon, Ada, KHealth, etc.), if not perfect, seem to be a better option here than GPT-3 as they’ve been carefully optimized for this sole purpose. One benefit of these systems is that they can output different diagnoses with their probabilities, which acts as a measure of confidence for the practitioner. If the first diagnosis example below GPT-3 ignores the fever of the little girl that suggests ethmoiditis and mentions a “rash” that does not exist.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp6.jpg" alt="Medical diagnosis 1 example with GPT-3"></p>
<p>In another test, GPT-3 misses a pulmonary embolism. Fortunately nobody died here!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp7.jpg" alt="Medical diagnosis 2 example with GPT-3"></p>
<h2>Under the hood</h2>
<p>As others have observed, the quality of GPT-3 outputs is much impacted by the seed words used - the same question formulated in two different ways can result in very different answers. The model’s various parameters, such as the temperature and the top P also play a big role. Temperature and top P control the risks and creativity that the engine will exhibit in its answers.</p>
<h3>Temperature</h3>
<p>For the same input and a high temperature we get two answers with very different tones telling two opposite things. Here is an example with T = 0.9.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp8.jpg" alt="High temperature parameter and GPT-3"></p>
<p>By contrast, a similar seed with a very low temperature (T = 0) will always result in the same and quite straightforward answer.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp9.jpg" alt="Low temperature parameter and GPT-3"></p>
<h3>Frequency penalty and presence penalty</h3>
<p>It is also pertinent to mention the frequency penalty and presence penalty parameters, which prevent both word repetition and subject repetition. In a medical context, the intuition would be to reduce them as much as possible since a too abrupt subject switch can be very confusing and repetition can actually be pedagogical. However, comparing two conversations where the human asks the same questions, we clearly observe that the model with repetition penalties seems more empathic and friendly than the other one which appears cold and too repetitive to be human. Here is an example with no penalty.</p>

<p>And an example with full penalty.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As warned by OpenAI, we are nowhere near any real time scenario where GPT-3 would significatively help in healthcare. Because of the way it was trained, it lacks the scientific and medical expertise that would make it useful for medical documentation, diagnosis support, treatment recommendation or any medical Q&amp;A. Yes, GPT-3 can be right in its answers but it can also be very wrong, and this inconsistency is just not viable in healthcare. Even for more administrative tasks such as translating or summarizing medical jargon, GPT-3 while promising is still many moons away for a production use case actually supporting doctors. We’re still in this phase where multiple, narrow-task supervised models win over a single, very ambitious approach.</p>
<p>That being said, GPT-3 seems to be quite ready to fight burnout and help doctors with a chit-chat module. It could bring back the joy and empathy you would get from a conversation with your medical residents at the end of the day, that conversation that helps you come down to earth at the end of a busy day. Also, there is no doubt that language models in general will be improving at a fast pace, with a positive impact not only on the use cases described above but also on other important problems, such as information structuring and normalisation or automatic consultation summaries.</p>
<p>And at Nabla, we are working on it!<br>

                    <p><a href="https://www.snowflake.com/data-warehousing-glossary/data-enrichment/">Data enrichment</a> is a powerful technique for adding valuable context to your customer data, and it’s simple in theory – given a bit of data about a record (e.g. a user's email or the IP of a web session), tell me more information about it so I can take effective action (e.g. map the email domain to a company or map the IP to a geolocation). In practice, however, it can be difficult to integrate a data enrichment process into an existing ELT pipeline, for a few reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>Maintaining Freshness: </strong>How recent are the results being correlated with my data? This may be a function of how often external datasets are loaded or how up-to-date your third-party data provider’s information is.</li><li><strong>Ensuring Consistency: </strong>Once data is enriched with new attributes, can I easily push those attributes to my warehouse and SaaS tools to maintain a synchronized data model?</li><li><strong>Limiting Resource Usage: </strong>Enrichment processes can be expensive in storage costs (to maintain huge third-party data sets), processing time, and API quota usage for paid enrichment services. And enrichment processes shouldn’t unnecessarily repeat the same work over and over again.</li></ul><p>In this post, I’ll share our recipe for enriching our own customer data at Census using the <a href="https://clearbit.com/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Clearbit</a> API, Snowflake External Functions, and <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/product/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">dbt</a> to enrich data correctly and efficiently over large data sets.</p><p>One note before we begin, if you’re new to data enrichment: there’s a key difference between enriching using a dataset and enriching using an API. Some enrichment pipelines make use of third party datasets that can be purchased in their entirety – you can see many examples of these in the <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/data-marketplace/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Snowflake Data Marketplace</a>. This kind of data can be easier to work with because you can rely on your warehouse to efficiently <code>LEFT JOIN</code> to these datasets and materialize the result on a schedule. However, an enrichment API doesn’t give you the full dataset to work with; it replies to your queries (one at a time or in bulk) in a request-reply style to tell you if the API has additional data for the company or person in question. These are more challenging to work with in a data warehousing context, and we built this pipeline so that we can perform both types of enrichment without leaving the comfort of our warehouse SQL environment.</p><h3 id="snowflake-s-external-functions">Snowflake's External Functions</h3><p>External functions are a recentaddition in modern data warehouses. An external function is like a traditional <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/user-defined-functions.html">user-defined function (UDF)</a>, but it allows you to break free of the database sandbox by calling an external handler to calculate results. For example, Redshift has basic support for <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_CREATE_EXTERNAL_FUNCTION.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">external functions</a> that call Lambda functions to compute their results.</p><p>Snowflake's <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/external-functions-introduction.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">external functions</a> call out to an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">AWS API Gateway</a> endpoint to retrieve results, which allows us to connect many different handlers, including Lambda functions. Calls from SQL will be batched into JSON HTTP requests and proxied to the configured handler, which needs to unwrap the batch items, calculate appropriate values, and then return a batch of results as JSON. Setting up a gateway and handlers in AWS for the first time isn’t trivial, but the design allows a lot of flexibility. I won't go through that process in this post but you can read about it in Snowflake's <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/external-functions-creating-aws.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">documentation</a>. We automate this using a <a href="https://www.terraform.io/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Terraform</a> module, which we hope to open source soon.

            <p>TORONTO -- 
	Lisa Carr never thought her work would lead to armed threats, a firebombing, a shooting and a conspiracy to kill her.</p>
<p>
	The Carr Law office is in a nondescript strip mall in Vaughan, Ont., north of Toronto. It’s closed now, after the litigation lawyer says police told her they could no longer protect her.</p>
<p>
	She was shuttled to another country where she spent five long months in hiding. Carr has never before told her story, but agreed to meet for an interview as part of a W5 investigation into the shady underbelly of an industry that forced her to give up her business and almost cost her, her life: The tow truck industry.</p>

	Over the last number of years, criminal elements have been battling for lucrative control of the major highways around the Toronto area. It has resulted in more than 50 arsons, multiple shootings and at least four murders.</p>
<p>
	So why is there so much violence over a couple of hundred-dollar tows at the side of the road? Because that one tow can net tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>
	Here’s how it works: The tow truck driver gets a kickback from an unscrupulous auto body shop, which then submits wildly inflated repair fees to an insurance company.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="york police" src="https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4954903!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_960/image.jpg"></p>
<p>
	The insurance industry estimates that fake repair bills tally up to $2 billion a year in Canada. And that’s why Carr was in the crosshairs. She was hired by an insurance company to challenge bogus claims.</p>
<p>
	Over the course of a number of months, Carr’s law firm was the target of increasingly violent attacks. First a firebombing and then her office was set on fire.</p>
<p>
	Months later, in broad daylight, a colleague leaving work had a gun put to her head and was told, “Stop suing our friends.” Shortly after that, again in broad daylight, someone opened fire through the front door of the busy office.</p>
<p>
	Carr says it is incredible no one was struck by the flurry of bullets.</p>
<p>
	“I looked down the hall and I saw my receptionist on her hands and knees surrounded by glass. And one of the other girls came running at me saying, ‘Shots fired, shots fired. Call 911.’”</p>
<p>
	While the violence surrounding the tow truck industry has made headlines in the Greater Toronto Area, the story that has never been told is that York Regional Police (YRP) uncovered a plot to kill Carr.</p>
<p>
	It was such a credible threat that they gave her an hour to pack up her belongings and leave her home. Carr and her husband were then whisked out of the country and spent five months in hiding.</p>
<p>
	Three separate police services – YRP, Toronto Police Service and Ontario Provincial Police – joined forces to launch Project Platinum to investigate the violence associated with the tow truck industry.</p>
<p>
	They carried out a series of raids this past spring, which netted dozens of high-powered weapons and led to the arrests of 35 people who face almost 500 charges, including the attempted murder of Carr.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="weapon" src="https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4954983!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_960/image.jpg"></p>
<p>
	Now back in Canada, Carr says police have told her she is likely no longer in danger, but with one caveat.</p>
<p>
	“The police said we believe the risk is low. As long as you don't go back to work, as long as you don't restart the firm,” she says.</p>
<p>
	“So they have effectively ended my career. We lost everything. They won.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
		<p>E-mail is what connects most people.</p>
<p>It holds most of our accounts, helps us communicate with one another, and can be used for a variety of tasks, including shopping lists, personal notes, and much more.
With that many responsibilities in place, we can surely attest that our mailboxes are both pretty important and sensitive, we should not lose access to them, and we should avoid sharing their contents as much as we can.</p>
<p>Still, running your own e-mail server infrastructure is <em>an absolute pain</em>, for a large variety of reasons, including anti-spam flagging (DKIM, SPF, and other stuff to maintain), blacklists avoidance (because Microsoft and Google are always frisky with their blacklists), and some other problems.</p>
<p>Some choose to handle this cost, resulting in an infrastructure they have <em>absolute control</em> over, and for which they can tailor their backup solutions.
Some others aren't so inclined to partake in such tedious maintenance, and choose instead to put their trust in some companies<sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Both choices are fine per-se, but they both fall under the same issue: "what happens if my host dies?".
This question could be talking about a temporary network outage, a database corruption issue (data loss), or the service outright dying or blocking you without rescourse.</p>
<p>The common result in all those issues (and many more I haven't mentioned) is that you lose access.
A good idea is to keep a replica of them somewhere, ideally not on the same server used to host them.
Some e-mail services offer automated backups, but since I don't know their backup policy (how the backups are handled, how reliable is the system, and other considerations), I prefer to have my own, which stores files the way I want, in a storage of my liking.</p>
<p>For that, you have multiple solutions and tools you can set up.</p>
<p>The nifty tool <a href="http://pyropus.ca/software/getmail/"><code>getmail</code></a> is the one I chose to go with.
With it, you could for example choose to move your e-mails from your "main" IMAP server to another IMAP server (e.g. the one provided and automatically configured by Synology on their Synology DSM NAS OS shipped with all their NAS), but I chose another solution: to move the e-mails from the main IMAP server to a local storage, i.e. as a list of <a href="http://cr.yp.to/proto/maildir.html">maildir</a>-formatted files.</p>
<p>This allows me to get all my e-mails as text documents on my local computer, so I can access, search, and index them as I wish at any given moment.</p>
<h2>Setting up <code>getmail</code> for local download of e-mails</h2>
<p>The tool <code>getmail</code> is configued by a configuration file stored by default at <code>~/.getmail/getmailrc</code>.
For this example, we'll want to backup our e-mails at <code>~/Documents/my-emails</code>.</p>
<p>The configuration format, as described <a href="http://pyropus.ca/software/getmail/configuration.html">in their documentation</a>, is pretty straightforward in our case.</p>
<p>We want to get our e-mails from the IMAP server our mail provider gives us and save them all in our folder (given above).</p>
<p>We start by configuring our IMAP source.</p>
<pre><code><span>[retriever]</span>
<span>type</span> = SimpleIMAPSSLRetriever
<span>server</span> = mail.my.domain
<span>username</span> = user@mail.my.domain
<span>password</span> = this-is-a-test-password
<span>mailboxes</span> = ALL</code></pre>
<p>We then have to point how and where we want to send them.</p>
<pre><code><span>[destination]</span>
<span>type</span> = MailDir
<span>path</span> = ~/Documents/my-emails</code></pre>
<p>If we run the command <code>getmail</code> right away, we'll notice that it indeed works!
Well, kinda.
The issue here is that every unread e-mail will be flagged as read once the tool handled them, which isn't really what we want...</p>
<p>For this reason, we must add another configuration entry to disable that.</p>
<pre><code><span>[options]</span>
<span>read_all</span> = <span>False</span></code></pre>
<p>And that's it!</p>
<p>You can just throw it in a systemd timer or a crontab, and be done with it, it will silently run and copy all your e-mails the way you want!</p>
<pre><code>*/15 * * * * getmail</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>For reference, this configuration is almost mine, and I chose to put the nifty tool <a href="https://restic.net/"><code>restic</code></a> behind <a href="http://pyropus.ca/software/getmail/"><code>getmail</code></a> to automatically encrypt and backup my e-mails in a snapshot-based backup setup on my NAS in addition to the local clone.</p>

<![CDATA[We Chose Node.js over Python for Our Product]]>

October 31, 2020 | https://swimm.io/blog/why-we-chose-node-js-over-python-for-our-product/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://swimm.io/blog/why-we-chose-node-js-over-python-for-our-product/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-2ee12136="" data-v-61c0ab88=""><div><p>Launching a new product is a daunting road of experimentation that requires precision and calibration, like fixing a plane while flying. In our early MVP days (little shorter than a year ago), we started writing our web application with <strong>Vue for the Frontend and Python for the Backend</strong>. Six months later we launched our Alpha product for Swimm, and it was a more robust product that enables an experience for users switching between a CLI and the web app.</p>
<p>As a long time Pythonist, I followed my gut intuition and implemented the first version of our CLI in Python. It was unexpected but, several demos in with our first clients, revealed some major gaps we did not anticipate when starting off.</p>
<h2>Lessons Learned: Node JS vs Python</h2>
<p>It seems that Python and JavaScript <a href="https://medium.com/@xccelerate/python-vs-javascript-which-language-you-should-learn-and-why-cd29c64935c">are especially prevalent</a> among young tech startups - according to <a href="https://userbrain.net/blog/programming-language-startup">Nick Kamyshan</a>, CEO at Chanty, “The Most popular technologies I see startups use today are Python, Java, Ruby, C, Swift, JavaScript, and PHP.”</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#key-results">Stack Overflow’s developer survey in 2019</a>, Python, the fastest-growing major programming language, rising in the ranks of languages and edging out Java in 2020, standing as the second most loved language (after Rust).</p><blockquote>— MIT CSAIL (@MIT_CSAIL) <a href="https://twitter.com/MIT_CSAIL/status/1288515126409060354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 29, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>While it remains a <strong>heated debate [JS vs Python?]</strong>, I didn’t really perform an in-depth comparison for choosing my go-to language for our CLI. Instead, I just used Python as it was the most intuitive solution for me. Yet as we started Demos with clients, we realized we needed to easily wrap the CLI as a tool that can be run, and distributed to clients.</p>
<p>With Python, <strong>this is not a trivial task</strong>. While it’s theoretically possible to send your Python code as it is, any difference between your environment and the client’s (e.g., different dependencies versions) may cause things to fail. <strong>After searching the web for solutions</strong>, we ended up using <a href="https://www.pyinstaller.org/">PyInstaller</a>.</p>
<p>From the project’s website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&gt; PyInstaller freezes (packages) Python applications into stand-alone executables, under Windows, GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, Solaris and AIX.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://swimm.io/media/screen-shot-2020-09-02-at-20.13.24.png" alt="Pyinstaller"></p>
<p>It sounded like a really good solution, but it turned out to be far from ideal. Our clients use different OS versions, in order to ship our code to Windows - I had to run Pyinstaller on Windows to ship to OSX - run Pyinstaller on OSX, and so on. While this can be solved with a CI/CD pipeline, things started to feel wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, one client was using a specific distribution, Ubuntu16.04. I had used Pyinstaller to pack our CLI using Ubuntu 18.04, thinking it would comply with all linux distributions, but little did I know. Reading through <a href="https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html">the docs</a>, this seems to be a known issue:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&gt; Under GNU/Linux, PyInstaller does not bundle libc (the C standard library, usually glibc, the Gnu version) with the app. Instead, the app expects to link dynamically to the libc from the local OS where it runs. The interface between any app and libc is forward compatible to newer releases, but it is not backward compatible to older releases.</p>
<p>For this reason, if you bundle your app on the current version of GNU/Linux, it may fail to execute (typically with a runtime dynamic link error) if it is executed on an older version of GNU/Linux.</p>
<p>The solution is to always build your app on the <em>oldest</em> version of GNU/Linux you mean to support. It should continue to work with the libc found on newer versions.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The documentation includes other daunting notes, e.g. “For Python &gt;= 3.5 targeting Windows &lt; 10, the developer needs to take special care”.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, I got to realize <strong>this solution isn’t good enough for us</strong>. While Python may be a wonderful language for the backend, it just seems like <strong>the wrong solution for a product that</strong> <strong>needs to run on a client’s machine</strong>, at least in case we don’t want to assume anything about the client’s environment without disclosing our code.</p>
<p>Eventually, I completely rewrote our CLI with NodeJS, <strong>throwing my Python implementation away</strong>. I ended up using the great project <a href="https://github.com/vercel/pkg">pkg</a> for packaging our NodeJS code. We have now been running on Node.js for 6 months, and a team of 5 happy developers.</p>
<h2>Happy Combo: Node.JS + Vue.JS</h2>
<p><strong>Another advantage of moving to Node JS</strong> was having (most of) our stack consist of one programming language - JavaScript.</p>
<p>It’s not uncommon to have multiple microservices, each written in a different language. When the entire codebase is in the same language, it’s easier to teach a team of developers specific topics on JavaScript taking out the hassle of teaching different languages and for different code areas.</p>
<p>This makes things much easier for <strong>engineer onboarding</strong> - at least when it comes to programming languages a new programmer onboarding the team needs to master. Of course they need to be aligned on our best practices for JavaScript and know JavaScript well, but at least most of these best practices will be the same across our repository.</p>
<p>In addition, <strong>when using pkg, private packages</strong> are <a href="https://github.com/vercel/pkg/issues/340">stored as tokenized v8 compilations</a>, so the source code isn’t available (especially not as easy as with <a href="https://programming.vip/docs/decompile-pyinstaller-packaged-exe-installation-package.html">PyInstaller’s compiled files</a>).</p>
<h2>Conclusions of Python-Enthusiast</h2>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>"Is python a good language to start learning?"</p><p>I can't tell you how often I get this question.<br>Yes. Python is great!<br>Javascript is Great!</p><p>All languages are great tools to solve problems.<br>It doesn't matter what you start learning AS LONG as you start.<br>Find your beginning.</p></div>— Danny Thompson (@DThompsonDev) <a href="https://twitter.com/DThompsonDev/status/1299427067810009088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 28, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p><strong>Reading all of this, highlights some major goals</strong> we have as a team on our day-to-day: experiment, learn on the go, and make our collaboration processes more efficient. Our road map already includes a future shift to TypeScript, a subset of JavaScript with its own set of benefits also <a href="https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-typescript?aid=5082902844932096&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=edpresso-dynamic&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIgPGprKrC6wIVhud3Ch2GyQCdEAAYASAAEgJAU_D_BwE">helpful for team collaboration</a>.</p>
<p><strong>On a personal note, I love Python</strong>. After years of programming in Python it wasn’t an easy choice for me to choose to develop a product in JavaScript. I miss the Context Managers that don’t exist in JS and the libraries I know so well. But also, as a linguist I might add, sometimes, transitioning between programming languages is like speaking a new language fluently but with a strong foreign accent (more about that in another post).</p>

<p>
Computers used to be fun. Programming felt magical – it gave you the
ability to create something out of nothing. Over the last few decades, personal
computers have become increasingly impersonal, and programming has lost much of
that magic.
</p>
<p>
But some still recognize that programming can be a creative endeavor, undertaken
for its own sake. In fact, there are thriving communities working to create
elegant, empowering tools for the next generation of tinkerers. In this article,
I want to highlight some of my favorite projects that are working to bring magic
back to programming.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php" rel="nofollow">PICO-8</a>
is a <i>fantasy console</i> – an emulator for a Commodore 64-era computer
that never existed. You can just boot it up and start typing in commands from
<a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php?page=manual" rel="nofollow">the manual</a>.
PICO-8 is perfect for people who are new to programming, and its constraints make
it a fun challenge even for experienced programmers.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://pharo.org/" rel="nofollow">Pharo</a>
is a living descendant of the legendary Smalltalk-80 system. Describing it as a
programming language would be inadequate – it's like a world inside a
computer. Pharo is expansive, yet playing around in it feels cozy. Spending a
few weekends with this environment has enriched my appreciation for what
programming can be.
</p>
<p>
Few things are more satisfying than bootstrapping an entire programming language
from scratch.
<a href="https://github.com/nornagon/jonesforth" rel="nofollow">Jonesforth</a>
is a complete
implementation of the Forth programming language in
<a href="https://github.com/nornagon/jonesforth/blob/master/jonesforth.S" rel="nofollow">a couple thousand lines of thoroughly commented assembly code</a>.
Forth sits somewhere in the space between genius and insanity. It's weird and
beautiful, and well worth tinkering with.
</p>
<p>
If you want to go a level deeper, Andreas Kling is
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AndreasKling/videos" rel="nofollow">documenting the process of building an entire operating system in C++</a>.
His videos about
<a href="http://serenityos.org/" rel="nofollow">SerenityOS</a>
show just how much work goes into building an operating system – but also
demonstrate that such a feat is remarkably achievable.
</p>
<p>
Modern computers are complicated, but the principles behind them don't have to
be.
<a href="https://eater.net/" rel="nofollow">Ben Eater's</a>
video series in which he
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyznrdDSSGM&amp;list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU" rel="nofollow">builds his own computer on a breadboard</a>
is a must watch, even if you're not planning to follow along yourself. He
explains the process so elegantly that it almost seems obvious.
</p>
<p>
But you don't need an interest in electronics or operating systems to enjoy
programming. Web development has a reputation for being needlessly obtuse, but
at its best, the Web is one of the most amazing technologies we have. It lets
you create something that anyone, anywhere can start using the moment you put it
out there just by clicking a link.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://glitch.com/" rel="nofollow">Glitch</a>
boils Web development down to its basics. With one button click, you get your own
little server on the web where you can build anything you want. There's no
deployment, source control or build pipelines – just code.
</p>
<p>
And the
<a href="https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/" rel="nofollow">Small Web</a>
is home to hundreds of little communities, existing outside the big bubble of
commercial social media. If you want your own space on the Web, there's
<a href="https://neocities.org/" rel="nofollow">Neocities</a>,
<a href="http://tilde.club/" rel="nofollow">tilde.club</a>
and
<a href="https://special.fish/" rel="nofollow">Special Fish</a>
to name a few. Why should you have to sell your data just because you want to
connect with people?
</p>
<hr>
<p>
If programming is getting stale, I encourage you to check out some of the
projects on this list. Try to create something unoriginal, useless and
unfinished – and have fun doing it. You don't need a reason to write a
program or build a website. It's okay to create something just because it's
fun to create.
<a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/" rel="nofollow">An app can be a home-cooked meal.</a>
Programming can still be magical.

<p>When you have a piece of code, you can stop and continue building upon your solution at any time - you're not forced to finish all of your code at once - you can pause and come back to it at any point - however if you stop at a point when your code isn't complete in working order then it'll obviously be broken / unfinished. The same goes for Lego - you can build something then come back to it and continue however it'll be unfinished if you leave it.</p>

<p>There are so many different ways to build certain solutions - more efficient ways, shorter ways (in terms of lines of code), modern ways, old school or "traditional" ways etc. They all have one thing in common - they all achieve the same end goal. However one solution or method may be better than another due to certain factors like efficiency, speed, performance etc.</p>

<p>Building and developing consistent code ensures the integrity of your website or product in the long term. If you continue to use proven working patterns and techniques then it's going to be future proof. It also keeps your code alot neater and makes it more readable. Looking at the maintainability factor - this means that you can continue to come back to your code and make easy and fast changes to the code without having to touch core functionality. This also applies to if another developer down the line comes on board and tries to maintain your code - the more consistent and maintainable your code is then the easier it's going to be to be picked up by someone else.</p>
<p>All of these points can be applied directly to Lego - and although it is slightly a weird comparison - it definitely does fit together. If you ever need to bring yourself back to basics for some scope or to realign your vision of a project then think of this post. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you build upon the code you're writing? Is your code consistent and maintainable? Have you figured out the best way to write the solution? </p>

        <p>Outside the cockpit, the air chilled to fifty degrees Fahrenheit below zero.</p>
<p>The reinforced glass panes of the windows ripped through the thin upper atmosphere at such terrifying speed that it was hot to the touch from invisible friction against the winds. Two of the most advanced jet engines in the world roared some 50 feet behind the twin pilot seats, but neither of them could hear it: The SR-71 Blackbird flew at Mach 3.5, slicing through the air 85,000 feet above the ground like chainsaw through jello, racing the vibrations of sound its engines left in its own wake, and winning by miles.</p>
<h2 id="the-blackbird">The Blackbird</h2>
<p>The Blackbird earned its name because of the jet-black paint that covers the entire titanium exterior of the aircraft – a purely utilitarian choice to most effectively dissipate the immense heat generated by sprinting through the air three times faster than sound. It set speed records when it flew from Los Angeles to Washington D.C. in a few minutes over an hour. The same flight takes around five hours in a typical commercial jet airliner. To date, it’s the fastest jet ever flown.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/blackbird.jpg" alt="SR-71 Blackbird"></p>
<p>The SR-71 Blackbird was built in the late 1950’s by Lockheed’s Skunk Works division for the CIA’s Cold War missions. Skunk Works began as a small, elite group of around 40 aircraft engineers working under the industry veteran Kelly Johnson with little oversight from Lockheed and a <em>carte blanche</em> from upper management. The Blackbird is one of several storied aircrafts built by the Skunk Works team, in a lineup that also includes the famed F-117 and F-22, better known as Nighthawk and Raptor.</p>
<p>Over the course of its history, Skunk Works would move from building to building to design and deliver new innovative aircrafts for Lockheed. Many decades after the Blackbird’s maiden flight, one of Skunk Works' buildings would greet an unwitting pair of business executives: Steve Jobs and Ed Catmull, searching for architectural inspiration for a new building just outside San Francisco that would soon host a budding animation studio Steve had recently acquired, called <em>Pixar</em>.</p>
<h2 id="pixar">Pixar</h2>
<p>When the lightning struck, Pixar – like its then majority owner Jobs – was on an apparent decline. Pixar had been building computer workstations and software designed for creating rich computer graphics, but the business was shrinking, and the company was being shopped around for sale, eventually resulting in Steve Jobs wholly owning Pixar. They were then only a computer company with a fascination for graphics and storytelling.</p>
<p>After rounds of layoffs and consolidation, by 1991, Pixar had just over 40 employees left. The company had already sold off its hardware division long ago, and the small team that remained awaited the company’s probable certain death by writing 3D animation software like <a href="https://renderman.pixar.com/">RenderMan</a>.</p>
<p>Later that year, Pixar struck a deal with Disney for three animated feature films for a meager $26 million. A few years later, the first feature-length film from Pixar, <em>Toy Story</em>, debuted to universal fanfare, grossing over $350 million worldwide. Pixar followed up with <em>A Bug’s Life</em>, <em>Finding Nemo</em>, <em>Monsters, Inc.</em>, and <em>The Incredibles</em> – hit after hit after hit. Pixar’s landmark partnership with Disney saved the company, and propelled Pixar to the animation juggernaut status it enjoys today.</p>
<p>Pixar went public in 1995, just after the record-setting debut of <em>Toy Story</em>, eventually making its owner a newly-minted billionaire. Jobs, an exiled founder of his own company rejuvenated by the success and creative potential of technology at Pixar, returned to Apple a few years later for his final acts.</p>
<h2 id="iphone">iPhone</h2>
<p><em>Project Purple</em> began on a single floor in a building in Cupertino, locked and gated by key cards and codes even tighter than the usual levels of security at Apple. They were doing a phone. But nobody outside of those locked office perimeters would know that for a few years – even the cleaning crew were banned from the floor. To the rest of Apple’s unsuspecting staff, a few noted engineers simply disappeared over time, pulled into a mystery project.</p>
<p>The iPhone really came together in pieces, rather than from the whole. A web browser here, a phone radio there, a multi-touch keyboard here, an old abandoned tablet prototype there. One of the many miracles of the first iPhone is the way these disparate ideas melded together into a concept, then to a debut with an on-stage demo that sucked the air out of the room in 2007, to the best-selling product in the history of products.</p>
<p>But just as remarkable as the influence of the product itself is that the Purple Project was built by a <em>team</em>. Not a company or a division or a business unit, but a small, talented, squad of designers and engineers working tightly together in complete secrecy, competing and collaborating on what would be a history-defining marriage of engineering and design. An elite crew of the best people Apple could find, advised directly by the company’s executives, separate from the rest of the company’s operations. You might even call it a <em>skunkworks</em> project.</p>
<h2 id="just-enough-of-only-the-best">Just enough of only the best</h2>
<p>I find these stories of era-defining teams so fascinating because it goes against the conventional wisdom that larger teams create larger impact. It emanates a refreshingly different message: <em>small teams of very smart people, working tightly together in a trusted group, create the best inventions</em>.</p>
<p>Companies are machines designed to scale. To grow as a business, serve more customers. To serve more customers, build more products. To build more products, find more builders. Naturally, the result is that a company grows with its ambitions, and its ambitions grow with its people.</p>
<p>But the Blackbird, Pixar, and the iPhone were not products of large, sprawling corporate bureaucracies. In fact, they were designed to be the polar opposite: a small, elite group of the most talented people available, working closely with experienced visionaries with a high degree of autonomy and a singular focus.</p>
<p>I think these stories invite a closer look at the way we think about building teams. It asks us to value talent over scale, trust over control, and focus over delegation. It suggests that the way to build great teams is to <strong>find only the best people – the top individuals you’ve worked with – and to gather only just enough of them to realize your ambition</strong>. However you measure “best” – your balance of talent, creativity, persistence, kindness – make sure the team is always empowered to do the right thing. For the project, for the work, for each other.</p>
<p>One of the profound lessons I’ve learned in the last year is that <em>it is the people that always make the difference</em> between ideas that succeed and ideas that fail. The right team, given the wrong ideas, will correct their course and build the right thing. The wrong team, given the right ideas, will stumble over the many obstacles that litter the road to creating something great. It seems that in order to be a great maker of things, whether software or companies or something entirely different, people matter more than anything else. On this challenge, I think there is still much to learn from stories of superlative teams past, from the Blackbird, Pixar, and the iPhone.</p>
<hr>
<p>More than usual, this piece pulls from external reading. If you’re curious about any of these stories of invention, I would highly recommend diving deeper – there are always more insights to be gleaned.</p>
<p>On the SR-71 Blackbird aircraft and its history, check out <a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/09/0901sr-71-blackbird-transatlantic-record/">Wired’s piece on the aircraft</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/style/article/sr-71-blackbird-spy-plane-design/index.html">CNN’s historical overview</a>, as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk_Works#History">the history of Lockheed Skunk Works itself</a>.</p>
<p>On the history of Pixar and Steve Jobs’s tumultuous leadership of the studio, I heavily referenced Brent Schlender and Rick Tetzeli’s excellent <em>Becoming Steve Jobs</em> as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar#Independent_company">other sources on Pixar’s corporate history</a>.</p>
<p>On the history of the iPhone project, I pulled from Ken Kocienda’s <em>Creative Selection</em>, the aforementioned <em>Becoming Steve Jobs</em>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15782200/one-device-secret-history-iphone-brian-merchant-book-excerpt">an excerpt published on The Verge</a> about other accounts of the original Purple Project team.</p>
<p>Lastly, many of the ideas in this post were inspired by writing and talks by Bryan Cantrill, formerly CTO of Joyent and currently at Oxide Computer Company. Specifically, his talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KeYzjILqDo">building engineering teams</a> and <a href="http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/2015/09/03/software-immaculate-fetid-and-grimy/">blog on software engineering</a> were key to my ideas in this post.</p>

<p>What seniority means for a software engineer? Is it familiarity with frameworks, libraries or something different? In this post, I will try to summarise my perspective on how it is changing for me. Got a lot of view during the last three years when I have lead or participated in a decent amount of interviews for engineering roles, including the C-level executives. Let state the obvious: fair and good hiring is super hard. During the hiring process, you try to assess the seniority of the candidate(and other qualities for sure) according to the company career ladder. As a reference, industry-respected and well-known ladder description can be used <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://codingrelic.geekhold.com/2018/08/google-software-engineering-levels-and.html" target="_blank">Google career ladder</a>. If you haven’t had an opportunity to familiarise yourself with it, take the time and do so, it is definitely worth understanding. Google career ladder construction anchored in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/28/what-google-learned-in-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html" target="_blank">Google perfect team study</a>. This post doesn’t attempt to mimic Google research but rather provide a starting point and raise curiosity. Excellent management is where the resulted outcome of the team is far greater than the pure sum of individual contributions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seniority levels are usually a combination of technical “hard” skills and other skills collectively referred to as “soft” skills. Unfortunately, relatively few companies go beyond this level of explanation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Junior level is characterised by a strong desire to learn new tools, frameworks and techniques. Often connected with black and white view on problems and when solving a task, junior developers can come up with a single possible solution or more with slight modifications. It is nothing wrong to be at that stage, and healthy teams often contain some junior developers as they bring fresh trends and passion to the teams. However, having more than 25% of junior developers in the team is challenging as they require more attention and slows the team down or affect the quality. Be careful with this mix.</p>



<p>Gaining seniority than then goes on a few axes –&nbsp;<em>technical skills,</em>&nbsp;<em>context</em>&nbsp;developer is using during the evaluation of possible solutions and ability to&nbsp;<em>communicate effectively</em>. Junior developer has limited technical skills, and his context is limited to code he is writing and communicates solely in terms of code, requirements or tickets. Context is a vital vehicle for guiding a developer in two remaining axes. As technical skills are growing number of the possible solution raises as well. Context can be divided but not limited to the following scopes:</p>



<p><strong>Codebase</strong> – Limits the knowledge to the current codebase, used technologies and design principles and thinking in those low-level terms. This definition can be confusing as project codebase is involved every time as the ultimate source of truth but what differs is the level of abstraction. Developers are growing by operating bigger codebase and experience on different project codebase.</p>



<p><strong>Development habits and practices</strong> – This area covers topics like where to apply which kind of tests. Where are the areas you can compromise if chasing time, and what are the real costs? Tech debt management. Essential features for long term supportability. Those items can be categorised under some risk management and damage control practices.</p>



<p><strong>System design</strong> – Designing a system for performance, scalability, security and similar system-wide aspects. Defining thread zones and expected failure scenarios. Think in terms of consistency and ability to enforce those policies on the platform level. What can be handled on infrastructure level vs what is necessary to address in the application code?</p>



<p><strong>Different mindset/roles</strong> – Understanding of other functions and associated mindsets of people participating in the development process (system engineers, quality assurance, machine learning engineers, project managers, etc.). What helps the best in this area is to try out the majority of those roles. Getting the role mindset will simplify communication during cross-team communication.</p>



<p><strong>Software development life cycle</strong> – Ability to foresee and expect requirements which might not be implicitly obvious or stated in the desired functionality description. Understanding of product lifecycle stages starting from ideation till end-of-life. An item like supportability, troubleshooting etc. What helps in those aspects is to take the perspective of technical support personnel and think in terms of what-if. How difficult would it be to discover that component/feature X doesn’t work as expected.</p>



<p><strong>Technology overview</strong> – Knowledge of technologies and alternatives gives you lego blocks for building a final solution architecture. This is especially important for the cloud-based product as you are trading a cost for a speed of delivery. Similarly, the same applies to programming languages. Those have specific features, design patterns etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Cross disciplines</strong> – This context is pretty similar to `Different mindset roles` with an only difference; it is focused on actual skills necessary in those roles and effects the tools have on team dynamics. Disciplines like development, operation, infrastructure, marketing and similar.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Cross-level and cross-department awareness</strong> – Understanding main objectives, areas of competence and levels of abstractions those people operate on. Unfortunately, even though role titles repeat competencies and responsibilities differs significantly between companies. That is what makes the execution different for each company and is one of the secret sauce of success. Effects are visible in accounting and balance sheets.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Business domain</strong> – Understanding of industry you operate in helps you to drive better value for your customers by combining your technical abilities with domain knowledge.</p>



<p><strong>Business models</strong> – Understanding how the business makes money on the product you build helps you to understand key aspects of the technical solution in terms of desired points of flexibility, scalability and cost management.</p>



<p>Knowledge and experiences in those scopes provide a better context for making decisions in the bigger picture and finding a more strategic solution for given conditions. Helps you to drive communication more effectively as you can think more like your counter-party and understand his point of view. Lastly, you should be able to come up with a plan of delivery iterations with a value-added in each iteration and mitigated risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The more senior you get on technical skills and proceed on the career ladder, the more the role start rely on your leadership skills. The vast amount of companies than forces people to manager roles but some (including Google, Facebook, etc.) allows to continue on technical track and label those positions as Principal or Staff Engineers. The role of those engineers is usually to improve the engineering culture and best practices of the teams apart from solving complex engineering tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I neglected at least one aspect in my writing, the effect of personal characteristics and perspectives for particular roles. I am not going into those but instead refer to great <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.howtodeal.dev/" target="_blank">Neil blog with people topologies</a></p>

In Spring Boot, it is best practice to define the database connection via your <code>application.properties</code> file or directly via environment variables.</p><p>For the above credentials, your configuration would look like this:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic">spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.postgresql.Driver

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/my_database
spring.datasource.username=bernhard
spring.datasource.password=somepassword</pre><p>As stated above, the host name of your database service is <code>postgres</code>, which is why your jdbc connection string connects to <code>postgres:5432</code> (which is the default port of PostgreSQL).</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>Yes, it is really that easy to use a real PostgreSQL database in your unit and integration test pipeline. By matching the exact database version that is also used in production, you can avoid many subtle errors that may not be apparent when relying on an in-memory database.</p><p>Let me know if you have any questions or whether you found this useful in the comments section.</p></div></div>]]>

      <article>
  
  <time datetime="2020-10-30T00:00:00+00:00">30 Oct 2020</time>
  <p><em>Credits: The solution described in this post is based on <a href="https://github.com/alexeagle">Alex Eagle</a>’s suggestion in: <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/issues/773">https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/issues/773</a></em></p>

<p>While migrating the Nexar backend mono-repo to use Bazel as our main build-system I encountered a particularly painful challenge of compiling Go packages with C dependencies, such as <a href="http://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go">confluent-go-kafka</a> or <a href="https://github.com/paulsmith/gogeos">libgeos</a>. For others who will hit this issue, this will be a short and practical post showing what I finally came up with.</p>

<h3 id="first-try-let-gazelle-figure-things-out">First try: let Gazelle figure things out</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle">Gazelle</a>  is a really great project from the Bazel community that helps us automatically generate BUILD files for our Golang Bazel projects. It can look at our <code>go.mod</code> files that describe our external dependencies and translate them for us into <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go">rules_go</a>’s <code>go_repository</code> invocations that will fetch external dependencies into our WORKSPACE and create a BUILD file for them. For 99% of our mono-repo’s dependencies this worked smoothly; all we had to do is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bazel run //:gazelle -- update-repos -from_file=go.mod -to_macro=deps.bzl%go_dependencies
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And Gazelle would generate a macro that contains invocations to <code>go_repository</code> for each of our module’s dependencies. In this post, I focus on the few dependencies that this did not work well with, and document my way around those edges.</p>

<p>Our <code>go.mod</code> file contains a dependency on:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>require (
	github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go v1.4.2
)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Gazelle analyzes our dependencies and emits this block in the <code>deps.bzl</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>go_repository(
    name = "com_github_confluentinc_confluent_kafka_go",
    importpath = "github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go",
    sum = "h1:13EK9RTujF7lVkvHQ5Hbu6bM+Yfrq8L0MkJNnjHSd4Q=",
    version = "v1.4.2",
)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Trying to build we get:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ bazel build @com_github_confluentinc_confluent_kafka_go//kafka:kafka

<h3 id="compiling-cmake-projects-from-within-a-bazel-workspace">Compiling CMake Projects From Within a Bazel Workspace</h3>

<p>We need to compile our C dependencies into a static library (.a file) in order to provide it to the go linker. We could try to create new Bazel BUILD files on top of that project, but that would require us to deep dive into that dependency and mimic anything it’s authors have done in the original build, wouldn’t it make sense to try and invoke the CMake build from within Bazel? A crude way to do this is using a <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/general.html#genrule">genrule</a>, which allows us to invoke any arbitrary command as part of our action graph, but it turns out there’s a great project called <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_foreign_cc">rules_foreign_cc</a> which are “<em>[Bazel] Rules for building C/C++ projects using foreign build systems inside Bazel projects.”</em></p>

<p>We add it to our WORKSPACE file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>http_archive</span><span>(</span>
    <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"rules_foreign_cc"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>strip_prefix</span> <span>=</span> <span>"rules_foreign_cc-master"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_foreign_cc/archive/master.zip"</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>load</span><span>(</span><span>"@rules_foreign_cc//:workspace_definitions.bzl"</span><span>,</span> <span>"rules_foreign_cc_dependencies"</span><span>)</span>

<span>rules_foreign_cc_dependencies</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So instead of figuring out an elaborate, specific  BUILD file for the C library we are using, we can simply use the foreign dependency rules to invoke the original CMake build and integrate it natively with our action graph.</p>

<p>We add this to our WORKSPACE:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>http_archive</span><span>(</span>
    <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"librdkafka"</span><span>,</span>

    name = "sources",
    srcs = glob(["**"]),
)

    name = "librdkafka",
    cache_entries = {
        "RDKAFKA_BUILD_STATIC": "ON",
        "WITH_ZSTD": "OFF",
        "WITH_SSL": "OFF",
        "WITH_SASL": "OFF",
        "ENABLE_LZ4_EXT": "OFF",
        "WITH_LIBDL": "OFF",
    },
    lib_source = ":sources",
    static_libraries = [
        "librdkafka++.a",
        "librdkafka.a",
    ],
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
)
"""</span><span>,</span>
    <span>sha256</span> <span>=</span> <span>"ae27ea3f3d0d32d29004e7f709efbba2666c5383a107cc45b3a1949486b2eb84"</span><span>,</span>

<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s break it down:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We use <code>http_archive</code> to pull in a resource from the internet into our Bazel project.</li>
  <li>We provide a custom BUILD file for Bazel to use to build this target.</li>
  <li>the invocation of <code>cmake_external</code> tells Bazel how to invoke CMake (<code>cache_entries</code> is the CMake input arguments), and what output files it provides (<code>static_libraries</code>) so this target can be depended on downstream in the Bazel action graph.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can now build our header files:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ bazel build @librdkafka//:librdkafka

INFO: Analyzed target @librdkafka//:librdkafka (3 packages loaded, 530 targets configured).
INFO: Found 1 target...

INFO: Elapsed time: 3.959s, Critical Path: 0.13s
INFO: 0 processes.
INFO: Build completed successfully, 2 total actions
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In my specific use-case, I wanted to link the my build of the confluent-go-kafka library with zlib, so I could avoid getting this error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/external/librdkafka/librdkafka/lib/librdkafka.a(rdgz.c.o):rdgz.c:function rd_gz_decompress: error: undefined reference to 'inflateGetHeader'

....
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To do that I did a very similar thing to what I’ve done with the <code>librdkafka</code> library, adding to the WORKSPACE:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>http_archive</span><span>(</span>
    <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"zlib"</span><span>,</span>

    name = "sources",
    srcs = glob(["**"]),
)

cmake_external(
    name = "zlib",
    cache_entries = {

    },
    lib_source = ":sources",
    static_libraries = ["libz.a"],
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
)

<p>I could now build it:</p>

              <p>One of the greatest challenges that have affected Blockchain companies has been within the unpredictable transaction costs of well-known blockchain technology. </p><p>The view of &nbsp;"most mature technology", in the decentralised space, is historically based on <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work">Proof of Work (PoW)</a> consensus mechanisms such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. All network fees correlate in direct relation to the increase in network traffic.</p><p>This makes on-chain solutions around micropayments and reward mechanisms effectively impossible to work at any level of impact. </p><blockquote>Any ecological or environmental positive impact will be wiped out by a single PoW network transaction and theoretically cause a negative effect.</blockquote><p>The fundamental problem is that Proof of Work is terrible for the environment, absolutely awful. For more information have a look at the <a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/">Bitcoin energy consumption index</a>, as at October 2020 the energy consumption is <strong>22.6% of the UK power consumption.</strong> </p><figure><img src="https://blog.dovu.earth/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-23-at-15.47.51.png"><figcaption>Bitcoin’s energy consumption relative to countries <a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/">see reference link</a></figcaption></figure><p>Although this is a known problem and there is a range of solutions that solve the "energy" problem including using <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_Stake">Proof of Stake</a> but there is an ICO issue. As many ICOs (initial coin offerings) have used the Ethereum ERC standards as the basis protocol there is a cost, a carbon debt that has already been assigned.</p><p>In order for DOVU to deliver a carbon offsetting solution today, we require a different, hybrid approach.</p><p>And yes as DOV is an ERC20 token we accept we already have a carbon debt. This needs to be paid, in one way or another.</p><h2 id="so-what-is-dovu-doing">So what is DOVU doing?</h2><p>DOVU is introducing an innovative <strong>Proof of Carbon </strong>mechanism. Every time DOV tokens are rewarded to a user through our API we capture and store this information.</p><p>This information is stored publically, anyone can view the intent of the distribution of the assignment of carbon, the DOV token.</p><p>DOVU uses the <a href="https://hedera.com/consensus-service">Hedera Consensus Service </a>(HCS) backed by <a href="https://hedera.com/">Hedera Hashgraph</a> and leverages the work by <a href="https://trust.enterprises/">Trust Enterprises</a> a community-driven open source project. </p><p>Using HCS provides an extremely low-cost solution in terms of environmental and economically to add trust to any system, without having to offset the cost to any user. </p><p>This provides a scalable solution for adding proof for any transaction which indicates the transfer of carbon using the DOVU API, <a href="https://developer.dovu.dev/">that any team can start using.</a></p><p>Below is an example of how the assignment of carbon can be proved and viewed, without the requirement to interact directly with a mainnet PoW network.</p><p>This process is impossible on PoW networks as the transactional cost would override and almost always exceed the micro-payment benefit to <strong>prove the assignment of carbon. </strong></p><figure><img src="https://blog.dovu.earth/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-23-at-17.13.42.png"></figure><p>In addition to this Hedera Hashgraph network has the potential to reach a capacity of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/hedera-hashgraph-deep-look-into-10-000-transactions-per-second-claim">10,000 transactions per second (TPS)</a>. Examples of pushing the network have been confirmed through <a href="https://coinrivet.com/adsdax-achieves-1372-cryptocurrency-transactions-per-second-on-hedera-hashgraph-with-zee-entertainment-enterprises-sets-new-industry-record/">AdsDax at 1372 TPS</a> and <a href="https://quantstamp.com/blog/quantstamp-stablecoin-case-study-formally-verifying-hedera-hashgraphs-stablecoin-framework">Quantstamp at 2909 TPS</a>.</p><p>During our early testing of a simple architecture using a single serverless proof of carbon node we have exceeded 50 TPS. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.dovu.earth/content/images/2020/10/Hashgraph-TPS.png"><figcaption>The TPS of a single proof of carbon node, using Trust Enterprises.</figcaption></figure><p>With that said this is one bit of the greater puzzle, we have a vision and roadmap to enter the DeFi space and to link physical land to unique non-fungible tokens (NFT).</p><p>When we hold the image of carbon being emitted into the atmosphere we envision the pollution through the <strong>burning of fossil fuels. </strong>Thoughts of transportation, cars, and power plants are clear and present.</p><p>One of the greater concerns is <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/clima/sites/clima/files/docs/soil_and_climate_en.pdf">the emissions of CO2 from soils are around ten times those from fossil fuels.</a></p><p>At DOVU we have been working toward delivering a solution, to incentivise farmers with additional income to consistently pursue high-quality farming practices.</p><p>The economic value of the farming industry is <a href="https://www.countrysideonline.co.uk/food-and-farming/contributing-to-the-economy/">worth £120 billion in the UK</a> but the <a href="https://www.fginsight.com/news/news/public-estimates-average-farmer-salary-at-almost-47k-23592">average income for a farmer is £20,000</a>.</p><h2 id="blockchain-and-nft">Blockchain and NFT</h2><p>Building a decentralised marketplace for farmers and land-owners to offer carbon certified areas of land verified by <a href="http://www.fao.org/soils-portal/soil-management/soil-carbon-sequestration/en/">soil carbon sequestration</a>.</p><p>A buyer may purchase the carbon of a given portion of land this is exchanged for a unique NFT, that includes metadata including exact location. </p><p>Every portion of land will have a finite amount of NFTs, in other words, a unique token would be minted for every piece of land. Any value will be stored in escrow and released over the duration of the contract terms.</p><p>Upon purchase from a buyer, the farmer will be paid out for ongoing consistent behaviour for environmentally positive behaviour. </p><p>Ongoing payment will be hinged on the measurement of positive carbon measurement gain through carbon audits for farms. </p><p>If there is a gain in carbon storage, the farmer will receive payment otherwise the value will be returned to the buyer. Without the latter consequence, there will be no accountability.</p><p>This will eliminate the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/carbon-credits-have-a-double-spend-problem-this-microsoft-backed-project-is-trying-to-fix-that">carbon double-spend problem</a> and create a fair incentivized carbon marketplace based on real tangible assets.</p><p>These solutions will be crucial for large businesses and enterprises for their <a href="https://www.hamworthy-heating.com/Knowledge/Articles/Energy-legislation">carbon reduction targets</a>, purchasing allowances for carbon to offset every tonne they emit. Many of these targets have been written into legislation, so they need to be met.</p><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1594101236305-037fa463b9b9?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" alt="A Buttercups carpet in Wales."><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@theret?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Avi Theret</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>DOVU is building technology to facilitate the offering, validation, and rewarding of capturing carbon value. </p><p>So that is where DOVU is moving toward, this is where we are today.</p><p>We provide a mechanism to augment your Carbon Offsetting solution, through a REST API, now backed by the trust of Hedera Hashgraph.</p><p>If you have a carbon offsetting project in mind we welcome you to join our <a href="https://dovu.earth/grant">DOVU Token Grant project</a>, we'll support you with tokens and marketing.</p><p>Otherwise, if you are a developer that wants to work with our community and start building with use we have opened up an <a href="https://blog.dovu.earth/dovu-bounty-program/">Open Source Bounty program</a>, we provide Tokens and Mentorship.</p><p>There is a lot of exciting developments coming forward for DOVU for the end of 2020 and 2021, we are looking forward with excitement with the possibilities for the future.</p>

 		<p>Awesome, you are a CTO or founding engineer of a newborn startup.&nbsp; You have an web app up on Heroku and someone is paying you money for it!&nbsp; Nice job.</p>
<p>Now, you need to think about supporting it.&nbsp; Heroku makes things way easier (no racking and stacking, no purchasing hardware, no configuring apache) but you still to set up some operations.</p>
<p>Here is the bare minimum you need to do to make sure you can sleep at night.&nbsp; (Based on a couple of years of heroku projects, and being really really cheap.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a staging environment
<ul>
<li>You don’t want to push code direct to prod, do you?</li>
<li>This can be a free dyno, depending on the complexity of your app.</li>
<li><a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pipelines">Pipelines</a> are nice, as is <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/preboot">preboot</a>.</li>
<li>Cost: free</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have a one line deploy.
<ul>
<li>Or, if you like CD/CI, an automatic deploy or a one click deploy.&nbsp; But make it really easy to deploy.</li>
<li>Have a deploy script that goes straight to production for emergencies.</li>
<li>Cost: free</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;Backups
<ul>
<li>User data.&nbsp; If you aren’t using a shared object store like S3, make sure you are doing a backup.</li>
<li>Database.&nbsp; Both <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-backups">heroku postgresql</a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.html">amazon RDS</a> have point and click solutions.&nbsp; All you have to do is set them up.&nbsp; (Test them, at least once.)</li>
<li>Cost: freeish, depending on the solution.&nbsp; But, user data is worth spending money on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Alerting
<ul>
<li>Heroku has <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/metrics#threshold-alerting">options</a> if you are running professional dynos.</li>
<li><a href="http://uptimerobot.com/">Uptimerobot</a> is a great free third party service that will check ports every 5 minutes and has a variety of alert options.&nbsp; If you want SMS, you have to pay for it, but it’s not outrageous.</li>
<li>Cost: free</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Logging
<ul>
<li>Use a logging framework (like slf4j or the rails logger, and mark error conditions with a string that will be easy to search for.</li>
<li>Yes, you can use <code>heroku logs</code> but having a log management solution like papertrail will make you much happier.&nbsp; Plus, <a href="https://elements.heroku.com/addons/papertrail">it’s free</a> for 2 days of logfiles.</li>
<li>Set up <a href="http://help.papertrailapp.com/kb/how-it-works/alerts/">alerts</a> with papertrail as well.&nbsp; These can be more granular.</li>
<li>Cost: free</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a list of third party dependencies.
<ul>
<li>Sign up for status alerts from these.&nbsp; If you have pro slack, you can have them push an email to a channel.&nbsp; If you don’t, create an alias that receives them.&nbsp; You want to be the person that tells your clients about outages, not the other way around.</li>
<li>Cost: free</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Communication
<ul>
<li>Internal
<ul>
<li>a devops_alert slack channel is my preferred solutions.&nbsp; All deploys and other alerts go there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>External
<ul>
<li>create a mailing list for your clients so you can inform them of issues easily.&nbsp; Google groups is fine, but use whatever other folks are using.&nbsp; Don’t use an alias in your email–you’ll forget to add new clients.</li>
<li>do not use this mailing list for marketing purposes, unless you want to offload the burden of keeping the list up to date to the marketing department.</li>
<li>do make sure when you gain or lose clients you keep this up to date</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Run through a disaster in your mind and make notes on how you would communicate the issue, both internally and externally.&nbsp; How often do you update your team?&nbsp; How often do you update your clients?&nbsp; What about an internal issue (some of your code screwed up) vs an external issue.&nbsp; This doesn’t need to be exhaustive, but thinking about it ahead of time and making some notes will help you in the crisis.</li>
<li>Cost: free</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is probably a four hour project, max.</p>
<p>But once this is done, you’ll rest easier at night, knowing you have what you need to troubleshoot and recover from production issues.</p>

<article>
    <p>I’ve just watched the talk «Nailing Your First Launch» (MicroConf Starter 2018) by Adam Wathan and I
took notes that I’d like to share and re-visit them in the future. Some of them are just text from his screens, some thoughts are mine.</p>
<p>But don’t let me steal the video from you by providing a digested summary.
In my humble opinion, the main idea of watching talks or reading something is to change your mind
model of seeing this topic.
Don’t hesitate and start watching the video before proceeding to notes.
The notes are here just to come back from time to time and re-call some especially useful highlights.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajrDxZRpP9M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajrDxZRpP9M</a></p>
<hr>

<h3 id="one-time-purchase-products-are-way-easier-to-sell">One-time purchase products are way easier to sell</h3>
<ul>
<li>Harder to convince people that for $9 dollars per month they’d have value.</li>
<li>But it’s a very frequent case when people buy $100 courses and don’t even watch them.</li>
<li>One-time payments are much easier to go away with.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="they-can-be-done">They can be “done”</h3>
<ul>
<li>You don’t have to maintain them forever.</li>
<li>A course can be finished. A book can be finished.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="you-can-put-one-together-in-3-months-of-nights-and-weekends">You can put one together in 3 months of nights and weekends</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easier to plan.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="they-put-money-in-the-bank-fast-then-drop-off-opposite-to-saas">They put money in the bank fast then drop off (opposite to SAAS)</h3>
<ul>
<li>One-time projects do have a more clear cliff of death, but they produce more money than saas during
launch days.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3 id="building-an-audience">Building an audience</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Having a big audience can compensate for almost any mistake made in marketing/sales.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Huge audience + bad sales plan produces way more profit than no audience + good sales plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Produce blog posts, tutorials, podcasts, screencasts, interview people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should be worth following (provide a value for your audience)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help people where they already are (Wes Bos)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specific tactics for tech guys: tweet your hacks (like some tricks with css) that save you time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="picking-the-right-idea">Picking the right idea</h3>
<ul>
<li>Have an idea
<ul>
<li>what are you already putting out there that peoeple seem excited about?</li>
<li>what are you excited about that you think others will get excited about?</li>
<li>what do people think you’re better at than they are?</li>
<li>what have you learned outside your community would benefit from?</li>
<li>what did you have to figure out yourself but was really helpful to learn?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Test it
<ul>
<li>
<p>«First thing to do is to put a landing page and start emailing.»</p>
<p>It’s not a bad way, but it’s not the first thing that you should do.
Especially it doesn’t work if you have no audience. People wouldn’t trust you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Collect feedback from tweets, have a catalog of them. Can be used later for your landing/sales pages.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="define-the-product">Define the product</h3>
<ul>
<li>Plan small, it will end up bigger than you think anyway
<ul>
<li>Don’t worry about size. A short book is still a book.</li>
<li>3 hours of a video course is plenty.</li>
<li>Actually, not everyone is looking for a full knowledge base on a specific topic and read
500 pages on that. Collection of great ideas (like tweets) on that specific topic works
too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In general, courses are easier to sell at higher prices because people expect products such as
books to be in a specific cost range, even if they understand that it brings a high value.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="landing-page">Landing page</h3>
<p>The goal is to collect e-mail addresses.</p>
<p>Example of Adam’s landing page can be seen on 19:33 - 22:25</p>
<ul>
<li>Promise something in advance (sign up for free screencasts and a big discount)</li>
<li>You can put your catalog of feedback on your landing page to earn more trust.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pre-sell">Pre-sell</h3>
<h4 id="advantages">Advantages</h4>
<ul>
<li>Best form of product validation</li>
<li>You’ll make more money</li>
<li>More motivation to finish</li>
<li>Can buy you the time to focus on the product</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h4>
<ul>
<li>Selling multiple tiers is trickier</li>
<li>Can’t easily change scope</li>
<li>Like taking on debt, can be extremely stressful. People paid you 50k$ and you have to return
it as the value in N months. (impostor syndrome?)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="building-your-email-list">Building Your Email List</h3>
<ul>
<li>Always tell your audience.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Announce the announcement — «about to announce the next big project I’m working on; if you check
it out and are excited about it, I’d love any help spreading the word!»</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Share progress. Send an update every week or so.</li>
<li>Repurpose content (Take a chapter from a book, make it a blog post and share it)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="getting-it-finished">Getting it finished</h3>
<p>A few strategies to finally finish it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make promises («this week I’m going to deliver a screencast»)</li>
<li>Email on a schedule</li>
<li>Reduce scope. (the project/book gets bigger and bigger, the best way to cross the finish line</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="figuring-pricing">Figuring pricing</h3>
<ul>
<li>It’s hard to sell tiers during pre-sales.</li>
<li>Sell pre-orders with top tier price.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="single-tier">Single tier</h4>
<ul>
<li>Can be fine if you can charge enough</li>
<li>Often necessary if pre-selling</li>
<li>Nice if you can’t figure out a way to add additional tiers that actually feel valuable</li>
<li>In general, prefer multiple tiers</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="two-tiers">Two tiers</h4>
<ul>
<li>Usually a price anchoring strategy, first tier makes second tier look like better deal</li>
<li>Second tier is usually the “real” product</li>
<li>Prices are often close-ish, maybe 1x and 1.5x</li>
<li>Works well with video courses where easy to cut content for budget version</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="three-tiers">Three tiers:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Great for books if you can come up with the bonus content (videos?)</li>
<li>Makes it easier to evaluate as its own product instead of compring to Amazon book prices</li>
<li>Prices are usually 1x, ~2x, ~5x</li>
<li>This will make you a lot more money from a book than just selling the book on its own</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Adam’s case</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First tier: The Bare Essentials, $39
<ul>
<li>The 158-page book in pdf format</li>
<li>Comprehensive set of exercises</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Second tier: The Premium Training Package, $79
<ul>
<li>Over 4 hours of screencasts, covering all of the book examples</li>
<li>Three additional advanced tutorials</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>all from first tier</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Third tier: The complete Reference Package, $179

<li>The source code of Nitpick CI, a production Laravel application that makes heavy
use of collection pipelines</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>all from second tier</li>

<h3 id="launch-discounts">Launch discounts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Discount it by enough to be appealing, at least 30%</li>
<li>Use stepped discounts; lower discount on cheaper tiers and better discount on higher tiers</li>
<li>Reverse engineer non-discounted price from your planned discounted price, it’ll help you charge more</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nailing-the-launch">Nailing the launch</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Build the sales page 39:13</p>
<ul>
<li>Still include an email sign up that sends preview content for new traffic (sign up to get
four free preview lessons)</li>
<li>Testimonials and social proof are important; use feedback from preview content to start</li>
<li>Sort tiers from highest price to lower price, use visuals to communicate value of higher
tiers (ui/ux hacks, make more important text bold, more physical things on a picture)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Announce the launch details</p>
<ul>
<li>Include all package and pricing details</li>
<li>Complete TOC or content list</li>
<li>Final free content preview if possible</li>

<li>Morning EST works well too</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leverage early feedback</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect and catalog feedback after the launch.</li>

    <p>What can we do when designing Rust code to make it easier to test?
This is a survey of everything I could find<sup id="fnref:survey-method" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:survey-method">1</a></sup> about
testing Rust with a particular focus on design for testability for
correctness.  Some of the articles show multiple things to do on a
worked example, some are more focused on a particular trick.</p>

<p>There doesn’t seem to be a single place that describes all the testing
ideas: it is scattered across book chapters, blog articles, medium
articles, etc. but here are the main sources that I have found.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html">The Rust book</a> chapter on testing</li>
  <li><a href="https://rust-cli.github.io/book/tutorial/testing.html">Testing command line applications in Rust</a>
(significant overlap with the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html">Rust book</a>)</li>
  <li><a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-organize-your-rust-tests/">How to organize your Rust tests</a>

</ul>

<p>I am not going to try to summarize what these sources say: the rest of
this post is a list of some common / interesting topics and which of
these sources describe it in more detail.</p>

<p>Although my main focus is on how to write Rust programs so that they are easy
to test, I touch on the other half of the problem: how to do the testing.</p>

<p><em>[I am new to Rust and my own testing habits are somewhat ad-hoc so this is
definitely not a recommendation of how to write software by me.  I hope it is
useful and that you will tell me what I have missed
<a href="https://twitter.com/alastair_d_reid">on twitter</a> or
<a href="mailto:alastair.d.reid@gmail.com">by email</a>
so that I can update this post.
I would love to hear about any team that has published recommendations for
design-for-testability.]</em></p>

<h2 id="design-techniques-for-improving-testability">Design techniques for improving testability</h2>

<p>The sources listed above have a bunch of common suggestions that I
explore in more detail below. Many of the sources I found have great
discussions so I will not try to repeat their explanations in this
document but will link to some of the better discussions of each idea
that I found.</p>

<h3 id="use-intermediate-data-structures">Use intermediate data structures</h3>

<p>See:
<a href="https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/-testing-our-new-sync-engine">Testing sync</a>,
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html">Rust book</a>,

<a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/using-the-rust-compiler-as-your-integration-testing-framework/">use the Rust compiler for integration testing</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Use intermediate data structures to separate deciding what to do
from performing the action: allowing tests to check that the right
decision is being made and avoiding the need to mock/fake the
filesystem, etc.</li>
  <li>Aggressively use newtypes, structs, enums</li>
  <li>Parse and validate inputs early (eg convert strings to enums)</li>
  <li>Also, #[must_use], parse/validate early</li>
  <li><a href="https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/how-to-sans-io.html">Writing I/O-Free (Sans-I/O) Protocol Implementations</a> (not Rust specific)</li>

<a href="https://rust-cli.github.io/book/tutorial/testing.html">Testing CLI applications</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Cleanly separate command line parsing from code that implements functionality</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/-testing-our-new-sync-engine">Testing sync</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Use of std::io::Write trait and writeln! instead of println! (and handle resulting potential error)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="avoid--reduce-non-determinism">Avoid / reduce non-determinism</h3>

<p>See:
<a href="https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/-testing-our-new-sync-engine">Testing sync</a>,
<a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1687">Writing fuzzable code</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Use Futures with a custom executor to eliminate the
non-determinism of threads</li>
  <li>All randomized testing systems should be fully deterministic
and easily reproducible</li>
  <li>Beware of additional randomness in libraries:
e.g., Rust’s HashMap uses randomized hashing to protect against denial of service attacks.
This makes testing harder.</li>
  <li>Determinism enables minimization of random tests
(cf. <a href="https://altsysrq.github.io/proptest-book/proptest/tutorial/shrinking-basics.html">proptest</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>API design strongly affects testability of that API</p>

<ul>
  <li>The component should provide a stable contract composed of traits, structs, and enums</li>
  <li>Always implement Clone and fmt::Debug for public types
    <ul>
      <li>types like failure::Error should be converted to something that is cloneable</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use ‘newtype’ to let the type system statically test for errors and use
one of these to test that this is done correctly</p>

October 31, 2020 | https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Why-Clojure/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Why-Clojure/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One piece of unattributed wisdom that's stuck with me is "don't take more than one technology bet". At <a href="https://www.ladderlife.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ladder</a>, our big bet is using <a href="https://clojure.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Clojure</a> for fullstack app development. Ladder's used Clojure since day 1 in 2015, and we wouldn't want it any different! In particular, Clojure's Lisp heritage, focus on pure functions and immutable data structures, unified client-server support, and superior developer experience have helped us write higher quality code faster.</p>
<p><strong>Ladder is hiring! If you're interested, please check out our job description <a href="https://grnh.se/5cebfb331us" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>!</strong></p>
<!-- excerpt -->
<h2>Pure functions and immutability</h2>
<p>One of the challenges with ordinary, imperative programming languages like Javascript or Python is the increasing complexity of state management. As your application grows, it becomes harder and harder to isolate where in the codebase specific changes to your application state occur. This is because with typical application architectures in those languages, any function can perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_%28computer_science%29" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">side effects</a> or modify incoming or global state. On the other hand, Clojure strongly emphasizes working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pure functions</a> (well, if you discount I/O...) and <a href="https://clojure.org/about/state" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">immutable data structures</a>. A Clojure programmer must be explicit when defining and modifying mutable state - this helps minimize its usage and makes it easier to reason about.</p>
<p>Immutable data structures and pure functions also lend themselves well to concurrent programming. We rarely find ourselves worrying about locks and shared data in a multi-threaded environment, because our functions are rarely modifying shared state. And when we do, Clojure provides <code>atom</code>, a thread-safe wrapper around ordinary data structures. Behind the scenes, setting an <code>atom</code>'s value calls <code>compare-and-set!</code>. That means no fussing around with locks or mutexes and no worrying about your data changing before you modify it. With this one simple construct, Clojure removes 99% of our concurrency headaches.</p>
<h2>Clojure is a Lisp</h2>
<p>There are probably enough Lisp arguments on the Internet already - I'll defer to <a href="https://clojure.org/about/rationale#_lisp_is_a_good_thing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Rich Hickey</a> (Clojure's creator) and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Paul Graham</a> instead of adding another rehash. That said, Clojure provides some advantages over other Lisps like Common Lisp and Scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li>CL only includes lists in its core language spec. Clojure introduces vectors, sets, and maps which makes reading and writing code so much less tedious. Of course Scheme has all of these except sets.</li>
<li>Clojure's core data structures are immutable which, as discussed above, makes reasoning about code, especially concurrent code, much easier.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Clojure runs everywhere</h2>
<p>Clojure provides first class support for sharing code between platforms with <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/reader_conditionals" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reader conditionals</a>. Most of our namespaces at Ladder take advantage of this and are shared across our client (Clojurescript) and server (Clojure). In fact, all of our client React code (aside from browser-specific API calls like clipboard, input handlers, etc) supports being run on the JVM. This lets us run what we call "full-stack tests" entirely within a Java process. For example, we can run full user flows like "user can accept a life insurance policy" and assert against both client and server state <strong>in the same test</strong>. The closest analogue without this superpower would be running a Selenium test against a running webserver, which introduces all sorts of potential flakiness. For more on full-stack tests, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qijWBPYkRAQ&amp;t=346s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this talk</a> two of our engineers gave at Clojure West in 2017.</p>
<p>Clojure also provides easy <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/reader_conditionals#_host_interop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">host interop</a> for each supported platform. This lets us leverage the full JVM (and Javascript) ecosystem. For example, we use popular Java libraries like <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jetty</a>, <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.kafka/kafka-clients" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">kafka-clients</a>, <a href="https://github.com/google/tink" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tink</a>, and more. On the frontend, we use React, and can easily include other Javascript libraries for analytics, error handling, and session replays.</p>
<h2>Developer experience</h2>
<p>When I’ve worked with Typescript and Python in the past, I was constantly waiting for my development server to reload. Clojure makes updating code on your local server as simple as reloading the updated namespace in your REPL. If you want, you can even <a href="https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">update remote, (hopefully) non-production webservers</a>! Being able to evaluate code in a REPL and have your running web server update in less than a second makes exploration and iteration on your actual backend so much faster. Instant feedback makes developers more playful and experimental. Ultimately, it helps them write better code faster.</p>
<p>It’s also super easy to run small chunks of code in the REPL. Ladder, like other Clojure shops, has a convention of documenting namespace usage with a <code>comment</code> block at the bottom. Developers can use the code within to learn the namespace’s API, run commonly used procedures, or test changes to the rest of the namespace - all without leaving their editor!</p>
<h2>Why not Clojure?</h2>
<p>While we're extremely satisfied with our choice of Clojure, we've had our fair share of headaches. First, Clojure processes take a long time to start up - especially as the size of the application grows. Our webserver at Ladder takes a full minute before it can accept web requests. This makes autoscaling in response to load more challenging - some of our load can spike in well under a minute, so we have to be consistently overprovisioned to handle it. Second, Clojure produces pretty big artifacts. This matters less on the backend, where our webserver JAR is over 1.5GB, but hurts us on the frontend. We still have work to do here, but our initial bundle is 7.2MB uncompressed (1.0MB gzipped)! If raw performance or bundle size is your primary concern, you might be better off choosing another language.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As a small company, we have more ideas to try than we have bandwidth to implement. Using Clojure has helped our team be more iterative and more productive, so we can ship more experiments and projects than we would otherwise be able to. I feel super lucky that Ladder introduced me to Clojure - and I'm excited to see how Clojure and our use of it continues to evolve!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Kropotkin and Poliakov â€“ enthusiastic, curious and well-read young men in their 20s â€“ were fired by the prospect of finding evidence of that defining factor of evolution set out by Charles Darwin in <em>On the Origin of Species</em> (1859): competition<em>.</em> They were disappointed. As Kropotkin later wrote:</p>
<blockquote>We saw plenty of adaptations for struggling, very often in common, against the adverse circumstances of climate, or against various enemies, and Polyakoff wrote many a good page upon the mutual dependency of carnivores, ruminants, and rodents in their geographical distribution; we witnessed numbers of facts of mutual support â€¦ [but] facts of real competition and struggle between higher animals of the same species came very seldom under my notice, though I eagerly searched for them.</blockquote>
<p>Kropotkin pursued this contradiction for decades. Observation and wide reading convinced him that what heâ€™d seen in Siberia was no exception, but a rule. In the 1860s, he watched a vast exodus of fallow deer gather in their thousands to cross the river Amur at its narrowest point to escape an early snowfall. In 1882, he was fascinated by a crab stuck on its back in a tank in Brighton Aquarium; it was painstakingly rescued by a band of comrades. Kropotkin collected descriptions from all over the world of the sociable behaviours of ants, bees, termites, falcons, swallows, horned larks, migrating birds, gazelles, buffalo, colonies of beavers, squirrels, mice, flocks of seals, herds of wild horses, tribes of dogs, wolf packs, marmots, rats, chinchillas, as well as apes and monkeys. He wrote that:</p>
<blockquote>[A]s we ascend the scale of evolution, we see association growing more and more conscious. It loses its purely physical character, it ceases to be simply instinctive, it becomes reasoned.</blockquote>
<p>It proved impossible for Kropotkin, a man â€˜amiable to the point of saintlinessâ€™ according to George Bernard Shaw, to dedicate himself entirely to the â€˜highest joysâ€™ of scientific discovery, when all around him he saw â€˜nothing but misery and struggle for a mouldy bit of breadâ€™, as he put it in his <em>Memoirs of a Revolutionist</em> (1899). In 1872, in Switzerland, he became an anarchist, impressed by the egalitarian fraternity he found among the watchmakers of Jura. Back in Russia, he joined the revolutionary Circle of Tchaikovsky, disseminating underground literature and lecturing to the workers of St Petersburg disguised as Borodin the peasant agitator. His propaganda landed him in prison, but he escaped in 1876 with the help of comrades. By 1883, he was a political prisoner once again, this time in France. This second confinement gave him time to develop his arguments about evolution: he started to address systematically the conflicting interpretations of Darwin emerging in different parts of the world.</p>
<p>Human beings could overcome competitive struggle by restructuring society along principles of community and self-sufficiency</p>
<p>In England, the biologist, anthropologist and anatomist Thomas Huxley had quickly emerged as â€˜Darwinâ€™s bulldogâ€™. Self-described as sharp of â€˜claws and beakâ€™, Huxley was prepared to â€˜go to the Stake if requisiteâ€™ to defend evolutionary doctrine. His views on human nature and political economy were defined by Thomas Hobbes and Thomas Robert Malthus: life was an endless fight for scarce resources. The libertarian Herbert Spencer likewise applied natural selection to economics, using his infamous coinage the â€˜survival of the fittestâ€™ to justify laissez-faire capitalism. Popularly labelled â€˜social Darwinismâ€™, this view became gospel for Gilded Age industrialists such as John D Rockefeller. Although Huxley himself didnâ€™t recommend the â€˜survival of the fittestâ€™ rule as a basis for morality â€“ quite the reverse â€“ he certainly believed that human beings were brutal and competitive, their sociability merely a recent veneer, rationalised by self-interest.</p>
<p>After Huxley published his pessimistic essay â€˜The Struggle for Existence and Its Bearing Upon Manâ€™ (1888) in <em>The Nineteenth Century</em>, an influential Victorian monthly review, Kropotkin was in a good position to launch an attack on Huxleyâ€™s idea of nature as a â€˜gladiatorâ€™s showâ€™. By this time, having been released from prison following an international outcry, Kropotkin was established in England, becoming quite a celebrity in the socialist and anarchist circles that blossomed through the mid-1880s. He promoted his political ideas in the international Left-wing press, and cofounded a London-based journal called <em>Freedom</em>, but made a living writing for scientific periodicals.</p>
<p>Between 1890 and 1915, in a series of interdisciplinary essays, Kropotkin drew on biology, sociology, history, (anti-racist) ethnology and anthropology to argue that species can organise and cooperate to overcome the natural environment and ensure their future survival. In 1902, the first eight essays were brought together in a book entitled <em>Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution</em>, an account of mutual support in action across the animal world (from microorganisms to mammals), ancient and modern â€˜barbarianâ€™ and â€˜savageâ€™ societies, medieval city-states and, finally, among modern humanity.</p>
<p>Kropotkin sought to recover an uncorrupted Darwin, whose metaphors should not be read too literally. But his call to understand compassion as â€˜a powerful factor of further evolutionâ€™ cleared the way for a very particular political vision: human beings could overcome competitive struggle by voluntarily restructuring and decentralising society along principles of community and self-sufficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Kropotkin became</strong> <strong>enamoured</strong> with mutual aid after reading an 1880 lecture on the subject by the celebrated zoologist Karl Kessler. Like other Russian naturalists at the time, Kessler didnâ€™t deny the struggle for existence, but his own fieldwork in harsh and sparsely populated regions of the Russian empire strongly suggested that â€˜the progressive development of the animal kingdom, and especially of mankind, is favoured much more by mutual support than by mutual struggleâ€™. But, as Kropotkin mourned: â€˜like so many good things published in the Russian tongue only, that remarkable address remains almost entirely unknownâ€™.</p>
<p>Kropotkin laid the groundwork for subsequent studies of altruism and mutualism in natural selection</p>
<p>Neither was Kropotkin alone politically. The historian of science Eric Johnson has recently <a href="https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0378937" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">demonstrated</a> that the rhetoric of social Darwinism arose in reaction to â€˜Social<em>ist</em> Darwinismâ€™, while Piers Hale <a href="https://chicago.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.7208/chicago/9780226108520.001.0001/upso-9780226108490" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">traces</a> a much more contested politics of evolution than many historians have previously recognised. The womenâ€™s rights campaigner Annie Besant in 1886 declared that she was a socialist because she believed in evolution. She was one of a number of thinkers on the Left who read Darwin as proof that power and privilege, not nature, were responsible for social inequality.</p>
<p>Kropotkinâ€™s ideas about mutual aid have often been dismissed. The title of Stephen Jay Gouldâ€™s confessional essay is telling: â€˜Kropotkin Was No Crackpotâ€™ (1988):</p>
<blockquote>If Kropotkin drew inappropriate hope for social reform from his concept of nature, other Darwinians had erred just as firmly â€¦ in justifying imperial conquest, racism, and oppression of industrial workers as the harsh outcome of natural selection in the competitive mode.</blockquote>
<p>Many biologists now <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-prince-of-evolution-peter-kropotkin/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">credit</a> Kropotkin with laying the groundwork for all subsequent studies of altruism and mutualism in natural selection, and outlining an epigenetic framework in which heredity and development are integral to the process of evolutionary change. Social activists and anarchists embrace his ringing refutation of the political value of competition.</p>
<p>Kropotkin united science with anarcho-communism for the rest of his life, and <em>Freedom</em> continued to promote mutual aid in its columns. The turn of the century brought tough times for anarchism. London was no longer its international hub, an â€˜anarchist holy-cityâ€™. The principle of â€˜propaganda of the deedâ€™ had irrevocably conflated the movement in the public mind with dynamite, assassination and acts of terror, while surging enthusiasm for Marxism struck at anarchismâ€™s support base. Boer war jingoism hardly helped. â€˜[O]ur movement just now is so slow, so low down,â€™ Kropotkin complained to <em>Freedom</em>â€™s editor in 1904.</p>
<p>In the early hours of 28 December 1908, southern Italy was struck by the most calamitous earthquake ever to hit Europe. The shock, lasting 30-40 seconds, was followed by a devastating tsunami, flattening the cities of Messina and Reggio and killing more than 100,000 people in Calabria and Sicily. <em>Freedom</em> reported the aftermath, applauding the rescue operation as the perfect realisation of â€˜the mutual aid positionâ€™, and the â€˜deeds of superhuman heroismâ€™ achieved on the ground by common mortals â€˜who are supposed to need rulers to teach them what is rightâ€™. â€˜But,â€™ asked the paper, â€˜must we have a social cataclysm before the blind selfishness of this society can give place to human solidarity and the communal life which means plenty for all?â€™</p>
<p>Kropotkin finally returned to Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution, horrified by the authoritarian socialism that now held sway. Critical of all government to his death, he wavered in his last years between fear and hope for the future. A century later, mutual aid is a thriving model of political and social organisation, and Kropotkinâ€™s ideas have nourished thousands of bottom-up voluntary initiatives, not least Common Ground Relief and the Occupy movement. His heirs rejoice in a new slogan: â€˜solidarity, not charityâ€™.</p></div></div>]]>

When I find an idea that resonates with me, I turn into an evangelist for it to
everyone who works with me.</p>
<p>Here are some of my favorites. There’s a recency bias; I can’t remember some of
the formative essays from my early years as a programmer. </p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/progessays/">Ben Kuhn</a> for this idea!</p>
<h3>Essays</h3>
<p>Jeff Atwood, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-first-rule-of-programming-its-always-your-fault/">The First Rule of Programming: It’s Always Your Fault</a>. I
like to answer questions on Stack Overflow, and an amazing amount of questions
on that website have a title like “Found a bug in React?” paired with an
introductory sentence: “I’m brand new to React.” It’s human to assume there’s a
problem with your tools or materials. To me, this essay’s point is that it’s
more profitable to assume the opposite, because your code hasn’t stood up to
anything close to the scrutiny of the code from a popular software project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you truly aspire to being a humble programmer, you should have no qualms
about saying “hey, this is my fault— and I’ll get to the bottom of it.”
— Jeff Atwood</p>

<hr>
<p>Shawn Wang, <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/">Learn in Public</a>. Be public, leverage the encouragement and
criticism of others, and build a footprint for yourself on the internet. There
are a bunch of detours you can take as a junior developer that waste time and
potentially graduate you to <a href="https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/">expert beginner</a> status; one of
them is hiding your work in an attempt to avoid criticism. I think one of the
smartest parts of argument this can be summed up in the adage: “The fastest way
to get the right answer to a question is to post the wrong answer on the
internet.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People think you suck? Good. You agree. Ask them to explain, in detail, why
you suck. You want to just feel good or you want to be good? No objections, no
hurt feelings. Then go away and prove them wrong.

<hr>
<p>Elisabeth Hendrickson, <a href="https://testobsessed.com/2020/02/momentum-urgency/">Momentum &gt;
Urgency</a>. I found this post
recently, and it describes the best teams I’ve worked with. Effective teams
focus on process, not outcome. Managers of such teams know that a team member
being blocked isn’t a frustrating detail that that team member will have to
remedy, but rather a process failure that was luckily exposed while many more
remain hidden. They’ll use their managerial clout to fight with you against
that obstacle, considering it a top priority.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I’ve learned is that if we want things to go fast, a sense of momentum
is much more effective than a sense of urgency.

This post isn’t just for programmers, but the statistical nature of it
resonated with me. Since reading it, I often consider the reach of my chosen
communication method, and whether I’m making efficient use of time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assuming you want your message to reach as many people as possible, blog it. You only have so many hours in the day.

Programmers know that what we can see on a web page can represent a small
fraction or none of the true functionality, completeness, and complexity of the
application. People who don’t write software don’t automatically know that.
Factor this into all communication.</p>

going to be all about pixels. If you can, build your UI in such a way that
unfinished parts look unfinished.

<hr>
<p><a href="http://xyproblem.info/">XY Problem</a>. When you’re asking for programming help
from someone, start by easing them into your situation, stating the problem,
your assumptions, and what you’ve tried and learned. Give them the chance to
poke holes in your logic.</p>

<p>Jon Evans, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/07/why-the-new-guy-cant-code/">Why The New Guy Can’t
Code</a>. The truth
of this argument has confirmed itself to me over and over again. I think that I
became a programmer on the job. But you can become a programmer right now by
doing just one hard thing: committing to a meaningful project, no matter how
small, and finishing it, in spite of the obstacles you will face.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So what should a real interview consist of? Let me offer a humble proposal:
don’t interview anyone who hasn’t accomplished anything. Ever. Certificates and
degrees are not accomplishments; I mean real-world projects with real-world
users.

<p>Paul Slaughter, <a href="https://conventionalcomments.org/">Conventional comments</a>. I
believe in code reviews as a technique to raise quality, share information, and
help people grow. But they can go wrong in so many ways and have an almost
opposite effect. This technique– labeling comments to help the recipient
contextualize your feedback– has had a positive impact on several teams I’ve
been a part of.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Labeling comments saves hours of undercommunication and misunderstandings.
They are also parseable by machines!

<p>Zed Shaw via Abhishek Nagekar, <a href="https://www.nagekar.com/2018/06/advice-from-an-old-programmer-zed-shaw.html">Advice From An Old Programmer</a>. There will
likely come a day when you find programming to be a little bit boring. It will
cease to be joyful as a pure exercise. What do you do then? It’s a question I’m
grappling with. I’m choosing to use that skill to build things I care about,
and help others become programmers through volunteering.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Programming as a profession is only moderately interesting. It can be a good
job, but you could make about the same money and be happier running a fast food
joint. You’re much better off using code as your secret weapon in another
profession.

Business does not. Copying is a zero-sum game and all participating players will compete profits away until they reach a Nash-equilibrium, where a further lowering of price, and thus margins, is unsustainable. Innovation is always new and therefore never formulaic. There are certain guidelines successful businesses seem to use but in the end, you’ll still have to go with your gut and make a judgment call according to your own ethical values.</em></p><p>Arguably, replicating findings is one of the best tools we have in our scientific arsenal in order to test the validity of a conclusion.</p><p>Which is why the psychology community was not amused when the methodological crisis now known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis" target="_blank">Replication crisis</a> started, where it was discovered that many studies weren’t replicable (Nosek et al., 2015).</p><p>Even some of the most cited and well-known studies such as the study that power posing makes you act bolder (Carney, Cuddy &amp; Yap, 2010).</p><p>Which, incidentally, is why it’s so important to not just reference research (instead of parroting some YouTube influencer or blogger) but to also carefully analyze the literature and its limitations yourself. *1</p><p>This doesn’t guarantee perfection, but it does decrease obvious and preventable mistakes.</p><p>JP Ioannidis pointed out serious problems with published research in ‘’Why most published research findings are false.’’</p><blockquote><p>‘’ Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.’’ (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/" target="_blank">Ioannidis, 2005</a>).</p></blockquote><p>Methodological issues aside, replication matters.</p><p>Well, that’s all fine and dandy weren’t it for the pesky fact that our field relies on innovation.</p><p>Even if you extract all the knowledge from the brains of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Systrom" target="_blank">Kevin Systrom</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Krieger" target="_blank">Mike Krieger </a>and build Instagram, you’d get the complete opposite result because Instagram already exists.</p><p>Even Kevin and Mike can’t replicate it because the variables have changed.</p><p>The entire environment and current social climate (regarding privacy, advertising, users as the product, and social media addiction) are different, and even if it weren’t, no user is gonna switch to an IG clone when IG already exists.</p><p>There are some guidelines that most successful companies seem to follow, however, you can’t formulate a step-by-step plan for the reasons laid out above.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel" target="_blank">Peter Thiel</a> was one of the first to point out this distinction between companies that go from 0 to 1, innovation, and companies that go from 1 to n (copying), in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296" target="_blank">Zero to One</a>.</p><p>Companies that do copy and thus employ a formula they copied from another company open themselves up to fierce competition.</p><p>As more players participate in this zero-sum game, the fixed pie of users and profits will get competed away because there are too many mouths to feed with finite resources. *2</p><p>If you copy each other with no (or no meaningful) distinctions then price will be the only thing you can compete on, which is exactly what we see in commodity markets.</p><p>Player B will lower prices in order to steal market share from Player A. Player A lowers them still. Player C lowers it below both of them. Player D goes too low and goes bankrupt.</p><p>Over time, price will collapse into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium" target="_blank">Nash-equilibrium</a>.</p><p>A point where no player can do better by unilaterally changing their strategy. Go below the current price point and you go out of business because the unit economics fail. Go above the current price point and you go out of business because there’s no good reason for users to pay more for the exact same product. *3</p><p>Unless one player, usually a new one, sufficiently innovates and thus creates a whole new business model. In effect, changing the game. This is essentially the raison d’etre of a startup, and it’s why <a href="https://steveblank.com/about/">Steve Blank</a> defined a startup as: ‘‘a temporary organization <strong>used to search</strong> for a repeatable and scalable business model.’’</p><p>This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that we go through traditional education by&nbsp;default.</p><p>A system that’s not designed to teach independent thinking but rather to reward obedience and implementing rules.</p><p>If you think that’s my opinion instead of the facts, then watch this to get a better understanding of how our modern education system was formed:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1560851539916_31181"><div><p>If you’ll allow me, I’d like to take a short trip with you to use mathematics as an analogy.</p><p>In mathematical set theory, there’s something called the axiom of choice&nbsp;(AoC).</p><p>Without making the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice" target="_blank">AoC</a> too complex, picture this:</p><p>Suppose you have 3 jars: Jar 1, Jar 2, Jar 3.</p><p>Each jar contains a piece of paper with a few whole numbers written on it.</p><p>Jar 1: 4, 8, 45</p><p>Jar 2: 646, 23</p><p>Jar 3: 894, 7, 45649, 54, 76</p><p>Now I can make a new jar: Jar 4, which contains one element from each of the jars.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1560851539916_34730"><div><p>Okay… in order to do that we need to build some machine where we can put something in and it spits something out (a function).</p><p>Let’s create a function that just ‘’chooses’’ the smallest element in each jar.</p><p>So it picks: 4 from Jar 1, 23 from Jar 2 and 7 from Jar 3.</p><p>So now we can put a piece of paper in Jar 4 with 4, 23, 7 on it.</p><p>We’ve created a choice function ‘’pick the smallest element out of each jar’’ that creates a new set (Jar 4) with the chosen elements.</p><p>Even if we had infinite jars, this function always works.</p><p>Because with natural numbers (whole numbers 1 and up), there’s always ‘a smallest’.</p><p>But what if we have an interval in Jar 2 such as (3,5].</p><p>The symbol ( means 3 is not included.</p><p>This creates a problem because what’s the smallest element we should pick now?</p><p>3.1? Well, what about half that 3.05?</p><p>Well, what about half of that again 3.025?</p><p>No matter how close we get to 3 we can always choose a smaller element so our choice function doesn’t work here.</p><p>When you invoke the AoC you claim that even though we don’t know what the choice function is, you’re going to assume there is one.&nbsp;</p><p>(That there is a way to pick one element out of each jar and create a new jar with those elements.)</p><p>An analogy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell" target="_blank">Bertrand Russell</a> came up with is that if you have an infinite pair of shoes you can create a choice function: Pick the left shoe from every pair.</p><p>But if you have an infinite pair of identical socks, there’s no such thing as right or left, so you can’t create a choice function to pick one sock from each pair and therefore have to invoke the AoC.</p><p>The AoC is something that can not be proven or disproven, you either invoke it or you don’t.</p><p>If you use it, it allows you to do certain kinds of mathematics but also creates paradoxes such as the Banach-Tarski paradox.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Hard to explain without mathematics but a sketchy way to think about it is that it’s possible to break a sphere into pieces, rotated them and you get your sphere back, rotate them differently and you have two spheres with the same volume as the original.</em></p><p>And if you don’t invoke the AoC, there’s certain mathematics you can’t do.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1560851539916_43081"><div><p>Just like not knowing the existence of a choice function and invoking the Axiom of Choice, we often can’t know the best way to proceed in business under the current market and technology circumstances.</p><p>We often can’t prove or disprove our hypotheses, especially when you’re innovating, so reason fails us to some extent.</p><p>We talked about the limitations of reason and the upside of using a more Darwinian approach in the essay series: ‘‘<a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/illogical" target="_blank">Why Your Business Needs More Weird Ideas.</a>’’</p><p>In essence, you’re saying: ‘‘It’s fundamentally impossible to determine what the best way to innovate is, but I’m just gonna assume there is a way.’’</p><p>It’s an enigmatic problem so you just have to take a stance and make a decision according to your ethical values.</p><p>I want to end with an excerpt from the interview with Andrew Mason, the Founder and early CEO of&nbsp;Groupon.</p><p><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/10/andrew-mason-on-groupon.html" target="_blank">The Quick Rise and Even Faster Fall of Groupon, Through the Eyes of Its CEO.</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>There was one other part of the letter that says your biggest regrets are the moments that you let a lack of data override your intuition of what’s best for the customers. What did you mean by that?</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong>Groupon started out with these really tight principles about how the site was going to work, really being pro-customer. And as we expanded people in the company would say, “Hey, why don’t we try running two deals a day?” “Why don’t we start sending two emails a day?” And I’d think, <em>That sounds awful. Who wants to get two emails every single day from a company. </em>And they’d be like, <em>Sure, it sounds awful to you. But we’re a data-driven company, so why don’t we let the data decide? Why don’t we do a test?</em> And we’d do a test, and it would show that maybe people would unsubscribe at a slightly higher rate, but the increase in purchasing would more than make up for it. You’d get in a situation where it doesn’t feel right, but it does seem like a rational decision.</p><p>The problem was when you’re in hypergrowth like this, you don’t have time to see what is going to happen to the data in the long term. The churn would catch up with you. People would unsubscribe at higher rates, and then, before you know it, the service has just turned into something — if you look at Groupon now, it’s just this vestige of what it once was. There’s no real copywriting. It’s a marketplace of coupons. It’s still a service that a lot of people get a lot of value out of, but it doesn’t have the spirit it once did.</p><p>There are certain things you have to be religious about in the company. That’s what I’ve taken away from that: There are some things where you have to say, “I’m sorry. I’m not going to look at the data on that. This is just what we’re going to do. We know that it’s right, and there’s nothing that’s going to shake us from that.” (Blumberg, 2018).</p></blockquote><p><em>*1 The fact that almost everyone is lazy and assume others have done their homework vs. doing the hard work of checking it themselves is a cognitive error known as </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility" target="_blank"><em>diffusion of responsibility</em></a><em>. ‘’The individual assumes that others either are responsible for taking action or have already done so.’’</em></p><p><em>*2 This is often …</em></p></div></div></div>

          <td colspan="3">
            
            <div id="content">
              <p>I have a couple of different stationary computers. A
                custom-built PC running Windows, an iMac G3 running Mac
                OS 9 and an old HP microtower running Alpine Linux,
                acting as a home server of sorts. Out of all these, I
                spend most of my time on the Windows PC. I use Windows
                for the majority of my work, including a large part of
                the programming that I do.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Even though I mainly use Windows, most of my
                web/software development is grounded in or at least
                inspired by Unix in some way: most obviously, I use Git,
                which is a tool designed for the Unix shell. This turns
                out to be a rather awkward match: on the one hand, I use
                Windows Explorer to manage the files; on the other hand,
                I have a command prompt open to manage the repository.</p>
              <p>For my workflow, it would be much better if the Git
                commands were integrated into Explorer itself. So I
                added what amounts to the following code to <a href="http://git.ankarstrom.se/ahk.git/">my AutoHotKey
                  script</a>: <br>
              </p>

              <p>(The actual code is contained in <a href="http://git.ankarstrom.se/ahk.git/tree/tt.programs.explorer.ahk">this

                  file</a>, most of it near the bottom.) </p>
              <p>This adds a bunch of hotkeys to any Explorer window:</p>
              <dl>
                <dt><b>Alt-A</b></dt>
                <dd>"git add" the selected file; then "git status"<br>
                </dd>

                <dd>"git diff" the selected file, comparing the previous
                  and current commit</dd>

                <dt><b>Alt-P</b></dt>

                <dd>"git status"</dd>
              </dl>
              <p>All of these hotkeys open a new command prompt window,
                displaying the results of the Git command, which the
                user can close by pressing any key.</p>
              <p>In my experience, these hotkeys make it incalculably
                less bothersome to work with Git on Windows, and I think
                it shows how incredibly useful even very simple
                AutoHotKey scripts can be. If you have any suggestions
                on other hotkeys, please write a comment below.<br>

<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>We started this series with <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">an overview of the CPython VM</a>. We learned that to run a Python program, CPython first compiles it to bytecode, and we studied how the compiler works in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">part two</a>. <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/">Last time</a> we stepped through the CPython source code starting with the <code>main()</code> function until we reached the evaluation loop, a place where Python bytecode gets executed. The main reason why we spent time studying these things was to prepare for the discussion that we start today. The goal of this discussion is to understand how CPython does what we tell it to do, that is, how it executes the bytecode to which the code we write compiles.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h3>Starting point</h3>
<p>Let's briefly recall what we learned in the previous parts. We tell CPython what to do by writing Python code. The CPython VM, however, understands only Python bytecode. This is the job of the compiler to translate Python code to bytecode. The compiler stores bytecode in a code object, which is a structure that fully describes what a code block, like a module or a function, does. To execute a code object, CPython first creates a state of execution for it called a frame object. Then it passes a frame object to a frame evaluation function to perform the actual computation. The default frame evaluation function is <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> defined in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/Python/ceval.c#L889">Python/ceval.c</a>. This function implements the core of the CPython VM. Namely, it implements the logic for the execution of Python bytecode. So, this function is what we're going to study today.</p>
<p>To understand how <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> works, it is crucial to have an idea of what its input, a frame object, is. A frame object is a Python object defined by the following C struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// typedef struct _frame PyFrameObject; in other place</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>_frame</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject_VAR_HEAD</span>

<span>};</span>

<p>The <code>f_code</code> field of a frame object points to a code object. A code object is also a Python object. Here's its definition:</p>

<p>The most important field of a code object is <code>co_code</code>. It's a pointer to a Python bytes object representing the bytecode. The bytecode is a sequence of two-byte instructions: one byte for an opcode and one byte for an argument.</p>
<p>Don't worry if some members of the above structures are still a mystery to you. We'll see what they are used for as we move forward in our attempt to understand how the CPython VM executes the bytecode.</p>
<h3>Overview of the evaluation loop</h3>
<p>The problem of executing Python bytecode may seem a no-brainer to you. Indeed, all the VM has to do is to iterate over the instructions and to act according to them. And this is what essentially <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> does. It contains an infinite <code>for (;;)</code> loop that we refer to as the evaluation loop. Inside that loop there is a giant <code>switch</code> statement over all possible opcodes. Each opcode has a corresponding <code>case</code> block containing the code for executing that opcode. The bytecode is represented by an array of 16-bit unsigned integers, one integer per instruction. The VM keeps track of the next instruction to be executed using the <code>next_instr</code> variable, which is a pointer to the array of instructions. At the start of each iteration of the evaluation loop, the VM calculates the next opcode and its argument by taking the least significant and the most significant byte of the next instruction respectively and increments <code>next_instr</code>. The <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> function is nearly 3000 lines long, but its essence can be captured by the following simplified version:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PyObject</span><span>*</span>
<span>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault</span><span>(</span><span>PyThreadState</span> <span>*</span><span>tstate</span><span>,</span> <span>PyFrameObject</span> <span>*</span><span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>throwflag</span><span>)</span>

        <span>// ... check if the bytecode execution must be suspended,</span>

            <span>case</span> <span>TARGET</span><span>(</span><span>NOP</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>FAST_DISPATCH</span><span>();</span> <span>// more on this later</span>
            <span>}</span>

            <span>case</span> <span>TARGET</span><span>(</span><span>LOAD_FAST</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>// ... code for loading local variable</span>

        <span>}</span>

        <span>// ... error handling</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>// ... termination</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To get a more realistic picture, let's discuss some of the omitted pieces in more detail.</p>
<h4>reasons to suspend the loop</h4>
<p>From time to time, the currently running thread stops executing the bytecode to do something else or to do nothing. This can happen due to one of the four reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are signals to handle. When you register a function as a signal handler using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html#signal.signal"><code>signal.signal()</code></a>, CPython stores this function in the array of handlers. The function that will actually be called when a thread receives a signal is <code>signal_handler()</code> (it's passed to the <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigaction.2.html"><code>sigaction()</code></a> library function on Unix-like systems). When called, <code>signal_handler()</code> sets a boolean variable telling that the function in the array of handlers corresponding to the received signal has to be called. Periodically, the main thread of the main interpreter calls the tripped handlers.</li>
<li>There are pending calls to call. Pending calls is a mechanism that allows to schedule a function to be executed from the main thread. This mechanism is exposed by the Python/C API via the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.Py_AddPendingCall"><code>Py_AddPendingCall()</code></a> function.</li>
<li>The asynchronous exception is raised. The asynchronous exception is an exception set in one thread from another. This can be done using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc"><code>PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc()</code></a> function provided by the Python/C API.</li>
<li>The currently running thread is requested to drop the GIL. When it sees such a request, it drops the GIL and waits until it acquires the GIL again.</li>
</ul>
<p>CPython has indicators for each of these events. The variable indicating that there are handlers to call is a member of <code>runtime-&gt;ceval</code>, which is a <code>_ceval_runtime_state</code> struct:</p></div></div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>According to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_time#Statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American survey,</a> children&nbsp;between the ages of 8-12 and 13-18 spend a daily average of 4 hours, 44 minutes and 7 hours, 22 minutes respectively, staring at screens.</p>
<p>The data for these numbers were collected in 2019. For adults, this figure is higher and according to an article on the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/24/screen-time-iphone-coronavirus-quarantine-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post </a>earlier this year, the amount of screen time increased considerably during the quarantine period due to <strong>COVID-19</strong></p>
<p>Today, mobile devices take a large percentage of the amount of time people spend staring at screens, this is why there is a need for applications to have a <strong>Dark Mode</strong> option for its users.</p>
<p><strong>Dark Mode</strong> according to <strong>Wikipedia,</strong><em> is a color scheme that uses light-coloured text, icons, and graphical user interface elements on a dark background and is often discussed in terms of computer user interface design and web design.</em></p>
<p>Now, let us look at the 5 reasons why <strong>Dark Mode</strong> really matters for the end-users of an application!<br>
<a name="reasons-for-dark-mode"></a></p>
<h2>Reasons For Dark Mode</h2>
<p><img src="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal-300x200.jpg" alt="visual appeal" width="1055" height="703" srcset="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal-300x200.jpg 300w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal-768x512.jpg 768w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1055px) 100vw, 1055px"><br>
<a name="visual-attraction"></a></p>
<h3>1). Visual Attraction</h3>
<p><strong>Dark Mode</strong> when applied in the right manner always looks really appealing to the eye. It provides the opportunity to present a unique user interface to the end-users of an application.</p>
<p>Also, in terms of data presentation for graphical contents like dashboards that contain graphs and charts, <strong>Dark Mode</strong> brings out the elegance in the design as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/darkmode-300x156.png" alt="Dark Mode" width="1106" height="575" srcset="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/darkmode-300x156.png 300w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/darkmode-1024x531.png 1024w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/darkmode-768x398.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1106px) 100vw, 1106px"></p>
<p>Unlike the drab white look that most applications have, the above image shows how <strong>Dark Mode</strong> can bring a significantly deeper and more attractive visual perception to an application.<br>
<a name="user-experience"></a></p>
<h3>2). User Experience</h3>
<p>Providing the users of a product with the option of a <strong>Dark Mode</strong> is a good business decision, especially if the application requires users to spend lots of time on the application. A streaming site, for example, implementing a dark mode feature is a good business decision.</p>
<p>Streaming a video in <strong>light-mode</strong> under a dark environment or at night may not be a good experience for the eyes. Hence, applications that require people spending lots of screen time should provide an option for <strong>Dark Mode</strong> for a better user experience.</p>
<p>Above all, it is worthy to note that context is a key factor in making decisions on whether to implement the option of a <strong>Dark Mode</strong>.<br>
<a name="eye-strain"></a></p>
<h3>3). Eye Strain &amp; Blue Light Removal</h3>
<p>By default, <strong>Dark Mode</strong> helps to reduce overall screen brightness. Although no study has outrightly confirmed that <strong>Dark Mode</strong> reduces eye strain, it can, however, be effective in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Also, <strong>Dark Mode</strong> helps to reduce exposure to <strong>Blue Light.</strong>&nbsp;Blue light is a high-frequency colour in the “visible light spectrum” that can be seen by the human eye.</p>
<p><img src="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light-300x200.jpg" alt="blue-light" width="990" height="660" srcset="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light-300x200.jpg 300w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light-768x512.jpg 768w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px"></p>
<p><strong>Blue Light&nbsp;</strong>can be found almost everywhere, from smartphones to computers and other digital devices. Another source of Blue Light is the sun, so by stepping out of your house, you are exposed to a certain degree of blue light.</p>
<p>Too many exposures to Blue Light can lead to digital eye strain.</p>
<p>Since not everyone can see well with <strong>Dark Mode</strong>, some mobile devices provide the option for Blue Light filters. This can be found in the display settings area and can be easily adjusted to the level of blue light exposure you want.<br>
<a name="reduction-of-photophobia"></a></p>
<h3>4). Reduction of Photophobia</h3>
<p>Photophobia is a symptom of abnormal intolerance to the visual perception of light. The source of this light could be any form of light source including sunlight.</p>
<p>There are so many things that can cause photophobia, some of which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excessive light entering the eyes</li>
<li>Eye infection</li>
<li>Medications</li>
<li>Meningitis</li>
<li>Lack of eye pigment (Albinism)</li>
<li>Wearing contact lenses for an extended period of time, or wearing it wrongly.</li>
<li>Post Eye Surgery</li>
</ul>
<p>Photophobia usually disappears once the underlying cause is treated. A good way to deal with photophobia is making use of the <strong>Dark Mode </strong>of a mobile device or an application. This helps to reduce the amount of bright light that goes directly into the eyes.</p>
<p>An extension you may consider installing on your desktop browser is &nbsp;<a href="https://nighteye.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Night Eye</a>. It is supported by almost all major web browsers. It helps you enable <strong>Dark Mode </strong>and other features across almost all the websites you view, to help cope with the light sensitivity.</p>
<p>However, if light sensitivity persists, you may want to see your doctor!<br>
<a name="battery-saver"></a></p>
<h3>5). Battery Saver</h3>
<p>Another positive impact of <strong>Dark Mode</strong> is the impact it has on the battery life of mobile devices. <strong>Dark Mode </strong>can significantly help reduce the battery drain on devices which use OLED(Organic Light-Emitting Diode) screens.</p>

<p>Numerous studies have confirmed the fact that <strong>Dark Mode</strong> saves battery life. In an<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UljafaxRcEE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Android Dev Summit</a> in November of 2018, Google also confirmed that themes on android devices have a significant impact on the battery life of a mobile device.</p>
<p>If you are using an Android device, you should consider using <strong>Dark Mode</strong>, especially at night. Not only is it easy on the eyes, but it also helps save your battery life.<br>
<a name="factors-to-consider"></a></p>
<h3>Factors To Consider When Selecting Dark Mode</h3>
<p>In as much as <strong>Dark Mode</strong> seems trendy, it is necessary to consider some factors before deciding to implement it in an application. Some of these factors are discussed below:</p>
<p><strong>Readability and Visibility:&nbsp;</strong>Readability simply means the ease at which a reader can easily understand or perceive a written text. Applications that contain lots of text in their interface will have to be careful about how <strong>Dark Mode</strong> is implemented.</p>
<p>If the <strong>Dark Mode</strong> is not well implemented, this will lead to a poor user experience with the users struggling to read the texts. This defeats one of the purposes for which <strong>Dark Mode</strong> is created and could lead to eye strain.</p>
<p>Lots of research must go into how the backgrounds, text colour and font will work together.</p>
<p><strong>Test Before Implementation:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Testing helps to discover the strength and weakness of the Color scheme used in an application. <strong>Dark Mode</strong> does not work well for all applications. A website that contains lots of elements(text, images, tables) may make it difficult for <strong>Dark Mode</strong> to be implemented.</p>
<p>Other factors to consider include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determination of the target audience</li>
<li>Providing an option to switch between Light Mode and Dark Mode</li>
<li>The Environment</li>
<li>Accessibility</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The decision to always use <strong>Dark Mode </strong>should always be a relative one. For users of an application, knowing when to use light mode and <strong>Dark Mode </strong>at different times of the day is very essential for the eye.</p>

            <p>On Nov 1st, all images pulled from the Docker Hub will be subjected to severe limits, which will affect all Kubernetes users. Learn what solutions exist, and how how to prepare.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p><a href="https://inlets.dev/blog/2020/10/29/Docker">Docker</a> is both a company and <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker">an Open Source project</a> which revolutionised how users deploy code to production. Containers rather than Virtual Machines (VMs) are now considered the lingua franca of deployments, and containers are packed in “images”. These images need to be distributed through a container registry, such as the registry created and operated by Docker called the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://inlets.dev/images/2020-10-preparing-docker-hub/containers.jpg" alt="Container shipment"></p>

<p>Up until recently, public images were able to be pulled as many times as needed by a user with no rate-limiting, gating, or payments getting in the way. On Nov 1st, that is all going to change an the following will come into play:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unauthenticated users: 100 pulls / 6 hours</li>
  <li>Authenticated users: 200 pulls / 6 hours</li>
  <li>Paying, authenticated users: unlimited downloads</li>
</ul>

<p>See also: <a href="https://www.docker.com/pricing">Docker Hub rate limits &amp; pricing</a></p>

<p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> users will be most affected, since it’s very common to push and pull images during development many times with each revision of a container. Even bootstrapping a cluster with 10 nodes, each of which needs 10 containers just for its control-plane and could exhaust the unauthenticated limit before you’ve even started getting to the real work. This is compacted where companies use a shared IP address, shared cloud infrastructure, or a VPN, as the Docker Hub will use the shared IP address.</p>

<p>That limit of 100 pulls can be extended to 200 pulls, but requires complex configuration of your Kubernetes cluster with <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/">“image pull secrets”</a> in each namespace and each ServiceAccount throughout the cluster. Docker Hub users who pay Docker will be able to pull an unlimited amount of images, without rate-limiting, however this still requires “image pull secrets” to be configured.</p>

<p>You will be able to check your rate-limit level using a new Docker Hub API. Read more: <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/">Docker Hub Download rate limit</a>.</p>

<h2 id="potential-solutions">Potential solutions</h2>

<p>You will hit the limit, eventually, and so it’s best to prepare yourself and team for that eventually, than to scramble to StackOverflow when that day arrives.</p>

<p>In addition to several alternatives, I want to show you how to use the <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/registry-creds/">registry-creds operator</a> built to help new users learning Kubernetes, and those who are developing images locally.</p>

<h3 id="use-a-local-mirror-of-the-docker-hub">Use a local mirror of the Docker Hub</h3>

<p>Setting up a mirror is fairly straight-forward, but will require additional infrastructure, and storage. Someone will need to own this mirror and baby-sit it, if it crashes or dies, you better hope that it can be restored quickly. For new Kubernetes users, this is going to be an unfortunate burden on your learning curve which is steep enough as it is.</p>

<p>There is an <a href="https://get-arkade.dev/">arkade</a> app for setting up a Docker registry on your own Kubernetes cluster:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>arkade <span>install </span>docker-registry
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This configuration enables authentication, so that you don’t have to worry about finding out how to do that yourself.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>arkade <span>install </span>docker-registry-ingress <span>\</span>
  <span>--email</span> web@example.com <span>\</span>
  <span>--domain</span> reg.example.com
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It also has automation to get a TLS certificate set-up, as nobody really wants to mess about with self-signed CAs, do they?</p>

<p>And if you’re running on your own hardware, or on-premises, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-operator">inlets-operator</a> to expose it on the Internet securely.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>export </span><span>LICENSE</span><span>=</span><span>"INLETS_PRO_LICENSE_JWT"</span>
<span>export </span><span>ACCESS_TOKEN</span><span>=</span><span>$HOME</span>/access-token

arkade <span>install </span>inlets-operator <span>\</span>
 <span>--provider</span> digitalocean <span>\</span>
 <span>--region</span> lon1 <span>\</span>
 <span>--token-file</span> <span>$ACCESS_TOKEN</span> <span>\</span>
 <span>--license</span> <span>$LICENSE</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See a complete tutorial here for <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/get-a-tls-enabled-docker-registry-in-5-minutes/">setting up a local Docker registry with a public IP address</a>.</p>

<p>Docker docs: <a href="https://docs.docker.com/registry/recipes/mirror/">Registry as a pull through cache</a></p>

<h3 id="configure-an-image-pull-secret">Configure an image pull secret</h3>

<p>Whether you pay Docker for unlimited pulls, or want to use your free account to bump up to 200 pulls per 6 hours, you’ll need to log in.</p>

<p>This generally consists of three steps:</p>

<p>1) Create an image pull secret in each Kubernetes namespace</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://docs.openfaas.com/deployment/kubernetes/#set-a-custom-imagepullpolicy">OpenFaaS docs</a></p>

<div><div><pre><code>kubectl create secret docker-registry my-private-repo <span>\</span>
    <span>--docker-username</span><span>=</span><span>$DOCKER_USERNAME</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--docker-password</span><span>=</span><span>$DOCKER_PASSWORD</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--docker-email</span><span>=</span><span>$DOCKER_EMAIL</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--namespace</span> openfaas-fn
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>2) Attach the secret to any Service Accounts in each namespace</p>

<div><div><pre><code>kubectl edit serviceaccount default <span>-n</span> openfaas-fn
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Most users can get away with just editing the <code>default</code> serviceaccount, however if you have more than one serviceaccount you’ll have to edit each of them.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the manifest add:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>imagePullSecrets</span><span>:</span>
<span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>my-private-repo</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At that point, you can now deploy a container to the <code>openfaas-fn</code> namespace, and as long as the Pod is using the <code>default</code> service account, it will pull from the Docker Hub using the credentials provided in the <code>my-private-repo</code> secret.</p>

<h3 id="use-a-public-docker-hub-mirror">Use a public Docker Hub mirror</h3>

<p>It appears that Google Cloud are offering a mirror of the Docker Hub at <code>mirror.gcr.io</code></p>

<p>So you can change your images as follows:</p>

<pre><code>FROM ubuntu:latest
</code></pre>

<p>to:</p>

<pre><code>FROM mirror.gcr.io/library/ubuntu:latest
</code></pre>

<p>This may be worth while for Google Cloud customers, but read all the terms and conditions before switching over.</p>

<p>See also: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/mitigating-the-impact-of-new-docker-hub-pull-request-limits">Google Cloud - Pulling cached Docker Hub images</a></p>

<h3 id="publish-your-own-images-to-another-registry">Publish your own images to another registry</h3>

<p>Since the Docker Hub rate limits pass the burden on to the end-user, and not the maintainers/vendors, you could consider using another registry all-together.</p>

<p>Just be careful that you don’t incur a huge bill. Make sure you know the costs of bandwidth and are aware of any limits that are in place.</p>

<p>The best option at present seems to be <a href="https://github.com/features/packages">GitHub’s container registry (ghcr.io)</a> which offers unlimited pulls of public images. Beware that the original GitHub Package Repository for containers is not the same product, and cannot support multi-arch templates.</p>

<p>On the inlets project we’ve already started publishing an image in GHCR so that users don’t have to contend with this issue.</p>

<p>Before:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>docker pull inlets/inlets-pro:0.7.3
docker pull docker.io/inlets/inlets-pro:0.7.3
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that the <code>docker.io</code> prefix is implicit, we are just not use to typing it in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>pull ghcr.io/inlets/inlets-pro:0.7.3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s a little more typing, and maintainers have to change their projects, but this seems like a good balance.</p>

<h2 id="our-solution-for-imagepullsecrets">Our solution for ImagePullSecrets</h2>

<p>Finally, I wanted to introduce our solution for managing ImagePullSecrets. We developed a Kubernetes operator which will propagate your registry credentials, whether for the Docke Hub or some other registry to every namespace in your cluster.</p>

<p>We’re releasing this as a free and open-source project on GitHub and you will be able to pull an image from GHCR to avoid a chicken-and-egg situation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Star or fork on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/registry-creds">alexellis/registry-creds</a></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://github.com/alexellis/registry-creds/blob/master/diagram.jpg?raw=true" alt="Diagram"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How it works: an initial secret is created, which is then copied into each namespace, and attached to each ServiceAccount</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s how you can try it out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use the arkade tool to download some tools and start a cluster, if you don’t already have one:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-SLs</span> https://dl.get-arkade.dev|sh
<span>sudo mv </span>arkade /usr/local/bin/

arkade get kind
arkade get kubectl
kind create cluster
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>Create a secrets file <code>~/.docker-creds</code></li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>export </span><span>DOCKER_USERNAME</span><span>=</span>username
<span>export </span><span>DOCKER_PASSWORD</span><span>=</span>password
<span>export </span><span>DOCKER_EMAIL</span><span>=</span>email

<span># Optional</span>
<span>export </span><span>DOCKER_SERVER</span><span>=</span><span>""</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>Install registry-creds with arkade</li>
</ul>

<p>The app applies the manifest for the controller and its CRD called <code>ClusterPullSecret</code> then creates an initial Kubernetes seed secret and attaches it to a new <code>ClusterPullSecret</code>. Of course, if you prefer then you can do all of this manually and there are <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/registry-creds">instructions in the README</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>source</span> ~/.docker-creds
arkade <span>install </span>registry-creds <span>--from-env</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you prefer, then you can also specify each flag, however be careful of leaking your credentials into your bash history:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>arkade <span>install </span>registry-creds <span>\</span>
  <span>--username</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>DOCKER_USERNAME</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--password</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>DOCKER_PASSWORD</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--email</span>  <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>DOCKER_EMAIL</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>Deploy an image</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code>kubectl run nginx-1 <span>--image</span><span>=</span>nginx <span>--port</span><span>=</span>80 <span>--restart</span><span>=</span>Always
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The image will now be pulled from the Docker Hub using the credentials you specified when installing the registry-creds arkade app.</p>

<p>If you want to prove that the secret is being used, try creating a private container image, and then deploying that with the command above.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>In conclusion, there are some changes coming to the Docker Hub that are potentially going to affect every user of container images. Kubernetes users are going to suffer the worst, especially new users who are just starting out on their journey. There are mitigations such as a pull-through and caching registry, which are actually a good idea anyway to make your environment faster. Configuring an ImagePullSecret is likely to be required whatever you decide to do, and the <code>registry-creds</code> operator we created is ready for the task.</p>

<p>Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/registry-creds">Star or Fork the registry-creds project on GitHub</a>. Feature requests are welcome.</p>

<p>All the tools mentioned here which are maintained by <a href="https://www.openfaas.com/">OpenFaaS Ltd</a> are multi-arch compatible, so you can run these steps on your home lab, ARM64 server, or on a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>Firearms (guns) are one of the hot button issues in the United States and globally. I’m sure it is understandable why — pull the trigger and something dies. Killing is the primary purpose of a firearm. Naturally, this leads many to be fearful of firearms, but should people be fearful?</p>
<p>When I started writing this, I wanted to answer:</p>
<blockquote><p>Are firearms inherently unsafe?</p>
<p>Should firearms be banned, as many believe?</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s quite ambitious. One may believe you can just find an answer on a website / paper somewhere or is obvious. Unfortunately, the reality is far more complicated and has turned this into my longest article to date.</p>
<p>It’s been said,</p>
<blockquote><p>Guns don’t kill people, people kill people. <em>– unknown</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Many agree and many others strongly disagree. That divisiveness has made firearms a political issue, leading to a plethora of bias studies, inaccurate analysis, and more. Thus, to answer these questions I had to go through the data myself; I pulled <a href="#Data_Tooling">data from the CDC, FBI, RAND, Census and others</a> and completed my own analysis.</p>
<p>For those interested, a PDF version of this document you can download here: <a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-by-the-Numbers.pdf">Firearms by the Numbers</a>.</p>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Due to the nature of this analysis, it is important to highlight some items upfront.</p>
<p>1. The United States is often the focus throughout the analysis. This is because the United States has an abundance of firearms, a relatively uniform society and the most available &amp; accurate records.</p>
<p>2. This analysis focuses on general trends. Specific situations vary wildly, even in the same region: country, state, county, city, and neighborhood situations vary. As such, I caution making detailed / specific inference, beyond what the data explicitly shows (in the general case).</p>
<p>3. Some important data is lacking, such as socioeconomic status associated with crimes. This makes it very difficult to isolate confounding factors and leads to confusion / lack of definitive answer(s).</p>
<p>The goal of this analysis was to analyze available (and unbiased) data as in-depth as enabled, with no particular outcome in mind. <em>If new data comes in that materially changes what can be inferred, I’ll attempt to update the analysis.</em> With that in mind, I want to highlight that I dive into demographic information and I found some surprises. Politics seems to stifle this topic and in fact the truth. Instead I went to the data, I hope you can find it as interesting as I do.</p>
<blockquote><p>The truth is not for all men, but only for those who seek it.<br>
– Ayn Rand</p></blockquote>
<p>If anything in this analysis was missed,<strong> please feel free to reach out or leave comments.</strong></p>


<p>Globally, firearms are highly controlled, particularly in the Europe and Asia. In contrast, the United States has more firearms held by it’s citizens than the rest of the world combined.<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png" alt="" width="1107" height="687" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png 1107w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-300x186.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-1024x635.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-768x477.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1107px) 100vw, 1107px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png 1107w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-300x186.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-1024x635.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-768x477.png 768w"></a>The real question — do the number of firearms really matter? From the graph above, it’s clear China, Russia and Iran have a high number of military firearms when compared civilian held firearms (and I suspect most civilian held firearms are former military, in countries such as China, Russia ,Iran, India, etc). In contrast, the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_World" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free world</a>” has an order of magnitude more civilian firearms, when compared to military firearms.</p>
<p>Clearly, what matters to “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">second world</a>” is having a large military arsenal, when compared to civilian held firearms.</p>
<p>It can be argued an unarmed society allows the military to impose their will, allowing countries to maintain the status quo and avoiding violent revolutions overthrowing the government.</p>
<h2><span id="Homicides_Firearms_Globally"></span>Homicides &amp; Firearms Globally<span></span></h2>
<p>In the “free world,” the main concern surrounding firearms are homicides &amp; suicides, with homicides being the most concerning. Below is a comparison of homicides by firearm deaths per 100,000 people across the globe.</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png" alt="" width="1228" height="677" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png 1228w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-300x165.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-1024x565.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-768x423.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1228px) 100vw, 1228px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png 1228w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-300x165.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-1024x565.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-768x423.png 768w"></a>When we compare the world, a few things become clear:</p>
<ol>
<li>The America’s, Caribbean and Africa have a much higher firearm homicide rate</li>
<li>The United States has the highest firearm homicide rate of a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first world</a>” country</li>
<li>Europe has the lowest firearm homicide rate globally</li>
</ol>
<p>What’s not clear, is whether or not firearms are really leading the increased firearm homicide rate.</p>
<p>Are homicides just naturally higher in these regions?</p>
<h2><span id="Firearm_Death_Rate_per_Firearm"></span>Firearm Death Rate per Firearm<span></span></h2>
<p>Below is an argument from the Amnesty International’s website:</p>
<blockquote><p>governments [with] poor regulation of the possession and use of <strong>guns lead to violence</strong> and that they must tackle this now through strict controls on guns and effective interventions in communities suffering high levels of gun violence.</p>
<p>– <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/arms-control/gun-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amnesty International</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The key statement is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Guns lead to violence</p></blockquote>
<p>The statement above implies a couple of things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gun volume and violence are correlated</li>
<li>As the number of guns increase, violence increases</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a few ways to invalidate / validate this statement. The clearest method is to simply compare firearm deaths per firearm. If firearms lead to more violence, we should see the ratio of firearm deaths to firearms (firearm deaths / firearms) staying constant (or growing at a constant rate). This ratio should stay or grow at a constant rate because as the firearm count increases, the firearm homicides should increase (keeping the ratio constant). We could also assume a direct correlation if “guns lead to violence” as it would probably occur at some constant rate.</p>
<p>Below you can see the comparison between firearm deaths and firearms:</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5.png" alt="" width="1313" height="687" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5.png 1313w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-300x157.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-1024x536.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-768x402.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1313px) 100vw, 1313px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5.png 1313w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-300x157.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-1024x536.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-768x402.png 768w"></a>As seen in the chart, the Caribbean, South America, Africa have a high number of firearm deaths per firearm, Columbia having one death per five hundred firearms. In contrast, “First World” (Europe and the United States) has a much lower number of fatalities per firearm, the United States having only one death per ten thousand firearms.</p>
<h3><span id="Firearms_vs_Homicide_Rate"></span>Firearms vs Homicide Rate<span></span></h3>
<p>For further evidence firearms aren’t correlated with violence, it’s possible to directly compare the number of firearms vs homicides:<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png" alt="" width="1107" height="687" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png 1107w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-300x186.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-1024x635.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-768x477.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1107px) 100vw, 1107px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png 1107w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-300x186.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-1024x635.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-768x477.png 768w"></a>Across the bottom of the chart you can see all the countries with high homicide rates. The United States stands out clearly, if firearms were correlated with homicides we’d expect the U.S. to have many more homicides than it currently does. It does not appear more firearms are correlated with more homicides, in fact the trend line shows the opposite to be true (more firearms are correlated to less homicides).</p>
<p>For a final validation, we can compare firearms against homicides and firearm homicides against total homicides. Both should have a similar growth rate, if there was a correlation.</p>

<p>It’s important to note the graph is a logarithmic comparison for homicides and homicides by firearm (firearms per 100k Inhabitants are not logarithmic). The trend line comparison of Total Homicides and Homicides by Firearm is linear, because the comparison is logarithmic, it appears exponential on the chart.</p>
<p>It is clear as homicides increase, homicides by firearm increase (blue data points). In contrast, when there are more firearms, homicides by firearm remain flat (purple data points), implying more firearms do not cause increase the number of homicides involving a firearm.</p>
<p>Further, you can see the blue star representing the United States homicide rate to homicide firearm deaths is right where it is expected. However, the purple star, representing the United States homicide rate to firearms per 100k inhabitants, is way outside the norm.</p>
<p>To summarize,</p>
<blockquote><p>Globally, as the firearm homicide rate increases, the total homicide rate increases; as the prevalence of firearms increase, the homicide rate <span>does not increase</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>The United States is clearly the largest holder of firearms in the world, most states have more firearms than entire countries. Fun fact:</p>
<blockquote><p>Texans and the Chinese military have the same number of firearms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clearly, there’s a culture of gun ownership in the United States. When the United States was formed it had just fought a war of independence and regularly combated Native Americans, settling North America by force. Even today, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Guard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">United States National Guard</a> is one of the largest militias in the world.</p>
<blockquote><p>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.<br>
–<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-2/"> Constitution of the United States</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Without diving into politics, the constitution &amp; culture has enabled the United States to be relatively unique. Firearms are regulated, but just barely. Generally, citizens can do everything from carrying a firearms in public to purchasing assault rifles, flamethrowers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minigun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">miniguns</a>, rocket launcher(s), etc. Often the only requirement is obtaining permit to own weapons, after that you can regularly purchase as many firearms as you’d like.</p>
<p>As seen in the previous section, the United States does have a higher (on average) number of firearm deaths. However, this doesn’t necessarily tell the whole story. In the prior section, we focused on the homicide rate. In the following sections, the focus will expand as uniform data collection, similar social norms and a widespread framework for law makes comparisons much easier.</p>
<p>Some topics we will explore here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suicide vs homicide vs accidental rates</li>
<li>The type of weapons used in homicides</li>
<li>How demographics impact firearm fatalities</li>
<li>How firearm fatalities compare to other fatalities</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Suicides_Homicides_in_the_United_States"></span>Suicides &amp; Homicides in the United States<span></span></h2>
<p>First, it is also important to highlight just how small the number of firearm related homicides really are, when compared to all deaths. On average, the total (suicide, homicide &amp; accidental) number of firearm related fatalities account for about 1.33% of all deaths in the United States (firearm related homicides account for ~0.44% of all deaths) and it varies wildly between states.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important item to discuss is the “<em>firearm fatality rate</em>“, often conflated with the “<em>firearm homicide rate</em>” by political pundits. While all fatalities are unfortunate, most American’s would argue there is a different between <em>suicides</em> and <em>homicides</em>. Some states, such as Washington, support medically assisted suicides (for the terminally ill).</p></div></article></div>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>After a very, very long delay, here comes finally another development report about the <a href="https://github.com/yorikvanhavre/BIM_Workbench">BIM tools</a> for <a href="https://www.freecadweb.org/">FreeCAD</a>. Awfully sorry about the black-out during these last months, lots of things <a href="https://www.rtbf.be/info/regions/liege/detail_circuit-de-spa-francorchamps-80-millions-d-investissements-et-le-retour-de-la-moto?id=10604892">happened</a> (all the 3D&amp;BIM done with FreeCAD and Blender) and  of course the pandemic didn't ease things either. Anyway, that doesn't mean nothing happened on the FreeCAD front, on the contrary, bugs still get addressed, things get fin-tuned, ideas get discussed, and FreeCAD gets everyday better.</p>
<p>This last month we also had a hectic turnover, because Autodesk changed the terms of the free version of  their <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview">Fusion360</a>. There is a full load of new limitations that restrain much the use for personal/hobby users. For example, the g-code you export from Fusion360 to CNC machines (that cut objects out of a block of material), is now making the machine running slower (and therefore raising the production costs), for no apparent reason other than nagging the users into buying a subscription. As a result, we saw a massive migration of users to FreeCAD, and it's really thrilling to see people discovering FreeCAD and learning it and liking it.</p>
<p>Thanks once more to everybody who contributes to my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/yorikvanhavre">Patreon</a> or <a href="https://liberapay.com/yorik/">Liberapay</a> campaigns, I'm really grateful you guys didn't just drop me away when I fail to write for 3 months.</p>
<p>Also, for who didn't notice, FreeCAD now has a proper <a href="https://liberapay.com/FreeCAD/">Liberapay teams account</a> where all money received is divided equally between the FreeCAD developers registered there (currently 7). This account has seen a huge raise of donations these last weeks (it receives around 1000 USD/month at the moment), thanks to the flow of new ex-Fusion360 users, and the impressive job Kunda1 is doing on <a href="https://twitter.com/FreeCADNews">the official FreeCAD twitter account</a> (subscribe to it if you are a twitter user, that account used to be just a mirror of the FreeCAD Facebook page, but is now very, very well maintained) and the campaigning of other people (special thanks to my <a href="https://www.twitter.com/beatnikqueen">girlfriend</a>, the most awesome person in the world).</p>
<p>So, no more loitering, to the news! Here is what we got this month:</p>
<h3>Customizable section color</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-02.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Arch_SetMaterial">Materials</a> now have a new <strong>Section Color</strong> property, which allows to give a different color when the material is viewed and when it is cut through. So for example you can now have your walls appear white when viewed, but black when cut and seen on a TechDraw page.</p>
<p>This is a small improvement so far, but it laid the structure to have more advanced things, such as supporting hatch patterns. The main problem for this, is that, although the SVG format has an excellent support for hatch patterns (anything can become a hatch pattern, even bitmap images), the Qt implementation of the SVG format lacks support for it (it has its own <a href="https://doc.qt.io/Qt-5/qbrush.html#details">system</a> but it's not very practical to make that compatible with SVG). Therefore at the moment we have no clear idea of how to go further.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/TechDraw_Module">TechDraw</a>'s implementation of hatch patterns internally recreates OpenCasCade geometry, which works very well but might be heavy for large BIM models. In any case, that's a track I'm <a href="https://github.com/yorikvanhavre/FreeCAD/tree/td-makedrawgeomhatch">exploring</a> too.</p>
<h3>Default windows are now openable</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-03.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Another very small fix, but the default door and windows created with the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Arch_Window">Door and windows tools</a> now have a hinge edge defined, so their <strong>Opening</strong> property now works out-of-the-box. It might not open in the direction you want, though, so you might still need to tweak this. But next items on my list are adding a couple of controls to easily switch opening directions.</p>
<h3>Default pattern size option</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-04.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The Draft patterns system is now working again (hatch patterns can be added to all closed Draft objects such as rectangles, polylines, circles, etc). I also added a preferences option under <em>Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Draft -&gt; Visual settings</em> to set a default hatch pattern scale, which is useful when you always work with objects of a similar size range, for example building plans. I still have to experiment a bit (0.0025 seems like a very good default setting for BIM), but will add that to the BIM setup screen once I found a couple of good settings.</p>
<h3>Section plane label</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-05.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Arch_SectionPlane">Section planes</a> now have a <strong>Show Label</strong> property, which, when turned on, show the section plane label on the plane in the 3D view. This is useful to easily identify these section planes when there are many in your document. The text size currently depends on the arrow size, but I'll make all this better customizable later on.</p>
<p>We have further plans too for the section planes, such as be able to double-click or activate them somehow, and find yourself in a separate 2D view with all needed geometry cut or turned off, where you can still work on the model in a 2D environment. This would be a bit like an intermediary step between the full 3D model and a TechDraw view. You can see a first draft of that coded by Carlo Pavan on the experimental tools palette in the BIM workbench.</p>
<h3>TechDraw tools in BIM workbench</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-06.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Among the annotation tools on the BIM workbench, you'll now find two TechDraw tools, <strong>Create page</strong> and <strong>Create view</strong>. The first one is the same of the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/TechDraw_PageTemplate">Create page from template</a> TechDraw tool, except that it remembers the last template you used and gets you right there when you use the tool again, so it gives a little bit faster workflow. The second tool is currently the same as the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/TechDraw_ArchView">TechDraw ArchView tool</a> but I plan to make it a bit more flexible in the future so it would become a mix of TechDraw's ArchView and DraftView tools, depending on the selected objects.</p>
<h3>TSV export</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Arch_Schedule">Schedule</a> tool has been extended to now allow to export results to the .tsv (Tab-Separated Values) format, which is basically the same as the .csv (Comma-Separated Values) format, but using tab characters to separate columns, instead of commas. The big problem of csv, of course, is if there are commas in the columns texts. Usually spreadsheet apps are pretty tolerant with .csv files, they will usually ask you what character to consider as column separator on import, but others (for example GitHub) doesn't display them correctly if they don't use a comma as separator. So from now on there is a correct way to please everybody <i></i></p>
<h3>Blender exporter upgrade</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-07.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/yorikvanhavre/029f6fcce9f4d0e62fb6163804b7f80d">FreeCAD exporter for Blender</a> has seen several small fixes, it now automatically adds the .FCStd extension to the generated file if you haven't added it yourself, it now correctly handles object rotation and scaling, and it applies modifiers before exporting. It now also supports faceless objects (wireframe objects).</p>
<p>This coupled with the <a href="https://blenderbim.org/">BlenderBIM</a> improvements, it now becomes increasingly easy to work on BIM models in Blender, or parts of BIM models, and when needed, integrate everything seamlessly in FreeCAD. There are many more joint FreeCAD/Blender developments going on, such as the new <a href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?style=4&amp;t=51069&amp;p=438881">Sverchok nodes</a> that use FreeCAD internally, literally creating a kind of new interface for FreeCAD withing Blender.</p>
<h3>Detect and suggest development version</h3>
<p>The BIM workbench will now detect your FreeCAD version on the setup screen, and suggest you to install a development version if you are not using one. This will help people to be aware of the existence of development versions, and become more used to them and how to install and mange them.</p>
<h3>Grid extension setting in Working Plane panel</h3>
<p>The overall size of the grid is now settable directly from the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Draft_SelectPlane">Working Plane</a> task panel.</p>
<h3>Multiple custom folders on start page</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-08.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Start_Workbench">start page</a> can now show multiple custom folders. To achieve that, go to the start page preferences under menu <em>Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Start</em> and instead of choosing one custom folder, type manually several folder paths, separated by ;;</p>
<p>For example: <code>/home/yorik;;/home/yorik/Examples;;/home/yorik/FreeCAD/Examples</code></p>
<h3>Image Plane scaling</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-09.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Draft_Scale">Draft Scale</a> tool now support image planes created with the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Image_Module">Image workbench</a>. So it is now easy to import reference images such as scanned floor plans, position them on a common reference point, and scale them to the desired size.</p>
<h3>Unit and Show Unit in Draft dimension preferences</h3>
<p>You can now set default value for these two settings under <em>Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Draft -&gt; Dimensions and Texts</em>, that will affect all newly created dimensions.</p>
<h3>Manual upgrade</h3>
<p>And last but not least, I started upgrading the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Manual">manual</a> to FreeCAD 0.19, and this time I intend well to produce a printed book with it. To be continued!</p>
<p>That's it for this month I guess, I promise to do everything I can to resume posting once per month!</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Yorik</p>

<p>As a consultant I support my customers with their Jenkins issues since the beginning of 2017.
And almost from the start it was some kind of "as code" approach.
The experience I gained during that time resulted in getting myself involved in the development of Configuration as Code Plugin for Jenkins.
I consider becoming a part of Jenkins Community one of the most valuable experiences in my career so far.
I appreciate how much I have learned and how welcoming the community is.</p>
<p>I am not a very active contributor these days, at least when it comes to code, but what I have to offer is rather extensive experience
with Jenkins end users - from small, single instance setups to environments with hundreds of controllers run in a different way on different operating systems.
Every day I see pains those users go through, I know what issues they are facing and which features they consider valuable or missing.
As a Jenkins Governance Board Member I can represent those users.</p>
<p>Thanks to my involvement in Configuration as Code Plugin development
I had a chance to deliver a number of public presentations
where I focused on the benefits of the solution and tried to make it easier for newcomers to try it.
Here are a few examples of my activities related to Jenkins Configuration as Code:
<a href="https://www.praqma.com/stories/start-jenkins-config-as-code/">blogpost</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DwTzljM-EDjI">cdCON presentation</a>,
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4beEdOeirazc65AdEARIOM?si%3DY63V4gBDT02_UBMQ3vahvg">podcast recording</a>.
So my focus is not only on representing users but also on educating them, and educating myself,
so I actually know what they need and why.</p>

<p>I started to use Jenkins back in 2008, when it still had a different name.
In 2011 I started to contribute and created my first little plugin called
<a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/extra-columns/">extra-columns</a>.
Since then, using and administering Jenkins servers has become a major part of my work life,
while getting involved with the Jenkins community
kickstarted my interest and involvement with open source software and communities.</p>
<p>I’ve been working as a release engineer at the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse Foundation</a>&nbsp;since 2016,
supporting 250+ Jenkins instances for various open source projects.
I’d be honored to bring a user and admin oriented perspective to the Governance Board and help
shape the future of Jenkins.</p>

<p>Affiliations: Eclipse Foundation</p>

<div>
<h3 id="gavin-mogan"><a href="#gavin-mogan"></a>Gavin Mogan</h3>
<p>I got started with Jenkins early on when I was just getting started with testing.
I knew there had to be a way to run the tests automatically and report on them back to people.
I started hacking my own tools before I came across Jenkins (then Hudson) and was hooked ever since.
Over the years I’ve managed to install and configure Jenkins at various jobs,
and even was employed making internal and external plugins and integrations.
You’ll often find me on the Jenkins IRC and Gitter channels as well as the subreddit giving a hand to people who are stuck.
I also try to get involved with Jenkins Infrastructure projects as much as I can.
I currently maintain the plugin site, plugin site API, Jenkins Wiki exporter, and a bunch of other minor projects.
I also help run Vancouver’s chapter of Nodeschool.</p>
<p>If elected, I would like to address improving commercial support avenues.
Right now it’s a lot of people flailing in isolation.
I would like to not only improve things so people can find easier ways to get help,
but also encourage more users to help others, and push for a
centralized source of companies providing commercial support.</p>

<h3 id="justin-harringa"><a href="#justin-harringa"></a>Justin Harringa</h3>
<p>The nomination is quite an honor for me.
I have been a Hudson/Jenkins user since around 2009/2010 when
I started working through driving continuous integration in a corporate environment at John Deere.
As time went on, I began contributing some small fixes to plugins such as the Job DSL Plugin, OpenID Plugin, and the Workflow Job Plugin.
Eventually, I ended up helping maintain Salesforce’s Chatter plugin and then open sourcing plugins such as the Config-Driven Pipeline Plugin with Andrey Falko.
More recently, I have also had the extreme pleasure of mentoring in 2 Jenkins projects for Google Summer of Code
(Multi-branch Pipeline support for Gitlab in 2019 and Git Plugin Performance Improvements in 2020).</p>
<p>I have learned so much from working with Jenkins and I would love to give back to the project further.
Having introduced Jenkins at both small and large companies,
I would love to help contribute to the direction of the project through the Roadmap/SIGs/JEPs and encourage others to also contribute / improve Jenkins.</p>

<p>Affiliations: Salesforce, Spinnaker SIG for Azure</p>

<h3 id="mark-waite"><a href="#mark-waite"></a>Mark Waite</h3>
<p>I’m a Jenkins contributor, a member of the Jenkins core team,
one of the leaders of the Platform Special Interest Group,
and leader of the Documentation Special Interest Group.
I’ve served as the Jenkins Documentation Officer since 2019.
I was a mentor for Google Season of Code 2020 and am one of the maintainers of the Git plugin for Jenkins.</p>
<p>If elected and allowed to serve on the Jenkins Board, I’ll work to increase community involvement and community development.
I’m deeply interested in tooling and environments that support the Jenkins project,
including the Jenkins CI environments, issue tracker, artifact repository, and source code repositories.</p>

<h3 id="marky-jackson"><a href="#marky-jackson"></a>Marky Jackson</h3>
<p>I have been involved in the Jenkins project for many years.
I started out as a plugin maintainer, SIG member and general helper.
I moved to a SIG lead, speakers and Google Summer of Code and Docs org admin and mentor.
My current goals are to help continue the work of the public roadmap as well and gain most community members by continuing to be a champion of the community.</p>
<p>For me, being on the Jenkins Board is another opportunity to improve upon the great work
we have all done as well as work toward branching out our efforts to have more women, people of color and LGBTQIA members.
I would be honored to have this opportunity.</p>

<p>Affiliations: OpsMx, Continuous Delivery Foundation, Kubernetes, Ortelius, Spinnaker</p>

<h3 id="steven-terrana"><a href="#steven-terrana"></a>Steven Terrana</h3>
<p>I have been a Jenkins user since 2017 and contributor since 2018.
I am the primary maintainer of the Jenkins Templating Engine,
a plugin that allows users to create truly templated Jenkins pipelines that can be shared across teams.
Through that work, I’ve had the great pleasure of helping to organize the Pipeline Authoring Special Interest Group,
contributing to the Jenkins Pipeline documentation, and contributing bug fixes to various plugins
(including the pipeline plugin and workflow-cps library).</p>
<p>As a Continuous Delivery Foundation Ambassador,
I’ve enjoyed doing what I can to advance the community’s approach to CI/CD and simplifying DevSecOps adoption within large organizations.
It would be a privilege to serve on the Jenkins Governance Board and offer my support wherever I can.</p>

<p>Three years ago I joined the Jenkins community.
I learned a lot during the process of contributing.
I even became a Jenkins hero in my city.
The most exciting thing I want to do is help more new users of Jenkins get started, and let more contributors feel comfortable.
I always love to host a JAM no matter if it’s online or offline.</p>
<p>Plans: improve the experience of using Jenkins in different
countries; reorganize the knowledge of Jenkins, for example the tutorial
by text or video format; help other SIG leaders to organize meetings.</p>

            <p>"What should I do for lunch? Too lazy to get take-out, no clean dishes to cook."</p><p>"If the amazon delivery gets here during a meeting, should I excuse myself? Or, switch off video."</p><p>"I need to take a break, and have enough time to play one game of FIFA."</p><p>"How the hell is she so motivated and well dressed every day? I can hardly get out of bed and brush my teeth before the first meeting."</p><p>"I am tired already, will anyone notice if I log off at 2 PM?"</p><p>👆 is a snapshot of the thoughts I've had in the last 30+ weeks of work from home. The actual list is much longer, but let's not go there.</p><p>For almost six weeks now, I have felt that my productivity is lesser than what it was earlier. But the thing with productivity is that there is no scientific measure for it, nor is there a universal scale to determine how productive is productive enough for a superstar PM. (Yes, I think of myself as a superstar PM 😛)</p><p>To give some meaning to the said feeling, I decided to investigate further.</p><p>The goal was to design a system to measure my productivity, identify factors that negatively affect it and develop a method to keep it high.</p><p>TLDR:</p><ol><li>My mood at the end of the workday is a representation of how productive I was on that day - &nbsp;good mood equals a highly productive day. A low <em>task completion rate</em> and <em>high task completion time</em> negatively affected my productivity and my mood.</li><li>I lose focus more easily working from home than working from the office. This has a direct impact on the completion rate and completion time. I, then, identified the triggers that lead me to lose focus. [Read questions at the top.]</li><li>I researched productivity hacks and shortlisted the ones that I think could work for me.</li></ol><p>Deep dive:</p><h2 id="how-to-measure-productivity">How to measure productivity?</h2><p>There is no easy way for me to estimate productivity objectively. And that doesn't worry me. So I chose to limit the measures to subjective criteria like work-related mood and a sense of achievement at the end of the day.</p><p>I am the only one measuring my productivity. There are no external persons who can influence the measurement. Most importantly, I have no incentive to cheat or to justify it to anyone. Hence, this system works. It helps me track directional changes to productivity. As long as I am progressing in the right direction, I am happy.</p><h2 id="why-do-i-lose-focus-more-often-at-home-vs-the-office">Why do I lose focus more often at home vs the office?</h2><p>There are too many variables at home. [Read questions at the top.]</p><p>There is no standard start and end to my day. I start 15 minutes before my first meeting and only stop when I am exhausted. Not having an end time makes me more lenient about micro deadlines. And that leniency triggers the part of the brain which prefers getting distracted.</p><p>This was very different in a physical office.</p><ul><li><strong>The 20-minute commute to the office</strong> helped me prepare for my day, and the commute back helped me unwind and shutdown. The commute primed me to switch on and off, with enough prep time on both ends. The only commute I have now is from the bathroom to the living room.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.justanotherpm.com/content/images/2020/10/image-11.png" alt=""></figure><ul><li><strong>Grabbing a coffee and partaking in random kitchen chats</strong> provided me with much required breaks. And the one guy who is always eager to return to work motivated me to do the same.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.justanotherpm.com/content/images/2020/10/image-10.png" alt=""></figure><ul><li><strong>Working with others around me created positive peer pressure, </strong>which helped me focus and do more.</li><li><strong>Physically stepping out of the office</strong> helped me close one - and start the next - chapter of the day.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.justanotherpm.com/content/images/2020/10/image-14.png" alt=""></figure><ul><li><strong>Seeing people leave the office earlier than me </strong>signalled that the end is near, and I should start wrapping up my day.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.justanotherpm.com/content/images/2020/10/image-15.png" alt=""></figure><h2 id="how-am-i-increasing-my-productivity-at-home">How am I increasing my productivity at home?</h2><p>I am sharing ten methods to increase productivity during WFH. I divided them into two lists: first includes the tried and tested methods. The second list contains methods that I am yet to try.</p><h3 id="tried-and-tested-methods-">Tried and tested methods:</h3><ul><li><strong>The </strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique"><strong>Pomodoro Technique</strong></a><strong> </strong>works miracles for me. I highly recommend it. I am more efficient with my tasks when there is a timer counting down. For those who are not aware - the Pomodoro Technique is a time management method. It breaks down work into intervals of 25 minutes in length. Each interval, known as the Pomodoro, is separated by a short break (typically of 5 minutes).</li><li>I am not fond of being late. Ever. I use that to my advantage by <strong>creating and advertising time-bound goals</strong>. For example, suppose the engineers need a document by Friday. In that case, I commit (in front of the entire team) to deliver it by Wednesday. The ambition to fulfil my commitments keeps me focused for longer periods of time.</li><li><strong>Having something to look forward to at the end of the day</strong> keeps me efficient all day. I play football on Wednesday evenings, and miraculously I am the most productive on Wednesdays.</li><li><strong>A comfortable home office is quintessential. </strong>The most important part of the home office - something that I learned the hard way - is a comfortable chair. If you don't already have one, buy one right now. Thank me later.</li><li><strong>Keep your home office organized and clean</strong>. Cluttered and messy workspaces are a real motivation killer.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.justanotherpm.com/content/images/2020/10/WhatsApp-Image-2020-10-30-at-9.18.21-PM.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.justanotherpm.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/WhatsApp-Image-2020-10-30-at-9.18.21-PM.jpeg 600w, https://blog.justanotherpm.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/WhatsApp-Image-2020-10-30-at-9.18.21-PM.jpeg 1000w, https://blog.justanotherpm.com/content/images/2020/10/WhatsApp-Image-2020-10-30-at-9.18.21-PM.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>My home office setup.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Shutting my laptop's lid at the end of the day</strong> is a simple yet effective technique.

October 31, 2020 | https://www.dampfkraft.com/ghost-characters.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dampfkraft.com/ghost-characters.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 1978 Japan's <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B5%8C%E6%B8%88%E7%94%A3%E6%A5%AD%E7%9C%81">Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry</a>
established the encoding that would later be known as JIS X 0208, which still
serves as an important reference for all Japanese encodings. However, after the
JIS standard was released people noticed something strange - several of the
added characters had no obvious sources, and nobody could tell what they meant
or how they should be pronounced. Nobody was sure where they came from. These
are what came to be known as the ghost characters
(<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B9%BD%E9%9C%8A%E6%96%87%E5%AD%97">幽霊文字</a>).</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/a824aa10/ghostcanvas.jpg"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/a824aa10/img/ghostcanvas.jpg.l.jpg"></a><figcaption>Be careful what you write. <a href="http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/1312837">via the NDL</a>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>For a long time the ghost characters remained an unexplained and mostly
forgotten curiosity, but in 1997 an investigation was launched to discover
where they had come from.  While all characters in the JIS standard were
supposed to have a record of their sources, even when it existed it
wasn't very specific, typically just listing the document it was sourced from.</p>
<p>You'd think that listing the source would make tracking down the origins of the
characters easy, but it's important to clarify what counts as a "source" - one
of the more common sources for the ghost characters was the "Overview of
National Administrative Districts" (国土行政区画総覧), a comprehensive list of
place names in Japan. You might, as I initially did, imagine this to be a kind
of atlas, an oversize book with at most a few hundred pages. It turns out the
<a href="http://kokudo.or.jp/books/index.html">latest edition</a> is a seven volume set
with each volume having roughly nine hundred pages. Imagine tracking down a
single character without a page reference.</p>
<p>Despite the difficulty, the investigation into the ghost characters was
successful in discovering their origins - mostly. By interviewing the
catalogers involved in the creation of the standard, the investigators
established that some characters were inadvertently invented as mistakes in the
cataloging process. For example, 妛 was an error introduced while trying to
record "山 over 女". "山 over 女" occurs in the name of a particular place and
was thus suitable for inclusion in the JIS standard, but because they couldn't
print it as one character yet, 山 and 女 were printed separately, cut out, and
pasted onto a sheet of paper, and then copied. When reading the copy, the line
where the two little pieces of paper met looked like a stroke and was added to
the character by mistake. The original character
(<a href="https://ja.wiktionary.org/wiki/%F0%A1%9A%B4">𡚴</a>) was not added to JIS or
Unicode until much later and doesn't display on most sites for me.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/a824aa10/yuureimoji.png"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/a824aa10/img/yuureimoji.png.l.png"></a><figcaption>The core ghost characters: 妛挧暃椦槞蟐袮閠駲墸壥彁
</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the end only one character had neither a clear source nor any historical
precedent: 彁. The most likely explanation is that it was created as a
misreading of the 彊 character, but no specific incident was uncovered.</p>
<p>Following the general adoption of the JIS standards these characters all made
their way into Unicode, which has its own <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK%E7%B5%B1%E5%90%88%E6%BC%A2%E5%AD%97#%E5%B9%BD%E9%9C%8A%E6%BC%A2%E5%AD%97">separate set of ghost
characters</a>
introduced during CJK unification.</p>
<p>To sum up - in 1978 a series of small mistakes created some characters out of
nothing. The errors went undiscovered just long enough to be set in stone, and
now these ghosts are, at least in potential, a part of every computer on the
planet, lurking in the dark corners of character tables.</p>
<p>At this rate they'll presumably be with humanity forever. Ψ</p>

            <p>This is a new way to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. It’s <em>bad</em>. You shouldn’t use it if you have any other option.</p>

<p>If you want a little bit of a puzzle, here is the system as a plot:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/convert/convert.png" alt="conversion as lines"></p>

<p>Did you figure it out? Here’s the system in words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the numbers 4, 16, and 28, transposing digits switches from Celsius from Fahrenheit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want even more explanation, here’s the system as a diagram:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/convert/transpose.png" alt="conversion as transposition"></p>

<p>It’s a coincidence that these conversion points exist. It’s an even greater coincidence that they divide the range of temperatures in a convenient way.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Range in C</th>
      <th>Range in F</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Less than 4°C</td>
      <td>Less Than 40°F</td>
      <td>Cold</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Between 4°C and 16°C</td>
      <td>Between 40°F and 61°F</td>
      <td>Cool</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Between 16°C and 28°C</td>
      <td>Between 61°F and 82°F</td>
      <td>Warm</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>More than 28°C</td>
      <td>More than 82°F</td>
      <td>Hot</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>As an example, suppose you are familiar with Celsius and don’t know how to interpret 71°F. Since this is around halfway between 61°F and 82°F you know it is also about halfway between 16°C and 28°C.</p>



<p><strong>Question:</strong> Did you lie a little bit about the numbers?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, but by less than 1°F.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Don’t I have to remember “4, 16, 28”?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. But it’s not that hard! You have 4, then 4 + 12, and 4 + 12 + 12.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Isn’t this a bad system for me, smart person who can easily calculate F=(9/5)C + 32 and C=(5/9)(F - 32) in my head?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> How do I use this system to convert other temperatures?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> You don’t.</p>

I came back from University, sat down to write in my daily journal, and picked up my pen. I stared at the blank page with a sense of impending doom. Writer's block. It was here. For so long, I had evaded its dark clutches, but it had caught up to me. I knew one day it would.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Writer's block.

Welcome to writer's block.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How to Overcome Writer's Block?</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I remember going to the gym, going to the park, and even going to a nearby swamp to watch little frogs jump around.

My ink had dried. It seemed I would never be able to write. I had forgotten my language.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Overcoming writer's block is providential.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    
    

    <div>
      <p>This <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/64371281/4082052">stackoverflow Q&amp;A</a> got me thinking about various ways to construct a solution in <code>GNU sed</code> if lookarounds are needed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/info.svg" alt="info"> Only single line (with newline as the line separator) processing is presented here. Equivalent lookaround syntax with <code>grep -P</code> or <code>perl</code> is also shown for comparison. Cases where multiple lines and/or ASCII NUL characters are present in the pattern space is left as an exercise.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="filtering">Filtering<a href="#filtering" aria-label="Anchor link for: filtering">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Here, you only need to decide whether the input line has to be matched or not. <code>sed</code> supports grouping commands inside <code>{}</code> that should be executed only if a filtering condition is matched. The condition could be negated by adding a <code>!</code> character. In this way, you can emulate chaining of multiple positive and/or negative lookaround conditions.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ cat items.txt
</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>
apple=</span><span>50 </span><span>;per kg
a,b,c,d
;foo xyz3

</span><span># filter lines containing a digit character followed by a ; character
# lookaround isn't needed here
# same as: grep '[0-9].*;' or grep -P '\d(?=.*;)'
</span><span>$ sed </span><span>-</span><span>n </span><span>'/[0-9].*;/p'</span><span> items.txt
apple=</span><span>50 </span><span>;per kg

</span><span># filter lines containing both digit and ; characters in any order
# same as: grep -P '^(?=.*;).*\d'
</span><span>$ sed </span><span>-</span><span>n </span><span>'/;/{ /[0-9]/p }'</span><span> items.txt
apple=</span><span>50 </span><span>;per kg
;foo xyz3

</span><span># filter lines containing both digit and ; characters
# but not if the line also contains character a
# same as: grep -P '^(?!.*a)(?=.*;).*\d'
</span><span>$ sed </span><span>-</span><span>n </span><span>'/a/!{ /;/{ /[0-9]/p } }'</span><span> items.txt
;foo xyz3
</span></code></pre>
<p>For some cases, multiple condition check like the previous examples is not enough. For example, filter a line if it contains <code>par</code> as long as <code>cart</code> isn't present later in the line. Presence of <code>cart</code> earlier in the line shouldn't affect the outcome. In such cases, you can first change the input line to add a newline character wherever <code>cart</code> is present and then construct a condition such that it depends on the newline character instead of <code>cart</code>. If a match is found, delete all the newline characters and then print the line.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ s=</span><span>'par carted spare cart park city'

</span><span># same as: grep -P 'par(?!.*cart)'
</span><span>$ echo </span><span>"$s" </span><span>|</span><span> sed </span><span>-</span><span>n </span><span>'s/cart/\n&amp;/g; /par[^\n]*$/{ s/\n//g; p }'</span><span>
par carted spare cart park city
</span></code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/info.svg" alt="info"> Newline is a safe character to choose for default line by line processing, as <code>sed</code> removes it from the pattern space. If you are processing a pattern space that contains newline character (for example: <code>-z</code> option, <code>N</code> command, etc), then you can still perform this trick as long as you know a character that is guaranteed to be absent from the input data. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="substitution">Substitution<a href="#substitution" aria-label="Anchor link for: substitution">🔗</a></h2>
<p>In previous section, you saw how to modify input line with newline character to make it easier to construct a lookaround condition. This trick comes in handy for substitution as well. However, for search and replace cases, you also need to emulate zero-width nature of lookarounds. To achieve this, you can make use of <code>t</code> command to construct a loop that performs substitution as long as a match is found. See my chapter on <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_gnused/control-structures.html">Control structures</a> for more details about branching commands in <code>GNU sed</code>.</p>
<p>Here's an example of looping. Aim is to delete <code>fin</code> from the given input recursively.</p>
<pre><code><span># manual repetition, assuming count is known
</span><span>$ echo </span><span>'coffining' </span><span>|</span><span> sed </span><span>'s/fin//'</span><span>
cofing
$ echo </span><span>'coffining' </span><span>|</span><span> sed </span><span>'s/fin//; s///'</span><span>
cog

</span><span># :loop marks the 's' command with label 'loop'
# tloop will jump to label 'loop' as long as the substitution succeeds
</span><span>$ echo </span><span>'coffining' </span><span>|</span><span> sed </span><span>':loop s/fin//; tloop'</span><span>
cog
</span></code></pre><h3 id="negative-lookarounds">Negative lookarounds<a href="#negative-lookarounds" aria-label="Anchor link for: negative-lookarounds">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Some cases can be solved by performing substitution only if a condition is first satisfied. Note that <code>{}</code> grouping is optional here.</p>
<pre><code><span># same as: perl -ne 'print if s/^(?!;).*?\K[ ,].*//'
</span><span>$ sed </span><span>-</span><span>n </span><span>'/^;/! s/[ ,].*//p'</span><span> items.txt
</span><span>1</span><span>
apple=</span><span>50</span><span>
a
</span></code></pre>
<p>Change <code>foo</code> to <code>[baz]</code> only if it is not followed by a digit character. Note that <code>foo</code> at the end of string also satisfies this assertion. <code>foofoo</code> has two matches as the assertion is zero-width in nature, i.e. it doesn't consume characters. Here, the first step is inserting a newline character between <code>foo</code> and a digit character. Then change all <code>foo</code> to <code>[baz]</code> as long as it is at the end of string or if it isn't followed by a newline character. Once the loop ends, remove all the newline characters.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ s=</span><span>'hey food! foo42 foot5 foofoo'

</span><span># same as: perl -pe 's/foo(?!\d)/[baz]/g'
</span><span>$ echo </span><span>"$s" </span><span>|</span><span> sed </span><span>-</span><span>E </span><span>'s/(foo)([0-9])/\1\n\2/g;
                      :a s/foo([^\n]|$)/[baz]\1/; ta;
                      s/\n//g'</span><span>
hey [baz]d! foo42 [baz]t5 [baz][baz]
</span></code></pre>
<p>Change <code>foo</code> to <code>[baz]</code> only if it is not preceded by <code>_</code> character. <code>foo</code> at the start of string is matched as well.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ s=</span><span>'foo _foo 42foofoo'

</span><span># same as: perl -pe 's/(?&lt;!_)foo/[baz]/g'
</span><span>$ echo </span><span>"$s" </span><span>|</span><span> sed </span><span>-</span><span>E </span><span>'s/(_)(foo)/\1\n\2/g;
                      :a s/(^|[^\n])foo/\1[baz]/; ta;
                      s/\n//g'
</span><span>[baz] _foo </span><span>42</span><span>[baz][baz]
</span></code></pre>
<p>Replace <code>par</code> with <code>[xyz]</code> as long as <code>s</code> character is not present later in the input. This assumes that the assertion doesn't conflict with the search pattern, for example <code>s</code> will not conflict with <code>par</code> but would affect if it was <code>r</code> and <code>par</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ s=</span><span>'par spare part party'

</span><span># same as: perl -pe 's/par(?!.*s)/[xyz]/g'
</span><span>$ echo </span><span>"$s" </span><span>|</span><span> sed </span><span>-</span><span>E </span><span>'s/s/&amp;\n/g;
                      :a s/par([^\n]*)$/[xyz]\1/; ta;
                      s/\n//g'</span><span>
par s[xyz]e [xyz]t [xyz]ty
</span></code></pre>
<p>Replace all empty fields with <code>NA</code> for csv input (assuming no embedded comma, newline characters, etc).</p>
<pre><code><span>$ s=</span><span>',1,,,two,3,,,'

</span><span># same as: perl -lpe 's/(?&lt;![^,])(?![^,])/NA/g'
</span><span>$ echo </span><span>"$s" </span><span>|</span><span> sed </span><span>-</span><span>E </span><span>':a s/,,/,NA,/g; ta; s/^,/NA,/; s/,$/,NA/'
</span><span>NA</span><span>,</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>NA</span><span>,</span><span>NA</span><span>,two,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>NA</span><span>,</span><span>NA</span><span>,</span><span>NA
</span></code></pre>
<p>Replace if <code>go</code> is not there between <code>at</code> and <code>par</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ s=</span><span>'fox,cat,dog,parrot,dot,park,go,spare'

</span><span># same as: perl -pe 's/at((?!go).)*par/[xyz]/'
</span><span>$ echo </span><span>"$s" </span><span>|</span><span> sed </span><span>'s/go/\n&amp;/g; s/at[^\n]*par/[xyz]/; s/\n//g'</span><span>
fox,c[xyz]k,go,spare
</span></code></pre><h3 id="positive-lookarounds">Positive lookarounds<a href="#positive-lookarounds" aria-label="Anchor link for: positive-lookarounds">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Surround fields with <code>[]</code> except first and last fields for csv input (assuming no embedded comma, newline characters, etc). With positive lookaround emulation, the modified string may continue to satisfy the matching condition, resulting in infinite looping. In this example, the fields themselves may contain <code>[]</code> characters, so you cannot use them to prevent infinite loop. The newline character trick comes in handy again.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ s=</span><span>'1,t[w]o,[3],f[ou]r,5'

</span><span># same as: perl -pe 's/(?&lt;=,)[^,]+(?=,)/[$&amp;]/g'
</span><span>$ echo </span><span>"$s" </span><span>|</span><span> sed </span><span>-</span><span>E </span><span>':a s/,([^,\n]+),/,\n[\1],/g; ta; s/\n//g'
</span><span>1</span><span>,[t[w]o],[[</span><span>3</span><span>]],[f[ou]r],</span><span>5
</span></code></pre>
<p>Add space at word boundaries, but not at the start or end of string. Also, don't add space if it is already present. Here, negated character class on space character is enough to emulate the assertion.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ s=</span><span>'total= num1+35*42/num2'

</span><span># same as: perl -lpe 's/(?&lt;=[^ ])\b(?=[^ ])/ /g'
</span><span>$ echo </span><span>"$s" </span><span>|</span><span> sed </span><span>-</span><span>E </span><span>':a s/([^ ])\b([^ ])/\1 \2/; ta;'</span><span>
total </span><span>=</span><span> num1 </span><span>+ </span><span>35 </span><span>* </span><span>42 </span><span>/</span><span> num2
</span></code></pre>
<p>Replace <code>par</code> with <code>[xyz]</code> as long as <code>part</code> occurs as a whole word later in the line. Here, the nature of the modified string itself prevents the possibility of infinite loop.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ s=</span><span>'par spare part party'

</span><span># same as: perl -pe 's/par(?=.*\bpart\b)/[xyz]/g'
</span><span>$ echo </span><span>"$s" </span><span>|</span><span> sed </span><span>-</span><span>E </span><span>':a s/par(.*\bpart\b)/[xyz]\1/; ta'
</span><span>[xyz] s[xyz]e part party
</span></code></pre><h2 id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" aria-label="Anchor link for: summary">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Branching commands and some creative preprocessing of the input can be combined to emulate lookaround assertions in <code>sed</code>. Given that <a href="https://catonmat.net/proof-that-sed-is-turing-complete">Unix utility sed is Turing complete</a>, it's perhaps not a big surprise. Now, please excuse me, I'll be busy reaping points on stackoverflow/unix.stackexchange for this edge case ;)</p>

<p>I have been using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a> since day one, on both client and side projects. It’s an incredibly refreshing way of coding interfaces for Apple devices, but it’s far from being wrinkle-free. The framework’s bold ambitions are sometimes hampered by subpar debugging tools and arcane, seemingly random limitations.</p>
<p>I previously <a href="https://redalemeden.com/blog/2020/this-week-i-learned-24#programming">wrote</a> about a SwiftUI bug that gave me quite a run for my money:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The stack trace isn’t of much help and no amount of view hierarchy tweaks got rid of it entirely. Initially I was under the impression that either my code or one of my external dependencies were doing something horribly wrong, but <a href="https://steipete.com/posts/state-of-swiftui/">this post</a> from Peter Steinberger made me realize that it is a rather widespread issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since I didn’t manage to reproduce it on a particular test device at the time, I assumed it’s yet another simulator quirk. But a little over a month later, the same bug reared its ugly head on a test device. Fun times!</p>
<p>The app in question uses tab navigation where the first tab is always accessible, while the second tab shows different content depending on whether the user is signed in to their account or not. The view code looked roughly like this:</p>
<pre data-language="swift" data-index="0"><code><span><span><span>TabView </span><span>{</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>  </span><span>Home</span><span>()</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>    .tabItem </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>/* ... */</span><span> </span><span>}</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>    .tag </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>/* ... */</span><span> </span><span>}</span></span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> isSignedIn </span><span>{</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>    </span><span>Profile</span><span>()</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>      .tabItem </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>/* ... */</span><span> </span><span>}</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>      .tag </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>/* ... */</span><span> </span><span>}</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>else</span><span> </span><span>{</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>    </span><span>SignIn</span><span>()</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>      .tabItem </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>/* ... */</span><span> </span><span>}</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>      .tag </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>/* ... */</span><span> </span><span>}</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>  </span><span>}</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>}</span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>To avoid the <code>isSignedIn</code> boolean check in multiple modifiers, I opted for an <code>if-else</code> block with separate views and <code>tabItem</code> modifiers.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> Except that didn’t seem to sit right with SwiftUI for some reason. The app launches and displays the content of the first tab exactly as intended. But when I switch tabs—or god forbid, sign in or out—the app crashes with this cryptic error message:</p>
<pre data-language="" data-index="1"><code><span><span>[error] precondition failure: invalid size for indirect attribute: &lt;number&gt; vs &lt;number&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The call stack points exclusively to SwiftUI internals, with the last call referring to a certain <code>AG::Graph</code>—<a href="https://steipete.com/posts/state-of-swiftui/#swiftui-attributegraph-crashes">responsible</a> for holding the view tree and diffing it. As far as debugging goes, this is very, <em>very</em> little to work with.</p>
<p>With my hands tied, I briefly considered resurrecting the <code>UITabBarController</code> wrapper I used prior to WWDC, especially since I didn’t manage to make a reproducible test case or submit a feedback to Apple. At first, I spent an inordinate amount of time tweaking the view hierarchies of the profile and sign-in screens themselves, with varying—and rather inconsistent—levels of success. I ran out of both time and patience, so I moved on to other things to not stall the project any further. Weeks later, I came back to the problematic screen—pitchfork in hand—ready to gut the entire tab navigation and replace it with a custom-made solution. I had had enough.</p>
<p>But then came the proverbial aha moment: what if the conditional check took place <em>inside</em> the second tab, instead of <em>around</em> it?</p>
<pre data-language="swift" data-index="2"><code><span><span><span>TabView </span><span>{</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>  </span><span>Home</span><span>()</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>    .tabItem </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>/* ... */</span><span> </span><span>}</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>    .tag </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>/* ... */</span><span> </span><span>}</span></span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span><span>  </span><span>ProfileOrSignIn</span><span>(</span><span>isSignedIn</span><span>:</span><span> $isSignedIn</span><span>)</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>    .tabItem </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>/* ... */</span><span> </span><span>}</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>    .tag </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>/* ... */</span><span> </span><span>}</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>}</span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>And <em>just</em> like that, the crasher was gone. Squashed into oblivion.</p>
<p>If this sounds dumb, it’s because it is. At no point did the compiler chastise me for doing something I wasn’t supposed to do. And to make matters worse, the documentation doesn’t mention anything related to… wait, what documentation?</p>
<p>It’s a bittersweet feeling when you fix a bug in a non-deterministic, haphazard way. On one hand you are elated you’ve managed to fix it at all. On the other, you feel somewhat powerless and insecure about your ability to handle similar situations in the future. I adore SwiftUI, but moments like these give me a good dose of anticipatory anxiety—the kind that erodes trust and dampen the thrill of being at the bleeding edge.</p>

So that’s very concrete,” he said. <span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><p>“Everyone is enthusiastic. People are thinking this is the light at the end of the tunnel. Let’s go for it,” Levi added.</p><p>Several thousand staff at the University College London Hospitals, which Levi leads, are participating in the Phase 3 study of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Levi himself also got an injection. “I had pain in my arm for two days, muscle pain. Thirty percent of people get a little fever, like the flu. That is why it is also advisable to take paracetamol before vaccination. But the staff are doing well,” he said. “I don’t know anyone who has any major complaints.”</p><p>In the Western world, the pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca and Pfizer are the furthest along in developing a COVID-19 vaccine. Levi said that “everything indicates that these two vaccines have a good immune response against the <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/your-cough-cloud-is-7-to-23-times-larger-when-youre-not-wearing-a-mask/">coronavirus</a> and are safe.”</p><h2>Calculated risks</h2><p>“I don’t think it’s rocket science,” <a href="https://www.ad.nl/wetenschap/doe-niet-zo-krampachtig-en-breng-het-coronavaccin-nu-al-op-de-markt~a1526f7c/">Levi told the newspaper</a>. “AstraZeneca’s Oxford vaccine is now being tested on 50,000 people, and one person has experienced a serious side effect but has also recovered. Contrast that to the many hundreds of people who die every day, to hospitals that are filling up. And the only remedy we have now is shutting down society. Shouldn’t we have the courage to say: we will release it?”<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-box-4"></span></p><p>“You take a certain risk by releasing the vaccine now. But it is a limited, very small risk,” he said. “And you take that because the alternative is much worse. Let’s assume there’s a 1 in 50,000 risk of a serious side effect with the Oxford vaccine. The chance that you will have a traffic accident in the Netherlands is 1 in 1000 per year. Nobody is talking about that. You have to put things in perspective.”</p><p>In the Netherlands, <a href="https://www.government.nl/government/members-of-cabinet/hugo-de-jonge">Health Minster Hugo de Jonge</a> has taken a more cautious approach. He has said that a vaccine is unlikely to become available in the Netherlands before the first months of 2021.</p><p>“If there are images from England of rows of people getting vaccinated,” Levi said, “then I think it will happen everywhere, including in the Netherlands.

<p>I have been a contributor to WordPress since 2014. I serve as Deputy on the Community team, and as team rep for Bock-Editor Enduser documentation team. I am also a roockie contributor on the Gutenberg GitHub repo for WordPress’ block editor. </p>



<p>Earlier this week, Mark Uriane asked me to review a PR, that fixed an issue, I found. It was the first time someone asked me for a review via the GitHub process. I wanted to mark that day and retrace the steps of my Gutenberg GitHub journey.  </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="327" height="231" src="https://icodeforapurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-30-at-11.02.38-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://icodeforapurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-30-at-11.02.38-AM.png 327w, https://icodeforapurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-30-at-11.02.38-AM-300x212.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 327px) 100vw, 327px"></figure></div>



<p>I have not contributed any code to Gutenberg. My first and only Pull Request (PR) was a correction on a handbook file. </p>



<p>This post is for all people, who would like to contribute to Gutenberg, but don’t know how. I want to encourage starting their journey, too. </p>



<p>There is a learning curve on all things Gutenberg on GitHub, mostly because of the Git lingo. Below I started <a href="#glossary">a Glossary.</a> </p>



<h2>Set your GitHub account </h2>



<p>Signing up for GitHub is the easy first step. You can do it <a href="https://github.com/">right on the homepage</a>. I must have started my GitHub account some time in 2012 as my first fork was code from a speaker at <a href="http://ncdevcon.com/">NCDevCon </a>2012</p>



<h2><a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/new/choose">Create issues</a> on Gutenberg</h2>



<p>On January 27, 2018, I filed my <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/4711">first Gutenberg issue(#4711)</a>.  To date, I filed 48 issues, 36 are closed, 12 are still open on this repo. </p>



<p>There are four templates to choose from. Security issue need to go some place else. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="439" src="https://icodeforapurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-11.11.22-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://icodeforapurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-11.11.22-AM.png 700w, https://icodeforapurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-11.11.22-AM-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></figure>



<p>The editor will convert your formatting into Markdown and you can drag and drop screenshots and other graphics into the space. For our company repositories, I have become a fan of the checklist feature. </p>



<p>For demonstrating the issues, I often use videos or animated GIFs, recorded with  <a href="https://recordit.co/">Recordit</a>. </p>



<p>Before we head deeper into the GitHub Journey, here are short description of terms. You can <a href="#pr">skip over it</a>  continue the journey <a href="#pr">here</a></p>



<div><div>
<h2 id="glossary">Glossary</h2>



<p><strong>Git</strong> – Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">(Wikipedia)</a></p>



<p><strong>GitHub</strong> – GitHub, Inc. is an American multinational corporation that provides hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">(Wikipedia)</a></p>



<p><strong>Issues</strong> are bugs or enhancements tickets reported from users, and contributors take on to solve via a specific PR. </p>



<p><strong>Fork </strong>– is a copy of a repository (repo) that is now in your GitHub account, rather than the WordPress account. Here are instructions on <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/contributors/develop/git-workflow/#keeping-your-fork-up-to-date">how to keep your fork in synch</a> with the WordPress repo. </p>



<p><strong>PR is a Pull Request</strong> – contribution to the files in the repo. Issues that resulted into a PR will be closed when the PR is part of a future release. </p>



<p>Once the PR is reviewed, a committer will merge it into the main branch here called “master”. God is that hard not to use any jargon.<em> </em>Let’s unpack this a bit further. </p>



<p><strong>Repo</strong> = short for GitHub repository; the space where all the code of a product, plugin or module lives. </p>



<p><strong>Committer</strong> = contributor who has the rights to merge code from other developers into the main branch </p>



<p><strong>Merge </strong>– workflow to merge new code into the right places with other code. </p>



<p><strong>Review </strong> = a review of the submitted code. The person who submits a PR can mention specific persons to review their submission and comment or approved it for future release.  Sometimes multiple reviewers and reviews are needed to prepare code for a merge into the main branch and to make it into the next release</p>



<p><strong>Main Branch</strong> – That’s where all the code from different contributors comes together and is used to issue new software releases. For the Gutenberg Repo that main branch is called “master”, other WordPress repos named their main branch “trunk”, see also <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentyone">Twenty-Twenty-one Theme</a> repository</p>
</div></div>



<h2 id="pr">Create a Pull Request (PR) </h2>



<p>Creating a PR doesn’t have to be about code. It could also be updates to documentation pages that are tracked in the Gutenberg repository. However, you still need to go <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/contributors/develop/git-workflow/">through the Git Workflow</a> and it can be quite daunting. My one and only PR is from March 12, 2018. I updated a link in the documentation. </p>



<h2>Join the Triage Team </h2>



<blockquote><p>“Triage is the practice of reviewing existing issues and pull requests to make sure they’re relevant, actionable, and have all the information they need. Anyone can help triage, although you’ll need to be a member of the triage team for the Gutenberg repository to modify an issue’s labels or edit its title.”</p><cite><a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/">Block Editor Handbook</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/contributors/">Contributor Guide</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;Triage</cite></blockquote>



<p>On August 14, 2020, I joined the Triage Team for the sole purpose to identify issues and PRs that need consideration for the Block Editor End User Documentation team, lovingly called the 🐝-docs team. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VcwjesspLHt-dTEhuTF74LQ09RB4WWceumlxBFOLaI8/edit#">I  am exploring a whole process for this.</a> </p>



<p>For now, I do not attend triage meetings, and don’t triage issues beyond finding the issues and PRs for “UserDocumentation”. I just don’t have the time to do more. </p>



<h2 id="pr-review">My first PR Review</h2>



<p>Earlier this month, I did a testing sprint on the <a href="https://icodeforapurpose.com/testing-twenty-twenty-one/">Twenty-Twenty-One theme</a>, while I was setting up this site.  </p>



<p>Mark Uraine is a designer at Automattic, WordPress contributor and <a href="https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/">my co-host on the Gutenberg Changelog podcast</a>. He worked on dark styles updates to blocks, so they are better usable on themes with dark backgrounds like this one. <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/26483">On one of his PRs</a>, fixed my issue “<em><a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/26479">Some block features are rendered with invisible ink with dark backgrounds.”</a></em> Columns and Table outlines didn’t have enough contrast to be seen on the dark background. Mark requested a review of his PR to make sure it fixed the issues I was seeing. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="585" height="89" src="https://icodeforapurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-30-at-9.25.01-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://icodeforapurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-30-at-9.25.01-AM.png 585w, https://icodeforapurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-30-at-9.25.01-AM-300x46.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px"><figcaption>Snippet from PR Dark mode UI updates</figcaption></figure>



<p>As mentioned above, that was the first time I had a request for a review, so I needed to find out what I had to do to test a PR. Pull Requests are created in separate branches of the repo. It’s code that hasn’t been released yet and needs to be tested before it merges into the master branch. </p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/25202">Paal Joachim Romdahl wrote good to follow instructions</a> for this next step on my Gutenberg GitHub journey. </p>



<h3>Check out the PR Branch</h3>



<p>I already had a Gutenberg master repo clone on my system. I started with  check out of the PRs branch: <code>git checkout update/dark-mode-for-specific-blocks</code> – this copied the branch (PR) to my local version of gutenberg.</p>



<p>I already went through <code>npm install</code> and <code>npm build</code> and now needed to spin up a WordPress local install. </p>



<h3>Spin up local WordPress environment</h3>



<p>The command <code>npx wp-env start</code> starts a wp-env instance within the Gutenberg folder. It ran into some error. I needed to start <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop">Docker Desktop</a> first. Then it downloaded  WordPress. It was ready for me to test the PR on my local WP development environment site via &nbsp;<strong><a href="http://localhost:8888/">http://localhost:8888/</a></strong>  Just in case, I forget,  use admin/password for WP admin access. </p>



<p>This also had me look up the <a href="https://icodeforapurpose.com/difference-between-npm-and-npx/">difference between npm and npx</a>. </p>



<p>For alternative way to organize the local WordPress environment, <a href="https://michael.blog/2020/06/12/my-gutenberg-setup/">Michael Arestad gives you a detailed insight into his Gutenberg setup</a>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="941" height="202" src="https://icodeforapurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-10.48.42-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://icodeforapurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-10.48.42-AM.png 941w, https://icodeforapurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-10.48.42-AM-300x64.png 300w, https://icodeforapurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-10.48.42-AM-768x165.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 941px) 100vw, 941px"></figure>



<p>Back on GitHub, I added my review comment. Thank God, it doesn’t “count toward mergeability”! I can’t imagine the havoc I could wreak if I had merged capabilities. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="320" height="231" src="https://icodeforapurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-10.48.54-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://icodeforapurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-10.48.54-AM.png 320w, https://icodeforapurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-10.48.54-AM-300x217.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px"></figure>



<p>And there was a checkmark next to my name in the list of reviewers of the PR. Yay. </p>



<h2>Testing Gutenberg from Master branch</h2>



<p>Gutenberg has a bi-weekly release cycle, which mean every two weeks, you get an update of the Gutenberg plugin into your WordPress instance, and if you subscribed to automatic updates, you don’t have to do anything. On Monday, the team prepares a release candidate version and then two days later the new plugin version is released. </p>



<p>Another way to contribute to WordPress and Gutenberg is taking part by testing pre-release versions. Until a couple of weeks ago, testing Gutenberg from the master branch wasn’t easy. </p>



<p>On October 15, 2020, I started a new project on Gutenberg Times to provide a download of the Gutenberg plugin, built from the master branch. </p>







<p>For this project I do the following: </p>



<ul><li>Update my local git branch with changes on the wordpress/gutenberg/master branch <code>git pull</code></li><li>Modify the gutenberg.php file to update the version</li><li>run the build plugin script <strong><code>npm run build:plugin-zip</code></strong></li><li>rename the zip file</li><li>Upload to Gutenberg Times. </li></ul>



<p>I am working with the maintainer for the Beta Tester Plugin, Andy Fragen, on getting this into the plugin update system on WordPress. He also created the <a href="https://github.com/afragen/github-updater">GitHub Updater</a> I will use to implement a proper version control and a mechanism to update existing sites. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_76_f50">

<div><p><span>Every day more and more people adopt <a href="https://www.sourceht.com/intermittent-fasting-what-you-should-know/">intermittent fasting</a> as a weight loss protocol.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Unfortunately, it is not so easy to get rid of old eating habits, which makes us fall into these 3 most common mistakes when practicing intermittent fasting.</span></strong></p>
<h2><strong>1. Starting By Making Very Drastic Changes</strong></h2>
<p>When you decide to incorporate intermittent fasting into your lifestyle, the most important thing is to do it progressively.</p>
<p>Start by avoiding food for 12 hours. Once you have gotten used to it and it is no longer so difficult, add 2 more hours to your fasting window.</p>
<p>The true benefits of intermittent fasting are achieved after the first 16 to 18 hours of fasting. For this reason, the most popular protocol is 16: 8, in which you have 16 hours of fasting followed by 8 hours where food is allowed.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Overeating</strong></h2>
<p>At the start, when your body is not used to intermittent fasting, it will be “asking” you for food. For this reason, it is easy for you to overdo it when it is time for lunch.</p>
<p>One way to avoid this is to take your mealtime slowly, sit still, eat slowly, and enjoy your food without distractions.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Drinking the Wrong Liquids</strong></h2>
<p>Many people think that drinking any type of liquid will not interfere with fasting. This is very far from reality. When fasting, you have to avoid consuming calories completely.</p>
<p>For this reason, during fasting, people drink only water, coffee, or black tea <strong>without milk, cream, or sugar.</strong></p>
<p>Adding any of these extra ingredients breaks the fast, and in the end, are extra calories that you are probably not counting at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Any type of fruit juice contains enough calories to break your fast, especially if they are of the processed ones that you regularly find in the supermarket. Avoid these simple mistakes for the best results from your intermittent fasting program.</p>

<p>I spent over 25 hours building a cut-down version of Sapiens. The goal? Future-me should be happy to read this once future-me forgets how we evolved. It’s massive for a blog post, just under 30 minutes, but that’s the best I could do, condensing 9 hours worth of material.</p>

<p>I’ve tried to keep editing to a minimum: It’s the original text, edited to ensure it still flows like the book.</p>

<p>What caused our brains to develop? We’re not sure.</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem likely. A larger brain needs more energy and thus reduces the chance you’ll survive. Getting more energy meant hunting more.</p>

<p>One contributing factor was the domestication of fire. Fire paved the way for cooking.</p>

<p>Whereas chimpanzees spend 5 hours a day chewing raw food, a single hour suffices for people eating cooked food. The advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time to eating, and to make do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines. Some scholars believe there is a direct link between the advent of cooking, the shortening of the human intestinal track, and the growth of the human brain. Since long intestines and large brains are both massive energy consumers, it’s hard to have both. By shortening the intestines and decreasing their energy consumption, cooking inadvertently opened the way to the jumbo brains.</p>

<p>And, we weren’t alone. Competing with us were the Neanderthals, among other species. They were stronger, they had bigger brains, and they could survive the cold. How come, then, did we “win”?</p>

<p>We aren’t sure. The most likely answer is the very thing that makes the debate possible: Homo sapiens conquered the world thanks above all to its unique language.</p>

<h2 id="cognitive-revolution">Cognitive Revolution</h2>

<p>The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago, constitutes the Cognitive Revolution. What caused it? We’re not sure. The most commonly believed theory argues that accidental genetic mutations changed the inner wiring of the brains of Sapiens, enabling them to think in unprecedented ways and to communicate using a new type of language. We might call it the Tree of Knowledge mutation.</p>

<!-- 
> All new humans are improvements over the past?
> As in, the de facto keeps rising.

>These mutated humans were praised for their initiative and were more successful
>Till everyone became like this and then even more better humans were praised and the previous became the normal -->

<p>What’s special about our language?</p>

<p>Our language is amazingly supple. We can connect a limited number of sounds and signs to produce an infinite number of sentences, each with a distinct meaning. We can thereby ingest, store and communicate a prodigious amount of information about the surrounding world. A monkey can yell to its comrades, ‘Careful! A lion!’ But a modern human can tell her friends that this morning, near the bend in the river, she saw a lion tracking a herd of bison. She can then describe the exact location, including the different paths leading to the area. With this information, the members of her band can put their heads together and discuss whether they ought to approach the river in order to chase away the lion and hunt the bison.</p>

<!-- Most likely, both the gossip theory (who can be trusted and who can't) and the there-is-a-lion-near-the-river theory are valid.  -->

<p>Yet the truly unique feature of our language is not its ability to transmit information about men and lions. Rather, it’s the ability to transmit information about things that do not exist at all. As far as we know, only Sapiens can talk about entire kinds of entities that they have never seen, touched or smelled.</p>

<!-- The alpha male usually wins his position not because he is physically stronger, but because he leads a large and stable coalition -->

<p>Using language, lots of humans could work together, form a tribe, help each other, and hunt together.</p>

<p>However, communicating with lots of people brings with it new co-ordination problems. The critical threshold for a group interacting together is 150 people.</p>

<!-- But once the threshold of 150 individuals is crossed, things can no longer work that way. You cannot run a division with thousands of soldiers the same way you run a platoon. Successful family businesses usually face a crisis when they grow larger and hire more personnel. If they cannot reinvent themselves, they go bust.  -->

<p>How did Homo sapiens manage to cross this critical threshold, eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands of inhabitants and empires ruling hundreds of millions? The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. This is an imagined reality.</p>

<!-- Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens has thus been living in a dual reality. On the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and corporations.  -->

<!-- As time went by, the imagined reality became ever more powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers, trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as gods, nations and corporations. -->

<p>Unlike lying, an imagined reality is something that everyone believes in, and as long as this communal belief persists, the imagined reality exerts force in the world.</p>

<p>In other words, while the behaviour patterns of archaic humans remained fixed for tens of thousands of years, Sapiens could transform their social structures, the nature of their interpersonal relations, their economic activities and a host of other behaviours within a decade or two.</p>

<!-- > Because of the cognitive Revolution and the introduction of imagined reality -->

<p>For example, consider trade. Trade cannot exist without trust, and it is very difficult to trust strangers. The global trade network of today is based on our trust in such fictional entities as the dollar, the Federal Reserve Bank, and the totemic trademarks of corporations. When two strangers in a tribal society want to trade, they will often establish trust by appealing to a common god, mythical ancestor or totem animal.</p>

<!-- One on one, even ten on ten, we are embarrassingly similar to chimpanzees. Significant differences begin to appear only when we cross the threshold of 150 individuals, and when we reach 1,000–2,000 individuals, the differences are astounding -->

<!-- The real difference between us and chimpanzees is the mythical glue that binds together large numbers of individuals, families and groups. This glue has made us the masters of creation. -->

<p>Our Tree of Knowledge mutation was significant. However, it’s not just our biology that brought us where we are today.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Biology sets the basic parameters for the behaviour and capacities of Homo sapiens. The whole of history takes place within the bounds of this biological arena.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This arena is extraordinarily large, allowing Sapiens to play an astounding variety of games. Thanks to their ability to invent fiction, Sapiens create more and more complex games, which each generation develops and elaborates even further</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, in order to understand how Sapiens behave, we must describe the historical evolution of their actions.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<!-- Referring only to our biological constraints would be like a radio sports-caster who, attending the World Cup football championships, offers his listeners a detailed description of the playing field rather than an account of what the players are doing. -->

<!-- There is some evidence that the size of the average Sapiens brain has actually decreased since the age of foraging. Survival in that era required superb mental abilities from everyone. When agriculture and industry came along people could increasingly rely on the skills of others for survival, and new ‘niches for imbeciles’ were opened up. You could survive and pass your unremarkable genes to the next generation by working as a water carrier or an assembly-line worker. -->

<h2 id="agricultural-revolution">Agricultural Revolution</h2>

<p>The currency of evolution is neither hunger nor pain, but rather copies of DNA helixes. Just as the economic success of a company is measured only by the number of dollars in its bank account, not by the happiness of its employees, so the evolutionary success of a species is measured by the number of copies of its DNA. If no more DNA copies remain, the species is extinct, just as a company without money is bankrupt. If a species boasts many DNA copies, it is a success, and the species flourishes. From such a perspective, 1,000 copies are always better than a hundred copies. This is the essence of the Agricultural Revolution: the ability to keep more people alive under worse conditions.</p>

<p>Rather than heralding a new era of easy living, the Agricultural Revolution left farmers with lives generally more difficult and less satisfying than those of foragers. Hunter-gatherers spent their time in more stimulating and varied ways, and were less in danger of starvation and disease. The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest fraud.</p>

<!-- > The average person in Jericho of 8500 BC lived a harder life than the average person in Jericho of 9500 BC or 13,000 BC. But nobody realised what was happening. Every generation continued to live like the previous generation, making only small improvements here and there in the way things were done. Paradoxically, a series of ‘improvements’, each of which was meant to make life easier, added up to a millstone around the necks of these farmers -->
<!-- 
--- Way of life being lost over generations
    Like with the foundation.
    Also short sightedness.
    As, working harder here meant more food => can better feed children => even more people exist => You're back where you started, except you're working harder.
 -->

<p>Compared to foraging, working a bit harder on the farm meant more food. Settling down on the farm also meant greater freedom to reproduce - you’re not travelling all the time, so you can afford to have more children. This in turn, meant a higher population. And a higher population meant higher food requirements. Thus, the farmers were forced to work even harder.</p>

<p>Why didn’t humans abandon farming when the plan backfired? Partly because it took generations for the small changes to accumulate and transform society and, by then, nobody remembered that they had ever lived differently. And partly because population growth burned humanity’s boats. If the adoption of ploughing increased a village’s population from a hundred to 110, which ten people would have volunteered to starve so that the others could go back to the good old times? There was no going back. The trap snapped shut.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and spawn new obligations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This discrepancy between evolutionary success and individual suffering is perhaps the most important lesson we can draw from the Agricultural Revolution. When we study the narrative of plants such as wheat and maize, maybe the purely evolutionary perspective makes sense. Yet in the case of animals such as cattle, sheep and Sapiens, each with a complex world of sensations and emotions, we have to consider how evolutionary success translates into individual experience.</p>

<!-- In the following chapters we will see time and again how a dramatic increase in the collective power and ostensible success of our species went hand in hand with much individual suffering. -->

<!-- How the agricultural revolution led to individual suffering -> -->

<!-- 6: Building Pyramids -->

<!-- This was a far-reaching revolution, whose impact was psychological as much as architectural. Henceforth, attachment to ‘my house’ and separation from the neighbours became the psychological hallmark of a much more self-centered creature. -->

<h3 id="imagined-realities---solving-the-co-ordination-problem">Imagined Realities - Solving the co-ordination problem</h3>

<p>According to the science of biology, people were not ‘created’. They have evolved. And they certainly did not evolve to be ‘equal’. The idea of equality is inextricably intertwined with the idea of creation.</p>

<p>A natural order is a stable order. There is no chance that gravity will cease to function tomorrow, even if people stop believing in it. In contrast, an imagined order is always in danger of collapse, because it depends upon myths, and …</p></div></div>

<article>
  <p>There’s debugging and there’s <em>debugging</em>.
This is a story of the latter.
Before we get into this jaunt I’d like to add that I’ve written this piece to mimic how we actually got to the conclusion.
If you’re experienced in strange stuff you might see a faster route or use a different tool.
There’s more than one way to do most of this and this was what I had at hand when I needed it.</p>

<h2 id="all-stories-start-somewhere">All stories start somewhere</h2>

<p>Some background first.
I’m currently working in a bioinformatics lab that works on the functional identification of proteins.
One of our projects requires that we benchmark against an older tool that performs a similar function.
I’m not going to throw the particular tool under the bus, but needless to say, it’s charming in a way that only academic software can be.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Documentation ranges from “poor” to “nonexistent.”</li>
  <li>It’s held together with an unholy amalgamation of Perl, awk, tsch, and yes, <strong>Fortran</strong>.</li>
  <li>It includes/distributes binaries to other programs that the internet has <em>forgotten</em>.</li>
  <li>Some of the copyright headers are from when I was in elementary school- others before even that.</li>
</ul>

<p>So… “charming.”
A web-based version is available but is limited to how many proteins you can submit (via cgi-bin!) within a 24 hour window (it’s a low number- say ~100) and we need to process well over 100k.
So the naive, innocent question that started this was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Well, can we run it locally?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After all, all the pieces are available for download so it would seem simple enough, right?
You can probably already surmise the answer since you’re reading an article called “extreme debugging.”</p>

<p>I’m going to focus on a small pieces of a much larger puzzle called <code>netNGlyc</code>.
This handy, dandy little program is used to predict <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-linked_glycosylation">N-glycosylation</a> sites in proteins.
It’s distributed as a tarball.
Easy enough!</p>

<p>We can unpack it, and then perform setup by editing its main file <code>netNglyc</code> (written in <code>tsch</code>) by specifying the path to the unpacked dir.
Easy peazy.
And then we run the quick test and…</p>

<p><img src="https://squanderingti.me/img/nGlyc/seg_faults.gif" alt="">
<em>All the segfaults</em></p>

<h2 id="what-process-is-actually-segfaulting">What process is actually segfaulting?</h2>
<p>The entry point into this program is a <code>tsch</code> script that calls numerous additional <code>awk</code> and <code>tsch</code> files.
We have a few options we can try.</p>

<p>If kernel logging is enabled, then <code>dmesg</code> logs might include the offender like the following.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[30590535.213144] how98_Linux[1560171]: segfault at 8000000 ip 00000000080744f7 sp 00000000ffb8a114 error 4 in how98_Linux[8048000+5a000]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A second option, assuming <code>dmesg</code> doesn’t include this or doesn’t help, is to use <code>strace</code>.
If you don’t have much experience with <code>strace</code> and you work on Linux frequently, it’s very much worth your while to learn this tool.
We’re going to use it with <code>-f</code> for “follow process forking” so we can see everything that ends up being called.
We’re also invoking it with <code>-o</code> so we can write the output to a file and go through it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>strace -f -o /tmp/debugging ./netNglyc test/LEUK_RAT.fsa
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then look through the output:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>grep SIGSEGV /tmp/debugging
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Looking for <code>SIGSEGV</code> will show us everywhere a segfault signal was handled.
We’ll hopefully see lines like the following, where the left-most integer is the PID of the process.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1560785 +++ killed by SIGSEGV (core dumped) +++
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we can grep for both the PID and the <code>execve</code> syscall<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> to see what program was launched.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>grep 1560785 /tmp/debugging | grep exec
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Lo and behold:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1560785 execve("/mnt/home/cchandler/ceph/Programs/netNglyc-1.0-broken/how/how98_Linux", ["/mnt/home/cchandler/ceph/Program"...], [/* 89 vars */]) = 0
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="exploring-the-target">Exploring the target</h2>

<p>We have our culprit.
It’s whatever <code>how98_Linux</code> is.
First question: what exactly is it?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ file how98_Linux
how98_Linux: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, for GNU/Linux 2.0.0, stripped
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Oh.
So the thing crashing is an <em>old</em> statically linked binary that’s been fully stripped<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>A quick run of <code>nm</code> will confirm the awful truth and yield the same result.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$nm how98_Linux
nm: how98_Linux: no symbols
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So let’s quickly recap what we learned:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We have a 32-bit ELF binary</li>
  <li>Statically linked with glibc</li>
  <li>Against Linux ABI 2.0.0 (for the record: that’s from 1996)</li>
  <li>And it has no symbol table</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="maybe-recreate-its-input">Maybe recreate its input?</h2>

<p>The question at hand is now: is there something wrong with this ancient program, or is there something wrong with our environment?
After all, it’s been in use for years and years (right??).
Inspecting the binary is going to take some effort, so maybe the best approach is to make sure that the input files are correct.
Previously, we’ve run into problems with other programs like this thanks to subtle differences between shells or between <code>gawk</code> vs <code>awk</code> etc.</p>

<p>From the <code>strace</code> output for <code>exec</code> we can see the program didn’t actually take any arguments.
Right after the name of the program there’re square brackets indicating the arguments.
If I make up an argument like “asdf” and pass it to the program you can see it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$strace -f -eexecve ~/ceph/Programs/netNglyc-1.0-broken/how/how98_Linux asdf

execve("/mnt/home/cchandler/ceph/Programs/netNglyc-1.0-broken/how/how98_Linux", ["/mnt/home/cchandler/ceph/Program"..., "asdf"], [/* 65 vars */]) = 0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It would be a fairly logical deduction to say that it must be reading from <code>stdin</code>.
Indeed, the <code>strace</code> output contains a <code>read(0)</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1560785 read(0,  &lt;unfinished ...&gt;
1560785 &lt;... read resumed&gt; "********************************"..., 4096) = 4096
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On Linux, file descriptor 0 is always <code>stdin</code><sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">3</a></sup>.
It’s starting to look like we’re not going to get out of digging through all the <code>tsch</code> and <code>awk</code>.
Secondly, that line of stars “*****” is actually a preview of the what the process read, and we can find a matching call above to <code>write</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1560675 write(1, "********************************"..., 4096 &lt;unfinished ...&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Yup. Here we have the file descriptor 1 which is always <code>stdout</code>.</p>

<p>Everything is being redirected via pipes.
Unfortunately, reconstructing the movement of data through pipes is extremely non-trivial.
<em>Somewhere</em> in the <code>strace</code> output we’re going to find some calls to <code>open()</code> which will reveal the paths to the specific files we’re looking for.
Double unfortunately, if they’re interleaved with <code>chdir</code> calls we might only have relative paths.
There’s also the problem of just a <strong>ton</strong> of data.
A quick run of <code>strace</code> tracking only <code>open()</code> calls yields thousands of results.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>strace -f -eopen -o /tmp/opens ./netNglyc test/LEUK_RAT.fsa
*output omitted*

wc -l /tmp/opens
5489 /tmp/opens
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ugh.
Even if we filter out all the <code>open</code> calls to library files we’re still left with north of 2k results.
An alternate approach might be needed.</p>

<h2 id="a-break--a-very-surprising-twist">A break &amp; a very surprising twist</h2>

<p>Break time.</p>

<p>Time to switch gears and deal with a few other things.
How about making a copy of <code>netNGlyc</code> in my home directory so I can do some more analysis later.
Let’s give it a run to make sure the error is reproducible.</p>

<p><img src="https://squanderingti.me/img/nGlyc/working.gif" alt="">
<em>Excuse me?</em></p>

<p><em>Of course</em> it ran correctly.
No segfaults. No goofy messages.</p>

<p>Somehow, copying the files to my home directory fixes everything.
No permissions were modified in the process.
The only difference between the working copy and broken copy are which filesystem they’re running on<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">4</a></sup>.
It’s suddenly starting to appear that this segfault is somehow filesystem related.</p>

<p>But that’s nonsense.
What could it possibly be doing that would interfere with the underlying filesystem?</p>

<h2 id="sleep--the-inputs-at-last">Sleep &amp; the inputs at last</h2>

<p>The next morning.</p>

<p>Part of the problem with locating the errant inputs is that the <code>netNGlyc</code> script cleans up after itself.
It’s doing this via <code>rm -rf</code> on its temp directory.
Commenting that out we now have a <code>tmp</code> directory full of subdirectories.
We can combine our sequence of asterisks from the <code>strace</code> output with <code>grep</code> to finally locate the files in question.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ grep -H '^\*\*\*\*' * | sort | uniq
how.test.dat:**************************************************************************
tmp.dat.1576058:**************************************************************************
tmp.dat.1576071:**************************************************************************
tmp.dat.1576086:**************************************************************************
tmp.dat.1576098:**************************************************************************
tmp.dat.1576110:**************************************************************************
tmp.dat.1576153:**************************************************************************
tmp.dat.1576192:**************************************************************************
tmp.dat.1576235:**************************************************************************
tmp.dat.1576258:**************************************************************************
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The input files are all named something like <code>tmp.dat.123456</code>.
The trailing number in the filename (<code>-H</code> to <code>grep</code>) is likely the PID of the process that originally created it.</p>

<p>Let’s pipe one of these files to our friend <code>how98_Linux</code>.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ ../../how/how98_Linux &lt; tmp.dat.1576192
open: can't stat file
apparent state: unit 3 named test.how
lately reading sequential formatted external IO
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Fantastic! We finally have a small chunk of iterable work that we can play with.
The copy in my home directory works the same way, except of course that it outputs the correct result.</p>

<h2 id="a-hammer-named-gdb">A hammer named GDB</h2>

<p>Maybe there’s <em>something</em> we can learn from this binary.
Every time in my career that I’ve had to reach for <code>strace</code> and <code>gdb</code> to fix third-party code it has been a tale of woe.</p>

<p>This case is probably no different.</p>

<p>Remember that stripped symbol table?
Normally we could run <code>where</code> inside <code>gdb</code> and it would return all the frames on the stack.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) run &lt; tmp.dat.1576058

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>by Marc Scholten, 29.10.2020</em></p>

<p>
There’s been a recent blog post <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/10/haskell-bad-parts-1" target="_blank"><q>Haskell: The Bad Parts</q></a> in the haskell community. To keep things in balance and to spread some positive vibes we should also talk about the good parts of the haskell programming language and it’s ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the best parts we encountered while using Haskell at digitally induced. We focus on the advantages in the web dev space because that is what we are currently working on.
</p>

<h2>Type Safety</h2>
<p>
Haskell has one of the most impressive type systems of any programming language in practical use. If you have used TypeScript or other type safe languages in the past, you should be aware of the great advantages of having a type-checked codebase. Now think TypeScript - but 10x better. That’s how Haskell feels like.
</p>

<p>
You save a lot of time debugging runtime errors. Once the compiler approved your code, you can be pretty sure that it is working. This kind of development process is usually a lot more fun than debugging why something is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>.
</p>

<p>
Once your system has hit a certain size and when new feature requests are rolling in you will want to make changes and refactor some parts of your code base. With Haskell you feel empowered to make changes to any part of your codebase.
</p>

<p>
Compare this to the ruby ecosystem: When working with rails you usually need to have lots of tests or otherwise you cannot confidently refactor code after things are running in production. And even then things will break. With the power of the type safety provided by Haskell, we can make refactorings whenever we want.
</p>

<p>
It’s really a blessing.
</p>

<h2>Managed Side Effects</h2>
<p>The way you deal with the file system, external APIs and user input is way different in Haskell than in other less functional programming languages. Your program consists of a main routine that handles the side effects and calls all your pure functions that do the real business logic.</p>

<p>
Systems build this way scale really well because there are less moving parts. Additionally pure functions can be easily tested and changed later on.
</p>

<p>
Most other languages encourage you to do side effects in an unrestricted way. For example when working in Java, a call to an object method might indirectly change the state of many related objects. This means you cannot easily reason about what a method calls does. In Haskell most functions are pure and thus don't trigger side effects like this. And when they do you can see this already by the function's type signature.
</p>

<p>
Haskell forces you to manage your side effects in a more careful way. You can still do IO and have mutable state, you just need to make this explicit inside the type signature. This leads to a far more robust system in overall.
</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>
Out of the box the performance of Haskell based web applications is great. It just feels faster than your typical Rails or PHP application. Thanks to it’s highly optimized runtime system it can also <a href="https://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2011/03/preliminary-warp-cross-language-benchmarks" target="_blank">handle way more requests than a nodejs application</a>.
</p>

<p>
And you get all that without ever thinking about performance at all. 
</p>

<h2>Tooling</h2>
<p>In 2020 it’s finally good. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server" target="_blank">Haskell Language Server</a> there’s now an easy way to have type information, documentation on hover and smart refactorings inside your text editor.</p>

<p>
With nix, cabal and stack we have the best tools for managing Haskell dependencies. Cabal hell is a thing of the past.
</p>

<p>
Great things are also happening to the Haskell compiler itself. <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/282" target="_blank">We soon can write dot expressions as you know from most other programming languages:</a> <code>project.name</code> instead of <code>name project</code>.
</p>

<h2>Hiring Haskell Developers</h2>
<p>
Haskell is a secret super power in that regard. The Haskell community consists of many very smart and talented software engineers. Haskell developers usually learn about Haskell because they care about their craft and about building high quality software products instead of learning about it to get a high paying job. Exactly the kind of people you want in your team.
</p>

<h2>2020 Haskell is Ready for Prime Time</h2>
<p>
For years there has been this trend of growing use of type safety as well as the growing use of functional programming techniques. What language could fill this space better than Haskell. Haskell has really matured in the last years and in 2020 it feels like it’s finally ready to conquer the world.

<![CDATA[Performance Improvements]]>

      <p>2020-10-31</p>
      <p>
        This post will describe a performance guide I presented to my team
        last week. We encountered some issues with one of our services due to
        configuration change. The change quadrupled the average processing
        time for a single message. To be more precise, the change happened in
        the data mapping DSL, which helps analysts describe how input data is
        mapped to output data. Read more about it
        <a href="https://www.otto.de/jobs/technology/techblog/artikel/adatamappingdsl.php">here</a>
        here. I took this week to make the service run at a reasonable speed
        again. Below you’ll find the approach I take, when trying to improve
        application performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Disclaimer: There will be a lot of assumptions and the guide
          often talks about message processing. I understand that this doesn’t
          represent every application, but the core principles mentioned in the
          “Prerequisites” section still stand. I’m mostly using the term
          „application“ here, but I really mean any type of software, be it a
          backend service, frontend app or simple script.
        </em>
      </p>
      <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <img src="https://franz.hamburg/assets/images/performance-improvements-1.jpg" alt="graph showing average provessing time per message">
      <p>
        There is a wide range of reasons, why the performance of an application needs to be improved:
      </p><ol>
        <li>The application would be able to run more efficiently <a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>.</li>
        <li>The application needs to run faster to be worth running at all, for it to be economical.</li>
        <li>Performance is a competitive advantage <a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>.</li>
        <li>The high standards of the developer aren’t met.</li>
        <li>And many others: More stable, predictable runtime behaviour, increased future load, building a strong basis
          for future features.</li>
      </ol>
      

      <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
      <p>
        To actually make an impact on application performance, you’ll need to fulfil some requirements. There needs to
        be <strong>measurability</strong>. You need to be able to measure the metric you want to go down/up. You can
        record those by
        doing local benchmarks or by actually reporting metrics to a metric backend (Prometheus, CloudWatch or similar).
        Though the latter one might be to coarse.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next thing you want is <strong>reproducibility</strong>, you’ll need to be able to reproduce your measured
        results. Your
        application should be able to process the same n messages in the same amount of time. Also replaying the same
        input data should work effortless. This can actually be pretty tough, if your application depends on an external
        system like a database, a message broker or another cloud-thingy; I’ll get to that down the line.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final piece is <strong>profiling</strong>, which enables you to drill down on what your application spends
        its time on. It’s
        mandatory that you can investigate which components of your application you should improve: If your app is
        spending 80% of its CPU time on JSON parsing, you should probably focus on that area. Maybe switch to a faster
        parser or a different serialisation format like protobuf. Don’t go to work on those other 20%, your improvements
        won’t be very impactful. For profiling flame graphs are a good choice, for smaller scripts you might be able to
        instrument the code yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        To summarise: you want to measure, reproduce and profile your application’s runtime behaviour.
      </p>

      <h3>Approach</h3>
      <p>
        Set yourself a goal and a time frame. Both can be rough estimates, but you should stick to them nevertheless.
        Working on performance can be a tricky rabbit hole filled with micro optimisations and intensive swearing.
        Having a plan to stick to keeps you focused on the big wins. This can be as straightforward as: „This week I’m
        going to improve message throughput (a measurable metric!) by at least 10 percent points“. On the other hand you
        shouldn’t create unnecessary pressure for yourself, if the performance issue can be mitigated by a reasonable
        amount of additional hardware, go for it! The amount of hardware you get compared to a few hours of work is
        substantial. This just shouldn’t become your default solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s time to get your hands dirty, you should be able to start your application locally and put data into it.
        Preferably you want to cut out external system like remote databases. Can you extract your core business logic
        from the dirty gripes of remote data fetching? Great, setup up a standalone version of your app, which can read
        input from file or a local database. Otherwise do your best to at least make your input data deterministic. Work
        with a frozen database table or re-read that Kafka topic from a known point. If you are having a hard time with
        that, it might be wise to spend some time upfront and work on better a separation of concerns within your
        application. Knowledge about where your data lives and gets send off to shouldn’t leak into the business side of
        things, push those concerns onto the edges of your application. The next item on the list is to establish a
        baseline measurement, something you can later use to make a comparison. I’m a fan of documenting those
        measurements in a spreadsheet. It helps with calculating differences and allows you to document future changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now you can finally get into things, run the benchmark/standalone version and attach the profiler. You probably
        already have some suspicions about what might slow the application down, confirm those with actual numbers.
        There might also be a lot of low-hanging fruits, which will only take a few minutes to fix, but in total will
        already make a noticeable impact. If you find other performance sins, document them and prioritise them
        according to their predicted impact and effort of the fix. Now just rinse and repeat: Fix an issue, validate the
        improvement, profile and start over.
      </p>

      <h3>Typical Pitfalls</h3>
      <p>
        Some common things you might encounter when trying to improve application performance:
      </p><ul>
        <li>Actually static values which will be recalculated very very often and are surprisingly expensive to do so.
          I found a regular expression which was recompiled from a string over 500 times per input messages. The source
          string was known on application start-up.</li>
        <li>A collection of things is calculated, but most of the results are discarded later on. If your iterate over
          a collection to calculate something for each item and later on do a <code>collection.find(...)</code> call,
          you might
          want to use a lazy collection.</li>
        <li>If a single item in a collection is always searched for by a given key: Use a data structure with O(1)
          access like a hash map instead of a sequence. Generally speaking: use the correct data structure for the job
          at hand. It might cost you to convert a JSON array into a map, but that cost will amortize itself surprisingly
          fast.
        </li>
        <li>The Complete Rewrite™ is probably not the solution to your performance issues.</li>
      </ul>
      

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Performance work is fun and rewarding. Though there is a hurdle to establish a reproducible benchmark you can
        run locally, this benchmark will pay off. It is also a useful thing to have for reproducing some of those
        nastier bugs. Improving the core performance of your application will offer you deep insights into your
        programming language of choice and make you more proficient with it. Performance work isn’t a one-off task you
        do once, you’ll need to continually monitor and measure your application as it will change over time.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><code>I feel like I should start off this blog post by mentioning that I am a Product Designer with little to no development skills, so I heavily rely on no-code tools to get my side projects up and running.</code></p>
<p>The idea of creating something that thousands of users could potentially use was just so exciting to me. Over the course of just shy of a year, I worked on 2 projects that made me less than $20, <strong>combined</strong>, so I feel like it's safe to say I can share my experience with you guys and hopefully you'll learn from my mistakes.</p>

<p> <img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604131920818/D9DxXPfJk.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Custom Size – 3.png"></p>
<p>Oof, designtarget was a wild ride. On 18-8-2019, god knows what happened but I just hopped on Namecheap and purchased the domain <a href="http://designtarget.org/" target="_blank">designtarget.org</a> with no prior experience in web development. I was just so into the idea of creating the 'ultimate design directory' that I really didn't think anything through. How would I monetize the platform? Do I even have a list of resources that I can work with? Where will I market the website? So many questions, and little to no answers.</p>
<p>I remembered seeing an ad for a visual editor plugin on Wordpress called Elementor, it seemed intuitive so I go to Namecheap's cPanel and install Wordpress, purchase a year's subscription to Elementor and I get building. Literally next day I was done, I didn't think the design through, I just wanted to get an MVP out right away, and this atrociousness was born, but I was proud of it. I had no web development knowledge and I made a website, and it felt great.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604132243316/TKr68CyWaA.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Web 1920 – 1.png"></p>
<p>Naturally, I wanted people to see what I had built, so I go on Reddit and post the website on /r/webdev - no it wasn't a Saturday(you can only post your work on Feedback Saturday on /r/webdev), yes the post was locked. But that doesn't matter, why you ask?</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604132936013/UONs_j1_Z.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Mask Group 1.png"></p>
<p>8.5k visitors in less than 2 hours of being on reddit when I wasn't supposed to. I knew I was onto something, but a little after the hype died down, it dawned on me, I just missed a huge chance to build an audience. I rushed creating the website that I missed some essentials such as <strong>creating a newsletter sign up</strong> or even just a <strong>blog</strong>.</p>
<p>Fast-forward a few months, I eventually create a newsletter, Instagram page, and even a blog. </p>
<p>📧 ~300 newsletter subscribers.</p>
<p>📸 ~400 Instagram followers.</p>
<p>and most importantly, my blogs were ranking on Google. I don't have Search Console screenshots but I had ranked around ~11th or so for a few articles. </p>
<p>I had solved the traffic problem of any side project, but monetization was where this project went downhill. I simply had no monetization plan whatsoever. And this is where the story of designtarget, ends, well, I sold off the project for a measly amount but that was it.</p>
<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned:</h3>
<p>👉 No matter how excited you are, keep cool and think things through.</p>
<p>👉 Traffic is easy, business is hard. </p>
<p>👉 Think things through, but also do not spend much time working on an MVP.</p>
<p>👉 It is fine to not know what you're doing.</p>

<p>This one is close to my heart, it really is. You can read my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/good-code/temporarily-pausing-work-on-good-code--MKnKtlnidKMGLMQAuyr">post on IndieHackers</a> to know why I stopped working on Good Code.</p>
<p>The idea originally came to me when I discovered  <a target="_blank" href="http://frontendmentor.io/">Frontend Mentor</a>, by then I had learned HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript and wanted to improve my skills. I liked FEM, but the free templates were just not the level of design I wanted to work on, queue Good Code.</p>
<p>This time, I was ready, monetization plan was straight-forward, content was ready, community building was in place, newsletter was in place. I cook up a static version of the website using HTML and CSS and release it on Github Pages, you can view Good Code  <a target="_blank" href="https://moeminm.github.io/goodcode">here</a> and straight to reddit I go (and IndieHackers this time as well). </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604134249747/BPvkUcJ5j.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Mask Group 2.png"></p>
<p>September 3rd, to September 15th. I was onto something, again. Shortly after launching, I view my Gumroad page only to find 2 customers have purchased templates for a total of $10. My first internet money! </p>
<p>I also had people posting their solutions on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodCodeChallenge/">subreddit</a>  I created just for this website, it felt great.</p>
<p>I really wanted to continue working on Good Code, as it stands, it's only hosted on GH Pages, so there's a good chance there <em>could</em> have been more sales had it been on an actual domain. I might resume working on Good Code in a future date, but for now, I'm pausing for reasons listed in the  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/good-code/temporarily-pausing-work-on-good-code--MKnKtlnidKMGLMQAuyr">IndieHackers post</a>. </p>
<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned:</h3>
<p>👉 Spin ideas. I could have just released this as just another website selling Adobe XD templates, but I feel like the 'improve your HTML and CSS skills' twist was what brought this to life.</p>
<p>👉 Create a community for your side-project.</p>
<p> 👉 Don't be afraid to shut down.</p>
<p>To wrap things up, had I not started designtarget, I wouldn't have learned how to code (albeit being bad at it), had I not learned how to code, I wouldn't have started Good Code and made my first $ from a side-project, who knows what my next had I not started is going to be, but I feel like it might be success.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Over the last years I’ve been working on very different operating
systems. Operating systems are usually incredibly complex beasts. I
think there are mainly three drivers of this complexity. Surprisingly
enough, neither of these is having to deal with hardware.</p>

<p>The first one is resource <strong>discovery</strong>, i.e. figuring out how the
computer the OS is running on actually looks like. On x86, this
involves parsing countless bitfields, tables, executing byte code
provided by the firmware, probing individual features, etc. The most
painful example of this I’ve seen so far is figuring out which
interrupt a particular PCI interrupt line is routed to. It’s worth a
set of posts, but until then, feel free to checkout <a href="https://habr.com/en/post/501912/">this
description</a>. (If it’s down, it’s
also cached by
<a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:CXZUV61m7hwJ:https://habr.com/en/post/501912/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk">Google</a>.)</p>

<p>The second issue is <strong>resource management</strong>. Essentially, how do you
hand out and eventually reclaim all the resources you discovered. For
some workloads performance matters here, so this code is usually
written with speed in mind.</p>

<p>The third reason is that at compile time the <strong>workload</strong> is
unclear. So the kernel has to assume the worst. It must be ready to
start a couple of hundred VMs or create a thousand TCP sockets in a
blink of an eye, because there is no way to know what’s going to
happen or what the actual requirements are.</p>

<p>A fun exercise is to checkout the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.1/source/virt/kvm/kvm_main.c#L739">KVM code for creating
VMs</a>. Try
to follow
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.1/source/arch/x86/kvm/x86.c#L9904">the</a>
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.1/source/arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c#L7059">code</a>
to where the actual VM is created in hardware. <em>Spoiler:</em> There is
none. It’s all figuring out what the platform can do and then setting
up a bunch of spinlock, mutexes, lists, arrays, structs, …</p>

<p>I don’t want to pick on KVM in particular. I think it’s pretty ok as
far as Linux kernel code goes. Operating System kernel code is mostly
like this: A lot of really mind numbing platform discovery and
resource management code written for speed assuming the worst case
requirements in a language that doesn’t do parsing, resource
management or concurrency well (among other things).</p>

<p>People take this all for granted. But when I look around, I see many
systems that don’t need this complexity and where it is only a safety
and security burden. Consider most appliance-type products, e.g. a
Wi-Fi router. Or a system that runs one service on a cloud VM. You
know everything in advance!</p>

<p>If you read until this point, you are probably asking yourself, where
I am going with this. If you think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_kernel">separation
kernel</a>, you are
right. My rough plan to write a couple of more posts to flesh out the
idea of doing all the complicated OS parts at compile time and how
this results in an incredibly simple, secure, and efficient system at
runtime. There will be <a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a>,
<a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>, <a href="https://dhall-lang.org/">Dhall</a>,
and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> content.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>

October 31, 2020 | https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Genius_checklist | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Genius_checklist">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><small>This article by Dr <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak" title="Piotr Wozniak">Piotr Wozniak</a> is part of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_Guru" title="SuperMemo Guru">SuperMemo Guru</a> series on memory, learning, creativity, and problem solving.</small>
</p>


<p><small>Compiled on the basis of the original list presented here: <i><a href="http://super-memory.com/articles/genius.htm">Roots of genius and creativity</a></i>, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak" title="Piotr Wozniak">Piotr Wozniak</a> (2001)</small>
</p>
<h2><span id="How_to_become_a_genius">How to become a genius</span></h2>
<p>A majority of people carry the potential to become a genius. There are factors that are far <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Simple_formula_for_high_intelligence" title="Simple formula for high intelligence">more important than genes and IQ</a>. I have compiled a checklist that I believe should work, when followed. All you need to begin with is to be free and reasonably healthy. I try to list the factors that prevent many people from accomplishing their greatest potential. The list begins with the stumbling blocks that are most likely to occur on one's road to genius. Some factors need to be balanced against each other, and some factors overlap. For example, the first three preconditions of genius are strongly related: freedom from <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience" title="Stress resilience">stress</a>, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Science_of_sleep" title="Science of sleep">good sleep</a>, and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-discipline" title="Self-discipline">self-discipline</a>. They may provide the key to answering why we are not (yet) a planet of geniuses. I listed individual points separately on the basis of their ability to motivate and inspire. Before you start reading, however, remember what Herbert Simon said about genius: it takes about ten years to develop it. Not only will you have to meet all the criteria listed below, but lots of hard work and patience will be required before you climb that summit!
</p>
<p>If you follow these rules religiously, you will be amazed by how much progress you can make in a decade</p> 
<p>If I scare you with a decade-long time-frame, remember that chances are good that you will love your self-transformation in weeks. The younger you are, the 'messier' your life, the less you know about your future, the more powerful the effect.
</p>
<h3><span id="Eliminate_stress">Eliminate stress</span></h3>
<p>Stress is understood here as rapid change resulting in an increase in stress hormones (catecholamines, ACTH, cortisol, etc.). Stressful change can come from conflict, illness, the death of a relative, or unemployment. Stress can also result from seemingly happy events such as a wedding or a hasty vacation. A simple test here is to make sure that creative problems circulate in your mind while you are brushing your teeth. You will fail the test if, instead of creative thinking, you are preoccupied with problems at work or in the family. Stress will dramatically cut down your creative efficiency. Most of all, it will affect your <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-discipline" title="Self-discipline">self-discipline</a>: another cornerstone of genius. In addition, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Chronic_stress" title="Chronic stress">chronic stress</a> will result in excess cortisol, increased activity in the sympathetic system, and a resulting inhibition of neurogenesis, memory consolidation, creativity, and more. See: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience" title="Stress resilience">Stress resilience</a>
</p>
<h3><span id="Sleep">Sleep</span></h3>
<p>Make sure to always get as much quality sleep as <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_running_sleep" title="Free running sleep">your brain requires</a>. The simplest first step is: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Kill_the_alarm_clock" title="Kill the alarm clock">throw away your alarm clock</a>! Lack of sleep delivers a quadruple whammy: (1) it suppresses memory consolidation, (2) it prevents <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization_in_sleep" title="Memory optimization in sleep">memory optimization</a>, (3) it makes you unwilling to exert mental effort, and (4) it undermines your <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-discipline" title="Self-discipline">self-discipline</a>. Submit to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle" title="Natural creativity cycle">natural creativity cycle</a>. For more see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Science_of_sleep" title="Science of sleep">Science of sleep</a>
</p>
<h3><span id="Self-discipline">Self-discipline</span></h3>
<p>Lack of self-discipline aggravated by stress and a lack of sleep is the number one cause of low productivity. The trick to achieving good self-discipline is to make incremental progress, and convert discipline into a habit and then into the pleasure of productivity (for more see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-discipline" title="Self-discipline">Self-discipline</a>).
If you develop healthy self-discipline habits early, your life is likely to take an entirely different course. If you believe you are lacking in this field, try the following exercise: as soon as a valuable activity comes to your mind that you are really unwilling to do, <b>do it</b>. Within the scope and in agreement with human biology, your rational brain must be the master of your decision making. Stand over a pool of cold water. Do you hate jumping in? The more you hate it, the sooner you should jump. And in the end you will <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Winter_swimming" title="Winter swimming">love it</a>. A cold shower is a minor inconvenience once you experience the volitional power of the brain. You need to master the skill of perfect execution of your own plans. The more precise your plan, the harder it is to execute, yet the more tangible the results. Learn to delay gratification. If you focus on your long-term goals, your daily inconveniences will be more bearable or even pleasurable. A strenuous quest towards the goal is the best reward for a genius mind. Minor awards of laziness do not befit a true genius. Think of self-discipline daily. Even the strongest minds can relax it all too easily. Remember about stress and sleep. Stress and sleepiness are chief factors that undermine self-discipline. Self-discipline cannot quarrel with biology. In extreme cases, it can actually <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/War_of_the_networks" title="War of the networks">undermine your genius</a>. If you are sick, stop working. If you are sleepy, go to sleep. For comfort, you should know, that with each passing year, self-discipline will gradually transform into a pleasure. Not only will you <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Plan" title="Plan">execute your plans instinctively</a>, you will also reap the benefits of your earlier efforts to steer your life in a good direction. In later years, you will not need much self-discipline to employ your genius mind to do good things.
</p>
<h3><span id="Learn_day_and_night">Learn day and night</span></h3>
<p>Knowledge is the substance you <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_to_solve_any_problem%3F" title="How to solve any problem?">convert to great ideas</a>. Although it is possible to learn in stress or in a <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_deprivation" title="Sleep deprivation">sleep deficit</a>, learning is listed here behind stress, sleep and self-discipline. This is because humans exhibit <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive" title="Learn drive">inborn curiosity</a> that makes them crave learning. TV, tabloid press, and social media thrive on this need for learning. Most people understand the importance of learning but are prevented from executing their plans due to stress, lack of sleep or lack of self-discipline. To breed genius, your whole life should revolve around learning. You should use every single little opportunity to learn important things. This could be reading Einstein's biography or talking with a homeless person. Read, talk, watch, surf, and keep on thinking. Do not avoid hard subjects (e.g. mathematics). Mold your learning strictly to your creative needs, but do not fail to explore a wide range of topics. Touch all the bases and avoid tunnel vision! Remember that your success in learning will require appropriate <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules" title="20 rules">knowledge representation</a> and timing of review (as in <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a>). Are you lacking a university education? <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/School_dropouts" title="School dropouts">Never mind</a>. Look at Edison, Lincoln, or Leibnitz to see the power of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-learning" title="Self-learning">self-instruction</a>. All the seemingly contradictory requirements listed above can be reconciled if you structure your learning with <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a>. See: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Advantages_of_incremental_reading" title="Advantages of incremental reading">Advantages of incremental reading</a>
</p>
<h3><span id="Abstract_knowledge">Abstract knowledge</span></h3>
<p>Except for a great deal of learning, you will need to pay attention to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">quality of knowledge</a> and its general <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Applicability" title="Applicability">applicability</a>. You cannot just memorize thousands of facts. You have to consciously explore areas such as logic, probability, statistics, game theory, decision theory, computing sciences, optimization, as well as other branches of mathematics and sciences. You have to develop a love for logical thinking, the scientific method, and skepticism. Even if you are a movie critic, you will still need quality logic to frame your judgment. Remember that all knowledge is volatile and may be subject to falsification at any time. Keep your mind open to new truths even if they seem to turn your present vision of the world upside down
</p>
<h3><span id="Knowledge_representation">Knowledge representation</span></h3>
<p>The main thing that makes a genius brain stand out is its ability to store <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Coherence" title="Coherence">quality knowledge</a> in a way that is <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules" title="20 rules">easy to remember</a> and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Applicability" title="Applicability">easy to use</a>. A genius mind can see complex things in a simple form. It looks at the same text or picture and sees a dozen times more than an average individual. An average reader will say: <i>"I understand, so what?"</i>. A genius reader will say: <i>"Eureka!"</i>, and list several applications of the just acquired piece of knowledge. Geniuses simplify while learning. They <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Generalization" title="Generalization">generalize</a>. They build <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">abstract models</a>. They develop abstract languages for representing knowledge. Those representation skills can also be developed by training. Have you ever tried to learn Kanji (Japanese language symbols)? If you see Kanji as a tangle of confused sticks, you are a typical beginner. Over time, however, Kanji symbols should begin to sing to you and talk to you in their own language. Once you pass the first few hundred, the next thousand should go smoothly. The same happens if you learn the 20x20 multiplication table. With time you learn simple tricks for running simple and repetitive calculations. Instead of memorizing 20x20 combinations, you limit yourself to a standard 10x10 table (just 25% of all combinations) and add to this a few rules for manipulating numbers in your <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Working_memory" title="Working memory">working memory</a>. The best way to develop good representations is to (1) understand the way the memory works (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules" title="20 rules">20 rules of formulating knowledge</a>), (2) consciously modify representations in the learning process (e.g. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a> supports this process naturally) (3) work on <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">abstract knowledge</a> (the more you learn the easier it becomes), and (4) get <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep" title="Good sleep">good sleep</a> to employ <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Neural_optimization_in_sleep" title="Neural optimization in sleep">neural optimization in sleep</a>. If you encounter a difficult problem in <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a>, postpone it. With luck, some other information source will present to you a better representation that is easier to assimilate.
</p>
<h3><span id="Health">Health</span></h3>
<p>Take obsessive care of your health! Keep your blood pressure down (high blood pressure damages your brain), do not <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Impact_of_alcohol_on_sleep" title="Impact of alcohol on sleep">abuse alcohol</a> (any dose that visibly affects your mental performance may be poisonous to your brain), use medication only when absolutely necessary, exercise, stay away from smoking or illicit drugs, learn medical sciences!!! Your brain is a highly sensitive organ that needs a healthy environment to operate in. Health and understanding of the biological needs of your brain may dramatically affect your performance in the long run. Don't waste time on <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Formula_for_common_cold_prevention" title="Formula for common cold prevention">colds and flu</a>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>October 25, 2020</p></header><section><h3>Problem</h3>
<p>It’s very common while building any project we use certain third party libraries, in the case of Javascript; <code>npm packages</code>, which recursively use more packages, and eventually your code includes a huge chunk of third party code.<br>
There is nothing wrong with it, there is no point re-inventing the wheel. We include the required library, make our code work, write tests. Deploy to a staging environment, pass through automation and finally deploy to production.  </p>
<p>The problem is when a library tries to load remote content on our website. It can be an image, font, style, or even Javascript. This content bypasses all our tests, checks, and is executed directly on production. Even worse we don’t know where the content is being served from.</p>
<h3>Content Security Policy</h3>
<p>Content Security Policy (CSP) is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/">W3C specification</a> that helps to avoid <code>XSS</code> attacks. CSP enables developers to define rules for fetching the resources(images, javascript, fonts, etc.) on the client browser. Developers can define policies to allow/restrict loading any resource, restrict resources to load only from certain domains, and disallow from any other domain. For example, you can write a CSP to restrict browsers to load images only from <code>example.com</code>, any images from other domains will be not loaded and would throw errors. In addition to resources, CSP also offers control over the embeds.<br>
In the following example, the CSP forces to load images/scripts only from self domain and prevents the loading of images from other domains.</p>

<p>One of the CSP goal is to mitigate the risk of content-injection attacks by giving developers fairly granular control over</p>
<ul>
<li>The resources which can be requested (and subsequently embedded or executed) on behalf of a specific Document or Worker</li>
<li>The execution of inline script</li>
<li>Dynamic code execution (via eval() and similar constructs)</li>
<li>The application of inline style</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>How</h3>
<p>CSP can be implemented in following two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Specify in <strong>HTTP headers</strong> </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Security-Policy: __Policy__</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specify in <strong>META tags</strong> </p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>meta</span> <span>http-equiv</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Content-Security-Policy<span>"</span></span> <span>content</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span> __Policy__ <span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Defining a policy</h4>
<p>The Policy is the accumulation of directives which defines the allowed location of each resource, no directive means allowed for all. Some of the useful directives are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>default-src</em> : This defines the loading policy for all types of resources.</li>
<li><em>script-src</em> : This defines the loading policy for all javascript, from where javascript can be loaded.</li>
<li><em>img-src</em> : This defines the loading policy for all images, from where images can be loaded. </li>
</ul>
<p>List of directives for the other resources is <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/csp#policy_applies_to_a_wide_variety_of_resources">here</a>.</p>
<p>Some examples of policies are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self';</code></pre></div>
<p>This would allow resources only from the same domain, and all other resources will fail to load.</p>
</li>
<li>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Security-Policy: img-src example.com;</code></pre></div>
<p>This would allow images only from <code>example.com</code>, and all other images will fail to load.</p>
</li>
<li>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src example.com;</code></pre></div>
<p>This would allow any resources to load only if from the same domain, except images which can be from <code>example.com</code> too.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Reporting</h4>
<p>CSP also provides a way to send violation reports, in case any logging is required, via <code>report-uri</code> directive. </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>`Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; report-uri http://example.com/cspfails` </code></pre></div>
<p>The reports will be sent as POST request and with following JSON: </p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span>
 <span>"csp-report"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>"document-uri"</span><span>:</span> <span>"http://example.com/"</span><span>,</span>
   <span>"referrer"</span><span>:</span> <span>""</span><span>,</span>
   <span>"blocked-uri"</span><span>:</span> <span>"http://example.com/some_malware.js"</span><span>,</span>
   <span>"violated-directive"</span><span>:</span> <span>"default-src self"</span><span>,</span>
   <span>"original-policy"</span><span>:</span> <span>"default-src 'self'; report-uri http://example.com/cspfails"</span>
 <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<br>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>Before defining a CSP you should be completely aware of all the resources and respective origin required for your webapp, else some vital resources may be blocked and eventually random bugs.
In case you are not sure what all resources are being required for running your web page smoothly, you can implement the CSP in reporting mode, in this way the violations will be reported but no resource will be blocked, once you are sure what are the resources really required, you can implement CSP. To do this instead of <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> we need to use <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code> header. </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: __Policy__ + report-uri</code></pre></div>
<h3>Resources</h3>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-content">
    <div id="blogpost">
        <p>The last two decades have yielded us some great understandings about Software Development. A big part of that is due to the emergence of DevOps and itâ€™s wide adoption throughout the industry.</p>

<p>Leading software companies follow identical patterns: Fast iterations in software development followed by Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment. Every artefact is tested on its ability to provide value, always has a state of readiness and is deployed through automation.</p>

<p>As a field, Machine Learning differs from traditional software development, but we can still borrow many learnings and adapt them to â€œourâ€� industry. For the last few years, weâ€™ve been doing Machine Learning projects in production, so beyond proof-of-concepts, and our goals where the same is in software development: reproducibility. So we built a pipeline orchestrator, strong automations and established a workflow to achieve exactly that.</p>

<p>Why not just Jupyter Notebooks? Well, how long does it take to construct a Notebook from scratch, with all processing steps, from scratch? And how easy is it to onboard new members to the team? Can you reproduce the results youâ€™ve had two months ago, now, fast? Can you compare todayâ€™s results against historic oneâ€™s? Can you give provenance over your data throughout training? And what happens if your model goes stale?</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve faced all of these issues, and more, and now took our experience to deduce 12 factors (as a nod to the <a href="https://12factor.net/">12 factor app</a>) that build the backbone of successful ML in production.</p>

<h2 id="1-versioning">1. Versioning</h2>

<p>While obvious to basically all Software Engineers, version control is not an universally accepted methodology among Data Scientists. Let me quote the folks at Gitlab as a quick primer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Version control facilitates coordination, sharing, and collaboration across the entire software development team. Version control software enables teams to work in distributed and asynchronous environments, manage changes and versions of code and artifacts, and resolve merge conflicts and related anomalies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, versioning lets you safely manage the moving parts of Software Development.</p>

<p>As a special form of Software Development, Machine Learning has unique requirements. First, it has not one but two moving parts: Code and Data. Second, model trainings happen in (fast) iterations and introduce a high variance of code (e.g. splitting, preprocessing, models).</p>

<p>As soon as data can be subject to change it needs to be versioned to be able to reproducibly and repeatably conduct experiments and train models. Cruder forms of versioning (read: hard-copies) can go a long way, but especially in team scenarios shared, immutable version control becomes critical.</p>

<p>Version control of code is even more key. In addition to aboveâ€™s quote, preprocessing code is not just relevant at training but also at serving time and needs to be immutably correlatable with models. Serverless functions can provide an easy-access way to achieve a middle ground between the workflow of Data Scientists and production-ready requirements.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> You need to version your code, and you need to version your data.</p>

<h2 id="2-explicit-feature-dependencies">2. Explicit feature dependencies</h2>

<p>In a perfect world, whatever produces your input data will forever produce exactly the same data, at least structurally. But the world is not perfect, youâ€™re consuming data from an upstream service thatâ€™s built by humans and might be subject to change. Features will change, eventually. At best, your models fail outright, but at worst theyâ€™ll just silently start to produce garbage results.</p>

<p>Explicitly defined feature dependencies allow for transparent failure as early as possible. Well-designed systems will accommodate feature dependencies both in continuous training as well as at serving time.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Make your feature dependencies explicit in your code.</p>

<h2 id="3-descriptive-training-and-preprocessing">3. Descriptive training and preprocessing</h2>

<p>Good software is descriptive - it can be read and understood easily without reading every line of code.</p>

<p>And while Machine Learning is a unique flavor of Software Development it doesnâ€™t exempt practitioners from following established coding guidelines. Basic understanding of coding standard essentials can be picked up with very little effort and in a short amount of time.</p>

<p>Code for both preprocessing and models should follow <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP8</a>. It should consist of meaningful object names and contain helpful comments. Following PEP8 will improve code legibility, reduce complexity and speed up debugging. Programming paradigms such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">SOLID</a> provide thought frameworks to make code more maintainable, understandable and flexible for future use cases.</p>

<p>Configuration should be separated from code. Donâ€™t hardcode your split ratios, provide them at runtime through configuration. As known from hyperparameter tuning, a well-separated configuration increases speed of iterations significantly and makes codebases reusable.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Write readable code and separate code from configuration.</p>

<h2 id="4-reproducibility-of-trainings">4. Reproducibility of trainings</h2>

<p>If you canâ€™t reproduce training results you canâ€™t trust the results. While this is somewhat the overarching theme of this blogpost, there are nuances to reproducibility. Not just do you need to be able to reproduce a training yourself, the entire team should be able to do so. Obscuring trainings in Jupyter Notebooks on someones PC or on some VM on AWS is the literal inverse of a reproducible training.</p>

<p>By using pipelines to train models entire teams gain both access and transparency over conducted experiments and training runs. Bundled with a reusable codebase and a separation from configuration, everyone can successfully relaunch any training at any point in time.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Use pipelines and automation.</p>

<h2 id="5-testing">5. Testing</h2>

<p>Testing comes in many shapes and forms. To give two examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">Unit testing</a> is testing on an atomic level - every function is tested individually on itâ€™s own specific criteria.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing">Integration testing</a> is taking an inverse approach - all elements of a codebase are tested as a group, in conjunction and with clones/mocks of up- and downstream services.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both paradigms are good starting points for Machine Learning. Preprocessing code is predestined for unit testing - do transforms yield the right results given various inputs? Models are a great use case for integration tests - does your model produce comparable results to evaluation at serving time in a production environment?</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Test your code, test your models.</p>

<h2 id="6-drift--continuous-training">6. Drift / Continuous training</h2>

<p>Drift is a legit problem for production scenarios. You need to account for drift as soon as there is even a slight possibility that data might change (e.g. user input, upstream service volatility). Two measures can mitigate risk exposure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data monitoring for production systems. Establish automated reporting mechanisms to alert teams of changing data, even beyond explicitly defined feature dependencies.</li>
  <li>Continuous training on newly incoming data. Well-automated pipelines can be rerun on newly recorded data and offer comparability to historic training results to show performance degradation as well as offer a quick way to promote newly trained models into production, given better model performance.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> If you data can change run a continuous training pipeline.</p>

<h2 id="7-tracking-of-results">7. Tracking of results</h2>

<p>Excel is not a good way to track experiment results. And not just Excel, any decentralized, manual form of tracking will yield non-authoritative and therefore untrustworthy information.</p>

<p>The right approach are automated methods to record training results in a centralized data store. Automation ensures the reliable tracking of every training run, and allows for a later comparability of training runs against each other. Centralized storage of results give transparency across teams and allows for continuous analysis.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Track results via automation.</p>

<h2 id="8-experimentation-vs-production-models">8. Experimentation vs Production models</h2>

<p>Understanding datasets requires effort. Commonly, this understanding is gathered through experimentation, especially when operating in fields with a lot of hidden domain knowledge. Start a Jupyter Notebook, get some/all of the data into a Pandas Dataframe, do some hours of out-of-sequence magic, train a first model, evaluate results - Job done. Well, unfortunately not.</p>

<p>Experiments serve a purpose in the lifecycle of Machine Learning. The results of these Experiments are however not models, but understanding. Models from explorative Jupyter Notebooks are proof for understanding, not production-ready artefacts. Gained understanding will need more molding and fitting into production-ready training pipelines.</p>

<p>All understandings unrelated to domain-specific knowledge can however be automated. Generate statistics on each data version youâ€™re using to skip any one-time, ad-hoc exploratory work you might have had to do in Jupyter Notebooks, and move straight to the first pipelines. The earlier you experiment in pipelines, the earlier you can collaborate on intermediate results and the earlier youâ€™ll receive production-ready models.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Notebooks are not production-ready, so experiment in pipelines early on.</p>

<h2 id="9-training-serving-skew">9. Training-Serving-Skew</h2>

<p>The avoidance of skewed training and serving environments is often reduced to correctly embedding all data preprocessing into the model serving environments. This is absolutely correct, and you need to adhere to this rule. However, it is also a too narrow interpretation of Training-Serving-Skew.</p>

<p>A little detour to ancient DevOps history: In 2006 the CTO of Amazon, Werner Vogels, coined the term â€œYou build it, you run itâ€�. Itâ€™s a descriptive phrase for extending the responsibility of Developers to not only writing but also running the software they build.</p>

<p>A similar dynamic is required for Machine Learning projects - an understanding of both the upstream generation of data and the downstream usage of generated Models is within the responsibility of Data Scientists. What system generates your data for …</p></div></section></div>

  2020-10-31
</p>
<p>I recently released <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/release/0.8.3/">Oil 0.8.3</a>, and it's the biggest release in
recent memory!  What's new?</p>
<ul>
<li>Many changes to the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">Oil expression language</a>, including
Python compatibility and legacy syntax removal.</li>
<li>Changes to the <strong>word</strong> syntax, e.g. the <code>@</code> sigil.</li>
<li>Keyword changes, like the removal of <code>pass</code>.</li>
<li>New <strong>functions</strong>, like <code>_match()</code> to access <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=eggex#eggex">eggex</a> matches.</li>
<li>Enhancements to <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=shell-builtin#shell-builtin">shell builtins</a>, including <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a>
support in <code>read</code> and <code>write</code>.</li>
<li>The comprehensive <code>errexit</code> overhaul, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/10/osh-features.html#reliable-error-handling">mentioned in the last
post</a>.</li>
<li>Many new docs</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the first of two posts that describe the language changes.  Separately,
I plan to write "the ultimate guide" to error handling in shell.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with Oil, see the <strong>new</strong> <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/language-influences.html">Language
Influences</a> and  <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/idioms.html">Oil Language
Idioms</a> docs, as well as posts tagged
#<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">oil-language</a>.</p>
 
<a name="help-wanted"></a>
<h2>Help Wanted</h2>
<p>If you're interested in Oil, now is a great time to get involved.  Recall that
the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/10/osh-features.html">last post</a> said that OSH would have four significant
fixes, but the rest of the project was too much work.  <strong>The work described
here is what I need help with</strong>!</p>
<p>Toward the end, I recently updated these pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil#important-we-accept-small-contributions">We Accept Small Contributions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/Contributing">Contributing</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Asking questions and leaving feedback about the language on
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=zulip#zulip">Zulip</a> is also appreciated!  Several people have influenced the
language design this way.</p>
<a name="operators-expression-mode"></a>
<h2>Operators (Expression Mode)</h2>
<p>The expression language lets you talk about typed data with operators and
literals.  Let's review those changes first.</p>
<a name="return-to-python-compatibility"></a>
<h3>Return to Python Compatibility</h3>
<p>Last year, Oil had some "cleanups" of the Python expression language, but I
decided that the unfamiliarity isn't worth it.  I reverted them, so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integer division <code>div</code> is back to <code>//</code></li>
<li>Modulus <code>mod</code> is back to <code>%</code></li>
<li><code>xor</code> is back to <code>^</code></li>
<li>Exponentiation <code>^</code> is back to <code>**</code></li>
</ul>
<p>(The <a href="#appendix">appendix</a> has some rationale for this.)</p>
<a name="to-concatenate-and-to-match-globs"></a>
<h3><code>++</code> to concatenate, <code>~~</code> and <code>!~~</code> to match globs</h3>
<p>The <code>++</code> operator is for string and list concatenation.  That is, <code>a + b</code>
always does <strong>math</strong>, and <code>a ++ b</code> always does concatenation.</p>
<p>This is to support Awk-like auto-type conversion.  Similarly, comparison
operators like <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&lt;=</code> will only work on numbers, and we'll use a
different syntax for strings.  (Yes, I realize the danger with such type
conversion!)</p>
<p>The <code>~~</code> and <code>!~~</code> operators are for glob matching.  They deprecate <code>[[ x == *.py ]]</code> in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>.</p>
<a name="literals-expression-mode"></a>
<h2>Literals (Expression Mode)</h2>
<a name="dicts-are-not"></a>
<h3>Dicts are <code>{}</code>, not <code>%{}</code></h3>
<p>This is another return to Python compatibility.</p>
<p>We used sigils like <code>%{foo: 42}</code> in dict literals because Oil uses <code>{ }</code> for
C-like statement  blocks, and it lacks semicolons.</p>
<p>Making the tokens distinct is one way to avoid a subtle parsing issue.  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22706645">This
Hacker News comment</a> about the
Dart language describes some of the difficulties with using <code>{}</code>  in both
expressions and statements.</p>
<p>However, Oil's problem  is not as hard as Dart's, and I solved it by simply
including newlines in the grammar.  A key-value pair can be on a line:</p>
<pre><code>var mydict = {
  server: "www.example.com"  
  port: 80
}
</code></pre>
<p>But you can't split it across lines</p>
<pre><code>
var mydict = {
  server:
    "www.example.com"
}
</code></pre>
<p>without either <code>()</code> or <code>\</code>:</p>
<pre><code>var mydict = {
  
  server: (
    "www.example.com"
  )
}
</code></pre>
<p>It was bugging me that lists are just <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>, while dicts were <code>%{key: 'value'}</code>.  This is now fixed!</p>
<p>(<a href="https://oilshell.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/121540-oil-discuss/topic/Expression.20Language.20Improvements/near/212235586">Good Zulip Feedback on Line
Breaking</a>.
I'm still looking for more feedback.)</p>
<hr>
<p>I also removed the <code>%[]</code> syntax , which was an overly ambitious idea for typed
array literals.  We already have <code>%(one two)</code> for shell-like arrays, and
<code>['one', 'two']</code> for Python/JS-like lists.</p>
<p>(Aside: Perl and Ruby have <code>qw(one two)</code> or <code>qw[one two]</code> which is like our
<code>%(one two)</code>.)</p>
<a name="blocks-are-echo-pwd"></a>
<h3>Blocks are <code>&amp;(echo $PWD)</code></h3>
<p>Oil's Ruby-like blocks are "first class".  Normally they're passed to procs as
the last argument:</p>
<pre><code>cd /tmp {
  echo $PWD
}
</code></pre>
<p>But we also need them in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/command-vs-expression-mode.html">expression
mode</a>.
I decided on the syntax <span><code>&amp;(echo $PWD)</code></span>.</p>
<p>This may seem inconsistent at first, but it's consistent with command subs:</p>
<pre><code>var b1 = $(echo $PWD)  
var b2 = &amp;(echo $PWD)  
</code></pre>
<a name="chars-are-u012345"></a>
<h3>Chars are <code>\u{012345}</code></h3>
<p>Character literals <strong>stand alone</strong> in the expression language, like</p>
<pre><code>var x = \u{3bf}  
</code></pre>
<p>That is, you don't need quotes.  They're for both "code point literals"
("runes" in Go) and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=eggex#eggex">eggex</a> char classes.</p>
<p>This syntax is now consistent within C-escaped strings like <code>$''</code> and <code>c''</code>,
and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a>, which leads us into the next section.</p>
<a name="tightened-up-string-literals"></a>
<h2>Tightened Up String Literals</h2>
<p>Shell has a rich string literal syntax.  Oil inherits all of its power, but (as
of this release) removes unnecessary flexibility.</p>
<a name="c-style"></a>
<h3>C-Style</h3>
<p>Here are some C-style strings:</p>
<pre><code>echo $'C-style'
echo $'\n \i'               
echo $'\0123 \x01 \x1'      
echo $' \u1234 \U00012345'  
</code></pre>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>\n</code> is a valid char escape, but <code>\i</code> is an <strong>invalid</strong> one.  Bash accepts
it and prints <code>\i</code> literally.</li>
<li>Octal escapes and hex escapes can express exactly the same bytes.</li>
<li>Hex escapes can be abbreviated <code>\x1</code> instead of <code>\x01</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I made the following changes to simplify this syntax:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disallow invalid char escapes.</li>
<li>Disallow <strong>all</strong> octal escapes.</li>
<li>Disallow single char hex escapes.  Must be <code>\xHH</code>.</li>
<li>Disallow the two unicode escapes in favor of the QSN/Rust style <code>\u{12345}</code>,
which I added support for.</li>
</ol>
<p>As usual, <strong>we do a dance to avoid breaking existing code</strong>, while preventing
legacy from creeping into the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">Oil language</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In command mode, <code>shopt --unset parse_backslash</code> enables all these syntax
errors.  This is the default in <code>bin/oil</code> (option group <code>oil:all</code>).</li>
<li>In expression mode, they're always disallowed, even when running <code>bin/osh</code>.
Legacy shell scripts don't have expressions, so this is OK!</li>
</ul>
<a name="a-superset-of-qsn"></a>
<h3>A Superset of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a></h3>
<p>Now that we have <code>\u{12345}</code>, we have an interesting property: any <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a>
string is now an Oil string!  Though you have to add a <code>$</code> sigil:</p>
<pre><code>echo $'QSN and Oil \\ \n'    

var mystr = $'\x01 \u{3bf}'  
var mystr = c'\x01 \u{3bf}'  
</code></pre>
<a name="double-quoted"></a>
<h3>Double Quoted</h3>
<p>Here are some doubled quoted strings:</p>
<pre><code>echo "double quoted"
echo "\$ \i"         
echo "\\ \ ."        
echo "\$ $ ."        
echo "old: `hostname`, new: $(hostname)"  
</code></pre>
<p>Oil makes the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>parse_backslash</code> makes <code>\i</code> and <code>\</code> a syntax error.  Add the
<code>\</code> to fix it.</li>
<li><code>parse_dollar</code> makes <code>$</code> a syntax error.  Ditto.</li>
<li><code>parse_backticks</code> makes the old command sub style a syntax
error.  Use the new style.</li>
</ul>
<p>These options are <strong>unset</strong> in the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/oil-options.html">option group</a>
<code>oil:all</code>.</p>
<p>Aside: our <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=lexing#lexing">lexing style</a> is awesome for making these
changes!</p>
<a name="word-syntax-command-mode"></a>
<h2>Word Syntax (Command Mode)</h2>
<p>I made similar changes to <strong>unquoted words</strong>.</p>
<a name="parse_at_all-reserves-words-beginning-with"></a>
<h3><code>parse_at_all</code> Reserves Words Beginning With <code>@</code></h3>
<p>In the <code>oil:basic</code> option group, we allow this syntax, but we only break the
bare minimum:</p>
<pre><code>echo @myarray
</code></pre>
<p>But the <code>oil:all</code> option group reserves <strong>any</strong> word beginning with <code>@</code>, like:</p>
<pre><code>@{} @[] @// @'' @""
</code></pre>
<p>This will be useful for future language extensions.  That is, creating more
syntax errors lets the language <strong>evolve</strong>.</p>
<p>I also expect <code>shopt --unset parse_dollar</code> to have this benefit.  It allows us
to parse inline eggexes like <code>$/ digit+ /</code>.</p>
<a name="parse_dollar-again-for-strictness"></a>
<h3><code>parse_dollar</code> Again, For Strictness</h3>
<p>To recap:</p>
<p>No:</p>
<pre><code>echo $
echo "$"
</code></pre>
<p>Yes:</p>
<pre><code>echo \$
echo "\$"
</code></pre>
<p>TODO: We also need to support <code>strict_backslash</code> in unquoted words.</p>
<a name="next"></a>
<h2>Next</h2>
<p>This post got long, so I split it into two parts.  The next part will review
changes in Oil keywords, stdlib functions, shell builtins, and documentations.</p>
<p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/jle86e/big_changes_to_the_oil_language/?">Let me know</a> what you think of these changes!</p>

<a name="appendix-the-tea-language"></a>
<h2>Appendix: The Tea Language</h2>
<p>One reason to be more Python compatible is that I have a quixotic plan to
self-host Oil and expose the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=metalanguage#metalanguage">metalanguage</a> to users.  That is, our DSLs:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=opy#opy">OPy</a> / <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mypy#mypy">MyPy</a> subset</li>
<li>Zephyr <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=zephyr-asdl#zephyr-asdl">ASDL</a></li>
<li>A dialect of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=regular-language#regular-language">regular languages</a></li>
</ul>
<p>should be combined into one language, which I'm calling "Tea".</p>
<p>Against my better judgement, I brought this up <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/jb5i5m/help_i_keep_stealing_features_from_elixir_because/g8urxou/">on
Reddit</a>
and <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/4hx42h/assorted_thoughts_on_zig_rust#c_mqpg6e">on
lobste.rs</a>.
Briefly, Tea can be described as <strong>statically-typed Python with sum types</strong>
— which someone asked actually for!</p>
<p>And it should have <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=metaprogramming#metaprogramming">metaprogramming</a> features to express the equivalent
of Oil's use of textual code generation.</p>
<p>I wrote a working grammar to design Tea's syntax (*), but that's the only
implementation so far.  It would be a large project, but it's also a concrete
one, because we have 30K-60K+ lines of working code as a use case.</p>
<p>If you want to work on a statically typed language, let me know!  I don't know
how to write a type checker, and can use help.</p>
<p>Even if Tea doesn't get done, Oil will be useful either way.  We can continue
using these DSLs for a long time.</p>
<hr>
<p>(*) The entire language is expressed in the grammar as a big expression, using
a single <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=lexer-modes#lexer-modes">lexer mode</a>.  It's nowhere near as complicated as
shell!</p>

                        <p>A pilot project using sniffer dogs to provide instant and pain-free coronavirus testing at Helsinki airport has shown promising early results and proven popular with travellers, researchers said on Wednesday.</p><p>Three dogs, named Kossi, ET and Miina, have sniffed swabs taken from 2,200 passengers in the month since the testing booth was set up at the airport's arrivals hall, and have found the virus in 0.6 percent of travellers.</p><p>Although the research is not due for completion until December, the team say the initial findings appear broadly in line with detection rates of the nasal PCR tests also conducted on arriving travellers.</p><p>"We have done 16-17,000 PCR tests at the airport and less than one percent are positive," Timo Aronkyto, deputy mayor of Vantaa, told reporters.</p><p>Compared to the results found by the dogs, "they are about the same, I don't think there is a statistical difference," Aronkyto said.</p><p>The researchers are now analysing how closely the two sets of test results match each other -- whether the dogs found coronavirus in passengers whose infection was confirmed by a PCR test -- and hope to publicise their findings at the end of the year.</p><p>Preliminary experiments in the first major wave of infections earlier in the year suggested the dogs can detect the virus with close to 100 percent accuracy, up to five days earlier than a PCR test.</p><p>Feedback from arriving passengers, who take the free-of-charge test voluntarily, "has been exceptionally positive," project manager Soile Turunen said. </p><p>Around 100 travellers a day have been queuing up for the test, which involves wiping a swab onto the skin which is then put in front of the dog, who will quickly pass over a negative sample but will be attracted to a positive one.</p><p>"People don't complain about the queues, in fact it's the opposite," Turunen said. </p><p>"They're coming up to us to to say 'Hi' from morning until evening," she added.</p><p>A fourth dog, a German shepherd called Valo, is currently in training to begin work at the airport testing booth.</p><p>The Helsinki University researchers behind the trial, working with sniffer-dog specialists from the organisation Wise Nose, hope that their research will persuade the government to fund a rollout of the dogs for other uses, such as at tourist hotspots or large public gatherings.</p><p>Although sniffer dog trials have been undertaken elsewhere, such as in the UAE, France, Ruussia and Chile, use of canine scent-detectors to bolster coronavirus testing has not yet been widely adopted by authorities, in part because of a lack of peer-reviewed literature, some researchers believe.</p><p>Dog handling charities have previously worked with dogs to detect cancers, Parkinson's disease and bacterial infections using samples taken from humans.</p>

<p><b>LIL</b> (stands for <b>L</b>ittle <b>I</b>nterpreted <b>L</b>anguage)
is a small highly dynamic scripting language inspired by Tcl and
unix shells. LIL has two implementations, one written in <b>C</b>,
which consists of a pair of <tt>.c</tt> and <tt>.h</tt> files
and one in <b><a href="http://freepascal.org/">Free Pascal</a></b>,
which consists of a single <tt>pas</tt> file (a unit). Also a
<a href="http://lazarus-ide.org/">Lazarus</a> package for the
latter is provided.</p>

<h2><a name="downloads"></a>Downloads</h2>

<p>LIL is currently available as source code snapshots of both
the C and the Free Pascal version combined in a single ZIP file.
These snapshots are versioned using their release date. Note that
the interpreter's reflect version command will report <i>0.1</i>
regardless of date versioning. Both of these will change at some
point in the future to provide proper versioned releases.</p>

<h3><a name="latestversion"></a>Latest version</h3>

<p>The latest version of LIL is <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/lil20190821.zip">lil20190821.zip</a>
(159KB). This is an extract from my private Fossil repository
(the files are mostly the same as the older archives, but this
also includes a full changelog from the repository going back
to 2010 and the LIL logo as an XCF image which can be opened with
GIMP).</p>

<p>Please note that <b>20190821</b> contains slightly altered
behavior for line breaking during list parsing that <i>could</i>
affect some scripts, especially with lists that contain code inside
square brackets, however the previous behavior was completely
broken (e.g. having multiple commands inside brackets in a list
would merge all commands into a single one and if a semicolon
was used for the multiple commands, the entire command wouldn't
be parsed properly). Because of that i expect any reliance on
the previous behavior to be accidental (and in practice i do not
really expect any such script to even exist). Also in the same
version a Bash script is introduced to check the differences between
different executables by running the same scripts under both and
comparing the results, which show that FPLIL contains a few incompatibilities
with C LIL. At this moment FPLIL doesn't implement the changes
mentioned so far - all these incompatibilities and changes will
be fixed in a later release.</p>

<h3><a name="olderversions"></a>Older versions</h3>

<p>Some older versions are also available in case you need them.
LIL should be mostly backwards compatible (see below), but right
now there is no promise for strict API or ABI compatibility.</p>

<h3><a name="winlil"></a>WinLIL</h3>

<p>If you are using Windows you can also download <b>WinLIL</b>,
a small Windows-based environment with editor, console and extra
graphics functions that can be used to experiment with LIL. It
is self-contained in a single executable, including the LIL documentation.</p>

<p>The latest version is <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil14.zip">WinLIL 1.4</a>
(204KB) based on <i>C LIL 20190821</i>. <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil.png">Here
is a screenshot</a> of it in action. Also a small doodle program
can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/doodle.lil">downloaded here</a> and a <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/doodle.gif">screenshot
seen here</a>. <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil20190821231511.zip">This archive</a>
(45KB) contains the source code, but note that it uses the original
Borland C++ Builder and to compile with a newer version (such
as the free Community Edition) you'll need to recreate the project
file and make a few modifications to the code.</p>

<p>Older versions of WinLIL can be found in these files: <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil13.zip">winlil13.zip</a>
(1.3 binary), <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil20190524200539.zip">winlil20190524200539.zip</a>

(source).</p>

<h3><a name="lilgui"></a>LILGUI</h3>

<p><b>LILGUI</b> is an experimental API specification for GUI
applications that provide scripting functionality through LIL
to expose a simple GUI API. It is mainly intended for creating
embeddable GUIs (e.g. a panel in a sidebar) although it can also
be used for popup windows and dialogs. Currently the only implementation
for LILGUI is <b>LazLILGUI</b>, which is a component for Lazarus
that uses LCL to provide the actual GUI functionality.</p>

<p>The latest version of LILGUI files (which include the API spec,
LazLILGUI and a couple of examples) can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/lilgui20190708215135.zip">downloaded
here</a> (85KB). A 64bit windows binary for <b>LazLILGUI Notepad</b>,
a text editor that provides a sidebar to try out LILGUI code,
can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepad20190708.zip">downloaded here</a> (1.3MB).
Also you can see the screenshots of program in action under <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepadwin.png">Windows</a>, <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepadlin.png">Linux</a>
and <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepadosx.png">Mac OS X</a> and also the <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgcce.png">Custom Control Example</a> under Windows.</p>

<h2><a name="stability"></a>API stability and compatibility</h2>

<p>Generally speaking, both the C and Free Pascal implementation
APIs are stable <i>for the most part</i>. The <b>C API</b> was
broken only once in middle 2010 when <code>lil_command_t</code>
was renamed to <code>lil_func_t</code> and the <b>C ABI</b> for
the Windows DLL is also backwards compatible since late 2010.
The <b>Free Pascal</b> implementation has a less stable API but
as Free Pascal itself does not support ABI stability, this is
less of a concern.</p>

<p>In the foreseeable future the C API should be stable, but i'd
recommend <i>against</i> building a system-wide shared version
of the library before a proper versioned release is made. Once
a versioned release is made, both the API and ABI will remain
stable for as long as it is technically possible.</p>

<p>Script code should be backwards compatible even as new commands
are introduced since scripts and host applications will redefine
any conflicting functions anyway. The only time script code was
broken was in 2012 when the multiline comments were introduced
so any script that used a comment line like <code>#####</code>
was broken. This was addressed in a fix in 2014 that added a special
check for such cases so that multiline comments can only start
and end with two <code>#</code>s but not three or more (while
this could have broken any script that used three or more <code>#</code>s
to start and end multiline comments, the chances for such a script
are very slim).</p>

<p>Like with the C API, the script backwards compatibility currently
is mostly stable, but minor changes (like the multiline comment
changes mentioned above) might be made until a versioned release
is made or fixes to the script behavior to be closer to what is
described in the documentation or simply fix broken behavior.
At that point no changes will be made that may affect backwards
compatibility.</p>

<p>LILGUI and LazLILGUI are more experimental and may see backwards
incompatible changes in the future.</p>

<h2><a name="documentation"></a>Documentation</h2>

<p>Currently the only documentation is the (lengthy) <tt>readme.txt</tt>
file that <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/readme.txt">you can read here</a> or as part
of the archive containing the source code. At some point i'll
write better formatted documentation. Free Pascal has its own
API documentation <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/pasreadme.txt">readable here</a> and
also as a part of the archive containing the source code.</p>

<p>The LILGUI API can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/api.txt">found here</a> and
the documentation for LazLILGUI can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgreadme.txt">found
here</a>. Both are also part of the LILGUI archive.</p>

<p>Also <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/badsectoracula/lil-presentation">an
old LIL presentation can be found on SlideShare</a>. Please note
that the URLs in the presentation are not valid anymore.</p>

<h2><a name="status"></a>Status</h2>

<p>LIL is practically <i>feature-complete</i> and i do very little
development of it. I do not plan on making it a big and bloated
library that tries to provide everything - if anything, in the
future i might add some conditionals to remove bits of the library
for users who do not need, e.g, the string or list functions.</p>

<p>Further work is mostly "around" LIL and not on the
language itself: improving the documentation, writing a test suite
(currently there are several examples which i run after making
changes and almost half of them come from bug fixes, but i'd like

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>About every year or so I decide to change note-taking apps. Or at least I change <em>most</em> of my notes to a new app. This time I'm going back to an old app, but because of a "new" note-taking paradigm. The one I'm going back to is <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a>, but with a twist. In this post, I hope to look at some of the new ideas in note-taking and some of the apps available.</p><p>The new paradigm that I'm talking about is backlinking. It's actually not a new idea at all of course, but there have been many apps that have started to take advantage of backlinking. The one that launched off the fad was <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>. Many of these tools are based on or enable, a note-taking method called Zettelkasten.</p><p>Zettelkasten is a technique of note taking and indexing popularized by Niklas Luhmann, a German sociologist from the middle of the 20th century. Zettelkasten, literally "slip box", was a note-taking method in which small slips of paper were ID'd and linked to one another, creating a linked system of knowledge that Luhmann could then use in his books, research, and papers. As the links were maintained in two directions, ideas could be backward linked to other ideas. Ideas from various sources could then form a new network and hopefully, new links could be formed between information. There's more to it, such as the idea that each note should be an atomic, well-formed idea. For more information, and because I'm failing to explain it, visit <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/">https://zettelkasten.de/</a>.</p><p>I won't pretend to be an expert in Zettelkasten, and all of this is new to me. Frankly, I'm not even sure that the Zettelkasten method would be useful to me as I need longer form notes on many of the things that I do. But the idea of backlinking notes so that you can refer to notes that refer to the note that you're on seems extremely powerful. It feels like the next innovation in note-taking, beyond simple outlining or linking, precisely because you're essentially forming a distributed network of notes.</p><h2>Backlinks</h2><p>Let me give you an example. Say that I'm working on Kubernetes and can't remember the name of a tool that I had used. I can just pull up the Kubernetes note and look at the backlinks and see which notes are tagged as Kubernetes. Why couldn't I just create a link on the Kubernetes note? Well, of course, I could, but that would require opening that note and adding a link that may have nothing to do with the context for the primary Kubernetes notes.</p><p>Or another example, I am taking notes on a sermon being preached on John 3. I can then dive into John 3's note and look at all other sources tagged with John 3, including sermon notes, book notes, or personal devotional notes. From there I could dive into individual topics such as love or the kingdom of God.</p><p>At least, that's how I hope it will work in practice. Again, I'm just getting started</p><p>It seems that with the release of Roam Research, there have now been a plethora of tools in development that work off of the idea of backlinks, as well as atomic thoughts. I've done a lot of research in the last week, and have formed some opinions about some. Let's start first with the note-taking app I'm coming from:</p><h2>Notion</h2><p><a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> seemed to take off in 2018-2019 as the premiere note-taking app. Indeed, Notion has introduced backlinks in a recent release.</p><p>I like Notion, and will both keep paying for it and taking notes there. It has a lot of power in organizing and reorganizing notes, as well as pulling in other content such as code, videos, images, etc. It even goes so far as to include database-like tables and Kanban-style boards.</p><p>Backlinks in Notion seem to primarily work at the "page" level, rather than the block//heading level like Roam Research. And while I love Notion as a clean interface for notes, I'm not wild about its lack of capabilities in making TODOs and alerts and finding notes after the fact. Its search is great but basic.</p><h2>Roam Research</h2><p><a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a> seems like a really powerful system, particularly for a research-style Zettelkasten. I honestly have not tried it, both because I didn't get into the trial, but now because of the cost and the concern of people losing notes and the lack of good backups. Most of the posts I've seen about note stability have disappeared, but you can see one graveyard here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/hsrg0z/lost_all_my_notes_need_recommendations_for/">https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/hsrg0z/lost_all_my_notes_need_recommendations_for/</a>. There was even a post today about it: <a href="https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Recovering-Lost-Roam-Notes/">https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Recovering-Lost-Roam-Notes/</a></p><p>Frankly, I prefer open source and being in control of my own content and notes. I know Notion doesn't fit into that well, but it also seemed ahead of its time to me.</p><h2>TiddlyWiki</h2><p><a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a> has been around a while and was the note system I used before Notion. TiddlyWiki is many things, but at its heart, it was a single file HTML that you could download and make changes to in wiki syntax. TiddlyWiki has had backlinks for a while, possibly even before Roam Research, but recently the community has released some versions specifically for backlinking: <a href="https://akhater.github.io/drift/">Drift</a> and <a href="https://kebifurai.github.io/TiddlyResearch/">Tiddly Research</a> are two that I've tried out.</p><p>They're great, but there are a few problems that I've had with TiddlyWiki that just make me hesitant. I had a lot of notes in it as I was working in Seminary, wrote a custom Bible linking plugin, etc, but updating it was a nightmare on the node version with my customization. For each upgrade, I'd have to manually diff my plugin changes against the upgrades. Of course, this may have just been me not knowing what I was doing, but it still wasn't fun. Also, just the speed of entering notes and using the mouse doesn't appeal to me. Being a Vim guy, I like my keyboard.</p><h2>Obsidian</h2><p><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> is a recent and gorgeous option for note-taking. It was actually my first introduction to backlinking and this whole area of decentralized notes. It's a commercial-style app (more on that below), but also works off of just a directory of markdown files. So you get to keep your content regardless. It feels great to use, I like its editor (not as well as <a href="https://typora.io/">Typora</a> or Notion though), and it's fast, responsive, and the keyboard shortcuts are great. It even has a basic Vim mode.</p><p>My only hangups are: if you use it for commercial purposes, the license becomes a pay-as-you-go SAAS license. The free license is just for personal use. Also, it's not open source, so there's always the risk that the company could go under and disappear, or worse, that they start charging way after I'm invested in it. Sure, they're just markdown files...I could make my own note-taking app if that were the case...but I don't have that much time or interest. Also, the backlinks seem to just be at the note level, but I didn't mind that as much in this app.</p><p>Still, if you're looking for a personal note-taking app that's easy to get into, supports backlinks, has the graph, uses markdown, is modern-looking, and is nice to use, totally give Obsidian a try.</p><h2>Joplin</h2><p><a href="https://joplinapp.org/">Joplin</a> is one that I've just tried a little bit. It looks fine as far as an editor, has nice backlinking, etc. The one hangup that made me put it down quickly is that links are always based on note ID, so you have to find a note to get its ID and insert it. It didn't seem nearly as fast or practical as I wanted. It is open source though, and worth a look.</p><h2>Trilium</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/zadam/trilium">Trilium</a> is an app I see recommended often. It's also free and open source. It claims to have automatic markdown conversion, but I couldn't get it to work. I gave up pretty soon after that.</p><h2>Zim</h2><p><a href="https://zim-wiki.org/">Zim</a> is a desktop wiki that I've used quite a lot in the past. It also has a backlinks plugin. It works great, is open source as well, and is very quick for taking notes. The negatives for this one are that it looks old and that it uses a custom wiki syntax that I don't like as well as markdown or Org.</p><h2>MindForger</h2><p><a href="https://www.mindforger.com/">MindForger</a> kind of does its own thing. It's difficult to explain, but worth checking out. It kind of has backlinks in that it has notes that are related to each other, but in more of an AI/intuitive way than in a manual way. It takes the headlines of Markdown files and makes them notes, but for each note lets you embed other top headlines/etc. It's weird but worth checking out. For a great intro, watch the video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlW2e1X3O-I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlW2e1X3O-I</a>.</p><p>MindForger is open source and seems really powerful. I'm going to keep playing with it. The only negative is that it's got the whole split-screen preview/markdown editor like many of the others on this list, but there's no graphical component to the editor at all. The keyboard shortcuts are multi-key and not configurable as well, but they're intuitive.</p><h2>Foam</h2><p><a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/">Foam</a> is a plugin to Visual Studio code that emulates many features from Roam/Obsidian. It has backlinks, a graph, and looks decent.</p><p>Honestly, though, I don't like Visual Studio code, it's not the greatest editing experience, and the backlinks seem majorly delayed from saving. But maybe that was just my experience. This is one that has a lot of promise and I would keep my eye on in the future, but seems it has a little ways to go.</p><p>I'll give an honorable mention to <a href="https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron">Dendron</a>, which seems to be at least on par with Foam. It also has a hierarchical system but seems to keep all of the files in the same directory using a dot-separated notation. Also worth checking out and watching, but also had delayed backlink processing and note a great markdown editing experience.</p><h2>Org-roam</h2><p><a href="https://www.orgroam.com/">Org-roam</a> is where I landed for now. Org-roam is an extension of the famous <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a> for Emacs. I used Org Mode a LOT when I was new to Emacs. It's really crazy how deep the rabbit hole goes for Org Mode. Org Mode is best described as an outliner, journal, day planner, calendar, TODO list, kanban board, interactive coding tool, TODO capture tool (including linking to source code lines, a browser, or even against a pdf as you're reading it), and presentation software. I'm sure there are a dozen or two things I'm missing too.</p><p>I'll caveat this though...you have to be a little crazy to use org-mode. Configuring it alone can be a trial in insanity, but once you master …</p></div></div>

But what does it take to secure one of these highly sought-after positions? Like any job in technology, machine learning positions require candidates to go through a rigorous series of technical interviews. </p><p id="viewer-43gc5">What is the structure of these interviews? What topics are covered? Are these interviews similar to software engineering? (Spoiler: sorta, kinda) Who is paying for lunch? </p><p id="viewer-781mt">There are a lot of questions, but not a lot of answers out there. This is largely because the field of machine learning is still young and learning to stand on its own two feet. </p><p id="viewer-cemkd">This article is intended to be the missing guide for what to expect in a machine learning interview. The observations in this post are born out of collective experiences interviewing for machine learning engineer and scientist positions, comprising over 90 hours of interview time across 80+ interviews at big (FAANG) companies, small (just out of Y-Combinator) companies, and everything in-between.</p><p id="viewer-522i9">Let's get started.</p><h3 id="viewer-32gml"><strong>Machine learning interviews are diverse...sometimes</strong></h3><p id="viewer-ecirs">The machine learning landscape is constantly evolving. If you were entering the world of machine learning ~4 years ago, the most in-demand skill would be the ability to build and debug deep learning models. Today with the rise of tools like PyTorch and Tensorflow, a bigger issue is not so much how to build machine learning prototypes but rather how to take them all the way to a deployed system in production (also called the last-mile problem). </p><p id="viewer-63ac7">What this means is that over the course of several years of interviewing for these positions, we've learned that the nature of these assessments can be incredibly diverse. For example, the following are examples of real interview types/questions that we've had:</p><p id="viewer-ac86k">	1) Read a recent paper on unsupervised learning for noise reduction and whiteboard extensions to the techniques proposed in the paper</p><p id="viewer-aj8c3">	2) Explain the nodes in the Tensorflow computational graph for a feedforward layer of a neural network</p><p id="viewer-5lue8">	3) Give an hour-long talk about some machine learning project you have done and get grilled on its details</p><p id="viewer-4bjvl">	4)  Describe how you would implement Google's autocomplete </p><p id="viewer-2p8og">	5) Explain why L1 regularization encourages sparsity in features</p><p id="viewer-5hjhh">Sound like these questions are all over the place? Don't get overwhelmed: they are.</p><p id="viewer-53d1i">Does that mean you will have to know how to do all of the above for your interview? No, definitely not. This variety is only meant to illustrate that many things are fair game depending on the company you are applying to and what they expect your responsibilities will be. </p><p id="viewer-3hihv">For example, if you are applying to a more research-intensive machine learning position, you may be asked to explain research-caliber work (either yours or that of others). Or if you are going to be a machine learning engineer at a young company, you may have to be more familiar with the internals of a framework or technology stack that is in high-demand. It really depends.</p><p id="viewer-7annu">That being said, as the field has matured, we've seen that the responsibilities of these positions are getting more well-defined leading to more standardized assessment structures.</p><p id="viewer-ciu37">Nowadays for most machine learning engineer positions, you can expect your interview journey to look something like the following:</p><ul><li id="viewer-6irq6"><p>First screening call with a recruiter</p></li><li id="viewer-edt1j"><p>Technical phone interview covering some software engineering and machine learning theory</p></li><li id="viewer-e1103"><p>Onsite (~4-5 interviews)</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-esrfv">                - Software engineering principles (~2 interviews)</p><p id="viewer-62fec">                - Machine learning theory (~1 interviews)</p><p id="viewer-2ugbd">                - Machine learning system design (~1-2 interviews)</p><p id="viewer-es0je">                - Interview with management (cultural fit check, typical in startups)</p><p id="viewer-73jhi">This can be subject to change depending on the company, but we've largely seen that common format across interviews today. Now let's discuss what to expect in terms of specific skills being evaluated.</p><h3 id="viewer-avlia"><strong>Know your machine learning theory</strong></h3><p id="viewer-dob3m">When applying for machine learning jobs you will always be asked about machine learning theory. In a sense, this a "well duh" moment but the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/mlbook.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>machine learning</u></a> <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>theory</u></a> <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/prml-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>literature</u></a> is vast so knowing what to focus on rather than working through multiple 1000-page textbooks is the key question.</p><p id="viewer-et0di"> Conceptual questions are asked in one of two forms: 1) in the context of some larger problem (i.e. while describing a system design, discuss model tradeoffs) or 2) in isolation (i.e. spend 30+ minutes describing how your favorite supervised learning algorithm works).</p><p id="viewer-t28k">In either case, the types of questions and concepts you'll be asked about stay pretty consistent. Our survey of past machine learning interviews has shown that you will tend to be tested on topics such as the following:</p><p id="viewer-5srhm">	1) What is the bias-variance tradeoff?</p><p id="viewer-fo0au">	2) What is overfitting/underfitting and how do you know when your model is suffering from those issues?</p><p id="viewer-bg784">	3) How do you evaluate model performance (which metrics are used and why)?</p><p id="viewer-b17gt">	4) Can you explain how some classical machine learning models work (logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, decision trees, etc.)?</p><p id="viewer-2o3la">	5) What are common techniques for unsupervised learning?</p><p id="viewer-3sb7r">	6) How do you pick the best features for your model?</p><p id="viewer-b7b5m">That being said, because the collection of potential theory topics is so large, we've distilled the key concepts seen in interviews into a <a href="https://www.confetti.ai/assets/ml-primer/ml_primer.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>primer with practice exercises</u></a>. </p><h3 id="viewer-537k4"><strong>Software engineering is still important</strong></h3><p id="viewer-8v5gq">While the focus of machine learning jobs isn't just software engineering, you should still expect to be asked some more traditional coding and algorithms questions. These questions will be very similar, if not identical, to those you would be asked in a standard engineering interview. </p><p id="viewer-27v4b">Although this may seem unrelated to what you would think a machine learning practitioner does, when you are on the job knowing <em>how</em> to theoretically build a model is not the same as doing the actual building. This is true whether or not you are applying to be a machine learning scientist or a machine learning engineer. You need to be proficient in coding, debugging, and thinking through algorithms exercises. As an example of topics you can expect to be asked about:</p><p id="viewer-eal72">	1) Recursion and memoization (you'll basically never use recursion in the real world but 		   it's often used to evaluate your ability to think through an algorithm)</p><p id="viewer-cmind">	2) Memory and run-time complexity analysis</p><p id="viewer-d4m4q">	3) Standard data structures like trees, linked lists, hash maps, and general graphs</p><p id="viewer-9rse9">That being said, the standards for coding may not be the same in your interviews as they would be of someone applying for a pure software development position. In other words your engineering abilities might not need to be as sophisticated, especially if you are just coming out of an advanced graduate degree program in machine learning where your focus was more on pushing state-of-the-art rather than building robust training pipelines. </p><p id="viewer-dkeon">For software engineering, there are a number of popular <a href="http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>books</u></a> and <a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>services</u></a> that can help you practice these skills.</p><h3 id="viewer-76m1h"><strong>Know how to build machine learning systems</strong></h3><p id="viewer-ba220">Knowing how to architect machine learning systems is one of the most important skills you can have going into the field of machine learning. One of the big aspects of machine learning's evolution in the past 1-2 years is that companies are going all-in on integrating data-driven solutions to extract business value across their teams. At scale this can lead to <a href="https://www.kdd.org/kdd2019/accepted-papers/view/150-successful-machine-learning-models-6-lessons-learned-at-booking.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>tremendous improvements</u></a> in the quality of a service. </p><p id="viewer-2j318">When you are being brought into a team as a machine learning expert, the expectation is that you will be able to apply machine learning skills to improve some existing manual process. Oftentimes you will be presented with very vague problem descriptions (e.g. "I want these recommendations to be better") and you will have to break down and frame the problem in a form where machine learning is applicable.</p><p id="viewer-bj4et">This is the core of designing and architecting machine learning systems. This skill is among the most crucial ones that companies look for when evaluating candidates. A system design interview will involve being presented with a case study (e.g. "we want a tool that can help us detect offensive content on our platform") and then talking through how to set up a machine learning pipeline that can address the problem. Along the way you will be assessed on your ability to:</p><p id="viewer-b3dv8">	1) Gather and validate datasets needed for your models</p><p id="viewer-3ctv5">	2) Build training infrastructure</p><p id="viewer-actbm">	3) Discuss the tradeoffs among potential modelling solutions</p><p id="viewer-7bofr">	4) Know what metrics you will track for model performance</p><p id="viewer-5tid6">	5) Interpret model predictions and do error analysis</p><p id="viewer-b2nej">	6) Architect a deployment solution (e.g. cloud-based, on-device, etc.)</p><p id="viewer-3hr9b">	7) Iterate on user feedback to improve the solution</p><p id="viewer-2fn8e">The important thing to recognize in these types of interviews is that there is never one "correct" answer. Your interviewers are more interested in knowing how you think through a problem. You will be asked to justify your decisions and also adapt them based on new situations (e.g. "now imagine we don't have enough money to gather 1 million annotated images...").</p><p id="viewer-2plnr">When preparing for these types of interviews, there's no substitute for real-world experience. Build projects so you witness firsthand what tradeoffs are necessary to consider. If that's not possible, spend a lot of time reading through company use-cases and learning how others have <a href="https://github.com/eugeneyan/applied-ml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>solved similar problems</u></a>. </p><h3 id="viewer-44oq9"><strong>Technical interviews are just one signal</strong></h3><p id="viewer-dmrea">The last point worth mentioning is that while technical interviews are important signals in determining whether you get the job, they are still only one of many contributing signals.

                <div>
                  <p>When we started Reify, the idea was pretty simple – let’s take the experience we’ve gained as marketers at developer facing companies, and apply that knowledge to as many software companies as we can. Let’s raise the tide for everyone, and help everyone become better marketers. After more than 4 years and 75 clients, we’re extremely happy with the results, and it felt like the right time to take a step back, consider what we’ve accomplished and learned (and, glaringly, what mistakes we made), and try to do what every great marketer and consultant loves to do: define a framework.</p>

<p>Our first few clients, bless their souls, were very patient with us as we slowly but surely codified our methods. What started as a somewhat amorphous (but very enthusiastic, and usually quite successful somehow) “process” turned into a repeatable set of working sessions, asynchronous assignments for our clients, and research and synthesis on our parts. We figured out just the right way to start with the stakeholders, document their story, do the hard work, and then end up with a <em>messaging framework that succinctly and successfully communicated the value of the product</em>.</p>

<p>Once we settled on the basic outline of the process, we did it again. And again. And again. We’ve done this essential, foundational marketing engagement with more than 75 companies, from solo bootstrapped founders to public companies, and everything in-between. We expanded our initial notion of working with developer facing companies to working with a wide range of companies from <a href="https://testdouble.com/">award-winning software consultancies</a> to <a href="https://getchannels.com/">TV tech plays</a>, and even <a href="https://omg.network/">blockchain tech</a> (a category that barely existed when we started the company). We partnered with <a href="https://www.brightscout.com/">fabulous designers</a>, <a href="https://devrelate.io/">top content producers and community builders</a>, <a href="https://www.heavybit.com/">VC firms and event producers</a>, and we even started a <a href="https://epicconf.com/">little online conference with our friends.</a></p>

<p>Throughout all of this work, one thing remained very clear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nothing is more important than the story.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And so it was a few months back when Brian and I tried to finally put a name to this process we’ve developed that we settled on a name: The Value Story Framework (VSF). This post will focus on what the VSF is, and it will be followed by another post outlining how the VSF can be put to use in nearly any company to start with solid foundations, set reasonable goals, and execute marketing like a pro.</p>

<center><img src="https://www.reifyworks.com/images/vsf1.png"></center>



<h2 id="the-value-story-framework">The Value Story Framework</h2>

<p>The VSF has three concrete outputs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <em>value story</em>, which sums up the <em>Why</em> of the product</li>
  <li>The <em>refined persona</em>, which describes the <em>Who</em>, based on the essentials uncovered in the value story</li>
  <li>The <em>messaging framework</em>, which contains the words used to describe <em>What</em>, <em>Why</em>, and <em>How</em> to the refined persona</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the keys to the VSF is that <em>these outputs are entirely driven by inputs from the company’s key stakeholders</em>. We often tell our clients that they will have all of the good ideas during this process, and our job is to massage words, curate ideas, and present a complete, consistent package of ideas – something that can be difficult to do if you’ve never done it before.</p>

<p>The value story’s inputs come in the form of answering a series of questions about the origins of the company, focused initially on understanding <em>why</em> the people responsible for forming it came together. Beyond that, a timeline is established, and we also ask questions about other key factors: we get to know the competitive landscape a bit, we discuss important customers, and we discuss companies our clients admire and learn why.</p>

<p>Once we’ve established your <em>value story</em>, we move on to the <em>refined persona</em>. This persona document, which we’ve written about a few times over the years, is designed to allow you to focus in on what really matters when deciding what kind of marketing to do, when to do it, and what kind of content you need to produce. We ask stakeholders to list the key challenges of skills of the target persona, to consider what other tools they use and love, to tell us everything they know about what key roles and responsibilities that individual has at work. Once we’ve honed in on the <em>one initial persona</em> we’re going to use, we give it a memorable nickname and then move on to the part that most people actually think about when they think about marketing: messaging and positioning.</p>

<p>Our <em>messaging framework</em> itself is nothing unique – in fact we cribbed the structure of it by combining two different frameworks we found on the internet back when we were both marketing practitioners 5+ years ago. What does differentiate our process, however, is the process itself. While marketing is often done by thinking of cool sounding phrases and interesting angles first, and then matching the product’s marketing to it, we take the opposite approach.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use your story, focus on your persona, deliver your message</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We ask our clients to, <em>while considering the persona very closely</em>, produce lists of examples that support the basic argument that your product is a great fit for this persona. The messaging framework is assembled by combining existing facts about the product, aimed directly at the persona, in a way that leads us and the clients naturally to the great sounding slogans that companies often come to us in search of.</p>

<h2 id="prove-it">Prove it!</h2>

<p>We’ve been around a while, and worked with a decent number of clients you may have heard of, but the proof is in the pudding, right? How do you know that this stuff works at all? Beyond the fact that clients of ours who have used our frameworks directly have gone on to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital, added at least that much in revenue, come to dominate their own market niches, etc., nothing communicates out impact as effectively as their own words. To that end, here are some of our favorite client quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Reify’s marketing framework helped us discover and communicate the value of FireHydrant in a way that has really resonated with our core audience.” – Robert Ross, CEO, FireHydrant</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Determined AI is a technically complicated product, and communicating our value proposition early on was always a challenge. Reify’s frameworks helped us calibrate, and we went to market with messaging that helped us communicate clearly and effectively.” – <em>Evan Sparks, Founder and CEO, Determined AI</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Reify helped us develop a messaging framework that not only enabled us to level up how we communicate with our customers, but was also instrumental in telling the story that resulted in our recent Series A financing. We have a confidence and focus now that we didn’t before.” - <em>Caleb Hailey, CEO, Sensu</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And just because we love them so much, here are some of the great brand promises we’ve helped our clients come up with, in the context of any software company’s core marketing asset, the website homepage:</p>

<center><img src="https://www.reifyworks.com/images/hero_td.png"></center>

<center><img src="https://www.reifyworks.com/images/hero_stackbit.png"></center>

<p>And there are tons more.</p>

<h2 id="so--how-do-i-use-it">So … How Do I Use It?</h2>

<p>We’re working on a few different ways to share the VSF with the world. The first step will be a followup to this post, which will contextualize the Value Story, Refined Persona, and Messaging Framework in day to day marketing operations. After that, we’re planning on opening up a software platform version of our framework that will allow <em>anyone to leverage these tools</em> to become the awesome marketers we know they’re capable of. Yes, after all this time teaching people how to fish, we’re going to be fishing ourselves a bit – and making a small software product to sell to early marketing teams.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="article">
<p>Today is a big day for me as after many months (or years depending how you look at it), I've <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/brandvantage">finally launched the first product for my business, BrandVantage</a>.
This post is the story of how I started with one idea and ended up launching with a different one.</p>
<h2>The Original Idea: Let's build a digital brand expert!</h2>
<p>I worked as a web developer for a local web development agency for a number of years and in that time, I learnt a lot about how a variety of different businesses operated online.</p>
<p>There were a few key "problems" I found in common across many of those businesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under-utilising analytics</li>
<li>Misunderstanding analytics</li>
<li>Not keeping on top of industry information</li>
<li>Lack of competitor analysis/understanding</li>
<li>Difficulty with Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</li>
</ul>
<p>In moderate-to-large companies where you have marketing departments, most of this stuff can be covered by one or more staff dedicated to these things.
In smaller companies, the business owner is normally the one where these tasks fall on to, but they are already wearing many different hats.
It felt like something was here - if I could automate some of these tasks in different ways, I could both help business owners and earn myself some money along the way.</p>
<p>Automation of tasks, especially ones in analytics or SEO spaces, isn't a new idea.
In fact, I've seen many businesses in a similar space launch on Product Hunt over the years since starting, but that didn't deter me.
I was building <a href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/a+better+mousetrap"><em>a better mousetrap</em></a> and wanting to launch it at a lower price, not something truly innovative so it was going to be an uphill battle.
This area though, helping small businesses online be as efficient in tasks as some bigger businesses can, is something I felt passionately about so I proceeded anyway.</p>
<h3>Attempt One: Very Hacky (in PHP)</h3>
<p>Way back in 2015/16/17, while still at my full-time job, I spent nights and weekends building and tinkering on solutions to the problems business owners face.
It was a hacky PHP solution pulling real-time information from sources like Twitter, Google Analytics and Facebook.
A hacky approach seemed like a good idea as that seemed to be the way people launched things, do the quickest and hackiest thing you can to get it out the door.</p>
<p>While working on it, I had a few interested parties though what I built could barely be considered a prototype.
The thing was a mess.
I could do some basic queries, but it wasn't what I considered sellable and definitely not user-friendly, something I considered key to the product.
I was also running into technical problems with scale - any sufficiently complex query was performed real-time, which was getting more complicated.
Real-time processing had to be out.
I needed to pre-compute and store it in a database.</p>
<p>I wanted to take this more seriously and I didn't feel like a "quick and hacky" approach to building a product was right for me.
With this in mind, it seemed like a good opportunity to change the tech stack to something that would be better long term.</p>
<h3>Attempt Two: Slightly Less Hacky (in .NET)</h3>
<p>Moving to .NET felt like the smart move for me as at my job I had spent a lot more time working in .NET than PHP, plus I vastly prefered the tooling in .NET vs PHP.
That said, the .NET code I had worked on to-date would definitely be considered "legacy code".</p>
<p>My first version in .NET (specifically .NET Framework), predating my use of version control, was trying to keep costs low by using MySQL through Entity Framework.
After a lot of pain and suffering with that, I had a short stint of MSSQL before I settled upon MongoDB.</p>
<p>MongoDB might seem like a weird choice - there are some people that have very strong opinions about which type of database you should use.
Honestly it came down to a gut feel after messing around with it - it seemed more compatible to the way I was approaching problems than a relational database would.
I liked the code-first approach to Entity Framework so much though that I recreated the "feel" of Entity Framework for MongoDB with some custom code.
This later became an open source project of mine called <a href="https://www.mongoframework.com/">MongoFramework</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not going to lie, progress was... slow.
While I was putting quite a lot of time into working on it, it was still an extremely ambitious project.
I have strong feelings about building "MVPs" where some people focus too much on the "minimum" without enough focus on the "viable".
At the end of the day people buy products that meet their needs, and cutting too much out would meet no-ones needs.
If someone was going to use this, in a market with many competitors of varying quality, it had to do its job well.
There didn't seem much I could reasonably cut to make it any more minimal if I wanted people to buy it.</p>
<p>I kept working at it every night, building pieces to extract and store data from a variety of sources.
I was pulling in data from Google Analytics, Google Webmaster Tools (now called Google Search Console), Twitter, Facebook, IP Geolocation, DNS information and also from news articles.
What I thought I could do is once I had the different data sources together, I would write custom rules that could infer insights from individual or combined data sets.
These insights would form the basis of the "digital brand expert".
After all, that was the goal of the idea, something that could help out small business owners.</p>
<p>After 2 years of working on this in my spare time, it felt the right time to leave my job and go into this full time.
I felt like I was <em>so close</em> to launching and I just needed something more than the same day-to-day work.
So I did it - <a href="https://turnerj.com/blog/i-left-my-job-today-after-seven-years">I left my job after 7 years</a>.</p>
<h3>Going Full-time into the Idea</h3>
<p>Right out of the gate, I had moved from .NET Framework to .NET Core, was working on UI/UX improvements for the application and launched the website for it.
I worked with an accountant and a lawyer to setup the business, bought a trade mark for the product name, and I felt good like I was only a few months away from launching.
This feeling didn't last though...</p>
<p>Over time, it felt like I was taking two steps forward then one step back - some technical, some business related.
Sure, that is still progress, but having new issues crop up every day or so can really crush your motivation.</p>
<p>My best/happiest/most productive days were days I ignored or avoided different issues I had.
If I had a problem with the login system, I would focus on how the UX of the menus worked.
If I had a problem with data gathering, I would add more tests to the codebase.
While I didn't entirely ignore the problem, I would wait a week or two before I looked at it again, somewhat hoping it would solve itself - unfortunately that isn't how things work.</p>
<p>In time though, I got to a stage where it felt like I could launch and was hyping myself up until reality struck: I didn't actually build what I set out to build.</p>
<p>The UI/UX was good, I had strategies for deployment and plans for next steps, but it wasn't a "digital brand expert".
It was instead a glorified data store for information that people could better access through existing tools.
That's kinda a big problem!</p>
<p><img src="https://turnerj.com/blog/2020/images/a-better-mousetrap-ive-made-a-huge-mistake.gif" alt="Gob Bluth saying &quot;I've made a huge mistake.&quot; from the TV Show &quot;Arrested Development&quot;"></p>
<p>When realising this I poured time into fixing that huge lapse in judgement, but I couldn't do it.
No matter how I tried, I just couldn't figure out how to build this rules engine.
It was like my entire thought process was just clouded.
I couldn't see the solution to the problem like I can for most other things.</p>
<p>This was depressing and I ended up having a month or so hiatus from working on it.
When I have had stints of not feeling like or not being able to do programming in the past, I try and spur it on again by watching some show or movie which has some strong relation to technology (fictional or not).
My go-to is usually something like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/">Iron Man</a>, but this time I was rewatching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543312/">Halt and Catch Fire</a> where I found some inspiration.</p>
<h2>The Pivot: An API to the Internet</h2>
<p>Later in the series a lot of the focus is around the Web, and it was in these episodes where my thoughts about the Internet and the data on it have changed.
There is a quote from one of the main characters at the end of Season 3 that resonates with me:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>"The moment we decide what the Web is, we've lost. The moment we try to tell people what to do with it, we've lost.
All we have to do is build a door and let them inside."</p>
<p>- Joe MacMillan (Season 3, Episode 10)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Internet is a treasure trove of information, it is searchable but generally unstructured.
People have managed to create all sorts of different pages in HTML, but in the process of making a website everything is designed for a human user.
It is this way for obvious reasons, <em>we</em> are the consumers of web pages after all... aren't we?</p>
<p>Behind these user-friendly web pages are usually other specific bits of markup, providing some level of structured data for specific situations.
Sometimes it is a description metatag for search engines, other times it might be <a href="https://ogp.me/">Open Graph</a> metatags for social media links.
We build these things to help aid computers processing our web pages.</p>
<p>In 2011, <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a> was created.
This was a collaborative effort between Google, Bing and Yahoo (later that year, Yandex as well) with the mission to "create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond".
Through 3 different encodings (<a href="https://turnerj.com/blog/what-is-microdata-and-why-should-i-care">Microdata</a>, <a href="http://rdfa.info/">RDFa</a> and <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>), websites could express detailed structured data.</p>
<p>There is another quote from Halt and Catch Fire which I like:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Computers aren't the thing. They're the thing that gets us to the thing."</p>
<p>- Joe MacMillan (Season 1, Episode 1)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>As much as I like computers and programming, they are used to help us achieve other goals.
From my attempts of trying to build a "digital brand expert", I knew that data is fundamental to help build more advanced systems and give new insights.
Having easier access to other forms of data from web pages around the world may allow new and different tools to be built.</p>
<p>So I decided rather than try and solve a problem that I was clouded by, I …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The last few years have seen rapid automation of many Systems Administration/DevOps tasks. The new mantra is if you need to ssh to a server, your automation is not working right. But even for the occasional ssh access to the servers, the SSH authentication must be managed. Over the years, SSH has added many new features/techniques to enhance authentication and put some governance around it. This article is about the use of SSH Certificate-based authentication and why every organization, using SSH, must use it.</p><p>SSH Key-based authentication (aka passwordless login) has been with us for over two decades now. The mechanism works based on public-key cryptography. One adds his/her RSA/DSA key to the authorized_keys file on the server. The user with the corresponding private key can login without a password. It works great except for a few fundamental problems:</p><ol><li>When a user accesses the server using ssh for the first time, s/he always gets Trust On First Use (TOFU) warning.</li></ol><pre><code>$ ssh -l alice mavrix5.dbsentry.com
The authenticity of host 'mavrix5.dbsentry.com (72.191.40.116)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:PoK81UWgOBMn6owOoHXjGoBLWqcJ4E9JCiLQyiFF60s.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? 
</code></pre><p>As the server is not trusted at this point, theoretically a man-in-the-middle attack could be launched. I tried to find damaging incidents of such attacks on the internet but could not find any. Nevertheless, the possibility exists and we’d be better off getting rid of this warning.</p><ol start="2"><li>When the number of servers increases, authorized_keys files proliferate and they are hard to manage. Moreover, once added they are active perpetually and have to be removed manually to block access to its corresponding private key. That is probably the reason why many security guys frown on the use of authorized_keys.</li></ol><p>Fortunately, the newer version of SSH included many improvements that give us the ability to centralize and better manage authorized_keys using <code>AuthorizedKeysCommand</code>. However, the TOFU remains. Although the solutions exist in either the use of SSHFP or SSH Certificates, their usage never caught on.</p><p>Having said that, in addition to taking care of TOFU, SSH Certificates have many more advantages/features (for e.g. certificate expiration, use of principals, etc) that enhance SSH authentication governance and should be used by all organizations that use SSH.</p><p>Instead of using complex X.509 style certificates, SSH chose to use their own simpler format of certificates, which can be easily managed using CLI <code>ssh-keygen</code>. In order to use SSH certificate-based authentication one needs to set up SSH Certificate Authority (CA). So, how does one set up SSH CA?</p><p>SSH Certificate authority can be setup on any computer with <code>ssh-keygen</code>. It is a key pair that is used to sign SSH Public Keys to generate certificates. It is recommended to set up two pairs of CA keys: one for host certificates and others for user’s certificates.</p><p>Use <code>ssh-keygen</code> to genearet CA Keys:</p><pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ca_host_key
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ca_user_key
</code></pre><p>The above would generate two pairs of SSH Keys. for e.g.</p><pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ca_host_key
Generating public/private rsa key pair.

</code></pre><p>Optional: In addition you can also setup SSH Key Revocation List (KRL). This is a list of all revoked certificates.</p><pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -k -f ca_krl
</code></pre><p>And, thats it. your SSH CA is in business. Now, going forward, you just need to configure your servers and clients to use certificates with private keys.</p><h2 id="ssh-server-configuration">SSH Server Configuration</h2><p>Follow these steps to configure host to use SSH certificates:</p><ol><li>Copy your servers SSH Public Key, typically located under <code>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub</code> or <code>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.pub</code> and get it signed.</li></ol><pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -h -s ca_host_key -z &lt;serial no.&gt; -I &lt;hostname&gt; -V &lt;duration&gt; -n &lt;principal list&gt; ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
</code></pre><p>for e.g</p><pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -vvv -h -s ca_host_key -z 100 -I mavrix2 -V +52w -n mavrix2,mavrix2.dbsentry.com ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub
Signed host key ssh_host_ed25519_key-cert.pub: id "mavrix2" serial 100 for mavrix2,mavrix2.dbsentry.com valid from 2020-10-30T14:46:00 to 2021-10-29T14:47:02
</code></pre><ol start="2"><li>Copy the certifcate back to the host under <code>/etc/ssh</code></li><li>Copy CA User Public Key(<code>ca_user_key.pub</code>) to the host under <code>/etc/ssh</code></li><li>Add the following to <code>sshd_conf</code> file:</li></ol><pre><code>TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/ca_user_key.pub
HostCertificate /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key-cert.pub
</code></pre><p><code>TrustedUserCAKeys</code> directs SSH to trust certificates signed by <code>ca_user_key</code>. And, <code>HostCertificate</code> directs SSH to send the host certificate instead of public key to the client.
5. Restart SSH</p><pre><code>$ sudo systemctl restart sshd

October 30, 2020 | https://www.causal.app/blog/saas-vs-subscription | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.causal.app/blog/saas-vs-subscription">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Note:&nbsp;this was originally published at </em><a href="https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/" target="_blank"><em>https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/</em></a></p><p>The three key characteristics of a SaaS company are: subscription, high margin, and scalability. There are so many new business models and new applications of existing business models into new markets that capture one or two of these, but in order to get the high multiples that SaaS companies achieve, it's critical to have all three. In addition, the "rule of thumb" metrics that I previously mentioned don't work so well in the absence of any of these characteristics. While the fundamental subscription math remains true, you have to dig much deeper to understand the impact on the cash flows, working capital needs, scalability, customer lifetime value and long term profitability to be able to assess the health and viability of a business.</p><p>For example, if we look at <a href="https://www.lemonade.com/">Lemonade</a>, which priced its IPO today (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1691421/000104746920003943/a2242013z424b4.htm">424B4 here</a>). Lemonade is a technology-enabled insurance company and insurance broker. I think most people would agree that it is not a software company. But if we look through the lens of these three characteristics and some of the key metrics, we can learn a lot about its long term prospects as a business.</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Subscription:</strong> Insurance is probably one of the original subscription businesses, with people paying annual or monthly premiums. Revenue comes in regularly to support the clients’ claims.</li><li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Assuming there's access to re-insurance and the capital to back up the insurance plans, this business is highly scalable and in a huge market.</li><li><strong>Margins:</strong> This is where it gets a bit more complicated. This is not a 90% margin, AWS-expense only business. It's a complicated financial cycle and risk assessment business with very different capital, accounting and cash flow dynamics. Lemonade runs a few different businesses with varying risk ownership which have an impact on gross profit, and overall they achieved a gross margin of 17% in 2019.</li></ol><p>Now let's take a look at some of the key metrics:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>LTV</strong>: In most software businesses, especially those either creating or selling into new markets, it's almost impossible to calculate a lifetime value because we don't have enough data on the lifetime of a customer. In the insurance business, there's tons of data going back decades for hundreds of millions of people. Insurance companies run on actuarial science, which one could argue is the original data science application. To put it lightly, they understand data and have lots of it. While in a new-fangled enterprise or consumer software business, lifetime value is a shot in the dark, in the insurance business it's not, where it's reasonable to expect your customers to stay with you for 25+ years.</li><li><strong>CAC Payback</strong>: Knowing you can keep your customers for a very long time is great and now you can calculate the CAC you can afford to invest in order to acquire them. Lemonade runs efficiently now with $1 of marketing to $2 of in-force premium on their platform. Gross margin-adjusted this obviously shifts the timeline out, but that's OK because the likelihood of keeping the customers for a long time is high. This introduces a new question: capital. With short paybacks, cash management isn't so much of a challenge, but as those payback times increase, so does the need to fund the working capital needs of the business. The time value of money becomes a factor here, but is manageable and calculable.</li></ol><p>So a quick look through the lens of the fundamental subscription concepts makes it clear that even though Lemonade is not a software business, it is a subscription business with some highly favorable business and customer economics.</p><p>And congrats to the Lemonade team on the IPO!</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5f6128d02bc85546e3a93976_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Faa34c7a7-d833-453f-a3cb-79b88beb7eda_1536x1025.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This post outlines the lessons learned during the research on the security of real-life OpenID Connect implementations.
We presume basic knowledge of OpenID Connect 1.0 and OAuth 2.0 for this post.</p>
<p>First, we outline a high-level overview of the selection criteria. Afterward, we describe patterns that were regularly observed during the analysis of real-life OpenID Connect Service Provider and Identity Provider implementations.
Finally, proposals for adjusted security considerations regarding the OpenID Connect specification are derived.</p>
<h2 id="high-level-setup-and-selection-of-implementations">High-Level Setup and Selection of Implementations</h2>
<p>During the analysis, we evaluated OIDC Identity Provider and Service Provider implementations regarding a defined set of assertions, based on the specification’s security considerations [2, Section 16][3] and the OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practices [1]. In doing so, we analyzed self-hosted software <em>and</em> hosted services. For Service Providers, we considered the ability to configure custom Identity Providers as mandatory.</p>
<p>The following software and services were analyzed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.keycloak.org/">Keycloak (Red Hat)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket">Bitbucket Server (Atlassian)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce Lightning</a></li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Amazon Cognito (AWS)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="derived-issue-patterns">Derived Issue Patterns</h2>
<p>In the following, we outline <em>seven</em> issue patterns that we derived within our test-set.  <br>
<em>Reminder: This post aims to give an overview. We discuss novel patterns and the most relevant observations in detail in dedicated posts.</em></p>
<h3 id="pattern-1-redirect-uri-schemes">Pattern 1: Redirect URI Schemes</h3>
<p>The OpenID Connect Core specification is quite vague regarding allowed schemes for <code>redirect_uri</code> values, see [2, Section 3.1.2.1]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>REQUIRED. Redirection URI to which the response will be sent. This URI MUST exactly match one of the Redirection URI values for the Client pre-registered at the OpenID Provider, with the matching performed as described in Section 6.2.1 of [RFC3986] (Simple String Comparison). When using this flow, the Redirection URI <strong>SHOULD use the https scheme</strong>; however, <strong>it MAY use the http scheme</strong>, provided that the Client Type is confidential, as defined in Section 2.1 of OAuth 2.0, and provided the OP allows the use of http Redirection URIs in this case. The Redirection URI <strong>MAY use an alternate scheme</strong>, such as one that is intended to identify a callback into a native application.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We observed that multiple Identity Providers support pre-registering <code>redirect_uri</code> values with any possible scheme. Such schemes' support is potentially dangerous, as browsers treat risky schemes like <em>data</em> or <em>javascript</em> very differently (some of my test cases can be found <a href="https://security.lauritz-holtmann.de/files/evaluation_results.xlsx">here</a>, recently <em>quinn</em> found an interesting vector for Firefox using the <a href="https://www.gremwell.com/firefox-xss-302"><em>ws</em> scheme</a>).  <br>
Additionally, the specification defined the <code>redirect_uri</code> vague because it had native clients in mind. There are very few legitimate use-cases for these schemes as <code>redirect_uri</code> values in OpenID Connect setups.</p>
<h3 id="pattern-2-server-side-request-forgery">Pattern 2: Server-Side-Request-Forgery</h3>
<p>Multiple Identity and Service Provider implementations were vulnerable to different types of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities.
The Identity Provider’s <code>request_uri</code> parameter is already known to be vulnerable for SSRF by design since 2017 [4, Section III;A. 8)]. Notably, this vulnerability could be exploited by any unauthenticated user.</p>
<p>In 2017, Mladenov and Mainka pointed out [5, Section 2.1.2] that a malicious <em>Discovery Service</em> could be used to launch a SSRF attack against a Service Provider. Thus, the attacker can use SSRF for port scans or for retrieving data.
Additionally, having access to the endpoint configuration, administrative users could launch SSRF attacks on the Service Provider by design. Depending on the actual setup, this yields to severe security implications, especially considering hosted and <em>cloud</em> services.</p>
<p>Even though these issues were theoretically discussed earlier, SSRF to <em>private IPs</em> or <em>localhost</em> was a common and serious issue among our test-set.</p>
<h3 id="pattern-3-tls-enforcement">Pattern 3: TLS Enforcement</h3>
<p>The OpenID Connect Core specification already enforces TLS for communication with <em>Authentication</em>, <em>Token</em>, and <em>UserInfo Endpoint</em>, so does the OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration regarding the <em>Client Configuration Endpoint</em>. Nevertheless, most of the analyzed implementations allowed performing the discovery using unencrypted communication or allowed to specify OpenID Connect endpoints using HTTP without TLS.</p>
<h3 id="pattern-4-leakage-via-error-pages">Pattern 4: Leakage via Error Pages</h3>
<p>Error messages and pages need extra attention. We discovered that multiple Service Provider implementations presented error pages as a direct response to  <em>Authentication Responses</em> [2, Section 3.1.2.5.]. As a result, this page’s GET parameters include OpenID Connect values like <code>state</code> and <code>code</code>.  External resources like images, scripts, styles, or links to external resources on can be on any endpoint. In these cases, the attacker can retrieve sensitive information, including OpenID Connect parameters, in query parameters or the <code>Referer header</code>. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="pattern-5-csrf">Pattern 5: CSRF</h3>
<p>The Service Provider’s <em>Initiate Login Endpoint</em> implements Login Cross-Site-Request-Forgery (CSRF) by design and per specification [2, Section 4.]. This behavior is well known and was previously discussed [4, Section III; A. 7)].
Besides this endpoint, we observed non-normative endpoints that start an external OpenID Connect login without CSRF protection as well. If the <code>state</code> is correctly validated, these endpoints still allow to log in a victim End-User into her own account ("<em>Login CSRF</em>").</p>
<p>If there are additional non-normative parameters that indicate where the End-User should be redirected to after successful authentication (i.e., “next”, “nextUrl”, …) and these parameters allow specifying the
<em>Login Initiation Endpoint</em> or non-normative endpoints that start external OIDC login flows, <strong>Login Confusion attacks</strong> are possible. Technical details for this novel attack will be given in the next post of this series.</p>
<h3 id="pattern-6-state-parameter-handling">Pattern 6: State parameter handling</h3>
<p>OpenID Connect <code>state</code> parameter handling at the Service Provider’s <em>Redirection Endpoint</em> showed multiple more common issues. Some of the analyzed implementations did not handle the unexpected behavior of not receiving a <code>state</code> within the <em>Authentication Response</em> if it was present within the <em>Authentication Request</em>. As a result, unhandled exceptions occurred. Depending on the actual implementation, this may lead to sensitive information disclosure or availability issues.
Further, multiple implementations correctly bound the <code>state</code> to the user session. Still, they failed to make it one-time-usable, increasing the attack surface for token-reuse and Denial-of-Service Amplification attacks (we give the technical details behind this attack in a future blog post).</p>
<h3 id="pattern-7-injection-of-metacharacters">Pattern 7: Injection of Metacharacters</h3>
<p>Service Providers often treat contents provided by Identity Providers as trustworthy. In our research, we show that this behavior in general yields injection issues (previously outlined as “Injection Attacks” by Mainka et al. in [5, Section 2.1.3]).
Striking among the test-set were <em>CRLF</em>-related issues, as missing sanitization can lead to HTTP header injections in Service Provider initiated requests and injections to application log files.</p>
<h2 id="derived-openid-connect-security-considerations">Derived OpenID Connect Security Considerations</h2>
<p>In addition to previously known security considerations [1][2, Section 16.][5], it has been shown that the following aspects need extra attention. Some of these considerations have been made earlier but with a less severe indication. In terms of RFCs and specifications, this would mean that a “MAY” or “SHOULD” would become a “MUST”.</p>
<ol>
<li>The specification needs to be tightened regarding the <code>redirect_uri</code> definition. This URI scheme should NOT be <em>data</em>, <em>javascript</em>, <em>vbscript</em>, or any other scheme that is not <em>HTTP(S)</em> or related to a dedicated native client.</li>
<li>The Identity Provider SHOULD restrict allowed <code>request_uri</code> values by allowing the Service Provider to specify the <code>request_uris</code> parameter that is an “[…] array of request_uri values […]”, at registration [6, Section 2.].
Currently, only if the OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration is used, the Identity Provider can require the Service Provider to “[…] pre-register <code>request_uri</code> values using the <code>request_u…</code></li></ol></section></article></div></div>

<h2 id="encode-url">Encode URL</h2>
<p>Javascript has 2 functions that help you encode a URL:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>encodeURI()</code>: encode a full URL. It doesn't encode <code>~!@#$&amp;*()=:/,;?+'</code> </li>
<li><code>encodeURIComponent()</code>: encode a part of the URL. It doesn't encode <code>-_.!~*'()</code> </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="decode-url">Decode URL</h2>
<p>Javascript provides <code>decodeURI()</code> and <code>decodeURIComponent()</code>to decode a URL. You can use them to decode the corresponding encoding function's result</p>
<pre><code><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>decodeURI</span><span>(</span><span>"https://phongduong.dev/blog/ki%E1%BB%83m%20tra%20ti%E1%BA%BFng%20Vi%E1%BB%87t"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>

<p><strong>MPEG is releasing three new video codecs in 2020-2021 called Versatile Video Coding (H.266), Essential Video Coding (EVC MPEG-5 Part 1), and Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding (LCEVC MPEG-5 Part 2). Let’s take a look at the highlights of each of these codecs and what they bring to the table.</strong></p>




<h2 id="video-compression-is-critical-to-your-infrastructure"><span id="Video_Compression_is_Critical_To_Your_Infrastructure"></span>Video Compression is Critical To Your Infrastructure<span></span></h2>



<p>Video traffic is growing by the day and that is not going to stop any time soon. The pandemic might have stymied other industries, but, has actually given a filip to the streaming industry, because people are stuck indoors, and watching videos provides a much-needed escape from the daily routine!</p>



<p>Video Compression is a critical component in the video delivery pipeline and can make a massive make-or-break impression in the minds of the end-user. If you “tune” your encoders to maximize video quality, you’ll have to compromise on compression efficiency and spend more bits; and vice-versa. If you compromise on compression efficiency and create larger files, then you will have to spend more on CDN delivery costs.</p>



<p>So, the goal of every encoder team is to create a fine-balance between quality and bitrate. In other words, balance video quality with dollars.</p>



<p>The easiest way to perform this balancing act is to upgrade to the best encoder or encoding technology on the market. Hypothetically, this is simple, but practically, this is difficult. You need to make sure that the quality-complexity-efficiency trade-offs are met and decoder support is available amongst other things.</p>



<h2 id="the-failure-of-hevc"><span id="The_Failure_of_HEVC"></span>The Failure of HEVC<span></span></h2>



<p>When we talk about encoders, the discussion isn’t complete without mentioning H.264/AVC which is still ruling supreme since its introduction by MPEG (in 2003, I think). The MPEG announced a successor to H.264/AVC and called it H.265/HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) that had a slew of new coding tools such as quadtree decomposition, new picture types, SAO filtering, etc.</p>



<p>However, HEVC turned out to be a flop and the failure of HEVC had almost nothing to do with the algorithms. For HEVC R&amp;D teams, getting 20-30% gains over AVC was easy. </p>



<p><strong>You may disagree, but, as someone who wrote HEVC code for years, I stand by what I said.</strong></p>



<p>The “failure” of MPEG’s H.265/HEVC was due to patent-pools and licensing issues and this created the need for a new codec to fill the gap left by HEVC and to replace H.264/AVC (which by-design will struggle to compress 4K, UHD, and large resolutions).</p>



<p>In this regards, MPEG has announced that three new video codecs will soon be standardized and they are :-</p>



<ul><li>Versatile Video Coding (H.266)</li><li>Essential Video Coding (EVC MPEG-5 Part 1)</li><li>Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding (LCEVC MPEG-5 Part 2)</li></ul>



<p>Let’s take a quick look at the objective of each of these codecs and see what gap they’re trying to plug, shall we?</p>

<p>Touted as a successor to HEVC, the Versatile Video Coding standard has a lofty goal of achieving at least a 30% improvement in compression efficiency over HEVC. This should be doable considering the allowance of the “10x complexity increase” that the committee has provided.</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/sites/default/files/files/standards/parts/docs/w17074.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the MPEG Requirements document</a>&nbsp;for VVC (H.266), a few interesting points stand out with regards to compression efficiency, coding complexity, etc.</p>



<ul><li><strong>A substantial improvement in compression efficiency compared to HEVC Main Profile is required for the target application(s);</strong>&nbsp;at no point of the entire bit rate range shall it be worse than existing standard(s).&nbsp;<strong>30% bitrate reduction for the same perceptual quality is sufficient for some important use-cases and may justify a future video coding standard</strong>. Other use-cases may require higher bit-rate reductions such as 50%.</li><li><strong>Encoding complexity of approximately 10 times or more than that of HEVC</strong>&nbsp;is acceptable for many applications.</li><li><strong>The standard shall enable the use of efficient prediction structures (e.g. so-called open groups of pictures) without compromising from the fast and seamless representation switching capability between representations of different properties, such as different spatial resolutions.</strong></li><li>Support for&nbsp;<strong>progressive scanning shall be required for all Profiles and Levels</strong>.</li></ul>



<p>What stands out to me the most in the Requirements document are the references to “<strong>fast-switching</strong>” and “<strong>progressive scanning</strong>“. This is a clear indication of the importance that the MPEG body is placing on OTT streaming&nbsp;<em>(and the implicit absence of interlaced video in OTT)</em>.</p>



<p>This was a HUGE problem in HEVC where interlaced support was an after-thought; and it lead to a lot of code-wrangling to retro-fit interlaced support into commercial codecs. I hope VVC does not tread the same interlaced path.</p>



<p>The second comment about fast-switching is interesting and might put pressure on codec vendors to insert more IDRs in the bitstream to support smaller segment sizes and clean, fast, switching between profiles in the ABR bitrate ladder. The reference to open-gops is interesting, because Open-GOPs are very helpful in increasing compression efficiency – so this is something fun to watch out for.</p>



<p>Whenever a discussion about MPEG’s video codecs comes up, the elephant in the room has to be&nbsp;<strong>licensing</strong>. Fraunhofer HHI said in their&nbsp;<a href="https://newsletter.fraunhofer.de/-viewonline2/17386/465/11/14SHcBTt/V44RELLZBp/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newsletter</a>&nbsp;that,</p>



<blockquote><p>A uniform and transparent licensing model based on the FRAND principle (i.e., fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory) is planned to be established for the use of standard essential patents related to H.266/VVC. For this purpose, the Media Coding Industry Forum (MC-IF) was founded.</p></blockquote>



<p>I hope VVC pans out because I’d love to see it in action crunching 4K/8K videos!</p>

<h2 id="essential-video-coding---evc-mpeg-5-part-1"><span id="Essential_Video_Coding_%E2%80%93_EVC_(MPEG5_Part_1)"></span>Essential Video Coding – EVC (MPEG-5 Part 1)<span></span></h2>



<p>MPEG-5 EVC or Essential Video Coding is an MPEG standard backed by Samsung, Huawei, Qualcomm, Divideon as a response to the patent pool mess that HEVC ran it that essentially stymied large-scale adoption of a powerful video compression standard.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/sites/default/files/files/standards/parts/docs/w17928.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requirements of the EVC standard</a>&nbsp;were very clearly specified by MPEG as follows –</p>



<ul><li>The test model should consist of two tool sets:&nbsp;<strong>a base and an enhanced tool set</strong></li><li>The base tool set should be configured with tools that were made public more than 20 years ago or for which a Type 1 declaration is received</li><li>There should be additional tools in the enhanced tool set, each of which shall provide a significant improvement in coding efficiency and be capable of being cleanly switched off on an individual basis</li></ul>



<p>EVC’s aim is crystal-clear – provide a royalty-free option for content producers while also providing adequate tools, algorithms, and knobs to produce higher quality video (than the base tool set). And, the enhancement layer’s tools (also referred to as the Main layer) will be subject to royalties.</p>



<p>Sounds good, eh?</p>

<p>It is also interesting to note the following sentence from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibc.org/download?ac=10463" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IBC 2019 paper on EVC</a>&nbsp;and I quote,</p>



<blockquote><p>No considerations have been taken on licensing aspects of the technology other than a requirement for FRAND commitment by the contributors.&nbsp;<strong>Commercial aspects, and in particular, licensing aspects have been handled externally and independently of MPEG.</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>They’ve been handled, huh? Okay cool, but I still cross my fingers and say a prayer when I hear “MPEG” and “Licensing” in the same sentence.</p>



<p>Let’s hope that EVC is adopted and supported in the industry quickly – its a good concept and means well.</p>



<p>In a future article, we will do a deep dive into the tools supported in the Base and the Main layers of EVC.</p>



<p><strong>Reference</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibc.org/download?ac=10463" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Emerging MPEG-5 EVC Standard – Applications, Technology, and Results presented at IBC 2019</a></p>



<h2 id="low-complexity-enhancement-video-coding---lcevc-mpeg-5-part-2"><span id="Low_Complexity_Enhancement_Video_Coding_%E2%80%93_LCEVC_(MPEG5_Part_2)"></span>Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding – LCEVC (MPEG-5 Part 2)<span></span></h2>



<p>MPEG-5 Part 2 LCEVC is being introduced with the aim of increased compression efficiency for existing codecs at little or no-increase in coding complexity by using a base bitstream and an enhancement bitstream.</p>



<p>The LCEVC codec’s output is essentially a combination of a “base bitstream” produced by an existing video codec such as AVC, HEVC, VP9, AV1, etc. along with enhancement layers that can be used conditionally to improve the quality of the video.</p>



<p>If the decoder/end-device supports LCEVC, the enhancement layers are decoded, else, the base codec alone is used to decode the bitstream and the video is rendered to the user. This ensures backward-compatibility and encourages roll-out of the LCEVC codec without the fear of breaking the end-user’s experience.</p>



<p>This concept is nicely captured in the figure below taken from Guido Meardi’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/Workshops-and-Seminars/20191008/Documents/Guido_Meardi_Presentation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presentation</a>&nbsp;at the ITU Workshop on the Future of Media in Geneva.</p>

<p>On a final note, V-Nova has been instrumental in driving the LCEVC standard through their research and work on the Perseus codec. More information on that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.v-nova.com/v-nova-video-compression-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>



<h2 id="what-next"><span id="What_Next"></span>What Next?<span></span></h2>



<p>I think 2020 and 2021 present great challenges and opportunities for the field of video compression.</p>



<p>With consumption increasing due to the COVID-19 situation, most content providers are under the gun to reduce their streaming costs. Dropping the bitrates is one way of reducing your streaming costs, but, conversely, it will be hard to compete with the likes of Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Peacock, fuboTV, DAZN with poor video quality.</p>



<p>If the compression experts can pull off VVC’s goals of 30% bitrate savings over HEVC, then it will be a huge win. The only thing they’ll have to ensure is that they don’t blow their foot off with licensing issues (<em>a-la-HEVC</em>). If things work out properly, VVC should be a good competitor to AV1 especially at high resolutions such as 4K and 8K.</p>



<p><em><strong>However</strong></em>, that being said, I think that among the three codecs …</p></div></div>

Chaotic. Surprising. Uncertain. It is full of new things — many of which can kill us. And that’s a problem, because we humans tend to prefer not dying. Fortunately, we have been practicing surviving for quite some time and have developed a way to&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@beatsbyvanity/jordan-b-peterson-how-to-organize-your-life-for-success-d49cf42569ba">cut down on that chaos with a bit of order</a>: the ability to form habits. However, and unfortunately for those humans looking for more in life than just survival, these habits often have more control over us than we have control over them.</p><p>So what are habits and why do they control us?&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thebehavioralscientist.com/blog/your-house-is-holding-you-back-seriously">Jason Hreha</a>, a behavioral scientist who writes about life and business, summarizes that “habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.” They are unconscious programs that free up our conscious mind to solve those non-recurring new problems that are constantly thrown our way. It’s too mentally expensive to try to figure out what you should do every day when you get home from work — its much easier to have a program that loads without you knowing and tells you to change clothes. Putting on running shoes loads the running program. Smelling alcohol loads the drinking program. The important take away is that whether you notice them or not, the habits are running. This means that, for better or for worse, your habits are in charge of who you are in the future.</p><p>Fortunately, humans are conscious (which at times has its benefits). We can consciously uninstall bad old habits while installing new, better ones. This can push us towards a better version of our future self. In order to do so, Clear suggests we need to realize that 1) habits are best changed by a change in your&nbsp;<em>targeted</em>&nbsp;identity as opposed to goals alone and 2) your system of habits is far more important than your goals — you do not rise to the level of your goals, but instead fall to the level of your systems. These two points are also interconnected — our future identity is a lagging indicator of today’s systems. The only way you are a healthy person today is to have followed a system leading up to now that was that of a healthy person.</p><p>It is much easier for a&nbsp;<em>runner</em>&nbsp;to wake up early in the morning and head out into the rain before work than it is for a businessman wanting to get in shape. A&nbsp;<em>musician</em>&nbsp;can’t help but to find time to practice his violin, but the overloaded college student who wants to be able to play her favorite songs can easily find things get in the way. The runner and musician have no choice but to act in ways that are aligned with who they are. But how do you convince yourself that you are a runner or musician?</p><p>That is where the importance of your system comes into play. People often view themselves as a single entity, but we are in fact a new person every day we wake up. Today’s actions are votes for tomorrow’s me. Smoking a cigarette is a vote to be a future cigarette smoker. Remembering to kiss your wife in the morning is a vote to be a future loving husband. In the short term, you need the willpower to drive you. Eventually, the need for willpower falls away because your identity compels you into action. That sounds nice, for sure, but how does this all actually work in practice?</p><p>The first step is understanding how habits form — and they form thanks to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brainfacts.org/thinking-sensing-and-behaving/learning-and-memory/2018/motivation-why-you-do-the-things-you-do-082818">dopamine reward system</a>&nbsp;our brains use to program our actions. Clear lays out this “habit loop” as occurring in four phases — there are cues, cravings, responses and rewards. Check out the summary in the notes linked at the top of this post for more specifics, but in short, things in your environment remind your brain of a time it received a dopamine spike, prompting it to replay the actions that caused the dopamine spike most consistently when you were previously in a similar situation.</p><p>So how do you take advantage of your brain’s pathway for programing you? With the simple idea of making it easy. Your brain doesn’t “actually want the habit itself. What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers. The greater the obstacle — that is, the more difficult the habit — the more friction there is between you and your desired end state. This is why it is crucial to make your habits so easy that you’ll do them even when you don’t feel like it.” You need to make the habit cycle easy for those habits voting for the better future you and difficult for those voting for a diminished future you.</p><p>The “environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior,” meaning that time and place drive your actions more than anything. When you walk into the kitchen, do you automatically open the refrigerator door without thinking? When you check an email on your phone, do you also open all your social media even though you weren’t planning on it? You need to&nbsp;<a href="https://jamesclear.com/habits-scorecard">take stock of these cues</a>&nbsp;and the associated habits before you can start to make changes. What do you do everyday and what triggers the loading of those programs?</p><p>This is not easy — remember your habits are unconscious. That means even if you are paying attention, you are going to miss habits. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try. And you’ll get better the more you try. As the first step, you need to look at yourself as if you are another person. Take the time to watch yourself, asking “why did I just do that?” It is impossible to do this constantly, but sit down and replay parts of your day when you did things you are proud of and those you are not. See what cues caused you to act as you did. Make sure to notice if another habit was the cue for your action — is there a chain of habits getting you to where you ended up? It takes time, but you’ll learn a lot about yourself.</p><p>After you have figured those out, you need to put yourself in an environment where it is obvious what you want yourself to do. This is where preparation and willpower today can change who you are in the future. It’s almost like time travel — low budget of course, but still effective. Do you need to take medicine every morning? Put it next to your toothbrush. Do you need to wake up in the morning at a certain time. Put an alarm clock in another room that is set to automatically go off. Today’s you just changed tomorrow’s you.</p><p>Another powerful result from understanding your cues is recognizing when something in the environment is the cue for a bad habit. When your friends go out for a smoke, do you always stand up to go when they ask? Now that you have noticed why you are pulling out that pack of cigarettes, you can decide if you are fine with it or would like to change it. Want to override it? Force yourself to pull out flashcards for a new language every time they ask. If you are consistent, a new positive habit has hijacked an old one because you paid attention to how your environment was pulling you along.</p><p>And this all sounds terribly difficult, doesn’t it? That’s the opposite of easy, which is what we were going for. And this is why it is important to start small. Reading a new book every week sounds like a great habit. But it’s an impossibly difficult first step. Start with reading a page a day — see where that takes you. Maybe that is too hard because you are tired when you get home. In that case, start with sitting in a chair holding a book for 2 minutes a day. Make it easy to start. Starting to run is the opposite of fun and easy. Start with putting running shoes on every morning. Eventually you might even step outside. While you are there, maybe your brain might say “why not take a walk?” Walks can take a while, so why not just jog a little? A month later it is second nature to go out and run to the best your health will allow. If you had never started small, a month later you would still just be browsing social media.</p><p>Starting small can also help prevent us from failing into the trap of constantly preparing to act perfectly and, as a result, never acting. To steal from Robert Watson-Watt, “&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/health-family/don-t-try-to-be-the-best-just-be-good-enough-1.4012523">give them the third best to go on with; the second best comes too late, the best never comes.</a>&nbsp;“ While it is great to wish that you had the perfect workout routine and the best plan of nutrition, if you spend all your time comparing theoretical future versions of you doing those routines, there is no more time left to actually become that future you. And who are you to say that you, who hasn’t even started,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/invert-always-invert-avoid-failure-to-succeed/">can actually discern best from good enough</a>? There is time to perfect things as you go, but if you never get going, there will be nothing to perfect.</p><p>But then there are bound to be days where we don’t have the time or energy — what are we to do then? We are only human, after all. The trick is to continue staving off the need for perfection — consistency is more powerful than perfection. Whatever the habit is, do it even if you have to do it poorly. “Too often, we fall into an all-or-nothing cycle with our habits.” If you have been consistent in studying a new language every day, but today you just don’t have it in you — spend two minutes instead of thirty. Two minutes is success, you have continued to vote for your desired future self and your system is intact. Zero minutes is not.</p><p>What do we do when we mess up and actually can’t even get past zero? It is good to realize that even those that succeed fail at times — so the first step is realizing that all is not lost. But you must be paying attention so that you can catch the mistake before it becomes a new habit. “The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of …</p></div></div>

</section><p>What if I told you that $2=1$? You may say I’m wrong. OK, well, what if I proved it to you? We can both agree that there’s an $x$ and a $y$ where $x = y$. From there, <a href="https://math.hmc.edu/funfacts/one-equals-zero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multiply, subtract, factorise, divide, substitute, divide again</a>, and you get $2 = 1$.</p>
<p>Still not happy? You’re probably unconvinced by my so-called ‘proof’. OK, I say, and, after a minute, hand you a sheet of paper with the following hastily scrawled on it: <a href="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1.png?resize=204%2C188" alt="" width="204" height="188" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1.png?resize=300%2C277 300w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1.png?resize=1%2C1 1w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1.png?w=470 470w" sizes="(max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>It’s better, but you’re still displeased. This time, I’ve made clear what steps I’m taking from $x = y$ to $2 = 1$. However, you point out, I don’t connect any of these steps. Nodding slowly, I take my time and write out a very nice, orderly proof, complete with justifications for each line:<a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png?resize=454%2C241" alt="" width="454" height="241" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png?w=1200 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png?resize=300%2C160 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png?resize=1024%2C544 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png?resize=768%2C408 768w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png?resize=2%2C1 2w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>At this point, you spot my mistake: in going from line 4 to 5, I have divided both sides by $x-y$. But we began with the assumption that $x = y$, meaning that $x-y = 0$, and dividing by 0 is not defined! This means that lines 5 to 7 are operating on nonexistent values and are therefore meaningless.</p>
<p>You’re happy with yourself, but something is bothering you. To reveal my mistake, you asked me to be more precise. But why stop here? Because you found what you were looking for? That’s not how truth is found.</p>
<p>My proof, like all proofs, is a path from one statement to another, just as we may follow the path from $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ to $x = \big(-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}\big)/{2a}$, or from the existence of rectangles to the transitivity of parallelism (see below). Along this path I have made several intermediate statements, and linked them together with justifications. You found that one of my links is flawed, and you wonder how we know that the others aren’t also wrong. You begin to question foundational principles, wondering, for instance, <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/805939/24325" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">why we’re even allowed to do the same thing to both sides of an equation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Euclidean geometry:</strong> For the unfamiliar—Euclidean geometry (standard geometry on a flat surface) rests on 5 assumptions, one of which (the <em>parallel postulate</em>) has historically been regarded as ugly. In attempting to eliminate the parallel postulate, mathematicians have found numerous other statements that are equivalent to it, such as that a rectangle exists or that parallelism is transitive.</p>
<p>You keep digging deeper and deeper, questioning more and more of what you previously took to be correct. Eventually, you come across a piece of mathematics that is perhaps the most beautiful and elegant thing you’ve ever laid your eyes upon: <em>natural deduction</em>.</p>
<h2>Natural deduction</h2>
<p>Natural deduction is one result of asking for deeper and deeper justification when doing maths. A system of natural deduction is a set of very simple, almost irrefutable rules that act to formalise our intuition about what is <em>definitely true</em>.</p>
<div id="attachment_15535"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15535" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3.png?resize=124%2C71" alt="" width="124" height="71" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3.png?w=293 293w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3.png?resize=2%2C1 2w" sizes="(max-width: 124px) 100vw, 124px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15535">Reiteration (R): if $P$, then $P$.</p></div>
<p>These rules include such things as <em>reiteration</em>, which simply allows us to repeat ourselves. Precisely, reiteration says that if you know that a statement $P$ is true, then you can conclude that $P$ is true. This is hardly controversial.</p>
<div id="attachment_15536"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15536" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4.png?resize=193%2C120" alt="" width="193" height="120" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4.png?w=422 422w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4.png?resize=300%2C187 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4.png?resize=2%2C1 2w" sizes="(max-width: 193px) 100vw, 193px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15536">Conjunction introduction ($\land$I): if $P$ and $Q$ then $P\land Q$.</p></div>
<p>There are two rules for the natural idea of ‘and’. First is the so-called <em>conjunction introduction</em> rule, stating that if you know that $P$ and $Q$ are both true, then you may conclude $P \land Q$, pronounced ‘$P$ and $Q$’. On the other side, we have <em>conjunction elimination</em>, stating that if you know that $P \land Q$ is true, then you may conclude $P$ and also may conclude $Q$.</p>
<div id="attachment_15537"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15537" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.png?resize=176%2C121" alt="" width="176" height="121" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.png?w=384 384w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.png?resize=300%2C205 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.png?resize=1%2C1 1w" sizes="(max-width: 176px) 100vw, 176px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15537">Conjunction elimination ($\land$E): if $P\land Q$, then $P$ and $Q$.</p></div>
<p>These rules don’t feel like they do much besides swapping out ‘and’ for ‘$\land$’; however, doing so is important for formality and precision.</p>
<div id="attachment_15538"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15538" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.png?resize=172%2C78" alt="" width="172" height="78" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.png?w=373 373w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.png?resize=300%2C136 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.png?resize=2%2C1 2w" sizes="(max-width: 172px) 100vw, 172px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15538">Disjunction introduction ($\lor$I): if $P$, then $P\lor Q$.</p></div>
<p>Things start to get tricky with the rules codifying ‘or’. The first, <em>disjunction introduction</em>, tells us that if $P$ is true, then you may conclude $P \lor Q$, pronounced ‘$P$ or $Q$’: if I am hungry, then it’s also true that I’m either hungry or tired.</p>
<div id="attachment_15539"><p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15539" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7.png?resize=258%2C332" alt="" width="258" height="332" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7.png?w=568 568w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7.png?resize=232%2C300 232w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7.png?resize=1%2C1 1w" sizes="(max-width: 258px) 100vw, 258px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15539">Disjunction elimination ($\lor$E): if $P\lor Q$ and from $P$ we can prove $X$ and from $Q$ we can prove $X$, then $X$.</p></div>
<p>The second rule, <em>disjunction elimination</em>, states that if $P \lor Q$ is true, and from $P$ you can prove $X$, and from $Q$ you can prove $X$, then you may conclude $X$. More colloquially, if either $P$ or $Q$ is true, and in both cases $X$ is true, too, then $X$ is true. For example, if I’m either well-rested or well-fed, and being well-rested makes me happy, and being well-fed makes me happy, then I must be happy.</p>
<div id="attachment_15540"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15540" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.png?resize=222%2C212" alt="" width="222" height="212" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.png?w=472 472w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.png?resize=300%2C287 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.png?resize=1%2C1 1w" sizes="(max-width: 222px) 100vw, 222px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15540">Implication introduction ($\Rightarrow$I): if from $P$ we can prove $Q$, then $P\Rightarrow Q$.</p></div>
<p>Then come the rules regarding implication. We have <em>implication introduction</em>, stating that if from $P$ we can prove $Q$, then we may conclude $P \Rightarrow Q$, pronounced ‘$P$ implies $Q$’. And we have <em>implication elimination</em> (also known as <em>modus ponens</em>), which states that if $P \Rightarrow Q$ is true and $P$ is true, then we can conclude $Q$. If the weather being rainy implies that I am cosy, and the weather is rainy, then I must be cosy.</p>
<div id="attachment_15541"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15541" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.png?resize=220%2C121" alt="" width="220" height="121" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.png?w=477 477w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.png?resize=300%2C165 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.png?resize=2%2C1 2w" sizes="(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15541">Implication elimination ($\Rightarrow$E): if $P\Rightarrow Q$ and $P$, then $Q$.</p></div>
<p>Finally, we come to the most arcane rules, those handling negation. The negation of $P$ is written $\neg P$ and pronounced ‘not $P$’. Before talking about the $\neg P$ rules, however, we must first introduce a new symbol: $\bot$ (pronounced ‘bottom’), which represents impossibility or contradiction. We can then introduce <em>bottom introduction</em>, which states that if both $P$ and $\neg P$ are true, which is absurd (usually… there are systems of logic that admit both $P$ and $\neg P$ at the same time, called <em>paraconsistent</em> logics), then we can conclude $\bot$, to represent this impossibility.</p>
<div id="attachment_15542"><p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15542" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.png?resize=195%2C134" alt="" width="195" height="134" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.png?w=383 383w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.png?resize=300%2C206 300w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.png?resize=1%2C1 1w" sizes="(max-width: 195px) 100vw, 195px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15542">Bottom introduction ($\bot$I): if $P$ and $\neg P$, then $\bot$.</p></div>
<p>We’re then able to make use of $\bot$ through <em>negation introduction</em>, which states that if from $P$ we can prove $\bot$, then we can conclude $\neg P$. This is reasonable; if $P$ being true led to a contradiction, then $P$ isn’t true, so $\neg P$ is.</p>
<div id="attachment_15543"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15543" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11.png?resize=228%2C231" alt="" width="228" height="231" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11.png?w=443 443w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11.png?resize=295%2C300 295w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11.png?resize=1%2C1 1w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11.png?resize=45%2C45 45w" sizes="(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15543">Negation introduction ($\neg$I): if from $P$ we can prove $\bot$, then $\neg P$.</p></div>
<p>Finally we have <em>negation elimination</em>. This one is a nice easy way to end: it says that if we know $\neg \neg P$, then we can conclude $P$. If something isn’t not true, then it must be true!</p>
<div id="attachment_15532"><p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/12.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15532" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/12.png?resize=173%2C78" alt="" width="173" height="78" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/12.png?w=372 372w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/12.png?resize=300%2C135 300w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/12.png?resize=2%2C1 2w" sizes="(max-width: 173px) 100vw, 173px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15532">Negation elimination ($\neg$E): if $\neg\neg P$, then $P$.</p></div>
<p>And with that, we have completed (one kind of) natural deduction, laying out a framework for proofs based on undeniable principles so that we can be <em>completely</em> confident in our results.</p>
<p>Now, you may be wondering, hey, maths is about numbers and shapes and functions and vector fields, but all we’ve been working with are $P$s and $Q$s! Not a single $n$ or $x$, let alone an $f$, has been written so far!</p>
<p>Fear not! Purely logical systems such as natural deduction are key ingredient for building typical maths. For example, to define numbers, we may first extend to <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-precise-difference-between-propositional-and-predicate-logic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predicate logic</a>, then construct the naturals (via the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peano axioms</a></em>), which we’ll use to make the <a href="http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~pavel/syllabi_old/aluffi_321/NZ.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">integers</a> and the <a href="https://people.clas.ufl.edu/groisser/files/rationals.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rationals</a> (via equivalence classes), then finally the reals (via <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_cut" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dedekind cuts</a></em>).</p>
<p>So, in fact, we still we get to work with all the maths we’re used to! Plus, due to the use of natural deduction, we have the added benefit of being confident about what we’re doing at every layer of abstraction!</p>
<p><strong>Predicate and propositional logic:</strong> The logic we’ve been building, with $\land$, $\lor$, $\Rightarrow$, $\neg$, and $\bot$, is known as <em>propositional</em> or <em>zeroth-order logic</em>. <em>Predicate</em> or <em>first-order logic</em> is an extension of propositional logic wherein our statements ($P$, $Q$, $X$, etc) may be parametrised. So as well as having $H$ mean that ‘I am hungry’, we may also have $\mathcal H(x)$ mean that ‘$x$ is hungry’. Additionally, predicate logic includes two <em>quantifiers</em>, $\forall$ and $\exists$, which respectively mean ‘for every’ and ‘there exists’: $\forall x \mathcal H(x)$ means that everyone is hungry, and $\exists x \mathcal H(x)$ means that (at least) one person is hungry.</p>
<h2>So what?</h2>
<p>If you’re anything like I was at age 17, or anything like how I portrayed you in the beginning of this article, you’re drooling right now. It’s like all of your fantasies regarding rigour and precision have been heard and answered by divine mathematicians.</p>
<p>But maybe you’re not intrinsically motivated by rigour, so you’re less excited by natural deduction. Which is fine! I’m not hurt. Maybe a little bit. Or maybe you just feel that this is overkill—did you <em>really</em> need all this work to know that $2 \neq 1$? Or maybe you’re not convinced that these rules are correct; perhaps you don’t agree that from $\neg \neg P$ we can conclude $P$.</p>
<p><strong>Excluding the middle:</strong> If you don’t agree, you are not alone! That $\neg \neg P$ entails $P$ is a consequence of a rule called the <em>law of excluded middle</em>, which states that $P \lor \neg P$. (This law is built-in to the system of natural deduction that we created.) Some mathematicians (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_logic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the <em>intuitionists</em> or <em>constructionists</em></a>) reject the law of excluded middle, thus also forfeiting that $\neg \neg P$ entails $P$. One reason to question the law of excluded middle is that it allows us to state that something exists without stating what it is. For instance, we are able to <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/104121/243259" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prove that an irrational number raised to the power of an irrational number can be rational</a>, but <em>without</em> giving an actual example. If we reject the law of excluded middle, then all such proofs must <em>actually construct</em> an example.</p>
<p>Still, I posit, natural deduction is worth your time. Because we’ve been so rigorous in building the system up, we gain the benefit of knowing <em>exactly what we’re talking about</em>. Before establishing such precision, we may have used $P \Rightarrow Q$, but without a sense of …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The key reason why you (and likely most developers) struggle with CSS, is that you underestimate it.</p><p>Underestimating CSS leads to a strange feeling of tediousness when writing it, which makes having to deal with it a laborious and seemingly unrewarding task. Style by style, div by div, media query by media query. Having to make endless small tweaks in what feels like an open-ended ‘design’ process with no direction at all can feel like torture to a development-oriented mind.</p><p>Not to mention a complete lack of debugging tools and methods available for when things go wrong.</p><p>This underestimation is a subset of a problem that we developers tend to have with design in general. In short, we don’t think it’s that important. We don’t understand or appreciate its <em>meaning</em>.</p><p>In reality, CSS is as complicated, maybe more so, as any programming language or framework you will ever come across.</p><p>But the general feeling that it is an afterthought within the development process overall, only adds fuel to fire of the thought that leads you to feel that it is tedious.</p><p>The best way to start to get better at it then, is to gain a new appreciation for it, as a 'hard', technical thing. Which it is.</p><p><strong>You do this by reframing how you see it.</strong></p><p>You can start to learn to like CSS by understanding it from a problem solving technical aspect. As an act of 'constructing' a page rather than 'designing' it. By <a target="_blank" title="https://simpleprogrammer.com/information-architecture-developers-learning-design/" href="https://simpleprogrammer.com/information-architecture-developers-learning-design/">engaging the engineering side of your mind</a>.</p><p>Instead of seeing CSS as an annoying way to 'style' pages, see it instead as a visual programming language for constructing visual guides (UI's) for your user.</p><p>You don't 'style' pages, you 'construct' and 'architect' them. It sounds weird to use these words, but they have a massive effect on changing your perception of what you're doing. And that has a massive effect on your impression and willingness to learn how to do it well.</p><p>Essentially, you can properly learn CSS by transforming it in your mind from a 'styling' problem thing, to an 'engineering' problem thing.</p><p>This defeats the feeling of tedium that your mind has when you’re dealing with CSS, and over time, if applied with some of the specific additional tactics that I will explain below, leads to actually _enjoying_ the process of writing CSS.</p><h2>Tactics That Reduce CSS Tediousness &amp; Lead To CSS Enjoyment</h2><p>Once you’ve started to reframe the act of utilizing CSS in your mind, and start to see it as more of a tool for an engineering problem rather than a ‘design’ problem, embers of enjoyment will start to emerge within you as you are writing your CSS. From here, you can start to add some fuel to the growing fire. </p><p>You can do this by utilizing some strategies, tools and techniques that further reduce the tediousness of CSS. </p><p><strong>Let’s go through them.</strong></p><h3>Use tediousness reducing tools, such as <a target="_blank" title="https://tailwindcss.com/" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a>. So you can abstract CSS.</h3><p>I remember back a few years ago when the <a target="_blank" title="https://laravel.com/" href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel Framework</a> came out. PHP Programmers all over the web were fawning over it. The most common phrase I heard was that it gave programmers “their enjoyment of programming” back. This with a language that was notoriously derided as one that was tedious to use.</p><p>What Laravel did was abstract a lot of the annoying parts of most of these developers' workflows when writing PHP code. These developers, at this newfound higher level of abstraction, could now focus on ‘crafting’ their applications, becoming ‘artisans’ of their code rather than simply PHP programmers.</p><p>TailwindCSS does the same thing for CSS. Instead of moving from one file to another to define your styles, Tailwind uses standard default class presets that allow you to write your CSS, essentially directly onto your HTML elements. This <a target="_blank" title="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619">might sound weird</a> at first, but in the end, actually results in a LOT of saved time in development.</p><p>Over time, it, along with other tools, such as Flexbox, also massively increases enjoyment, as you start to intuitively ‘craft’ and construct pages at a higher level of abstraction, rather than simply ‘style’ them.</p><p><strong>Fun fact</strong><strong>:</strong> The creator of TailwindCSS, <a target="_blank" title="https://twitter.com/adamwathan" href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">Adam Wathan</a> actually started out as a Laravel Developer, so maybe that enthusiasm crossed over to his other project areas.</p><p><strong>EDIT</strong><strong>:</strong> I recently came across a very nice feature in Firefox that helps in debugging overflow issues (one of the most common CSS problems). You can see it in action <a target="_blank" title="https://twitter.com/violasong/status/1314406711696912386" href="https://twitter.com/violasong/status/1314406711696912386">here</a>.</p><h3>Understand how to solve common problems in CSS</h3><p>Because of the lack of debugging tools that are currently available for CSS. Most of debugging within it largely consists of cross-referencing ways that others have dealt with the issue you’re currently facing.</p><p>While this is likely not an uncommon practice in your development workflow (its why StackOverflow exists), it is very time consuming if it is the ONLY way that you can debug. </p><p>One way around this issue is to become familiar with the most common pattern of problems that occur within CSS, and then try to build a repository of solutions to those problems in your mind over time. This sounds simple enough but it very dramatically decreases tedium and increases productivity and speed of development, which ultimately increases your enjoyment.</p><p>For example, one of the most common issues, as referenced in the post drawing, is ‘overflow’ of elements occurring within the page. Sometimes causing the entire page itself to overflow at certain screen sizes. A tutorial like this, outlines the best way to solve this problem.</p><p><strong>Sidenote</strong><strong>:</strong> We are creating a short ebook that deals with this problem, by outlining these most common CSS problems and their solutions, you can sign up for notification of this here: <a target="_blank" title="https://forms.gle/tXRMnpyUZiFmvZwK8" href="https://forms.gle/tXRMnpyUZiFmvZwK8">How To Debug CSS</a>.</p><h3>Master layouts and positioning in CSS (the most tedious aspect of it)</h3><p>As a follow-on to the above point on simply gaining an understanding of the most common aspects of the CSS writing process, the most common of these in terms of general page creation, is that of simply layout out a page, and its elements and making sure that they are positioned and aligned properly. </p><p>The best way to approach problems in a way that solves them most effectively is in an 80/20 way. Mastery of layouts and positioning is the 20% that leads to the 80% of results with CSS. And what will have the most dramatic effect on reducing the tediousness of your CSS writing process.</p><p>Using tools such as Flexbox, as is mentioned above, also makes layouts and positioning twice as easy, once you understand the fundamentals behind it. </p><p>Overall, it’s with this knowledge that you may start to enjoy and view the process as ‘constructing’ pages, rather than simply ‘styling’ them.</p><h3>Practice regularly until it becomes second nature</h3><p>One simple thing that I found, as I started to implement some of the tactics above into my own workflow, was that as I became more proficient in writing CSS and it started to become second nature, my enjoyment of it also started to increase, which lead to a positive feedback loop that kept increasing my overall ability.</p><p>This is a very positive flywheel that I highly encourage. Once you’ve started to change your mindset about CSS and use the right tools to abstract a lot of the tediousness out of it, practicing it regularly is then like adding jet fuel to your workflow. Eventually, CSS will become something you look forward to, rather than an afterthought that you try to avoid.</p></div></div>]]>
