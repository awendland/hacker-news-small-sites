    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Not only is layout shift annoying and a bad user experience, it's now part of Google's Core Web Vitals which will become a ranking factor for Google Search in 2021.</p>
    <p>Lighthouse is a great tool for identifying your Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) score, but it's not so great for quickly visualising what's actually changing on a page. The Layout Shift GIF Generator allows you to quickly see which elements are moving around in the viewport and return your CLS metric.</p>

    <div>
        <h3>Device Information</h3>
        <p>The tool is able to check both a desktop and a mobile viewport.</p><p><em>- The desktop viewport is a standard 1920x1080 resolution.</em></p>
        <p><em>- The mobile viewport is the Nexus 5X profile from Lighthouse.</em></p>
        <p>Both the CPU and the network are throttled simulating a good 3G network.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Command Line Tool</h3>
    <p>The command line tool can be installed directly from <a href="https://github.com/workeffortwaste/layout-shift-gif">GitHub</a> using NPM.</p>
    <pre>npm install -g workeffortwaste/layout-shift-gif</pre>
    <p>Once installed the tool can be used as per the following example.</p>
    <pre>layout-shift-gif --url https://blacklivesmatter.com/ --device mobile --output layout-shift.gif</pre>
    <h2>Changelog</h2>
    <h3>1.0.0</h3>
    <p>- All the changes.</p>

    <h2>Known Issues</h2>
    <p>- If there is a lot of vertical movement on a page it can be difficult to discern which elements have shifted.

August 11, 2020 | https://spookylukey.github.io/django-views-the-right-way/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://spookylukey.github.io/django-views-the-right-way/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="django-views-the-right-way">

<p>Welcome to my opinionated guide on how to write views in Django!</p>
<p>It is the result of mistakes made and lessons learned in a range of
Django and Python projects over 15+ years.</p>
<p>It has also been prompted by the fact that “Class Based Views” (CBVs from now
on) seem to have become the default way to teach and learn Django views in some
circles, to the point that some are even scared to write “Function Based Views”
(FBVs).</p>
<p>Perhaps worst of all, some official Django documentation has <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/class-based-views/mixins/">well-intentioned
advise that will help to continue the torture of mixins</a>, but
without actually killing you and putting you out of your misery. (After a bit of
“git blaming” it turns out that I’m <a href="https://github.com/django/django/commit/c4c7fbcc0d9264beb931b45969fc0d8d655c4f83">credited</a>
in the commit log for that page. I hate it when that happens…)</p>
<p>So, in view of all this, here I am to save the day, and show you The Right Way
:-)</p>
<p>The essential part of this guide is very short, because FBVs are very easy and
simple. In fact, the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/intro/tutorial03/">Django tutorial for views</a> already has all you
need to know. Just read that, and skip the bits about CBVs, and you’ll be fine.</p>
<p>But if you want a different take on the same things, this guide might be for
you. I’ve also added extra bits for common tasks and patterns in FBVs for which
CBVs are often suggested as the solution. I have a few aims:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I want to show how simple and easy views can be.</p></li>
<li><p>I want you to be freed from learning a whole stack of additional APIs that
were only making your life harder (and teaching you bad patterns).</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of learning a bunch of Django specific APIs, I want to cover much more
transferable knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>HTTP principles</p></li>
<li><p>General OOP/multi-paradigm programming principles</p></li>
<li><p>General Python techniques</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And there are some other goodies along the way, like how to type-check all the
URL parameters to your view functions.</p>
<p>Each page is composed of <strong>two parts</strong>, which have <strong>two different audiences</strong>.</p>
<p>First, the business — the <strong>what and how</strong>: a short, definitive guide to The
Right Way. As a less experienced developer, either in general or in terms of
knowledge of Django, this part is all you need. Since this guide is not intended
to be reference documentation, I’ll include various links to the official Django
reference docs. All example code can be found in full in the <a href="https://github.com/spookylukey/django-views-the-right-way/tree/master/code">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<p>Second, discussion — the <strong>why</strong>: a longer, in-depth explanation of why everyone
else who tells you differently is wrong :-). It’s targeted at slightly more
experienced developers, and especially those who are responsible for teaching
other people, or making decisions about the patterns used in a code base. These
discussion sections are really about general programming principles, and how
they apply in Python and Django.</p>
<p>So let’s go!</p>

<p>Something missing? This guide is a <strong>work in progress</strong>, and no matter how much
I add it probably always will be! If you have requests for things to include,
you could file an issue on <a href="https://github.com/spookylukey/django-views-the-right-way">GitHub</a>.</p>
</div><div id="caveats-and-disclaimers-etc">

<ol>
<li><p>Yes, there may in fact be more than one Right Way. But not in this guide!</p></li>
<li><p>I’m assuming you are writing a ‘classic’ web app or web site — in which
most of your pages are server-side rendered HTML, with perhaps some Javascript
loaded onto those pages, as opposed to a site where your server mostly sends
data (e.g. JSON) to a client-side Javascript web app that puts the pages together.</p></li>
<li><p>My comments mainly apply to the CBVs that come with Django. Specifically,
many of my criticisms don’t apply to Django Rest Framework, the Django admin
(which uses a form of CBV), and possibly other implementations. See later
discussion on this.</p></li>
<li><p>Although I’m a Django core dev, I’m not speaking for all the Django
developers. I was actually around when CBVs were first being added to Django,
and even involved in the design of them a bit, and at the time didn’t see the
things I’m expressing now. So please understand my criticisms as a form of
“learning process debate”, rather than as attacks!</p></li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Universal React Query Library (URQL) is a highly customizable GraphQL client, exposed as a set of React components by <a href="https://formidable.com/">Formidable</a>, aiming to become a lightweight alternative that would uphold the principal values of the GraphQL protocol &amp; SDL.</p>
<p>Currently, the most popular client libraries come with large API footprints. URQL’s  main goal is to simplify some of the most popular aspects arising when using GraphQL by providing:</p>
<h3>1. The Declarative Queries</h3>
<p>URQL Client internally manages the lifetime and updates for query &amp; mutation operations in the background:</p>
<ul>
<li>when a cache invalidates their results you may receive updated data,</li>
<li>when your app stops being interested in results URQL will teardown the operation (it will stop requesting new data, stop updating results)</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. The abstracted caching</h3>
<p>Caching is handled &amp; customizable with so-called Exchanges. The default <code>cacheExchange</code> offers basic cache implementation that will avoid sending the same requests to a GraphQL API repeatedly by caching the result of each query. For more complex cases containing data interdependencies, URQL offers normalized caching provided by <a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/tree/main/exchanges/graphcache"><code>@urql/exchange-graphcache</code></a> package.</p>
<h3>3. The central point of extensibility and integration with GraphQL API</h3>
<p>URQL provides <code>Exchanges</code> to abstract how the Client interacts with frameworks, GraphQL API, or your app. URQL’s  <code>Exchanges</code> have access to all operations and all results (the concept is very similar to middlewares in Redux). The core package’s default behaviors are implemented using Exchanges as both operations as their results are treated as a stream of events:</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Built to be easy to use</strong> -  URQL prioritizes usability and adaptability aiming to be the first-choice pick for both, newcomers as well as GraphQL power-users,</li>
<li><strong>Performant and functional</strong> - Lightweight &amp; powerful GraphQL client, easy to use with React, Preact, and Svelte, makes URQL a great alternative to other bulky GraphQL clients.</li>
<li><strong>Logical default behavior and caching</strong> - URQL enables you to use GraphQL in your apps out of the box without complex configurations, large API overhead, and all that fuss.</li>
<li><strong>Easily extensible</strong> - one of the most interesting concepts presented in URQL are <em>Exchanges</em>. They are a kind of middleware that will help you change how you fetch, cache, or subscribe to data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Basic Usage</h2>
<p>The method <code>createClient</code> creates the GraphQL client which requires providing API’s URL as a bare minimum. This Client will manage all your operations. To make it work in React &amp; Preact provide it via the Context API with the help of the <code>Provider</code> export.</p>
<div data-language="react"><pre><code>import { createClient, Provider } from 'urql';
const client = createClient({
  url: 'http://localhost:3000/graphql',
});
const App = () =&gt; (
  &lt;Provider value={client}&gt;
    &lt;YourRoutes /&gt;
  &lt;/Provider&gt;
);</code></pre></div>

<h2>UPDATE</h2>



<p>It has been brought to my attention that there was a mistake by an entry level employee. </p>



<p>So the Revenue Department itself was supposed to get all the NOCs required by going to all those offices, but an entry level employee forgot to add my file to the list of NA’s to be done.</p>



<p>So now I have been told that all the NOC’s will be taken care of by the Revenue Department, Collector Office. </p>



<p>If any legal fees need to be paid, I will be informed by the Collector office (without me requiring to go to every office) and everything will be done in less than 2 months.</p>



<p>I am thankful to everyone for sharing my experience far and wide. But now my experience stands cleared and so does this post. </p>



<p>A lot of people have helped reach this post to very very high-in-the-hierarchy people in the state and central government as well as major national political parties. I am really very thankful to everyone.</p>



<p>I will try again in a few months and keep surveying the experience of people who get their NA done. Thank you again for all the co-operation.</p>



<p>I am also writing a post about “the real process required to obtain the NA permission”. I will try to get the higher authorities from the Collector office to record a video stating the actual procedure required and will publish such article soon.</p>



<p>Again Thank You Very Much.</p>



<p>I have removed the original post. I will update with next steps soon. </p>

            <!-- content --><p>In 2020, Arm is making rapid advancements in the server space well beyond what we have seen in recent years. Aside from the obvious hardware advancements (which we will get into later in this article), the biggest piece of the puzzle here is arguably the software ecosystem maturity. Many workloads can now more or less seamlessly transition from running on traditional x86 hardware to running on Armv8 metal. In this article, we are going to explore the Arm opportunity at cloud service providers or CSPs.<span id="more-45868"></span></p>
<p><em>Note on naming conventions: throughout this article, we will use x86 as a shorthand for x86_64, which is also known as amd64. In this context, it means traditional, Intel-compatible hardware. Armv8 stands for the – relatively – new Arm architecture, outed by Arm Holdings in 2011, and also capable of 64-bit memory addressing. Armv8 is also sometimes known as AArch64 or arm64. We need to keep things simple and standardize.</em></p>
<h2>Arm software ecosystem maturity</h2>
<p>Hardware and software engineers often see their jobs as different, but in order to bring about new architecture, better software means better investment in hardware and better hardware means more are willing to invest in software. Having an Arm server hardware discussion necessarily means that we need to discuss the software side. Indeed, that has been perhaps the most visible area of advancement over the past half-decade.</p>
<p>Arm’s software ecosystem has not hit an x86 level of maturity despite what many of its promoters argue. In many cases there may still be a bit a software engineering required, like tweaking compilation flags or container configuration files. In turn, these small tweaks often mean incremental testing effort. As a result, swapping from x86 to Arm has a switching cost. It may be a small cost, but the swap is usually non-zero. While closed source software is another story, open-source software underpinning popular workloads at CSPs, is rapidly gaining maturity. For example nginx a popular web server has done a great job developing its Arm solution.</p>
<figure id="attachment_17787" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17787"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/cavium-thunderx-micro-benchmarks-enterprise-arm-developers-need-machines/sth-software-maturity-model/" rel="attachment wp-att-17787"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/STH-Software-Maturity-Model.png" alt="STH Software Maturity Model" width="1086" height="606" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/STH-Software-Maturity-Model.png 1086w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/STH-Software-Maturity-Model-400x223.png 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/STH-Software-Maturity-Model-800x446.png 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/STH-Software-Maturity-Model-16x9.png 16w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/STH-Software-Maturity-Model-32x18.png 32w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/STH-Software-Maturity-Model-28x16.png 28w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/STH-Software-Maturity-Model-56x31.png 56w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/STH-Software-Maturity-Model-64x36.png 64w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/STH-Software-Maturity-Model-1000x558.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1086px) 100vw, 1086px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17787">STH Software Maturity Model</figcaption></figure>
<p>Armv8 software maturity has come a long way in the last few years. All popular Linux distributions like Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL, Fedora, Centos, and OpenSUSE now offer an Armv8 spin just as naturally as they offer a traditional x86 spin. This was not the case a few years ago. We have already covered this topic <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/arm-neoverse-n-e-tech-day/">in February of last year</a> when Arm launched its Neoverse line of server CPU cores. Other vendors are moving this direction as well as we are seen even legacy platforms such as <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/vmware-esxi-64-bit-arm-support-announced/">VMware ESXi venture to 64-bit Arm support</a>.</p>
<p>A second very important milestone in the Arm software ecosystem came last year when NVIDIA <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-announces-arm-support-for-gpu-accelerated-computing/">announced</a> support for CUDA-on-Arm at SC19. This was essentially a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-cuda-on-arm-becoming-a-reality/">very potent signal</a> sent to all the industry that Armv8 was soon to be considered on par with x86 for running GPU-accelerated workloads. AI is a pioneering workload, in the field. NVIDIA offering its full AI stack on Arm to build parity with x86 is a big deal since it is an offering for the future of compute, not the past.</p>
<h2>New Armv8 hardware changes the game</h2>
<p>Even though having software that ‘just works’ is essential, one also needs hardware. And in this regard, the Arm world certainly does not disappoint and is as vibrant as ever. Three main actors stand out: Ampere Computing, Marvell, and Amazon’s AWS. (<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/huawei-kunpeng-920-64-core-arm-server-cpu/">Huawei</a> in China as well, although we are going to set that aside for now.) You will of course immediately note that if the first two are CPU vendors, the third one is a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) or a traditional Intel Xeon customer.</p>
<p>Ampere Computing has already had its 7nm <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ampere-altra-80-arm-cores-for-cloud/">Altra</a> sampling for a few months now. As a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ampere-altra-q80-30-in-action-at-ampere-hq/">reminder</a>, it is certainly a solid 2P capable offering on paper, with up to 80 <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/arm-neoverse-n-e-tech-day/">N1 cores</a> at up to 3.3Ghz, 8 DDR4-3200 channels, and 128 PCIe Gen4 lanes (192 in a 2P configuration), all for a TDP of up to 250W. Ampere Computing has already announced next year’s follow up, the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ampere-altra-max-targets-a-128-core-arm-cpu-shipping-in-2021/">Altra Max</a>, which stays on 7nm and pushes the core count to 128. 2022 will see the company outing its 5nm Siryn follow-up.</p>

<p>Marvell, for its part, finalized its acquisition of Cavium in 2018, has arguably been the first Arm CPU vendor to properly enter the data center market, and we have covered the ThunderX2 <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/cavium-thunderx2-review-benchmarks-real-arm-server-option/">extensively</a> since its 2018 launch and the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/cavium-thunderx-micro-benchmarks-enterprise-arm-developers-need-machines/">ThunderX</a> before it. Marvell’s counterpart to the Ampere Altra is the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/marvell-thunderx3-arm-server-cpu-with-768-threads-in-2020/">ThunderX3</a>, to become available this year. It is also a 2P capable 7nm part with eight DDR4-3200 channels but limited to 64 PCIe Gen 4 lanes per CPU (128 in a 2P configuration.) Where it differs greatly from Ampere’s offering is in the choices of CPU cores. Instead of going for “off the shelf” Arm N1 cores, Marvell is using custom Arm cores, offering 4-way Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT). The ThunderX3 will be offered with up to 96 cores (and thus 384 threads) per socket. This is a big differentiating point for Marvell. Just like everyone else, Marvell has a roadmap, and a ThunderX4 is slated for 2022. It will likely be a 5nm part.</p>

<p>And then there is Amazon. Having bought the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/exclusive-gigabyte-annapurna-labs-arm-storage-server-benchmarks/">Anapurna Labs</a> CPU design house in 2015, and after testing the waters with a first-generation <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/putting-aws-graviton-its-arm-cpu-performance-in-context/">Graviton</a> at the end of 2018 (and selling its Arm chips for applications such as <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ubiquiti-unifi-usw-leaf-overview-not-review-48x-25gbe-6x-100gbe-switch/">switches</a>), Amazon announced the general availability of its <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/aws-graviton2-64-core-arm-cpu-heightens-war-of-intel-betrayal/">Graviton2 based instances</a> in March of 2020. Just like the Ampere Altra, the Gaviton2 is also a Neoverse N1 based design, manufactured at 7nm. It is a single socket design, offering 64 cores, 8 DDR4-3200 channels, and 64 PCIe Gen 4 lanes. The fact that AWS decided to build its own CPUs is important because a traditional Xeon/ x86 customer is now taking that in house. It also allows software development to happen at a more rapid pace by showing strong backing for Arm infrastructure, offering it to a wide array of customers. The industry is changing, and long gone are the days when only hardware vendors could decide its fate.</p>

<p>(1)&nbsp; Ampere’s <a href="https://amperecomputing.com/altra/">documentation</a> calls this “sustained turbo”, but presumably this can be treated as a kind of base clock, as all cores should be able to sustain said clock while fully loaded. To be confirmed in STH testing.</p>
<p>(2) These specifications are to be confirmed as the chips become commercially available and may change as the parts transform into shipping products.</p>
<p>Looking at the above table, a few things come to mind. First of all, the industry as a whole seems to be settling on a few “standard” specifications. Each of these three chips comes equipped with a memory controller supporting eight channels of DDR4, just like AMD’s EPYC line and Intel’s upcoming 10nm <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/the-2021-intel-ice-pickle-how-2021-will-be-crunch-time/">Ice Lake</a> Xeon line. Likewise, 250W+ seems to be to the new upper bound for acceptable maximum TDP per socket. A quick look at AMD’s and Intel’s 2020 shipping and roadmap offerings confirms this. Arm chips are looking to keep core counts high and TDPs low.</p>

<p>Amazon designed the Graviton only for internal use, it is a simpler design focused on 1P operation. Note that Ampere Computing and Marvell opted for different solutions enabling 2P operation: Ampere uses 32 (<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/cxl-may-have-just-won-as-amd-joins-cxl/">CCIX</a> enabled) PCIe Gen4 lanes per processor to enable communications between the two sockets, whereas Marvell uses a dedicated interface. Enabling 2P operation complicates the design quite a bit, and as it does not have to cater to any CPU buyer’s needs but its own, Amazon went for simplicity here. This may of course change with a future generation. It also, in some ways, validates AMD’s vision for single-socket EPYC.</p>
<p>Next, we are going to explore this decision of off-the-shelf or custom Arm CPU cores.</p>

But have you ever wondered how that happens?</p><p>In our new "Inside the Cockpit" series here on the Duffel blog, we'll take you behind the scenes of the travel industry so you can see how it really works.</p><p>In this post, you'll learn what has to happen to bring you your flight search results at lightning speed.</p><h2 id="setting-the-scene">Setting the scene</h2><figure><img src="https://duffel.ghost.io/content/images/2020/08/Screenshot_2020-07-23_at_12.42.47--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://duffel.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Screenshot_2020-07-23_at_12.42.47--1-.png 600w, https://duffel.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Screenshot_2020-07-23_at_12.42.47--1-.png 1000w, https://duffel.ghost.io/content/images/2020/08/Screenshot_2020-07-23_at_12.42.47--1-.png 1494w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Imagine that you search for flights from New York John F Kennedy (<code>JFK</code>) to San Francisco (<code>SFO</code>) on 29th August.</p><p>To find your flights, the search engine (sometimes called a “pricing engine” or “shopping engine”) has to cleverly combine together three kinds of data:</p><ul><li>Schedules</li><li>Fares</li><li>Availability</li></ul><p>Let’s look at these, one by one, to understand what they are and how they work. We’ll then talk about the hard part: combining them together to build the search results you see on your screen</p><h2 id="schedules">Schedules</h2><p>Schedules describe when and where an airline plans to fly.</p><p>This isn’t just a list of individual flights. Schedules are structured with a start date and an end date, and then the days of the week when the flight is set to operate.</p><figure><img src="https://duffel.ghost.io/content/images/2020/08/Screenshot_2020-08-02_at_17.46.50--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://duffel.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Screenshot_2020-08-02_at_17.46.50--1-.png 600w, https://duffel.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Screenshot_2020-08-02_at_17.46.50--1-.png 1000w, https://duffel.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Screenshot_2020-08-02_at_17.46.50--1-.png 1600w, https://duffel.ghost.io/content/images/2020/08/Screenshot_2020-08-02_at_17.46.50--1-.png 1972w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>An example of American Airlines' schedule</figcaption></figure><p>For example, an entry in American Airlines’ schedules might say something like this:</p><blockquote>We’re going to run a flight from JFK to SFO on Mondays, Fridays and Sundays between 1st August and 31st August 2020. We’ll call this flight AA2305, and we’ll use an Airbus A321 to operate it.</blockquote><p>Airlines distribute their schedules through industry data providers, who then make them available to other airlines, travel sellers and tech providers. <a href="https://www.oag.com/">OAG</a> and <a href="https://www.cirium.com/">Cirium</a> are the leaders in this space.</p><p>This isn’t just static data which changes infrequently - airlines generally update their schedules at least once a day, and there are about 800 scheduled airlines for the data providers to work with.</p><h2 id="fares">Fares</h2><p>A fare describes a price at which an airline is willing to sell seats on a particular flight, and the rules (sometimes known as "conditions") that go with that price.</p><p>A fare from American Airlines might look something like this:</p><blockquote>We’re willing to sell seats on our flights AA2305 and AA2307 for $200, as long as there is space in booking class N. However, you must book your seat as part of a return, you’ll have to stay in San Francisco for a Saturday night, and we won’t give you any refund if you want to cancel.</blockquote><p>A fare has a name, called a “fare basis code”. A fare basis code is a short set of letters and numbers - for example <code>NVAKZNM3</code>.</p><p>Fares are made up of rules which describe who is eligible for them, what flights they can be used for, and restrictions on how they can be sold or used. Examples of fare rules could include:</p><ul><li>You must fly via Los Angeles (<code>LAX</code>)</li><li>You can change flights, but only if you pay a $50 penalty</li><li>You can't have a "stopover" overnight on your journey</li></ul><p>The full fare rules for a fare can easily be thousands of words long - you can see the real-life fare rules for the American Airlines fare <code>NVAKZNM3</code> <a href="https://gist.github.com/timrogers/ef7a0070d29ea1ffa5d925184e7a4887">here</a>.</p><p>Fortunately, the most important fare rules can be described in a structured way which a computer can understand, allowing a search engine to work out what fares match your search without a human reading through manually.</p><p>Airlines file their fares in an industry directory run by <a href="https://www.atpco.net/">ATPCO</a>, which other airlines, travel sellers and tech providers can subscribe to. Each airline can change their pricing by refiling fares many times a day. All in all, ATPCO processes more than 10 million fare updates per day.</p><p>Airlines offer many fares for the same flight at the same time, since a traveller won’t always want the cheapest, most restrictive option. For example, you might want a checked bag, or the ability to change your flights free of charge.</p><h2 id="availability">Availability</h2><p>Airlines don’t just say “this flight has seats available” or “this flight doesn’t have seats available”.</p><p>Airlines want to make as much money as they can from their metal boxes flying through the sky, so they want to sell some seats cheaply, but hold some seats back for travellers who are willing to pay more.</p><p>A flight is broken into different “booking classes”, sometimes known as “reservation booking designators” (RBDs). These are letters of the alphabet, so a flight can be split into 26 different buckets: <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, etc..</p><p>A fare points to a specific booking class. The example fare we looked at above, <code>NVAKZNM3</code>, is for the booking class <code>N</code>. Usually, the first character of the fare basis code is the booking class.</p><p>Each booking class on a flight can have different availability. For example, imagine that American Airlines uses the booking classes <code>N</code>, <code>V</code> and <code>Y</code> for economy.</p><p>They might use <code>N</code> for the most restrictive economy fares, <code>Y</code> for the most flexible ones and <code>V</code> for ones in the middle. Being able to control availability for each booking class means that “cheap economy” can be sold out, but there can still be “expensive economy” seats left.</p><p>Airlines don’t “publish” their availability. To know the latest, up-to-the-minute availability, you have to go to the airline’s passenger service system (PSS). Popular passenger service systems include <a href="https://amadeus.com/en/industries/airlines/altea-suite">Amadeus Altéa</a>, <a href="https://www.sabreairlinesolutions.com/home/software_solutions/customer_sales_service/">Sabre Sonic</a> and <a href="https://www.navitaire.com/new-skies-reservation-system">Navitaire New Skies</a>.</p><h2 id="putting-this-all-together">Putting this all together</h2><p>To find results for a simple search, a flight search engine has to combine together schedules, fares and availability.</p><p>There is only a small number of flight searches engines on the market. Most travel sellers use the search built into the global distribution system (GDS) they use (for example <a href="https://amadeus.com/">Amadeus</a>, <a href="https://www.sabre.com/">Sabre</a> or <a href="https://www.travelport.com/">Travelport</a>). But there are competitors: airlines and larger sellers often use search solutions from providers like <a href="https://www.itasoftware.com/">ITA Software by Google</a> and <a href="https://pros.com/">PROS</a>.</p><p>Flight search is very complex, and it requires a lot of computer power.</p><p>The first step is to identify possible routings. For our trip from New York to San Francisco, there are tens of thousands of reasonable options if we take into account connecting flights and the full range of available airlines.</p><p>At the simple end, we could take a direct flight, <code>AA2305</code>. But we could also fly with Alaska Airlines on <code>AS17</code>, <code>AS398</code> and <code>AS3311</code>, connecting in Seattle (<code>SEA</code>) and Los Angeles (<code>LAX</code>).</p><p>For each of those routings, the search engine needs to work out what fares are applicable, checking all of the rules.</p><p>There can be hundreds or thousands of potentially relevant fares to check per airline, especially given that there can be many different ways to apply fares to a set of flights.</p><p>If we take our example above with Alaska Airlines, you’d fly from <code>JFK-SEA</code>, then <code>SEA-LAX</code> and finally <code>LAX-SFO</code>. In terms of fares, this could be structured as:</p><ul><li>A one-way from <code>JFK-SFO</code></li><li>A one-way from <code>JFK-SEA</code>, and then a one-way from <code>SEA-SFO</code></li><li>Three one-ways: <code>JFK-SEA</code>, <code>SEA-LAX</code> <code>LAX-SFO</code></li><li>…</li></ul><p>If we’re booking a round trip, this gets even more complex.</p><p>Once you’ve combined the schedules and fares, you’ll have a series of “priced itineraries” - for example:</p><blockquote>You can fly on AA2305 direct from JFK to SFO for $200, using fare NVAKZNM3, as long as booking class N is available</blockquote><p>The final step is to bring availability into the picture. You’ll probably find that a lot of your priced itineraries are not available because one or more of the booking classes you need are full.</p><p>The end result is a series of search results — or what we call "offers" in the Duffel API.</p><h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2><p>When you search for flights, a flight search engine has to combine schedules, fares and availability to generate your search results.</p><p>To do this, it has to consider hundreds of millions of options (at least!), turning them into a relatively small number of valid, relevant combinations. And all of that in just a couple of seconds!</p></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1597054012512/yOWZ6zJsl.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Have you ever met someone who kept apologising for every question or favour they asked? Perhaps you are that person and you can hear yourself saying "sorry" over and over again for basic and normal requests which really don't need an apology. It is annoying for everyone involved and usually, the person apologising is just in <em>such</em> a habit of doing it that a gentle "No need to apologise" or even "Please stop apologising" won't actually lead to any change.</p>
<p>I heard a great tip a few years ago which could help you escape this annoying habit, and lead to better relationships with colleagues, friends, and superiors. This tip helps avoid a <strong>weird power dynamic</strong> where you put yourself in the position of someone begging or being needy, and changes it into a collaborative, positive space. In my opinion, it not only helps others respect you more, but leads to you respecting yourself more.</p>
<h2 id="replace-sorry-with-thank-you-">Replace 'sorry' with 'thank you'</h2>
<p>We know that replacing bad habits is easier than removing them completely, so every time you feel the urge to apologise for something unnecessarily, try to rephrase it as a thank you. This puts you in a better headspace, but people also feel a lot more comfortable accepting thanks than accepting unnecessary apologies. As said, it also turns a generally negative feeling and frames it positively. You're still showing gratitude without begging forgiveness for an everyday request.</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Instead of</td><td>Try</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Sorry for the inconvenience</td><td>Thank you for your time</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Sorry you had to wait so long</td><td>Thank you for your patience</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Sorry to ask, but...</td><td>Thanks for seeing me, would you mind telling me...</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>You helped me so much, sorry</td><td>Thank you for helping me so much</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>These are just a few examples. For me, "thank you for your time" was the most valuable and easy to implement in a variety of situations. </p>
<p><strong>If you try to utilise this technique in your everyday life, you'll see that not only do people respond a lot better to your requests and explanations, but you'll also walk away feeling more like you collaborated, rather than grovelled.</strong></p>
<p><em>Disclaimer:</em> This advice does not apply for when you truly should apologise. If you hurt someone (even accidentally) or do someone wrong, you should apologise. The above is only applicable when you are in the unfortunate habit of apologising for normal requests.</p>

These frameworks create a window which GoLang can inject HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the UI.</p><p id="c60c">But I don’t want to write JavaScript(!) and deal with all the complexities that comes with it like npm, webpack, typescript… Fortunately, I can just compile GoLang to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WebAssembly</a> (WASM) and use that in place of JavaScript. WASM is a binary format that can be executed natively in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most modern browsers</a>. <em>My </em><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://maori.geek.nz/a-web-app-using-bazel-golang-wasm-and-proto-c020914f4341"><em>previous post</em></a><em> showed how to build a WASM web-app with the Bazel.</em></p><p id="14af">Also, using WASM in a desktop app (as opposed to a web app) dodges two of its main downsides:</p><ol><li id="a01f"><strong>Large WASM binaries</strong> (especially from GoLang): these take a long time to send over the network increasing loading times. In a desktop app the binary isn’t transferred over the network, so less overhead.</li><li id="c65b"><strong>Browser incompatibility: </strong>Some WebAssembly methods are unavailable in browsers and older browsers are not supported at all. In a desktop app the “browser” is controlled (Chrome for Lorca and Safari for webview), so no compatibility issues.</li></ol><p id="382a">Let’s get started and build the app.</p><h2 id="ad5c">The Main Desktop App</h2><p id="04fb">First, I want to sketch out the <code>main</code> function for the app:</p><pre><span id="49df">func main() {<br> // Create the Data URI of index.html<br> url := fmt.Sprintf(<br>  "data:text/html,%s", <br>  url.PathEscape(assets.INDEX_HTML)<br> )</span><span id="6f7e"> // Create Lorca UI<br> ui, _ := lorca.New(url, "", 600, 200)<br> defer ui.Close()</span><span id="7141"> // Create a JS function that returns the WASM binary in base64 <br> ui.Bind("getWASM", func() string { return assets.WASM_BIN })</span><span id="4a42"> // Initialize the wasm_exec.js script<br> ui.Eval(assets.WASM_EXEC_JS)</span><span id="77ea"> // Call the initial JS functions to load the WASM<br> ui.Eval(assets.INIT_JS)</span><span id="cbed"> &lt;-ui.Done()<br>}</span></pre><p id="6eb4"><em>Note: the core difference between with webview, is using </em><code><em>Init</em></code><em> instead of </em><code><em>Eval</em></code></p><p id="062d">This app will start a Chrome window then:</p><ol><li id="9913">load the webpage with HTML <code>assets.INDEX_HTML</code></li><li id="79c2">define a function <code>getWASM</code> that is a promise of <code>assets.WASM_BIN</code>, the WASM binary as a base64 encoded string</li><li id="c64f">load the JS GoLang WASM library <code>assets.WASM_EXEC_JS</code> copied from <code>$(go env <strong>GOROOT</strong>)/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js</code></li><li id="7f2e">load the JS initialization script <code>assets.INIT_JS</code></li></ol><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1676/1*tezB3wIacBS6kH32xAxeqw.png" width="838" height="287" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*tezB3wIacBS6kH32xAxeqw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*tezB3wIacBS6kH32xAxeqw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*tezB3wIacBS6kH32xAxeqw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*tezB3wIacBS6kH32xAxeqw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*tezB3wIacBS6kH32xAxeqw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="ce8d">This is pretty simple example Lorca app, it is basically the demo example. The main complication is the <code>assets</code> package and how it can be created. This is where Bazel comes in.</p><h2 id="74f4">Embedding Files in GoLang Binary using Bazel</h2><p id="8571"><em>Note: an easier way to do this was pointed out to me using the </em><code><a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/blob/fbbbfde2dff5072fe118b369a699d456ec756b0c/go/extras.rst#id3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>go_embed_data</em></a></code><em> rule, better to use that.</em></p><p id="9249">The <code>assets</code> package contains the HTML, JS and WASM files as string constants.

A web app does not fit their requirements very well since they are editing local files and talking to local daemons. The alternative is then to reimplement or bind their API and integrations to another language which is complicated, error prone and a lot of work. A method of building pure GoLang desktop applications makes a lot of sense for these kinds of tools.</p><p id="93db">This approach can pretty quickly create a distributable, single executable, desktop application with minimal external dependencies. An app that can reuse many GoLang libraries and tools that have already been built. I suppose the worst part of this approach is that it throws away years of development on JavaScript tools like React and Vue. But that just means I have to write more Go to reimplement them, so it isn’t that bad :)</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<p>This guide covers timeless ideas that are helpful to keep in mind while working with
systems where performance matters. Many of these ideas are fairly “durable”
and will apply regardless of what hardware, programming language, operating
system, or decade you are working in.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for follow-up articles that will drill into hardware and
more Rust-specific techniques.</p>

<p>Skip to the <a href="#contents">table of contents</a> if you don’t like intros.</p>

<p>There’s some foul language in here. Enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="executive-summary">executive summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>make it work, then make it pretty, then make it fast</li>
  <li>only do things that are necessary for correctness and safety</li>
  <li>your engineers will burn out, leave your team, and relentlessly shit talk you
if they don’t make their code pretty and low-friction to work with</li>
  <li>align all latency-throughput queuing positions for everything in the
serial dependency graph, or you will get worst-of-all-worlds
latency-throughput behavior, increasing latency and lowering throughput</li>
  <li>if something necessary can be done in the background without blocking,
queue it up for eventual batch processing to improve cache performance</li>
  <li>look at allocation lifetime using DHAT, avoid short-lived allocations
and ensure that long-lived allocations employ time-space trade-offs
that consume plentiful resources instead of scarce ones where possible</li>
  <li>seriously, it’s always your fault if your engineers quit.</li>
  <li>performance happens naturally when engineers love the codebase and they
are aware of which parts of the system can be sped up</li>
  <li>before wasting time optimizing things that don’t matter, we can easily test
whether optimizing could be useful at all by adding delays or deleting
relevant code to see what the impact of infinite optimization would be</li>
  <li>by default your machine will randomly change your cpu frequency, yank
processes across cores and sockets, and generally make measurements
deceptive and non-reproducible. we can control this behavior. if you
don’t account for this behavior, your measurements are not sound justifications
for code changes</li>
  <li>wait, why does an executive care about performance, anyway?</li>

<p>Ok, now that the executives are gone, it is time to party.</p>

<p>Let’s put on some nice music.</p>

<p>Take a deep breath.</p>

<p>Let it out.</p>

<p>The year is 2020. and we are utterly fucked.</p>

<p>Supposedly we are here reading this article because we “like computers” or
something but let’s be clear about one thing - you’re not here because of that.
I know. You know. We all know. You couldn’t give two fried pennies about
computers if they didn’t help you feel the things you so desperately need to
feel.</p>

<p>You’re here, ultimately, because of control. Your entire life is entombed
in an elaborate, entirely abstract labyrinth of machines that define so
many aspects of every moment of your waking life. You’re here to better
understand the prison you find yourself within. You’re here to sympathize
with the machine.</p>

<p>While you will only seep ever more deeply into this morass of gold and glass,
you have the power to turn your captors into familiar friends. You have the
power to make the machines into the only friends you will ever need. You are
here to abandon the organic and the analogue. There is nothing for you on the
other side of your window. As you lounge (please fix your posture now) in your
designated quarantine pit, gazing listlessly into the LED mesh while biding
your time, I invite you to join me - your newest simulated human experience -
on a once-in-a-lifetime adventure into the bowels of the machine through which
you experience joy and place orders for more toilet paper.</p>

<p>It begins today.</p>

<p><img src="https://sled.rs/art/sunrise.jpg" alt="warm sun rising over the water with a boat and mountains in the background"></p>

<p>This guide contains basic information for getting started with
performance-sensitive engineering. I think most folks will learn something new.
I know I have. And, part of why I wrote this is to have a single place with a
memorable URL where I can return to when I forget most of this stuff. More
importantly, when I unfurl fiery screeds in random internet comments I want to
have an intimidating reference to which I can mercilesly link.</p>

<p>I initially wrote this guide for the Rust ecosystem, where many people are now
trying their hands at optimization for the first time. But nearly all of this document
applies to general programming, with a few of the hardware effects mentioned
being specific to x86 and ARM circa 2020. Linux is assumed, because that’s
what the overwhelming majority of server workloads run today.</p>

<p>This guide brings together ideas from systems engineering, systems theory,
psychology, hardware, queuing theory, statistics, economics,
distributed systems, concurrency and philosophy of science with the goals of
helping you to be less of an asshole and write code that tends to improve
the metrics you care about.</p>

<p>Performance is about being thoughtful about the metrics that matter to us and
allowing ourselves to be aware of them while making decisions.</p>

<p>These materials are based on Tyler Neely’s Rust workshop content, and have been
inspired by the writings of

<h2 id="principles">principles</h2>

<div><div><pre><code>You are not a Bayesian homunculus whose
reasoning is “corrupted” by cognitive biases.

You just are cognitive biases.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Rationality-An-Introduction">- Luke Muehlhauser, via R:AZ</a>.</p>

<p>The first thing to consider is that our minds are pure shit and everything we
know is wrong. We must accept our fallibility before embarking down the path to
fast-as-fuck machinery.</p>

<p>We build towers of assumptions that are bound to specific contexts, and when the
conditions that caused us to form these beliefs change, we tend not to revisit
the now-invalidated beliefs. Cache invalidation is hard when we are so rarely
aware of the dependency graphs of what we believe.</p>

<p>So, we measure. Even when we’re convinced that we’re right. Because we are
always out of sync with reality, and we are fundamentally incapable of altering
this fact. But we can be responsible in the face of that.</p>

<p>Corollary: allow yourself to be wrong. Allowing yourself to be wrong with
yourself, your collaborators, and in public is a key optimization for learning
faster and building better things with less effort and in less time.</p>

<p>Luckily for us, machines tend to be somewhat amenable to measurement. We built
them that way. Indeed, constructing them to be somewhat measurable in the first
place was the only way we were able to assemble them at all despite our
innumerable shortcomings. We took the predecessor to your current machine,
chose some metrics to improve, made a huge number of mistakes while continuing
to measure, and occasionally we got lucky: the metrics we cared about improved
enough to alter production lines, crystallizing our occasionally successful
results into new production processes that eventually put your machine in front
of you.</p>

<p>We must measure.</p>

<p>The only thing that matters is that real programs on real hardware see real
improvements in relevant metrics like total cost of ownership, responsiveness,
etc… If a metric doesn’t help a human, it’s just a vanity pursuit that may
make the important metrics worse due to under-investment.</p>

<p>We must select our measurements with care. Our time is precious.</p>

<p>By making decisions that are considerate of available data, we are able to cut
through so much bullshit. We have so many ideas that our experience tells us
should cause our code to improve, but it simply isn’t true when we actually
measure. Code changes that made your Java, C++, Haskell or JS programs faster
may not make Rust any faster. Don’t make Rust code ugly just because some
program you wrote in the 90s worked better with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device">manual loop
unrolling</a>. Compilers change,
in many ways for the better.</p>

<p>Don’t be macho. Make decisions while having real data on-hand and limit the
damage of hubris.</p>

<h2 id="e-prime-and-precise-language">e-prime and precise language</h2>

<p>So many aspects of performance-critical engineering can be highly contextual
and may vary wildly from one machine to another. It helps to avoid the verb
“to be” and its conjugations “is”, “are” etc… when describing observations.</p>

<p>When we say something “is” something else, we are casually equating two
similar things for convenience purposes, and we are lying to some extent.
By avoiding false equivalences (usually easily spotted through use of “is”, “are” etc…)
we can both communicate more precisely and we can allow ourselves to reason
about complexity far more effectively. Situations that may seem completely
ambiguous when described using “to be” phrases are often quite unambiguous
when taking care to avoid false equivalences. This general form of speech
is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime">E-Prime</a>.</p>

<p>Don’t say “lock-free queues are faster than mutex-backed queues”, say “on
hardware H with T threads running in tight loops performing operations O, our
specific lock-free queue has been measured to achieve a latency distribution of
X1 and our specicific mutex-backed queue has been measured to achieve a latency
distribution of X2.” It’s likely your lock-free queue will sometimes perform
worse than a well-made mutex-backed queue given certain hardware, contention
and many other factors. What does “perform worse” even …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In my spare time (whenever I get to have some these days) I like to
poke around in the world of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a>.</p>

<p>I do have some experience with various Lisp dialects such as Scheme,
<a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a> and <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>,
so this is not my first introduction to the Lisp family. I’ve been
developing in Clojure at my current job and has also used Scheme
(<a href="https://www.call-cc.org/">Chicken Scheme</a> in particular) and Racket
in various small to mid-sized personal and hobby projects. Having
spent a fair amount of my time with the various Lisp dialects I
wouldn’t say that I’m expert in Lisp, not even close.</p>

<p>We are now in the 2020 year, and this is also the year that Lisp would
become 62 years old! That is an impressive age for a programming
language. With that said that does not mean that the concepts and
ideas developed in Lisp are old.</p>

<p>A thing so common for all languages these days such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If%E2%80%93then%E2%80%93else">if-then-else</a> was first
introduced by the creator of Lisp itself - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)">John
McCarthy</a>.
Another notable thing so common to lots of modern languages such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)">garbage
collection</a>
came from Lisp too. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">Read-Eval-Print-Loop
(REPL)</a> that most
of us cannot live without is another good example.</p>

<p>And these are just a few of the things that Lisp gave to the world.</p>

<p>These days Lisp isn’t very popular compared to other languages as it
used to be back in the days, but that isn’t to say that Lisp itself is
dead. As a matter of fact it is in a pretty good shape - various
Common Lisp implementations are actively being maintained – few days
ago <a href="http://www.sbcl.org/all-news.html#2.0.0">SBCL 2.0.0</a> got released
for example. Research and innovations are still happening in Racket
(check out the Honu project for instance), and Clojure is kicking
butts in the JVM world.</p>

<p>So, why spending time with Lisp you might ask?</p>

<p>Is it for the famous Lisp enlightenment everyone is talking about? I
don’t know, maybe. Personally, I find programming in Lisp quite fun.
Exploring stuff and poking around at the REPL in Common Lisp is a
whole different story than most of the REPLs you’ve dealt with.  Maybe
it is my personal curiousity about programming and computer science
that drove me to Lisp.</p>

<p>The language has a long history, so you would find lots of
reading materials, research papers and it’s fascinating to know that
you can still run such old code in modern Common Lisp implementations.</p>

<p>Have I been enlighted by Lisp? I don’t feel smarter after learning
Lisp. I do however feel that I’ve gained more experience as a
programmer. And maybe that’s the <em>Lisp enlightment</em> these old Lispers
talk about, maybe it’s something else. What I do know however is that
learning new paradigms and techniques definitely makes you a better
problem solver, so that’s another another reason to try learning some
Lisp.</p>

<p>Oh, and I <em>do</em> like the s-expr syntax. That for me is a good enough
reason to be excited about Lisp.</p>

<p>In this post I’m going to summarize my experience with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp">Common
Lisp</a> so far, and hopefully
the things I write here are going to be useful to someone else in
his/hers own journey in the world of Lisp.</p>

<p>I also need to mention that even though I have experience with Scheme
and Clojure, I’m quite new to Common Lisp. These being Lisp dialects
does not mean they are fully compatible with each other. Scheme takes
the functional-first approach to solving problems and Clojure is a
more modern reincarnation of Lisp which is closer to Scheme being a
Lisp-1 dialect, while Common Lisp is the ANSI standardized vision of
what Lisp should be.</p>

<p>Also keep in mind that this post is not intended as a tutorial for all
things related to Lisp, but rather they document my particular
development setup and show various code samples which I’ve found
useful, and hopefully others will too.</p>

<p>At the end of this post you will also find additional references to
learning materials such as books and documentation, which I’d
recommend checking out. These references will be valuable to anyone
starting up with Common Lisp as they provide useful information and
insight.</p>

<h2 id="installing-common-lisp">Installing Common Lisp</h2>

<p>The nice thing about Common Lisp being ANSI standardized language is
that you can <a href="https://common-lisp.net/implementations">choose between various
implementations</a>.</p>

<p>You need high-performance Lisp compiler -
<a href="http://www.sbcl.org/all-news.html#2.0.0">SBCL</a> has got you covered,
you need to use the JVM platform - <a href="https://abcl.org/">ABCL</a> is there
for you. You can check out the various Common Lisp implementations and
choose the one that suits you most. My personal choice has been SBCL,
but as long as you develop standard compliant code your project be
portable to any conforming implementation.</p>

<p>Installing SBCL on my Mac is as simple as the following command.</p>



<p>And when I’m working on my <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> system
I would install SBCL using the following command.</p>



<p>You would want to get a copy of the <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/common-lisp.html">Common Lisp
Hyperspec</a> as
well. On Macs you can install the HyperSpec using the following command.</p>



<p>Or you can grab the HyperSpec from
<a href="http://ftp.lispworks.com/pub/software_tools/reference/HyperSpec-7-0.tar.gz">here</a>
instead.</p>

<p>After installing SBCL you can test things up quickly in the REPL and
confirm everything has been installed properly.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>sbcl

<p>I’ve been a long time Emacs user and for me the choice of editor
support for Common Lisp is simple -

probably want to pick <a href="https://github.com/l04m33/vlime">Vlime</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>One of the JavaScript concepts that most learners skip when studying the language is how JavaScript runs code on a single thread, and how it handles asynchronous tasks. By understanding the Call Stack and Event Loop, you'll learn how tasks are handled by the JavaScript engine, and hence, start writing non-blocking code.</p>
<p>Now, why should you care? Here are three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You get to understand how JavaScript works under the hood.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It helps in debugging code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Based on my research, questions on the Event Loop and the Call Stack come up in interviews.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-are-stacks-and-queues-">What are Stacks and Queues?</h2>
<p>We'll be using two important terms in this article: <em>stack</em> and <em>queue</em>; so, it's necessary that I throw some light on them before the action starts.</p>
<p>A Stack and a Queue are data structures that are supported in most, if not all, programming languages. If you already know what they are feel free to skip this section.</p>
<h3 id="a-stack">A Stack</h3>
<p><em>In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and. pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.</em> - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://shorturl.at/foruQ">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/stack_representation.jpg" alt="A Stack"></p>
<p>Take note of the text <strong>Last in - First out</strong> in the presentation above. Stacks use the <em>Last In, First Out</em> principle in managing a list (or array) of objects (elements), where the last item <strong>pushed</strong> onto the list is the first to be <strong>popped</strong> off. Makes sense?</p>
<p>A common example of a stack, is a pile of books:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/NSMGzCL/stack-of-books.jpg" alt="A stack of books"></p>
<p>In order to add a new book to the pile of books, you put it on top, making it the last book; but in order to take the first one, Literature, you'd have to take off the last ones: Maths, History, Science.</p>
<p>So, the last item in the stack is the first to go out of it. That's the main idea behind the <em>stack</em> data structure.</p>
<h3 id="a-queue">A Queue</h3>
<p><em>In programming, a queue is a data structure in which elements are removed in the same order they were entered. This is often referred to as FIFO (first in, first out).</em> - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/Q/queue.html">Webopedia</a></p>
<p>Unlike stacks, a queue uses the <em>First In, First Out (FIFO)</em> principle when managing lists. In this case, the element or object which is first added to a list, is the first to go off the list.</p>
<p>A real-life example is a queue of people looking to meet the doctor at a hospital. The person who comes first sees the doctor first, right?</p>
<p>Queues have the idea of <em>first come, first serve</em>.</p>
<p>Since this isn't a data structures article, let's get to why we're really here.</p>

<p><em>In computer science, a call stack is a stack data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program</em> - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>To translate the above definition into JavaScript, "active subroutines" simple means "active functions" or "invoked (running) functions".</p>
<p>In JavaScript, the <strong>call stack</strong> is a single-threaded stack of function <em>invocations</em> in an active JavaScript program.</p>
<p>The call stack is basically a list of functions which have been invoked but aren't done running. The fact that it is single-threaded means only one thing is happening at a time.</p>
<p>Whenever we call a function (e.g. <code>funcA</code>), it gets pushed onto the stack as a <strong>stack frame</strong>. A stack frame is a memory location on the call stack.</p>
<p>So, if this particular function depends on another function (e.g. <code>funcB</code>), as in, it invokes <code>funcB</code> in its block, then <code>funcB</code> gets pushed onto the stack too, right on top of the function which invoked it; in this case <code>funcA</code>.</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>function</span> <span>funcB</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  <span>return</span> <span>"End of B"</span>;
}


<span><span>function</span> <span>funcA</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  
  <span>let</span> str = funcB();
}


funcA();
</code></pre>
<p>Now, here's a visual representation of how the JavaScript engine runs this script:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Cs6wj3L/call-stack-eg-1.png" alt="Representation of the call stack and the stack frames"></p>
<p>Okay, let's digest this.</p>
<h3 id="explanation">Explanation</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>First and foremost, where the heck is the <code>main()</code> function coming from, and how did it get its own stack frame?
When a script (JavaScript code) is executed, the JavaScript engine creates a <strong>Global Execution Context</strong>, which is denoted by <code>global()</code> or <code>main()</code> function, which gets pushed onto the call stack. Thereby, becoming the first stack frame. We're not responsible for this; the JavaScript engine does this, so the Global Execution Context acts like an entry point for our JavaScript program.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the code we wrote, only <code>funcA()</code> was invoked globally (on the last line). This invocation creates a <strong>Function Execution Context</strong> for <code>funcA()</code> and pushes it onto the call stack, and it starts being executed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <code>funcA()</code> function, <code>funcB()</code> is invoked - where its returned string is stored in the variable <code>str</code>. At this point, a <strong>Function Execution Context</strong> is created again for <code>funcB()</code> and a stack frame is created for it and gets pushed onto the call stack.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Inside <code>funcB()</code>, every task (or code) is run until the last line (in our case, the <code>return</code> statement) which marks the end of the function. On this note, the function exits and is popped off the call stack. Since the call stack is a <strong>stack</strong> data structure, the last item goes out first (Last In, First Out). Therefore, <code>funcB()</code> is the first to be popped off the call stack.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When <code>funcB()</code> finishes executing, its returned value is obtained by <code>funcA()</code> which is stored in the <code>str</code> variable. And since the variable initialisation is the last line of <code>funcA()</code> it marks the end of the function, and hence causes the stack frame of <code>funcA()</code> to be popped off the call stack.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now, since there are no more functions to be executed by the JavaScript engine, the Global Execution Context exits and <code>main()</code> or <code>global()</code> is popped off the call stack too, leaving it empty.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>If the image above isn't big enough just open it in a new tab and zoom in.</p>

<p>Before you get overly excited, this section isn't about the forum <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.gyenabubakar.dev/www.stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a> 😅.</p>
<p>There's a maximum number of stack frames that can occupy the call stack.</p>
<p>If this limit is exceeded, a stack overflow occurs. In other words, the JavaScript engine throws a <code>RangeError</code> exception (in Chrome), or <code>InternalError</code> exception (in Firefox).</p>
<p>But how could this ever happen?</p>
<p>A common way a stack overflow could occur is when a recursive function is executed without an exit condition.</p>
<p>A recursive function is any function which invokes itself in its definition block.</p>
<p>When such a function is invoked and no condition is provided for it to stop infinitely calling itself, the stack size limit is exceeded and a stack overflow occurs.</p>
<p>Here's an example of a recursive function which has no exit condition:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>example</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  
  example();
}


example();
</code></pre>
<p>Copy the code above and run it. Check the developer console and you'll see an error which looks like this (Chrome):</p>

<hr>
<p>I mentioned earlier that JavaScript is single-threaded, and that it runs one task at a time.</p>
<p>So, how does it handle asynchronous tasks?</p>
<h2 id="asynchronous-tasks">Asynchronous Tasks</h2>
<p>JavaScript code is ran from top to bottom; tasks that are written first are executed first. However, this is different with asynchronous tasks.</p>
<p>Basically, asynchronous tasks are those that take some time before they complete. An example is fetching data from a remote server. Another instance is writing <code>setTimeout()</code> to invoke a function after a number of milliseconds.</p>
<p>Let's examine this code:</p>
<pre><code><span>console</span>.log(<span>"start"</span>);


setTimeout(() =&gt; {
  <span>console</span>.log(<span>"middle"</span>);
}, <span>1000</span>);

<span>console</span>.log(<span>"end"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>Result:</p>
<pre><code><span>start</span>
<span>end</span>
middle
</code></pre><p>As you'd expect, the <code>setTimeout()</code> fired its callback after a second, but then clearly the browser skipped it and executed the <code>console.log()</code> at the end before coming to execute the callback in the <code>setTimeout()</code>.</p>
<p>How does that happen under the hood when we know JavaScript has one call stack and is single-threaded?</p>
<p>First of all, the first <code>console.log()</code> is pushed onto the call stack (after the global execution context, of course).</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/zVLLyky/e-loop-eg1.png" alt="example"></p>
<p>And after it logs to the console, its stack frame is popped off the call stack.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/RSkPPY5/e-loop-eg1b.png" alt="example"></p>
<p>Then, the <code>setTimeout()</code> is pushed onto the call stack.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/HFPWPGd/e-loop-eg2.png" alt="example"></p>
<p>Browsers come with their own APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), such as <code>setTimeout</code>, the DOM, <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, etc. These APIs aren't provided by the JavaScript engine and hence, it doesn't know how it can execute such code. Therefore, the engine immediately marks it as complete (without running it), pops it off the call stack, and lets the browser or Web API handle it.</p>
<p>So, our <code>setTimeout()</code> is popped off the call stack so the Web API handles it, and then a timer is placed on its callback by the Web API.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/NCbdjt4/e-loop-eg3.png" alt="example"></p>
<p>At that point, since it has been removed from the call stack, the JavaScript engine continues executing the code, and the last <code>console.log()</code> is pushed onto the call stack and executed, whilst the <code>setTimeout()</code> callback is being handled by the Web API.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/YPmtKbW/e-loop-eg4.png" alt="example"></p>

<p>The moment the provided time on the <code>setTimeout()</code> expires, in this case 1 second, the callback is pushed onto the <strong>Callback Queue</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/xCZyMPD/e-loop-eg5.png" alt="example"></p>
<p>And obviously, by now, the last <code>console.log()</code> had already been executed and popped off the call stack, meaning the script is done running.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/YTzR1MY/e-loop-eg5b.png" alt="example"></p>
<p>Remember what the <em>queue</em> data structure is?</p>
<p>The <strong>Callback Queue</strong> is a first-in-first-out data structure. Meaning, the first function which it takes is the first to go out of it.</p>
<p>Why didn't the Web API push the callback function directly onto the call stack? The reason is that, by the time the timer on the callback expires, the call stack may be busy executing functions.</p>
<p>So, the asynchronous code is enqueued on the Callback Queue, waiting to be pushed onto the call stack by the <em>event loop</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>event loop</em> is an endless loop which has only one goal: push tasks (from the callback queue) onto the call stack when the call stack is done running the script.</p>
<p>The <em>event loop</em> keeps checking both the call stack and callback queue; if the call stack is empty, it checks if there are any queued tasks on the callback queue. If there are any, it pushes them onto the call stack.</p>
<p>So, now that the JavaScript engine is done executing code and the call stack is left with no more code or functions to execute, the event loop takes the callback from the callback queue and pushes it onto the call stack to be executed.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/GQbNmPz/e-loop-eg6.png" alt="example"></p>
<p>The callback is ran, and the engine notices it calls <code>console.log()</code>. It takes that and …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!--  end .author-box-single --> <!-- excerpt --> <!-- advertisement --> <!-- entry content --><p>Zimbabwean Lives Matter, a movement born as a result of the suffering of the country’s citizens has been an example of a successful social media campaign with over 1.5 million tweets, likes, shares and retweets going out. It <span>is a citizen movement against the Zimbabwean government which has been abducting and torturing people protesting against corruption and looting.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The Education Support Forum (TEDSF), a Pan-African Non-Governmental Organisation has taken it upon itself to use the #ZimbabweanLivesMatter (ZLM) campaign to highlight a serious deficiency on the African continent.</p><p>Africa is still not telling her stories as a continent. The experiences of Africans in good and bad times are not as well documented as their Western and Eastern peers. African stories are still being told by foreigners.</p><p>We have to develop mechanisms to share our experiences with the world. African universities and governments ought to be leading the efforts for multi-modal information gathering and distribution. Currently, most of our African societies still rely too much on oral tradition, a very ineffective way of passing down information. The distortion over time is inevitable.</p><p>TEDSF&nbsp; has created a <a href="https://zimbabwean-lives-matter.org/"><strong>platform</strong></a> to capture the experiences of Zimbabweans during their ZLM struggle. A digital repository that seeks to preserve and make accessible original content that was captured and created by individual community members, grassroots organizations, and witnesses to the #ZimbabweanLivesMatter movement. <span>It aims to raise awareness of these injustices so as to pave a way for sustainable change in the ailing country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>On the platform people can <a href="https://zimbabwean-lives-matter.org/contribution">share their experiences</a> through the following modalities:</p><ul><li><strong>Text</strong> – A resource consisting primarily of words for reading. Examples include books, letters, dissertations, poems, newspapers, articles, archives of mailing lists. Note that facsimiles or images of texts are still of the genre Text.</li><li><strong>Moving image</strong> – A series of visual representations imparting an impression of motion when shown in succession. Examples include animations, movies, television programs, videos, zoetropes, or visual output from a simulation.</li><li><strong>Oral History</strong> – A resource containing historical information obtained in interviews with persons having firsthand knowledge.</li><li><strong>Sound/Music</strong> – A resource primarily intended to be heard. Examples include a music playback file format, an audio compact disc, and recorded speech or sounds.</li><li><strong>Still Image</strong> – A static visual representation. Examples include paintings, drawings, graphic designs, plans and maps. Recommended best practice is to assign the type Text to images of textual materials.</li><li><strong>Website –</strong> A resource comprising of a web page or web pages and all related assets ( such as images, sound and video files, etc. ).</li><li><strong>Event</strong> – A non-persistent, time-based occurrence. Metadata for an event provides descriptive information that is the basis for discovery of the purpose, location, duration, and responsible agents associated with an event. Examples include an exhibition, webcast, conference, workshop, open day, performance, battle, trial, wedding, tea party, conflagration.</li><li><strong>Email</strong> – A resource containing textual messages and binary attachments sent electronically from one person to another or one person to many people.</li><li><strong>Lesson Plan</strong> – A resource that gives a detailed description of a course of instruction.</li><li><strong>Hyperlink</strong> – A resource that gives a detailed description of a course of instruction.</li><li><strong>Person</strong> – An individual.</li><li><strong>Interactive Resource</strong> – A resource requiring interaction from the user to be understood, executed, or experienced. Examples include forms on Web pages, applets, multimedia learning objects, chat services, or virtual reality environments.</li><li><strong>Dataset</strong> – Data encoded in a defined structure. Examples include lists, tables, and databases. A dataset may be useful for direct machine processing.</li><li><strong>Physical Object</strong> – An inanimate, three-dimensional object or substance. Note that digital representations of, or surrogates for, these objects should use Moving Image, Still Image, Text or one of the other types.</li><li><strong>Service</strong> – A system that provides one or more functions. Examples include a photocopying service, a banking service, an authentication service, interlibrary loans, a Z39.50 or Web server.</li><li><strong>Software</strong> – A computer program in source or compiled form. Examples include a C source file, MS-Windows .exe executable, or Perl script.</li></ul><p>The information collected can be used by academics and analysts in the future. You can help by sharing your experiences, anonymously, so you don’t have to worry about your safety.

						<p>SpaceX wants to transform the Boca Chica Village in Texas into a modern spaceport, according to a new <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/spacex/jobs/4816599002?gh_jid=4816599002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">job listing</a> for “Resort Development Manager” posted this week. Spotted by CNBC reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/thesheetztweetz/status/1292913032042086401">Michael Sheetz</a>, the job description states that “SpaceX is committed to developing this town into a 21st century Spaceport.”</p>
<p>Boca Chica is the small area near Brownsville, Texas, where SpaceX already conducts tests with the Starship project — which aims to deliver new spacecrafts designed to take passengers beyond low Earth orbit.</p>

<p>According to the job description for the SpaceX Brownsville facility, the company wants to turn the entire region into a spaceport to accommodate both the people and cargo that will be on board the Starship vehicle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>SpaceX is committed to developing revolutionary space technology, with the ultimate goal of enabling people to live on other planets. Boca Chica Village is our latest launch site dedicated to Starship, our next generation launch vehicle. SpaceX is committed to developing this town into a 21st century Spaceport. We are looking for a talented Resort Development Manager to oversee the development of SpaceX’s first resort from inception to completion.&nbsp;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Resort Development Manager will be responsible for managing the entire project, including design and architectural aspects, costs, schedules, and all government approvals.</p>

<p>With so much effort on this project, SpaceX clearly wants to offer a unique experience for those planning to travel to the Moon or even Mars.</p>
<p>Last week, NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley successfully <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://spaceexplored.com/2020/08/03/boaters-crash-nasa-astronaut-splashdown-for-spacex-mission-in-dangerous-coordinated-effort/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">returned to Earth</a> from the International Space Station, building SpaceX’s experience safely conducting human spaceflight missions.</p>

<p>Bad decision-makers who make quick decisions get themselves in a lot of trouble. They need to slow down and be more thoughtful.</p>



<p>Bad decision-makers who make slow and thoughtful decisions are still bad decision-makers. They need to make better decisions.</p>



<p>Good decision-makers who makes slow and thoughtful decisions do well for themselves but they waste time and endure unnecessary stress due to indecision. They need to be more decisive.</p>



<p>Good decision-makers who make quick decisions are great decision-makers. They trust their good judgement and make the most good decisions.</p>

It’s becoming increasingly normal for teams to update their Kanban boards on a weekly basis and adapt their projects to the changing requirements.</p><p>Many of us would find this flexible approach a little familiar mainly because many teams are attempting to apply the Agile approach in their work processes.</p><p>We wanted to get a real-life perspective about the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blogs.oracle.com/datascience/taking-an-agile-approach-to-data-science" target="_blank">Agile approach in data science</a>, so we got in touch with Christos Hadjinikolis, the Lead ML-Engineer of Data Reply UK, to talk about this topic. You can check out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://christos-hadjinikolis.github.io/" target="_blank">his personal website to learn more about his credentials and work in Machine Learning (ML)</a>.</p><h2 id="0-agile-in-data-science">Agile in Data Science</h2><p>Christos spoke about the Agile approach in data science in his session <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://2018.mcubed.london/sessions/data-science-agile-way/" target="_blank">Doing Data Science The Agile Way</a> at the Mcubed London event in 2018. You can watch the video for more information.</p><figure><p> <iframe title="M3 18: Christos Hadjinikolis - Doing Data Science the Agile Way" width="500" height="281" data-lazy-type="iframe" data-data-cli-class="cli-blocker-script" data-cli-label="Youtube embed" data-cli-script-type="analytics" data-cli-block="true" data-cli-block-if-ccpa-optout="false" data-cli-element-position="body" data-cli-placeholder="Accept <a class='cli_manage_current_consent'>Analytics</a> cookies to view the content." data-cli-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nRsqFrutfSg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure><p>Hadjinikolis defines Agile Software Development as a time-boxed, iterative and incremental approach to software delivery. The Agile approach in data science is based on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html" target="_blank">its twelve principles</a> (you can click on the anchor texts to find out what they are if you don’t know).</p><p>According to Christos, a data scientist’s role in an Agile team is to experiment and learn what works and what doesn’t. Agile Software Development is all about creating experiments, not tasks. Experimentation tolerates failure as education.</p><blockquote><p>“If practicing Agile Software Development produces value from learning through failing fast and safe… then a Data Scientist’s role in an Agile team is to help the team to fail faster!”</p><cite><a href="https://2018.mcubed.london/sessions/data-science-agile-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christos Hadjinikolis at Mcubed London 2018</a>.</cite></blockquote><p>When we do an experiment, we start by forming a hypothesis and determining the variables. Then, we proceed to collect and analyse data based on those variables.</p><p>When the results are not what we wanted or expected, it shows that the hypothesis doesn’t work or there’s not enough data to test this hypothesis. So, we adjust the hypothesis and redo the experiment to see if that hypothesis works or not.</p><h3 id="1-story-splitting">Story splitting</h3><p>In Agile, a use case is split into different user stories. A user story is an explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end-user. A user would describe the functionality they want in a feature and the benefit gained from that functionality.</p><p>Here’s an example we came up with. In a non-tech use case of baking the town’s best range of cupcakes, a user would say in a user story, “As a <em>cupcake seller</em>, I want <em>more vanilla essence in the cupcake batter</em>, so that <em>the cupcakes will be tastier</em> <em>for cupcake eaters</em>.”</p><p>In this user story, the “cupcake seller” is the description of the user, “more vanilla essence in the cupcake batter” is the functionality requested and “the cupcakes will be tastier for cupcake eaters” is the benefit of the functionality.</p><div><figure><img src="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter.jpg" alt="Putting cupcake batter into the cupcake mold." srcset="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter.jpg?v=1597029413 960w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter-300x200.jpg?v=1597029413 300w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter-768x512.jpg?v=1597029413 768w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter-600x400.jpg?v=1597029413 600w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" data-old-src="//www.iunera.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter.jpg?v=1597029413 960w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter-300x200.jpg?v=1597029413 300w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter-768x512.jpg?v=1597029413 768w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter-600x400.jpg?v=1597029413 600w"><figcaption>Hypothesis testing can be applied to making a good cupcake batter for delicious cupcakes.<br>Image Source: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pixabay.com/photos/baking-cupcakes-cake-batter-4020041/" target="_blank">Alice_Engelbrink</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>The baker would test the hypothesis that more vanilla essence in the cupcake batter would result in tastier cupcakes. The baker would experiment with several batches of cupcake batters with different amounts of vanilla essence, and then, record the data to analyse if more or less vanilla essence is better.</p><p>The baker would repeat experiments for other user stories about other cupcake features like the amounts of sugar, flour, ground flaxseed, water, colouring, oven temperature, flavouring and icing.</p><p>The same can be done in software development. Let’s look at it from the lens of a customer service colleague who is logging an issue about an online shopping app feature as a user story in the use case of improving the online shopping app.</p><p>This user would say, “As a <em>customer service representative</em>, I want <em>the</em> <em>quantity of items in the shopping cart to be changeable</em>, so that <em>the customers can buy more than one of the same product</em>“.</p><p>The software developer would then experiment with hypothetical ways to enable the quantity of items to change from 0 or 1 to the maximum number in stock.</p><hr><h2 id="2-agile-cuts-time-consuming-planning-and-speeds-up-turnaround-of-projects">Agile cuts time-consuming planning and speeds up turnaround of projects</h2><p>Frameworks based on Agile including Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming, Feature-Driven Development and Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) may emulate the adaptivity encouraged by Agile Software Development.</p><p>But they don’t necessarily have to be followed if they don’t necessarily meet the needs of failing faster, getting results faster and deploying software faster to give value to the customer faster.</p><p>That’s the beauty of the Agile approach. Nothing has to be concrete from the start and adjustments can be made along the way. Especially when there’s uncertainty about data availability, no time is wasted on excessive planning and documentation, and instead, more time is spent on pleasing the end-user.</p><h3 id="3-data-science-specific-practices-based-on-agile-values-will-eventually-be-developed-in-research">Data Science-specific practices based on Agile Values will eventually be developed in research</h3><p>Christos commented that the emergence of new Data Science-oriented practices will drive the application of Agile in the research domain.</p><p>“The focus there is about delivering business requirements, in the form of features and products, fast in a volatile, constantly evolving environment.”</p><p>“To support this, a number of underpinning practices have been developed, covering areas like modelling and design, coding and testing, risk handling and quality assurance.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Some of these underpinning practices can directly be transferred in the Data Science world (e.g. user stories and backlogs, timeboxing and retrospectives).”</p><div><figure><img src="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-1024x768.jpg?v=1596795332" alt="Waterfall vs Agile Process" srcset="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-1024x768.jpg?v=1597029378 1024w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-300x225.jpg?v=1597029378 300w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-768x576.jpg?v=1597029378 768w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-1536x1152.jpg?v=1597029378 1536w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o.jpg?v=1597029378 1728w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="//www.iunera.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-1024x768.jpg?v=1596795332" data-srcset="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-1024x768.jpg?v=1597029378 1024w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-300x225.jpg?v=1597029378 300w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-768x576.jpg?v=1597029378 768w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-1536x1152.jpg?v=1597029378 1536w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o.jpg?v=1597029378 1728w"><figcaption>Christos said that, for data scientists, Agile is mostly about adjusting to the requirement of working in a way to deliver business value from their experimentation.<br>Image Source: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/visualpunch/8746306184/in/photostream/" target="_blank">visualpun.ch</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>“So, a clear benefit of trying to apply Agile in Data Science is that gradually, similar Data Science-specific underpinning practices will eventually be developed and these will, of course, be based on the same Agile drives: adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery and continual improvement, and more generally, flexible responses to change.”</p><hr><h2 id="4-the-downsides-of-the-agile-approach-in-data-science">The downsides of the Agile approach in data science</h2><p>However, Agile may not work for everyone and for every situation. When we asked him about the downsides, he said that people tend to wrongly assume that Agile is the only way a team can work and be productive when it’s not.</p><p>“Ever since Agile emerged—in the concrete form that we know it today through the Agile manifesto—many hurried to undermine the effectiveness of other development models, e.g. Waterfall.”</p><p>“There is nothing wrong with the Waterfall model either; the real question is whether these practices or models are fit for purpose! There are surely research projects as well as business requirements around the delivery of software that could potentially be delivered through the Waterfall approach or maybe through a combination of the two.”</p><p>To this, he recommended that project managers and teams should strive to increase their effectiveness and efficiency.</p><p>“If that can be done by building on top of the Agile values then great; if not, then maybe they will need to try and come up with a different formula.”</p><blockquote><p>“People focusing too much on what Agile is and what is not—if it needs to be Scrum or Kanban or if too much documentation or too much time spent in design is not Agile—are bound to make mistakes.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h3 id="5-the-agile-industrial-complex">The Agile Industrial Complex</h3><p>He also agreed that the imposition of Agile on teams, i.e. The Agile Industrial Complex, is defeating the purpose of Agile in finding what works best for teams in working adaptively.</p><p>“Once more, I can’t stress enough how there is no single perfect development model. Project managers need to always assess what is fit for purpose.”</p><p>“Primarily though, they should focus on the underpinning values and principles that Agile or other development models are characterised by. When they do, a recurrent mistake that I have experienced through my consulting career is the oversimplification of Agile as an anti-methodology, anti-documentation and anti-planning development model.”</p><p>“I appreciate that this makes understanding Agile much easier, but at the same time it is a very unfair representation of what Agile is!

<p>I <a href="https://reeve.blog/blog/principles/">recently argued</a> that 80% of a product manager’s job is to discover the right product to build and drive organizational alignment. At the same time, ‘product discovery’ is often the most nebulous part of the job. So how&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;great product managers do this? While product discovery will never be easy, I’ll outline a simple yet effective framework that I use.</p>



<p>There are many great books about product discovery. They also tend to be complicated and tricky to reference day-to-day. So over time, I’ve tried to simplify this, and I’ve distilled it down into what I call the “Five P’s.” In my experience, all five have to be defined and considered when deciding what to build:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Purpose:</strong> What is the mission of your company or product?</li><li><strong>Problem: </strong>What is the customer or user problem we’re solving?</li><li><strong>Pattern:</strong> How many people are impacted by this problem?</li><li><strong>Prose: </strong>What is the narrative for how solving this problem benefits the customer and our business?</li><li><strong>Priority: </strong>How important is this solving this problem vs. other problems on which we could focus?</li></ul>







<p>Your purpose is why your company or product exists, reflected as a mission and strategy. Without this, you’re flying blind. There’s no use in identifying the auto industry’s most common problems if your mission is to create the world’s leading crypto bank:</p>



<ol><li>A <strong>mission</strong> statement is what you’re trying to accomplish. E.g., <em>Plant a billion trees on each continent to offset the world’s carbon emissions. </em>A mission statement should be concise, opinionated, inspiring, and action-oriented (i.e., begin with a verb.)</li><li>A <strong>strategy</strong> is how you’re going to achieve your mission. E.g., <em>Identify suitable land, build irrigation systems, procure seeds and fertilizer, sow seeds by helicopter.</em></li><li><strong>Vision</strong> and mission are easily confused. Think of vision as defining what the world will look like when you’ve achieved your mission.<em> </em>E.g., <em>we’ve offset the world’s carbon emissions by 30%, providing cleaner air to billions of people.</em></li></ol>



<p>Investing time in defining a purpose may seem abstract. Still, it’s critical: Having a clear and compelling mission and strategy inspires a product team and points discovery efforts in the right direction. For product “tracks” within larger companies, the track’s purpose should contribute to the company’s purpose. Boz (VP at Facebook) wrote a great article on mission and strategy <a href="https://boz.com/articles/strategy-tactics">here</a>.</p>







<p>The core part of effective product management is identifying pain within the context of your mission and strategy. What problems do your target customers have? Why do people like or not like your product? Are your customers asking for something?</p>



<p>Problems can surface qualitatively or quantitatively:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Qualitative:</strong> This might include user experience research, a customer call series, feature requests from users, input from your team or stakeholders, competitor research, or your own product judgment. To paraphrase <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ablue/">Allen Blue</a>, look for places where your target customers are already “duct-taping” things together.</li><li><strong>Quantitative:</strong> What you’ve identified through studying trends in your metrics. Product managers should study their metrics daily to understand how the product is performing and identify problems and opportunities.</li></ul>



<p>Customers will often tell you the solution, not the problem. They’re trying to be helpful. But well-intentioned customers usually don’t know what’s possible, nor what will work best for your product. Asking the right questions can help identify the problem:</p>



<ul><li>If you get X, what will it help you do?</li><li>What happens if you don’t get X?</li><li>If you don’t get X, how will you achieve Y?</li></ul>



<p>Be careful in situations where there’s a “layer” between you and the user. Suppose the person you’re talking with is an intermediary (e.g., the buyer or someone who administers the product within a company): In this scenario, they may not understand the experience from the end user’s perspective. Be mindful of who is answering your questions.</p>



<p>Finally, while many formal research functions support the discovery process (product marketing, user research, etc.), a deep understanding of the customer can’t be delegated to another function. Great product managers have strong opinions and intuition; this comes from being exposed to raw feedback, e.g., attending customer calls, studying metrics, and talking to users.</p>







<p>Most of the time, product managers are looking for systemic issues that impact a large percentage of your target customers. We can define ‘systemic’ in different ways: The number of customers with a problem, the value of the customers who have the problem (e.g., how much they spend with you), or whether they are uniquely significant (e.g., a prominent “brand name”).</p>



<p>There are going to be situations where solving an isolated problem is the right call. You might choose to build something purely because a critical customer is asking for it. You might prioritize something for a small but essential cohort of users (e.g., power users or promoters). These are fine, but they should be the exception, not the norm.</p>







<p>The word ‘prose’ underscores the importance of looking beyond a singular metric. Don’t get me wrong, moving metrics is crucial, and I spend a lot of time doing just that, but they aren’t exhaustive. Too often, I see product teams focusing on tuning a singular metric without considering the entire ecosystem or whether something is the right long-term investment as part of a broader mission and strategy. </p>



<p>Even worse, product teams may shy away from building a great product because they can’t predict the quantitative impact of building it. <strong>In practice, you often won’t be able to accurately predict the metric impact of shipping a brand new product or making a step-function change.</strong> </p>



<p>Persuasive prose forces product teams to consider both the quantitative and qualitative effects of building something <em>and</em> how it ties to a broader mission and strategy. It underscores the value of having a clear and compelling narrative for understanding:</p>



<ol><li>What the problem is.</li><li>Why the problem should be solved.</li><li>How the problem will be solved.</li><li>The qualitative and quantitative impact of solving the problem.</li><li>How solving the problem contributes to a broader mission and strategy.</li></ol>



<p><strong>I’ll touch on the two main tools I use when working with ‘prose’:</strong></p>



<p><strong>The first you’re probably familiar with, which is the hypothetical external press release, </strong><a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/11/working_backwards.html"><strong>popularized by Amazon</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The press release explains what the product is, why it exists, and the features and benefits. It’s a compelling articulation of the value that the product delivers to the customer and the market. If it isn’t compelling, you may either not be solving the right problem, or not have the right product to solve it.</p>



<p><strong>But I’m guessing you haven’t heard of the second application of ‘prose’:</strong> The concept is similar, but it’s an <em>internal</em><strong><em> </em></strong>press release. Imagine you’re summarizing the “why,” “what,” and “how” to your CEO. Articulate the problem you’re solving, how it ties to broader mission and strategy, how you’re going to solve it, and the impact that solving it will have on your business. This internal press release will narrate what you’re doing, why you’re doing it, and support it with qualitative and quantitative data. And yes, for any significant decision, you should share it! This exercise identifies incongruencies in your logic, and it will also help communicate the value of doing something.</p>







<p>Prioritization is conceptually simple. In practice, it’s harder and often imprecise, a mixture of art and science. Usually, it’s about the cost versus benefit.</p>



<ul><li><strong>First, we want to understand the impact of solving a problem:</strong> How much will it move a given metric? How many customers have asked for this? Will this increase retention? Will it unlock a portion of the market?&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Second, we need to have a sense of how much solving it will cost:</strong> How many engineering weeks are required to build the solution? What are the support and marketing costs?</li></ul>



<p>There are many prioritization frameworks, including <a href="https://medium.com/@nimay/inside-product-introduction-to-feature-priority-using-ice-impact-confidence-ease-and-gist-5180434e5b15">ICE</a>, <a href="https://roadmunk.com/guides/product-prioritization-techniques-product-managers/">RICE, and many others</a>. Still, I’ve found that they often miss the need for product teams to balance multiple distinct success metrics and “themes” of work. I’ve had success with a slightly augmented version of ICE that I’ve eloquently named <strong>MICE</strong> (Metric, Impact, Confidence, Ease.)</p>



<ul><li><strong>Metric: </strong>What is the importance of the metric that this feature will move? E.g., do we care more about improving activation, or more about retention?</li><li><strong>Impact: </strong>What is the impact of solving this problem based on the pattern you’ve identified?</li><li><strong>Confidence: </strong>What is our confidence in this impact?</li><li><strong>Ease: </strong>How easy is this problem to solve? (An inverse of cost, higher is cheaper.)</li><li>Multiply M*I*C*E, and sort from highest to lowest.</li></ul>



<p>A prioritization framework will give you a way of loosely sorting what you <em>could</em> work on, but it’s a supplement for judgment, not a replacement. “Because the framework said so” isn’t a valid reason for prioritizing something. Prioritization is always a balancing act between data, intuition, and stakeholder alignment.</p>



<p>Always remember that teams are comprised of people, and people are better when they aren’t stretched thin across multiple contexts. Set a theme for the quarter (e.g., we’re going to nail this particular customer type or user persona), and focus on making material progress within that theme, instead of trying to solve a dozen problems for a dozen different customer segments. Great focus yields great results.</p>







<p>Someday, I’ll write a longer piece about driving organizational alignment (which is just a fancy way of saying “getting people to agree that this is the right thing to build”). Still, it’s so important that this article wouldn’t be complete without touching on it.</p>



<p>Organizational alignment has to start early, and often. The mechanics are incredibly variable, but there are a few unavoidable pieces:</p>



<ul><li><strong>1-1 conversations: </strong>Asking a group of 10 people, “what do you think about this?” isn’t how you create alignment and understanding. In my …</li></ul></div></article></main></div></div></div>

<p>Most likely, Joe Biden will pick his Vice President at some point in the next 10 days. The Democratic National Convention begins on August 17th and only two candidates in modern history have waited until then to announce their running mate.</p>



<p>Biden’s VP selection has been the largest (and essentially the only) story receiving constant attention related to his campaign for President over the last few months. It has been followed closely only by the narrative that he has lost his marbles which has flared up once again following his regrettable comments about African Americans the other day. One could even speculate that the first storyline has been dragged out by Biden’s campaign intentionally in order to prevent the second from receiving more attention than it already is.</p>



<p>These top two storylines are fundamentally about indecision and a lack of fitness to serve as President, respectively. These are not good themes for someone aiming to get elected President, a role which requires one to be decisive and fit to serve as two of the most primary prerequisites.</p>



<p>I remain baffled by the way Biden’s original VP guarantee has been almost unanimously applauded and totally uncontroversial in the media. If Biden knew his pick already and she was a woman, I would have had no problem with him saying so a few months ago without prematurely revealing her identity at that stage. That was clearly not the case.</p>



<p>The fact of the matter is that Biden had no idea who he was going to pick when he made that guarantee to help secure the primary. This has been demonstrated by months of indecision on the matter with several names moving up and down the leaderboard of his most likely picks. This, to me, makes his guarantee an unfortunate one, though I try to give him the benefit of the doubt that his intentions were good at best and simply to get votes at worst.</p>



<p>That said, if I was a woman, I cannot imagine that I would want the first female Vice President to be selected this way, with the fact that she is a woman being the first and most outwardly advertised criteria. Furthermore, it now seems that our potential next VP’s race has become the second most necessary qualification, although Biden has not as explicitly said so.</p>



<p>I believe that the first female Vice President deserves to be selected at least apparently because she is the best person for the job, not just because she is the best woman for the job or the best black woman for the job. She should be chosen as the best candidate from a field that includes the best of the best regardless of gender or race. Anything else suggests that no woman is capable of landing the position by merit and that is so obviously not true.</p>



<p>Have people already forgotten that Hillary won the popular vote last election? We were well on our way to having our first female President well before this ugly and unnecessary VP guarantee.</p>



<p>Barack Obama won back to back elections to become the first black President. Can you imagine how much less meaningful that would have been if he was instead elected after we decided as a country that we were only going to pick from a pool of black candidates that year? Americans decided he was the best person for the job. That’s how it should be.</p>



<p>Biden’s VP selection comes with added consequence considering he would become the oldest President in America’s history on his first day in The Oval Office. Assuming he makes it through his first term, which is all but guaranteed, it seems doubtful that he would run for a second one. That would leave his VP as the candidate closest to being an incumbent and, all else equal, the most likely to win.</p>



<p>To be clear, I look forward to the day we have our first female President. I just hope she rises to power via election by the people of America, not via selection by the consultants of a presidential candidate who are only looking to assure the greatest possible benefit to his polls.</p>

<p><em>This article was published in The Seybold Report Volume 30 Number 6, November 2000. It was a strange time when QuickDraw GX 3rd party developments like Japanese stroke fonts and plug-in font scalers were up in the air without a clear migration path to the newly announced MacOS X ATSUI Carbon framework, OpenType Japanese fonts and InDesign J had been announced but were months away from shipping, and Japanese print customers were angry with Adobe and Morisawa for forcing font upgrades on everybody. It’s a snapshot of Japanese publishing in transition as Steve Jobs was saving Apple and tossing the Japanese print market a few morsels like extended Japanese glyph sets, Adobe was caught flat footed and was furious with Apple.</em></p>



<hr>



<p>Japanese DTP arrived with Apple’s NTX-J PostScript printer and Linotype’s first Japanese PostScript imagesetter in 1989. They came at the right time: The early- ’90s economy was bubbling, companies had money to burn and Japanese DTP took off. It was a young, booming market and it forgave many mistakes that would haunt the industry later.</p>



<p>By 1996, the go-go days were gone and they would not come back. By this time, DTP tools (Quark Xpress, Illustrator, Photoshop and, to a smaller extent, PageMaker) had captured nearly 40 percent of the production process. For a conservative industry like Japanese publishing, this was phenomenal―until compared to the West. There, in the same amount of time, practically the entire industry converted to DTP production. Japan is still about 40 percent and holding.</p>



<p>What happened? Three things: the economy, the failure of Western technology to address Japanese issues, and the same old cultural differences Westerners have been running into since Commodore Perry knocked down the doors in 1853. They just do things differently here, get used to it.</p>



<p>The economic crunch hit the publishing market hard, and it hasn’t really recovered. Consider the book and magazine market: On average, this year’s revenues are down 3.4 percent over last year.</p>

<p>Basically, the publishing industry overextended itself in the bubble years of the early ’90s and is still adjusting.</p>



<p>Some of the difficulty is the publication distribution structure. Anybody in the business will tell you there just isn’t enough shelf space and return rates are climbing. Internet publishing is not much of a factor yet. Japanese book retail laws, which prohibit stores from selling below suggested retail prices, will be relaxed soon and will put tremendous pressure on the current price structure, which supports lots of marginally profitable items</p>



<p>The Japanese market is also a highly segmented one. There are the major newspapers, which have very specialized workflow systems and in-house fonts. There is the book industry, which runs the gamut from standard tanko bon hardbacks to the ingenious, very popular pocket-size bunko hon paperbacks (which really have no equal in the West). There are lots of printers, using both DTP and traditional systems, that cover everything in-between. In a class of their own are manga: the hefty weekly comic books you can find on subway luggage racks, left there by salarymen too embarrassed to take them home.</p>

<p>On the whole, the industry is still in a slump and has been treading water for the last few years, with relatively little investment in new technologies such as computer-to-plate. At the same time, competition and consolidation in the printing sector have forced prices down-more than 30 percent in the past year alone-so there is a great need to reduce production costs and increase efficiency. This is the great challenge of the Japanese publishing industry. Meeting it will require new investment in hardware and software. The challenge for vendors is to provide the right products. Those who watch the market and listen to customers carefully will find opportunity.</p>



<p><strong>The font technology failure</strong><br>A designer once said, “Fonts are like air.” They are the environment in which DTP lives and thrives. Compared to the West, the Japanese DTP air is pretty thin.</p>



<p>One of the great tragedies was the refusal of <a href="https://atadistance.net/2020/04/25/requiem-for-shaken/" data-type="post" data-id="44199">Shaken KK</a>, the largest, most popular, and perhaps most beautiful Japanese font library, to license its faces to Adobe or have anything to do with PostScript. It kept its proprietary machines and formats, losing over 40 percent of its market share (and lots of prestige and talent) in the bargain. The industry is filled with ex-Shaken people. A low point came a year and a half ago when tax raiders found several safes in the company basement filled with 10,000-yen bills; the president of Shaken, Yuko Ishii had stashed away the money in the early ’80s and was now reporting it as profit.</p>



<p>This sorry state of affairs had two huge repercussions. It denied a large part of the Japanese font legacy to designers working with DTP. (Imagine a world without Helvetica and Times and you get the idea.) It also left the only other competitor, Morisawa, which did license its library to Adobe, with a practical monopoly. But these were not the only problems.</p>



<p><strong>Initial problems</strong><br>The first implementation of Japanese PostScript Type 1 fonts had serious shortcomings. First of all, they could not be downloaded on a per-job basis, but had to reside permanently on the printer. This turned the production process upside down; service bureaus and printers were suddenly dictating to designers which fonts could and could not be used. For every PostScript device, users had to invest in font licenses― and Japanese fonts are very expensive. In a market where making a single face can easily require ¥30,000,000 (about $280,000) and consume two years, font vendors made sure they got maximum return on their investments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To this end, Morisawa and Adobe came up with the idea of marketing two flavors of PostScript printer fonts: low-resolution (up to 600 dpi) and unlimited. A single unlimited-resolution Japanese font costs ¥218,000 (about $2,000).</p>



<p>The situation became more complex when ATM J arrived on the scene in late 1993. Morisawa’s ATM fonts used hardware binding to lock the font to the hard disk. This resulted in a high maintenance operation, because hardware binding required installer floppies for each font and for every CPU. (This remains true even today.) If the user got a new hard disk, he had to send the old floppies back to the vendor and exchange them, for a fee, for new ones. Large operations had the extra burden of keeping track of the floppy that had been installed on each CPU. On top of all this, each installation took time; putting a family of 15 Kanji fonts on two or three Macs could easily eat up a day.</p>



<p>In addition, compared to traditional systems, these fonts had primitive typographic features: lack of pair kerning, lack of proper metrics and poor Gaiji support. (Gaiji are Kanji characters outside of the current JIS [Japanese Industrial Standard] and Unicode encoding sets and are not included in a standard font. They comprise many “unofficial” Kanji characters, mistakes and misinterpretations, and seldom used Kanji passed down for generations, long before printing presses and governments created standards.</p>



<p>These Gaiji characters are widely used in people and place names. To this day, they are a reason for publishers to hang on to their proprietary systems. Last but not least, Japanese PostScript fonts were not cross platform.</p>



<p><strong>The first fix</strong><br>Adobe has been trying to fix the font problem. Its first attempt was CID (character-key ID). CID divorced two-byte PostScript fonts from dependence on any encoding scheme and allowed character subsets to be downloaded to the printer on a job basis, laying the foundation for PDF font embedding in Japanese Acrobat 4.0 as well.</p>



<p>Unfortunately the CID font upgrade was a marketing washout. Upgrades were not cheap, and there were few benefits the end user could really see. Morisawa also decided to tweak some glyph designs and the font metrics. Designers would open old files with the new fonts and find they had to redo everything. They stayed away in droves. As a result, the installed base is still overwhelmingly OCF (original composite font), which has slowed acceptance of PDF as a major production format.</p>



<p><strong>Dueling fixes</strong><br>Adobe’s final solution for the Japanese font problem is OpenType. OpenType will be a very big deal and, in the long term, fundamentally change the market. OpenType finally brings true font parity between Windows and Mac. Morisawa and Fontworks are busy preparing OpenType upgrades. It marks the first time their font libraries will be available cross-platform. Both companies see Windows as an opportunity for revenue growth―something that has been missing on the Mac side for years. Users will finally be able to choose the platform that best fits their needs and budgets without worrying about font problems.</p>



<p>This will be especially interesting because Mac OS X and OpenType are both arriving in 2001. According to a Japanese Publishing Consortium survey in 1999, Apple has nearly 80 percent of the DTP installed base. However, a large share of the machines in the printing and publishing areas (but not in design) are pre-G3 PowerPC systems that will have to be upgraded to run Mac OS X. Apple Japan’s “We’ll let the market decide” marketing statements may become a true nightmare if the market chooses Windows instead of Mac OS X</p>



<p><strong>Adobe Japan 1-4</strong><br>The most important feature of Japanese OpenType will be the Adobe Japan 1-4 character collection. This is the big Gaiji fix everybody has been waiting for. AJ 1-4 addresses the Gaiji encoding problem and provides a consistent and cross-platform way for font developers to add Gaiji to OpenType fonts. Adobe says the collection …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>While working on <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/">Qvault’s</a> <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/playground/go">Go Playground</a>, I came across a very strange error. The standard library’s <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/?m=all#Printf" rel="noopener">fmt.Printf()</a> function prints nothing to the console when called. <em>Nothing.</em></p>



<p>For those of you who are familiar with the function, when compiled to a “normal” executable <code>fmt.Printf</code> prints a formatted string to standard output. As per the official documentation, this program:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	const name, age = "Kim", 22
	fmt.Printf("%s is %d years old.", name, age)
}</code></pre>



<p>Will print:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">Kim is 22 years old.</code></pre>



<p>The interesting thing is that when the same exact program is compiled using Web Assembly, we get a different result. If you want to try it, copy the above program and run it <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/playground/go">here</a>.</p>



<p>Spoiler alert: <em>It doesn’t print anything.</em></p>



<p>However, if you change the program slightly:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	const name, age = "Kim", 22
	// add a newline character
	fmt.Printf("%s is %d years old.\n", name, age)
}</code></pre>



<p>Then it may print the expected:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">Kim is 22 years old.</code></pre>



<p> thought if you run the two programs back to back, you may actually find that this is printed instead:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">Kim is 22 years old.Kim is 22 years old.</code></pre>



<h2>Why?</h2>



<p>When compiled to Web Assembly, the <code>fmt.Printf</code> function is writing to a buffer, and that buffer is not cleared until a newline character is printed to standard out. In other words, you can call <code>fmt.Printf</code> as many times as you want, but nothing is printed until a <code>\n</code> character comes through standard output.</p>



<p>Take a look at the <code>writeSync()</code> code in Go’s <a href="https://github.com/lane-c-wagner/classroom.qvault.io/blob/master/public/wasm_exec.js#L43">wasm_exec.js</a>, which is a required include to execute Go Web Assembly in the browser:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">writeSync(fd, buf) {
	outputBuf += decoder.decode(buf);
	const nl = outputBuf.lastIndexOf("\n");
	if (nl != -1) {
		console.log(outputBuf.substr(0, nl));
		outputBuf = outputBuf.substr(nl + 1);
	}
	return buf.length;
}</code></pre>



<p>As you can see, <code>console.log()</code> is only called on the buffer if a newline is found within the output string, otherwise the output is just appended to the stateful <code>outputBuf</code>.</p>



<p>My current working theory is that it was implemented this way because there is no way to print to the console in a browser without appending a newline. JavaScript’s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/log" rel="noopener">console.log()</a> <em>always </em>appends a newline.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In the classical world, it is quite common that we could make an exactly the same copy of something. However, in the quantum world, the laws of physics impose a severe restriction on copying: It is impossible to make a perfect copy of an unknown state.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss the No-Cloning Theorem in quantum theory.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="kronecker-product-inverse-transpose-property">Kronecker Product Inverse-Transpose Property</h4>

<p>Conjugate transposition are distributive over the Kronecker product:</p><p>

\[(A \otimes B)^{\dagger} =  A^{\dagger} \otimes B^{\dagger}\]

\[\begin{align}
(A \otimes B)^{\dagger} &amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    A_{0,0}B &amp; A_{0,1}B &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{0,n-1}B \\
    A_{1,0}B &amp; A_{1,1}B &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{1,n-1}B \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    A_{m-1,0}B &amp; A_{m-1,1}B &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{m-1,n-1}B \\
\end{bmatrix}^{\dagger} 
\nonumber\\
&amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    (A_{0,0}B)^{\dagger} &amp; (A_{1,0}B)^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; (A_{m-1,0}B)^{\dagger} \\
    (A_{0,1}B)^{\dagger} &amp; (A_{1,1}B)^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; (A_{m-1,1}B)^{\dagger} \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    (A_{0,n-1}B)^{\dagger} &amp; (A_{1,n-1}B)^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; (A_{m-1,n-1}B)^{\dagger} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\nonumber\\
&amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    \overline{A_{0,0}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \overline{A_{1,0}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; \overline{A_{m-1,0}}B^{\dagger} \\
    \overline{A_{0,1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \overline{A_{1,1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; \overline{A_{m-1,1}}B^{\dagger} \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    \overline{A_{0,n-1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \overline{A_{1,n-1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; \overline{A_{m-1,n-1}}B^{\dagger} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\nonumber\\
&amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    A_{0,0}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; A_{0,1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{0, m-1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} \\
    A_{1,0}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; A_{1,1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{1, m-1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    A_{n-1,0}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; A_{n-1,1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{n-1,m-1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\nonumber\\
&amp;=
A^{\dagger} \otimes B^{\dagger} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="kronecker-product-mixed-product-property">Kronecker Product Mixed-Product Property</h4>

<p>Let $A \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times n}$, $B \in \mathbb{C}^{r \times s}$, $C \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times p}$, and $D \in \mathbb{C}^{s \times t}$, then</p><p>

\[(A \otimes B)(C \otimes D) = (AC) \otimes (BD)\]

</p><p>This has been proved in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Kronecker-Product-In-Circuits/">Kronecker Product In Circuits</a>.</p>

<h4 id="inner-product-expansion-property">Inner Product Expansion Property</h4>

<p>Suppose $|x\rangle$ is any unit vector whose $|x|^2 = \langle x | x \rangle = 1$. We have $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| x \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle)$</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
(\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle) &amp;= (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle)^{\dagger} (|\phi\rangle \otimes |x\rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} \otimes | x \rangle^{\dagger}) (|\phi\rangle \otimes |x\rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger}|\phi\rangle) \otimes (| x \rangle^{\dagger}|x\rangle) \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes \langle x | x \rangle\\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes 1\\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle\\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="unitary-matrix-preserves-inner-product">Unitary Matrix Preserves Inner Product</h4>

<p>Given two complex vectors $x$ and $y$, multiplication by unitary matrix $U$ preserves their inner product.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle Ux, Uy \rangle &amp;= \langle x, y \rangle
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Using the definition of inner product,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle Ux, Uy \rangle &amp;= (Uy)^{\dagger} (Ux) \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger}U^{\dagger} U x \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger}(U^{\dagger} U) x \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger} I x \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger} x \\
&amp;= \langle x, y \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h3 id="no-cloning-theorem">No-Cloning Theorem</h3>

<p>In quantum mechanics, copy, as it is the same to other quantum operators except measurement operators, is an reversible and linear operator.</p>



<p>Given any unknown normalized quantum state $| \phi \rangle$, and the copy operator $U$, we are supposed to have the following mathematical expression if we are going to copy the quantum state $| \phi \rangle$ to another system whose quantum state is $|x \rangle$ before copy.</p><p>

\[| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle \xrightarrow[]{U} | \phi \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\]

</p><p>We would like to write this transformation into equation.</p><p>

\[U (| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | \phi \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\]

</p><p>Without loss of generality, we could have another state $| \psi \rangle$ that is applied to the copy operator.</p><p>

\[U (| \psi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | \psi \rangle \otimes |\psi\rangle\]

</p><p>Note that for $| \psi \rangle$ we also used $|x\rangle$ which $| \phi \rangle$ is using, meaning that before copy, the “vacant” system is always the same. This is something we could guarantee.</p>



<p>We examine the inner product of $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ using the copy property and all the properties in the prerequisite section.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle) \\
&amp;= \big(U (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |)\big) \big(U (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle)\big) \\
&amp;= (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle \phi |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle)^{\dagger} (| \phi \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} \otimes | \psi \rangle^{\dagger}) (| \phi \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} | \phi \rangle ) \otimes (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} | \phi \rangle ) \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle$ is scalar, we further have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Solving the above equation, we have $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = 0$ or $1$.</p>



<p>Because $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ could be any arbitrary unknown states, $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = 0$ or $1$ could never be satisfied.</p>



<p>Therefore, there is no general quantum copy operator that makes copy of any unknown state.</p>

<h3 id="more-restrict-no-cloning-theorem">More Restrict No-Cloning Theorem</h3>

<p>In quantum theory, $| \phi \rangle$ and $c | \phi \rangle$, where $c$ is a non-zero complex number, represent the same physical state. If $|c \phi|^2 = 1$, then $| \phi \rangle$ and $c | \phi \rangle$ only have phase difference.</p>



<p>For example, $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ have exactly the same probability of collapsing to $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$. However, $| \phi \rangle$ has phase $\varphi_1$ while $| \psi \rangle$ has phase $\varphi_2$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \phi \rangle &amp;= \cos \frac{\theta}{2} | 0 \rangle + e^{i\varphi_1} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} | 1 \rangle \\
| \psi \rangle &amp;= \cos \frac{\theta}{2} | 0 \rangle + e^{i\varphi_2} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} | 1 \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>More restrict No-Cloning Theorem states that “copying” any unknown state while abandoning the phase is not possible either.</p>



<p>Suppose we have such “copy” operator, the mathematical expression for “copy” will be as follows.</p><p>

\[U (| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = e^{\varphi} | \phi \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\\
U (| \psi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = e^{\varphi^{\prime}} | \psi \rangle \otimes |\psi\rangle\]

</p><p>Similarly, we have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= e^{\varphi} e^{\varphi^{\prime}}\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2 \\
&amp;= e^{\varphi + \varphi^{\prime}} \langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The norm of the two sides should be equivalent.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle| &amp;= |e^{\varphi + \varphi^{\prime}} \langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= |e^{\varphi + \varphi^{\prime}}| |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= 1 |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle |^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Solving the above equation, we have $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle | = 0$ or $1$.</p>



<p>Because $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ could be any arbitrary unknown states, $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle | = 0$ or $1$ could never be satisfied.</p>



<p>Therefore, there is no general quantum “copy” operator that makes “copy” of any unknown state that has lost the phase information.</p>

<h3 id="transportation">Transportation</h3>

<p>Since it is not possible to do copy in quantum world, how about transportation?</p>



<p>Concretely, given any unknown normalized quantum state $| \phi \rangle$, and the transportation operator $U$, we are supposed to have the following mathematical expression if we are going to transport the quantum state $| \phi \rangle$ to another system whose quantum state is $|x \rangle$ before transportation.</p><p>

\[U(| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | x \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\]

</p><p>Note that although it is called transportation, it is more like a switch, where the two system states, one unknown and one known, got switched.</p>



<p>Without loss of generality, we could have another state $| \psi \rangle$ that is applied to the transportation operator.</p><p>

\[U(| \psi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | x \rangle \otimes |\psi\rangle\]

</p><p>Similarly, we compute the inner product of $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle) \\
&amp;= \big(U (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |)\big) \big(U (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle)\big) \\
&amp;= (\langle x | \otimes \langle \phi |) (| x \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| x \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle)^{\dagger} (| x \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| x \rangle^{\dagger} \otimes | \psi \rangle^{\dagger}) (| x \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| x \rangle^{\dagger} | x \rangle ) \otimes (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} | \phi \rangle ) \\
&amp;= \langle x | x \rangle \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= 1 \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

<p>For more than two millennia, Western thinkers have separated emotion from cognition – emotion being the poorer sibling of the two. Cognition helps to explain the nature of space-time and sends humans to the Moon. Emotion might save the lioness in the savannah, but it also makes humans act irrationally with disconcerting frequency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the quest to create intelligent robots, designers tend to focus on purely rational, cognitive capacities. It’s tempting to disregard emotion entirely, or include only as much as necessary. But without emotion to help determine the personal significance of objects and actions, I doubt that true intelligence can exist – not the kind that beats human opponents at chess or the game of Go, but the sort of smarts that we humans recognise as such. Although we can refer to certain behaviours as either ‘emotional’ or ‘cognitive’, this is really a linguistic short-cut. The two can’t be teased apart.</p>



<p>What counts as sophisticated, intelligent behaviour in the first place? Consider a crew of robots on a mission to Mars. To act intelligently, the robots can’t just scuttle about taking pictures of the environment and collecting dirt and mineral samples. They’d need to be able to figure out how to reach a target destination, and come up with alternative tactics if the most direct path is blocked. If pressed for time, the team of robots would have to know which materials are more important and to be prioritised as part of the expedition.</p>



<p>Part of being intelligent, then, is about the ability to function autonomously in various conditions and environments. Emotion is helpful here because it allows an agent to piece together the most significant kinds of information. For example, emotion can <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/designing-sociable-robots" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">instil</a> a sense of urgency in actions and decisions. Imagine crossing a patch of desert in an unreliable car, during the hottest hours of the day. If the vehicle breaks down, what you need is a quick fix to get you to the next town, not a more permanent solution that might be perfect but could take many hours to complete in the beating sun. In real-world scenarios, a ‘good’ outcome is often all that’s required, but without the external pressure of perceiving a ‘stressful’ situation, an android might take too long trying to find the optimal solution.</p>



<p>Most <a href="http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195166194.001.0001/acprof-9780195166194" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proposals</a> for emotion in robots involve the addition of a separate ‘emotion module’ – some sort of bolted-on affective architecture that can influence other abilities such as perception and cognition. The idea would be to give the agent access to an enriched set of properties, such as the urgency of an action or the meaning of facial expressions. These properties could help to determine issues such as which visual objects should be processed first, what memories should be recollected, and which decisions will lead to better outcomes.</p>



<p>But research from the behavioural and brain sciences suggests that emotion is not just an ‘added feature’ layered on top of ‘standard’ cognition. Instead, it’s an integral part of our cognitive machinery. In one of the <a href="http://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0904551106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">experiments</a> from my lab, people in a scanner watched videos of rapid, flashed-up images of either a house or a skyscraper. They had to identify which of these scenes was present in the video, a task designed to be very difficult. We then introduced an element of emotional manipulation. Before viewing the clips, half of the participants received a mild electric shock while viewing a series of skyscrapers; the other half, instead, watched a series of houses appear, paired with the same mild shock. This is what’s known as <em>classical conditioning</em>, and links an initially neutral stimulus (a nondescript picture) with the emotional meaning of the unpleasant stimulus (the shock).</p>



<p>The outcome: participants conditioned to the skyscrapers were better at detecting them than at detecting houses; conversely, participants conditioned to houses detected those better than they did skyscrapers. And in each case, responses in the visual cortex were stronger for the type of stimulus (house or skyscraper) to which participants had been conditioned. This study shows that perception is not a passive process that merely reflects the external world. Rather, it involves picking up on the significance of objects, and determines how they are processed. Vision is never neutral, it is always laden with affective meaning.</p>



<p>It’s the architecture of the brain, with its short- and long-range connections, that allows these properties to emerge. Emotion doesn’t come about from local computations in a single region, such as the amygdala, which is frequently called the ‘emotion centre’ in the brain. Instead, anatomical <a href="http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1238406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studies</a> have revealed that the areas in the brain associated with perception, cognition, emotion, motivation, action and bodily sensations are closely <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2017.03.002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intertwined</a>. Looking at the brain as a complex network helps to clarify why some brain structures, such as the amygdala, are important for emotion: they’re hubs, much like major airports that link to a very large number of destinations. As a consequence, these regions can influence and be influenced by many parts of the brain – which also suggests that it’s not possible to subtract emotion without affecting cognition.</p>



<p>The point is <em>not</em> that emotion is needed for intelligent, autonomous robots – the answer is yes – but that emotion needs to be hooked up to everything that goes on in a cognitive system. Emotion is not an ‘add-on’ module that endows a robot with feelings or allows it to express an internal state, such as the current risk of overheating. Its integration is a design principle of the information-processing architecture. Without emotion, no being that we might create can have any hope of aspiring to true intelligence.</p>

<p>Work hard, become successful, <em>then</em> you’ll be happy. At least, that’s what many of us were taught by our parents, teachers and peers. The idea that we must pursue success in order to experience happiness is enshrined in the United States’ most treasured institutions (the Declaration of Independence), beliefs (the American dream), and stories (<em>Rocky</em> and Cinderella). Most people <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11392863" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">want</a> to be happy, so we chase success like a proverbial carrot on a stick – thinking that contentment lurks just the other side of getting into college, landing a dream job, being promoted or making six figures. But for many chasers, both success and happiness remain perpetually out of reach. The problem is that the equation might be backwards. </p>



<p>Our <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1069072707308140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypothesis</a> is that happiness precedes and leads to career success – not the other way around. In psychological <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232577536_Subjective_Well-Being_Three_Decades_of_Progress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">science</a>, ‘happiness’ relates to ‘subjective wellbeing’ and ‘positive emotions’ (we use the terms interchangeably). Those with greater wellbeing tend to be more satisfied with their lives, and also to experience more positive emotions and fewer negative ones. Research <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1069072717751441?journalCode=jcaa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggests</a> that it’s these positive emotions – such as excitement, joy, and serenity – that promote success in the workplace.</p>



<p>Let’s look first at the cross-sectional studies that examine people at a single point. This allows researchers to determine whether happiness and success are correlated. Relative to their glummer peers, happier people are more satisfied with their <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1348/096317909X478557" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jobs</a>; they also receive greater <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001879196915560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social support</a> from co-workers and better <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/(SICI)1099-1379(199901)20:1%3C1::AID-JOB885%3E3.0.CO;2-W" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">performance evaluations</a> from supervisors. Notably, it might be that bosses give happy employees higher performance evaluations due to a halo effect, where a favourable impression in one area (such as happiness) influences opinion in another area (such as work ability): eg, ‘Tim is happy, so he must be great at his job too.’ However, there’s also some evidence that people with higher wellbeing perform better on a range of work-related tasks: one pivotal <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232497771_Explanatory_Style_as_a_Predictor_of_Productivity_and_Quitting_Among_Life_Insurance_Sales_Agents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> found that sales agents with a more positive outlook sold 37 per cent more life-insurance policies than their less positive colleagues.</p>



<p>Happiness is associated with excellent work performance in <a href="http://www.shawnachor.com/the-books/the-happiness-advantage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other areas</a> as well. People who frequently experience positive emotions <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2012.01017.x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tend to</a> go above and beyond for their organisations; they’re also less likely to be <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/10717919070130020401" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">absent</a> from work or <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-03046-001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quit</a> their jobs. People with better wellbeing also tend to earn bigger <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1014411319119.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">salaries</a> than those with lower wellbeing.</p>



<p>However, such cross-sectional research has its limits, since it can’t establish which comes first – happiness or success. Longitudinal studies can help here, as they follow people over days, weeks, months or years to see how they’ve changed over time. According to the longitudinal literature, people who start out happy eventually become successful, too. The more content a person is at an earlier point in time, the more likely she is to be clear later on about what <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001879105001016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kind of job</a> she wants, as well as to fill out more <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/peps.12027" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">job applications</a>, and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0146167212444906?casa_token=vPK_H2R02nQAAAAA:K-Q5uKmbRhlEekZ_6XOcUQ522go9OJ79pRU-bZ6umWZGfzJ34ThuC7lW5HwJ0hP8Ky9y65R_V05O-bo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">find</a> employment. A key <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1005539609679.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> found that young people who reported higher wellbeing than their peers just before graduating from college were more likely to receive follow-up job interviews three months later.</p>



<p>Positive emotions are also predictors of later achievement and earnings. In one <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12635918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>, happy 18-year-olds were more likely to be working in prestigious, satisfying jobs and to feel financially secure by age 26. In <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1019672513984.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another</a>, people who were more cheerful when starting college went on to have higher incomes.</p>



<p>But it’s not enough to establish that happiness comes <em>before</em> success; we want to know, does one <em>cause</em> the other? After all, there could be some unmeasured variable, such as intelligence or extraversion, that’s driving both wellbeing and work performance. Indeed, extraverts are more likely both to be <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7449572_Personality_and_the_Prediction_of_Consequential_Outcomes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">happy</a> and to earn <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9914.2010.00477.x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">greater incomes</a>.</p>



<p>Well-designed experiments can control for these variables. For example, studies have randomly assigned people to situations that make them feel neutral, negative or positive emotional states, and then measured their subsequent performance on work-related tasks. These <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00992168" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">experiments</a> <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/1986-29171-001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showed</a> that people who are made to feel positive emotions set more ambitious goals, persist at challenging tasks for longer, view themselves and others more favourably, and believe they will succeed. Happy people’s optimistic expectations appear to be realistic, too: on both <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1990.tb00417.x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clerical-coding</a> assignments and <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00992168.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">digit-substitution</a> tasks, people with positive emotions <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1526075" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tend</a> to do better and be more productive than those in the grip of neutral or negative emotions. The weight of experimental evidence suggests that happier people outperform less happy people, and that their positive demeanour is probably the cause.</p>



<p>From our review of more than 170 cross-sectional, longitudinal and experimental studies, it’s clear that wellbeing promotes career success in many ways. That’s not to say that unhappy people can’t succeed – which is just as well, as a sad person reading this and telling herself she <em>must</em> cheer up to be successful is unlikely to help matters! To the contrary, history demonstrates that depressed individuals such as Abraham Lincoln and Winston Churchill can accomplish incredible feats. Both negative and positive emotions are adaptive to situations – there’s a time to be sad, just like there’s a time to be happy.</p>



<p>So for any business leaders or managers reading this, we’d caution against hiring only overtly happy people or pressuring your employees to be more upbeat. Such strategies have backfired in the past – as in the case of the mandatory jollity imposed on staff at the US supermarket chain Trader Joe’s, where the policy ironically made workers more miserable. People and companies hoping to boost happiness in a healthier way would have better luck if they <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19301241" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced</a> positive activities, like performing acts of kindness and expressing gratitude.</p>



<p>The philosopher Bertrand Russell in 1951 said that: ‘The good life, as I conceive it, is a happy life.’ But he went on: ‘I do not mean that if you are good you will be happy; I mean that if you are happy you will be good.’ When it comes to making your mark at work, we agree. If you want to be successful, don’t hang around and wait to find happiness: <em>start</em> there instead.</p>

A speaker with a stream of slides full of text, monotonously reading them off as we read along.  We’re so used to it we expect it.  We accept it.  We even consider it ‘learning’. As an educator I push against ‘death by PowerPoint’ and I'm fascinated with how we can improve the way we present and teach.  The fact is we know that PowerPoint kills.  Most often the only victims are our audience’s inspiration and interest.  This, however, is the story of a PowerPoint slide that actually helped kill seven people.</p><p>January 16th 2003.  NASA Mission STS-107 is underway. The Space Shuttle Columbia launches carrying its crew of seven to low orbit.  Their objective was to study the effects of microgravity on the human body and on ants and spiders they had with them.  Columbia had been the first Space Shuttle, first launched in 1981 and had been on 27 missions prior to this one.  Whereas other shuttle crews had focused on work to the Hubble Space Telescope or to the International Space Station this mission was one of pure scientific research.  </p><p>The launch proceeded as normal.  The crew settled into their mission.  They would spend 16 days in orbit, completing 80 experiments.  One day into their mission it was clear to those back on Earth that something had gone wrong.  </p><p>As a matter of protocol NASA staff reviewed footage from an external camera mounted to the fuel tank.  At eighty-two seconds into the launch a piece of spray on foam insulation (SOFI) fell from one of the ramps that attached the shuttle to its external fuel tank.  As the crew rose at 28,968 kilometres per hour the piece of foam collided with one of the tiles on the outer edge of the shuttle’s left wing.  </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555166931302_17738"><div><p>It was impossible to tell from Earth how much damage this foam, falling nine times faster than a fired bullet, would have caused when it collided with the wing.   Foam falling during launch was nothing new.  It had happened on four previous missions and was one of the reasons why the camera was there in the first place.  But the tile the foam had struck was on the edge of the wing designed to protect the shuttle from the heat of Earth’s atmosphere during launch and re-entry.  In space the shuttle was safe but NASA didn’t know how it would respond to re-entry.  There were a number of options.  The astronauts could perform a spacewalk and visually inspect the hull.  NASA could launch another Space Shuttle to pick the crew up.  Or they could risk re-entry.  </p><p>NASA officials sat down with Boeing Corporation engineers who took them through three reports; a total of 28 slides.    The salient point was whilst there was data showing that the tiles on the shuttle wing could tolerate being hit by the foam this was based on test conditions using foam more than 600 times smaller than that that had struck Columbia.  This is the slide the engineers chose to illustrate this point:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555166931302_26426"><div><p>NASA managers listened to the engineers and their PowerPoint.  The engineers felt they had communicated the potential risks.  NASA felt the engineers didn’t know what would happen but that all data pointed to there not being enough damage to put the lives of the crew in danger.  They rejected the other options and pushed ahead with Columbia re-entering Earth’s atmosphere as normal.  Columbia was scheduled to land at 0916 (EST) on February 1st 2003.  Just before 0900, 61,170 metres above Dallas at 18 times the speed of sound, temperature readings on the shuttle’s left wing were abnormally high and then were lost.  Tyre pressures on the left side were soon lost as was communication with the crew.  At 0912, as Columbia should have been approaching the runway, ground control heard reports from residents near Dallas that the shuttle had been seen disintegrating.  Columbia was lost and with it her crew of seven.  The oldest crew member was 48.  </p><p>The shuttle programme was on lock down, grounded for two years as the investigation began.  The cause of the accident became clear: <em>a hole in a tile on the left wing caused by the foam let the wing dangerously overheat until the shuttle disintegrated</em>.  </p><p>The questions to answer included a very simple one: <strong>Why, given that the foam strike had occurred at a force massively out of test conditions had NASA proceeded with re-entry? </strong> </p><p>Edward Tufte, a Professor at Yale University and expert in communication reviewed the slideshow the Boeing engineers had given NASA, in particular the above slide.  His findings were tragically profound.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555332030872_26463"><p>Thirdly, there is a huge amount of text, more than 100 words or figures on one screen.   Two words, ‘SOFI’ and ‘ramp’ both mean the same thing: the foam.  Vague terms are used.  <em>Sufficient</em> is used once, <em>significant </em>or <em>significantly</em>, five times with little or no quantifiable data.  As a result this left a lot open to audience interpretation.  How much is significant?  Is it statistical significance you mean or something else?  </p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555332030872_55842"><div><p>NASA’s subsequent report criticised technical aspects along with human factors.  <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/akamai.netstorage/anon.nasa-global/CAIB/CAIB_lowres_full.pdf" target="_blank">Their report</a> mentioned an over-reliance on PowerPoint:</p><p><em> “The Board views the endemic use of PowerPoint briefing slides instead of technical papers as an illustration of the problematic methods of technical communication at NASA.” </em></p><p> Edward Tufte’s full report makes for<a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB" target="_blank"> fascinating reading</a>. Since being released in 1987 PowerPoint has grown exponentially to the point where <a href="https://www.thinkoutsidetheslide.com/are-we-wasting-250-million-per-day-due-to-bad-powerpoint/" target="_blank">it is now estimated</a> than thirty million PowerPoint presentations are made every day.  Yet, PowerPoint is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/23/powerpoint-thought-students-bullet-points-information" target="_blank">blamed</a> by academics for killing critical thought.  Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2018/08/22/jeff-bezos-banned-powerpoint-presentations-at-amazon-meetings-heres-what-replaced-them/#4578b4773b5f" target="_blank">banned it from meetings</a>.   Typing text on a screen and reading it out loud does not count as teaching.  An audience reading text off the screen does not count as learning.  Imagine if the engineers had put up a slide with just: “<strong>foam strike more than 600 times bigger than test data</strong>.”  Maybe NASA would have listened.  Maybe they wouldn’t have attempted re-entry.  Next time you’re asked to give a talk remember Columbia. Don’t just jump to your laptop and write out slides of text.  Think about your message.  Don’t let that message be lost amongst text.  Death by PowerPoint is a real thing.  Sometimes literally.</p><p>Thanks for reading</p><p> - Jamie </p></div></div></div>]]>

Morrison shelters were a way of protecting people from in their own homes from falling bombs. This was an alternative to the Anderson shelter in the garden and the public shelters.</p><table><tbody>

<p>
The Morrison shelter’s official name is the “Table (<i>Morrison</i>) indoor shelter”, it was designed by John Baker and named after Herbert Morrison who was the Minister of Home Security at the time. The idea for the Morrison shelter was fed from the realization that there was a lack of indoor shelters as not enough homes had cellars.</p><p>

The Morrison shelter measured approximately 6 ft 6 inches (1.98m) long, 4 ft (1.21m) wide and 2 ft 6 inches (0.76m) high. With a steel plate “table” top, welded wire mesh sides, and a metal lath floor. Three tools were supplied with the pack that you built up inside your home and it had 359 parts altogether. A lot of people used the shelter as a table and had bedding inside of it.</p><table><tbody>

<p>
Derek Lambert <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0000CMLO7/">describes</a> how this new shelter at first appeared to be a more comfortable option:</p><blockquote>
When the first savagery of the night attacks faded we left the cupboard under the stairs and moved into a Morrison shelter.<p>

This was a large metal cage a little higher than a dinner table. It had a hefty iron frame with a sheet steel ceiling screwed together with chunky nuts and bolts. Underneath was a crude wire mattress. It was massive and angular and filled the dining room except for a space in front of the fire.</p><p>

It became part of the house, a foundation almost; we slept in it and on it, we ate from it, we played in it. When the siren sounded we were supposed to dive inside and put up steel mesh around the sides. Thus, according to the theorists, we were protected from falling masonry by the frame and steel ceiling and from flying rubble by the mesh cage.</p><p>

When the Germans resumed the destruction of such military targets as schools, shops, houses and sleeping cows we spent all night in the shelter...</p><p>

As the bombs stirred the ground and the shrapnel clattered down the road we fought a quiet battle of cunning for the bedclothes. Feet touched faces, arms swung across chests, elbows elbowed; snores bubbled and spluttered to be silenced by ostensibly accidental blows; fragments of wild dream-talk escaped from the depths of our private lives. Enmity was closer to the surface during those caged nights than at any other time in our well-mannered lives.</p><p>

The system collapsed after a few weeks. White-faced, shadow-eyed, we decided that for the sake of health and happiness two of us would have to evacuate the shelter. For the next few months my parents slept on top of it while I rolled and stretched and crawled and sometimes slept beneath. When the next lull in the bombing came we crept back to our beds.</p></blockquote><p>
Half a million Morrison shelters had been distributed by the end of 1941, with a further 100,000 being added in 1943 to prepare the population for the expected German V-1 flying bomb.

        <div>
            <p>I’ve developed an unusual approach to styling in my React code. It’s sort of a functional, atomic css approach. Other methods I’ve used are BEM + separate css files, styled components, and tailwind. By far this is the one that lets me move fastest on my personal projects (I haven’t yet subjected anybody at work to dealing with it). Without further ado.</p>
<h2 id="element-styling">Element Styling</h2>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx"><span>const</span> <span>buttonStyles</span> <span>=</span> <span>s</span>(<span>caps</span>, <span>px</span>(<span>s6</span>), <span>py</span>(<span>s5</span>), <span>clickable</span>);
<span>const</span> <span>activeStyles</span> <span>=</span> <span>s</span>(<span>buttonStyles</span>, <span>bg</span>(<span>"green"</span>), <span>fg</span>(<span>light0</span>));
<span>const</span> <span>inactiveStyles</span> <span>=</span> <span>s</span>(<span>buttonStyles</span>, <span>bg</span>(<span>light0</span>), <span>shadow</span>);
<span>return</span> (
  &lt;<span>Row</span> <span>style</span><span>=</span>{<span>s</span>(<span>fullWidth</span>, <span>alignCenter</span>)}&gt;
    &lt;<span>div</span> <span>style</span><span>=</span>{<span>s</span>(<span>weightSemiBold</span>, <span>f1</span>, <span>fg</span>(<span>dark6</span>))}&gt;<span>Do</span> <span>you</span> <span>have</span> <span>a</span> <span>PS4</span><span>?</span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span>Spacer</span> <span>width</span><span>=</span>{<span>s7</span>} /&gt;
    &lt;<span>div</span> <span>style</span><span>=</span>{<span>s</span>(<span>roundedLeft</span>, <span>hasPS4</span> <span>?</span> <span>activeStyles</span> : <span>inactiveStyles</span>)}&gt;
      <span>yes</span>
    &lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span>div</span> <span>style</span><span>=</span>{<span>s</span>(<span>roundedRight</span>, <span>hasPS4</span> <span>?</span> <span>inactiveStyles</span> : <span>activeStyles</span>)}&gt;
      <span>no</span>
    &lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;
  &lt;/<span>Row</span>&gt;
);
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>s</code> function is at the heart of the approach. It just takes objects and merges them:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx"><span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> (...<span>args</span>) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>_</span>.<span>assign</span>({}, ...<span>args</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>To feed into <code>s</code>, I’ve got a collection of atomic styling objects that can be pieced together, stuff like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx"><span>// Helper for constructing styles
</span><span></span><span>const</span> <span>keyedProp</span> <span>=</span> (<span>key</span>: <span>string</span>) <span>=&gt;</span> (<span>x</span>: <span>any</span>) <span>=&gt;</span> {
  <span>return</span> {
    [<span>key</span>]<span>:</span> <span>x</span>,
  };
};

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>fullWidth</span> <span>=</span> <span>keyedProp</span>(<span>"width"</span>)(<span>"100%"</span>);
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>clickable</span> <span>=</span> <span>keyedProp</span>(<span>"cursor"</span>)(<span>"pointer"</span>);

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>weightRegular</span> <span>=</span> <span>keyedProp</span>(<span>"fontWeight"</span>)(<span>400</span>);
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>weightSemiBold</span> <span>=</span> <span>keyedProp</span>(<span>"fontWeight"</span>)(<span>500</span>);
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>weightBold</span> <span>=</span> <span>keyedProp</span>(<span>"fontWeight"</span>)(<span>600</span>);

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>flexible</span> <span>=</span> <span>s</span>(<span>keyedProp</span>(<span>"flexBasis"</span>)(<span>0</span>), <span>keyedProp</span>(<span>"minWidth"</span>)(<span>0</span>));

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>fg</span> <span>=</span> <span>keyedProp</span>(<span>"color"</span>);
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>bg</span> <span>=</span> <span>keyedProp</span>(<span>"backgroundColor"</span>);

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>caps</span> <span>=</span> {
  <span>textTransform</span><span>:</span> <span>"uppercase"</span>,
  <span>letterSpacing</span><span>:</span> <span>"0.03rem"</span>,
};

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>size</span> <span>=</span> (<span>x</span>: <span>string</span> <span>|</span> <span>number</span>) <span>=&gt;</span> {
  <span>return</span> <span>s</span>(<span>height</span>(<span>x</span>), <span>width</span>(<span>x</span>));
};
</code></pre></div><p>There’s a lot more. Sometimes they take a parameter, sometimes they don’t, and all return style objects that can be fed into the <code>style</code> jsx attribute.</p>
<p>Anyone reading that has used tailwind probably recognizes this sort of style, of having a bunch of smaller rules that combine. There’s a few benefits to it being in code instead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile-time or runtime errors (depending on your setup). In tailwind if you type <code>mr_4</code> accidentally instead of <code>mr-4</code>, you won’t notice unless you see that the page isn’t laid out correctly. With this approach and Typescript I get an error right away.</li>
<li>Tailwind’s approach to being able to specify the background color as any of 100 colors is to create 100 CSS classes. You can get caught with a pretty large CSS file, and you can’t use dynamic colors. You get a similar usage here, but less drawbacks, instead of <code>bg-green</code> you write <code>bg("green")</code>, and if you want dynamic you can do <code>bg(someColorVar)</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another advantage of this approach is that it’s very ergonomic, and that’s partly because these style objects form a monoid under the <code>s</code> function. That sounds more complicated than it actually is, and has real benefits. First of all, it means there’s an identity element, like 0 in addition or 1 in multiplication. In this case it’s the empty object <code>{}</code>. This identity element is useful when you want nothing to happen, ex:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx">&lt;<span>div</span> <span>style</span><span>=</span>{<span>s</span>(<span>size</span>(<span>32</span>), <span>isActive</span> <span>?</span> <span>bg</span>(<span>"green"</span>) <span>:</span> {})} /&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Because we have an identity element we can put <code>{}</code> in there for the case where we don’t want anything to happen to the previous style when <code>isActive</code> is <code>false</code>. The other nice feature is that since <code>s</code> returns the same type as its input, we can use the output in a new call to <code>s</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx"><span>const</span> <span>regularButton</span> <span>=</span> <span>s</span>(<span>clickable</span>, <span>px</span>(<span>8</span>), <span>py</span>(<span>4</span>));
<span>// We can use the above style by itself, or we can
</span><span>// feed it into `s` again to create a new style
</span><span></span><span>const</span> <span>boldButton</span> <span>=</span> <span>s</span>(<span>regularButton</span>, <span>weightSemiBold</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>Just to round out the monoid thing for anyone curious what else makes it a monoid, <code>s</code> is associative, but there’s nothing useful about that.</p>
<p>Inline styles are bound to look ugly to some people. There’s nothing as clean as styled components markup. But that cleanliness comes at a cost. I find having to do two passes when writing markup to be a pain, since you have to write the markup then go make the components. It can also be hard to figure out how the styling is working based on the markup, having to jump back and forth between the markup and the definitions for complex layouts.</p>
<h2 id="spacing">Spacing</h2>
<p>A while back I read a comment or article on Hacker News that that spacing should be seen as its own element instead of properties of the other elements on the page. I found myself agreeing on principal, and I’ve seen benefits from putting it into practice. If you’ve got a header, followed by 16px of space, followed by body text, the traditional approach would be to give a <code>margin-bottom</code> of <code>16px</code> to the header. What I’ve been doing instead is this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx">&lt;<span>div</span>&gt; <span>Header</span> &lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;
&lt;<span>Spacer</span> <span>height</span><span>=</span>{<span>16</span>}/&gt;
&lt;<span>div</span>&gt; <span>Body</span> &lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>I’ve found this to be easier than giving margins to a bunch of my elements. It also makes the non-spacing elements more re-usable, since I don’t have to modify the spacing when I copy them over to some new page or component.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-349383fc=""><p><img src="https://drand.love/images/drand-launch-banner.png" alt="Banner for drand v1.0"></p> <p>Welcome to the brand new website for the drand project! Drand is now in production, providing publicly verifiable randomness as a foundational internet service.</p> <p>Below you'll find an introduction to drand, information on recent protocol upgrades, details about the expansion and strengthening of drand's largest deployment, the League of Entropy, and glimpses into the future of drand and the League of Entropy.</p> <h2 id="new-to-drand-here-is-a-primer"><a href="#new-to-drand-here-is-a-primer">#</a> New to drand? Here is a primer</h2> <p>Randomness is at the core of many business-critical operations and protocols that we rely on every day (e.g., the cryptography of secure communications, the execution of public lotteries, and so on). However, despite being such a huge requirement, there has never been a source of public randomness capable of providing truly unbiased randomness at scale. Drand was created to change that.</p> <p>Drand provides a mechanism for a universally accessible source of publicly-verifiable, unbiasable, and unpredictable randomness. Following an initial multi-party computation to establish a distributed key, drand nodes operated by independent parties periodically broadcast information that gets aggregated into a final random beacon whose validity can be easily verified by users.</p> <p>Drand started as a research project in the <a href="http://dedis.epfl.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DEDIS lab at EPFL</a>, and the first network was launched as an experiment in 2019. After nearly a year in the research stage, it was time to transform drand into a production-level public service. Over the past few months, we have rolled out a host of new changes and improvements to the service. We've also deployed drand's largest network, the <a href="http://leagueofentropy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">League of Entropy</a>.</p> <p>We believe that drand can be a foundational Internet core service for randomness, one that everyone online can access and use in the same way as other foundational protocols, like DNS or NTP.</p> <h2 id="drand-v1-1"><a href="#drand-v1-1">#</a> Drand v1.1</h2> <p>Drand launched v1.0 in July and updgraded to v1.1 in August, rolling out many new features and architecture improvements. Chief among them are:</p> <h3 id="_3-layered-architecture"><a href="#_3-layered-architecture">#</a> 3 layered architecture</h3> <p>The network architecture was split into three layers, offering enhanced protection to the drand nodes while increasing scalability, with a distribution network utilizing <a href="http://api.drand.sh/public/latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTTP CDNs</a>, <a href="https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-05-20-gossipsub-v1.1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">libp2p Gossipsub</a> relays, a <a href="http://drandeokfd5aaz3hr4hfk7mlr23vc63boxrpr44ertumtbousmdgbhad.onion/public/latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tor hidden service</a>, and a <a href="https://twitter.com/loebot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter bot</a>.</p> <h3 id="new-features"><a href="#new-features">#</a> New features</h3> <ul><li><strong>Round-to-timestamps guarantees</strong> with a catch-up functionality where, after a downtime, nodes quickly generate randomness to be up-to-date.</li> <li>The ability for a node to <strong>download a full copy of an existing chain prior to joining the group</strong>.</li> <li>A new curve (<a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-snark-curve/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BLS12-381</a>) for <strong>improved security</strong> and <strong>compatibility with major blockchains like Filecoin and Ethereum 2.0</strong>.</li> <li>Solid client implementation with provider <strong>failover</strong> and <strong>optimizations</strong> in Go and JS.</li> <li>A broadcast channel enabling more <strong>robust set-up ceremonies</strong>.</li></ul> <h3 id="deployment-monitoring"><a href="#deployment-monitoring">#</a> Deployment monitoring</h3> <p>A set of tools is now used to monitor the various drand nodes and alert operators to incidents. A <a href="https://drand.statuspage.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">status page</a> that shows both system status and any planned maintenance is now available for the network. We have also established a network observatory to measure network performance and reliability from the perspective of the end-user, with vantage points around the world.</p> <h3 id="drand-s-specification-security-model"><a href="#drand-s-specification-security-model">#</a> Drand’s specification &amp; security model</h3> <p>The drand protocol now has a <a href="https://drand.love/docs/specification/">full specification</a> and a documented <a href="https://drand.love/docs/security-model/">security model</a>.</p> <h3 id="security-audit"><a href="#security-audit">#</a> Security audit</h3> <p>The drand implementation underwent an end-to-end security audit carried out by <a href="https://sigmaprime.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SigmaPrime</a>. We are excited to share the report with you <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fCy1ynO78gJLCNbqBruzHx7bh72Tu-q2/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> in which you can learn about the findings and the approach used. Working with the SigmaPrime team was an absolute delight, they were thorough and very communicative throughout the entire audit, which enabled the drand team to quickly solve the issues as they were found.</p> <h3 id="code-quality-refactor-testing"><a href="#code-quality-refactor-testing">#</a> Code quality, refactor &amp; testing</h3> <p>Improved development practices, including a testnet for pre-deployment evaluation of new versions and greatly increased code coverage, as well as linting and regression testing.</p> <p>General improvements to the codebase, with over 400 merged pull requests in the last couple months.</p> <p>With these changes, drand got the upgrades it needed to become  a reliable production environment.</p> <h2 id="new-website-logo"><a href="#new-website-logo">#</a> New website &amp; logo</h2> <p>We built this website to be the drand community's primary repository for the growing body of documentation about drand. We also want this to be the new home for the drand community of developers, operators, and end-users. We'll use it to host our blog and share important updates and news about the project.</p> <p>In addition to a new site, we also created a logo for the drand project, which you can see at the top of this post or <a href="https://drand.love/drand-logo-kit.zip">download the logo kit</a>.</p> <h2 id="the-league-of-entropy-main-network-loe-mainnet-becomes-a-production-service"><a href="#the-league-of-entropy-main-network-loe-mainnet-becomes-a-production-service">#</a> The League of Entropy main network (LoE Mainnet) becomes a production service</h2> <p>The true power of drand comes not from its implementation but from a strong, decentralized network of independent nodes contributing to the randomness generation. In addition to significant protocol upgrades, we also strengthened the League of Entropy.</p> <p>In 2019, Cloudflare, EPFL, the University of Chile, Kudelski Security, and Protocol Labs came together to start the League of Entropy and run the drand network. Since then, the group has expanded to include partners in six countries, spanning the spectrum from universities to infrastructure companies.</p> <h3 id="new-league-of-entropy-partners"><a href="#new-league-of-entropy-partners">#</a> New League of Entropy partners</h3> <p>With the LoE Main Network upgrade, a set of new partners joined the league to increase its robustness and quality of service. The current set of members include:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.c4dt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">C4DT</a></li> <li><a href="https://chainsafe.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChainSafe</a></li> <li><a href="https://celo.org/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cLabs</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare</a></li> <li><a href="https://emeraldonion.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emerald Onion</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/dedis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EPFL</a></li> <li><a href="https://ethereum.foundation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethereum Foundation</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.initc3.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IC3</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.kudelskisecurity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kudelski Security</a></li> <li><a href="https://protocol.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Protocol Labs</a></li> <li><a href="https://ptisp.pt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PTisp</a></li> <li><a href="https://tierion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tierion</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UCL</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.uchile.cl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Chile</a></li></ul> <p>More partners have signed up to join soon, and we'll keep growing the network over the years to come.</p> <h3 id="league-of-entropy-s-governance"><a href="#league-of-entropy-s-governance">#</a> League of Entropy's governance</h3> <p>Our changes start with the drand community. Drand's strength and resilience are ensured by the number and diversity of its nodes. But a key requirement for the overall security of the network is that no single entity retains complete and centralized control over the drand network. This calls for an explicit and decentralized governance model for the drand community of operators. So one of the first changes was to draft a new model of collaborative governance for the League of Entropy – the consortium supporting and sustaining the drand network.</p> <p>With this new governance model, we've established the rules and requirements that the League of Entropy needs in order to maintain a high level of network security, ensure that the League operates effectively, and establish the right conditions for ongoing improvement to the production quality of drand. We've also laid down the procedures for adding new members to the League of Entropy in an equitable, fair, and decentralized way. All told, we think these changes set up the drand project for continued success as we find new users and implement new features.</p> <h2 id="filecoin-becomes-drand-s-first-high-profile-production-user"><a href="#filecoin-becomes-drand-s-first-high-profile-production-user">#</a> Filecoin becomes drand's first high-profile production user</h2> <p>In this first post to our new website, we've talked about the changes and upgrades we're making to realize the future of drand as a production-ready service. We're thrilled to report that the Filecoin project at Protocol Labs has <a href="https://filecoin.io/blog/filecoin-testnet-phase-2-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> they are adopting drand as the source of unbiased randomness for leader election on the Filecoin blockchain. Filecoin has thus become the first known production user of drand!</p> <p>This is a huge announcement that couldn't come at a better time. One of the most promising production use cases of drand is in the blockchain space. Filecoin is already a cutting-edge blockchain-based technology, and its incorporation of drand as its preferred randomness source will power some incredible innovation, testing, and development for the drand network. We're excited for what the future holds for both Filecoin and drand.</p> <p>That's all for now, but there will be more to come in the weeks and months ahead. We hope you'll join us again at drand's new online home to hear about the next round of news and updates to the project.</p> <h2 id="one-last-announcement-join-us-on-august-13-for-the-randomness-summit"><a href="#one-last-announcement-join-us-on-august-13-for-the-randomness-summit">#</a> One last announcement: Join us on August 13 for The Randomness Summit</h2> <p>To help celebrate this exciting launch, the drand team, ETHGlobal, Protocol Labs Research, and ResNetLab are pleased to announce a <a href="https://randomness2020.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one-day virtual summit</a> on state of the art and future directions for randomness beacons.</p> <p><a href="https://airtable.com/shrTsIV4Btd8Wugqb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Register now</a> to learn from top cryptographers and randomness beacon experts, League of Entropy partners, and drand developers. The Ethereum and Filecoin project leads will also be talking about the critical role of randomness in the operation of their networks.</p> <p>That’s all for now, but there will be more to come in the weeks and months ahead. We hope you’ll join us at drand’s new online home to stay informed of future news and updates to the project.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

                                
<blockquote><p><em><strong><a href="https://www.getglobalhome.com/?utm_source=cornerstone&amp;utm_medium=methodology&amp;utm_campaign=launch">GlobalHome</a></strong> is a US-based digital platform for discovering and buying NRI properties in India. We leverage data science and insights to pre-verify properties, and provide a digital platform for financing, booking online and end-to-end purchasing.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Buying a property thousands of miles away is incredibly hard. Most buyers need to spend weeks of in-person visits to finalize a property and ton of paperwork to get the finance and purchasing done. <br>In fact, the entire process is so tiring and stressful that many NRIs (Non Resident Indians) just avoid buying a property in India or procrastinate for years effectively missing out on investment opportunities in one of the hottest real-estate markets in the world. </p>



<h3><strong>What makes buying property in India so hard?</strong></h3>



<h5><strong>Why hasn’t anyone solved this for NRI purchasing?</strong></h5>



<p>There are a few different aspects which add to the complexity of searching and buying a property thousands of miles away for NRIs.</p>



<div><p><em><strong>Note: If you want to jump to the data science part – <a href="https://getglobalhome.com/using-data-driven-property-insights-for-purchasing-nri-properties-in-india#methodology">Click here to Jump to Methodology</a><br></strong></em><br><strong>1. Distance &amp; Time: </strong>Typically, NRIs spend most of their time out of India and visit every 1-2 years and spend maybe 3 weeks. Just a few weeks is never enough time to scout for properties given that most Indians (like myself) would end up using couple of weeks just to settle in and say hello to friends and relatives. You can of course shortlist properties beforehand, <br>however under construction properties is usually the preferred choice and it takes quite a bit of imagination to envision what the property might end up looking like. For folks looking to buy resale properties, there’s a huge challenge with communication and seller reliability. In addition, the amount of co-ordination and intracity traveling needed makes it unworthy to spend time on properties which may not be a good fit or are going to have issues.</p><p><strong>2. Paperwork &amp; In-person visits</strong>: If you are buying a property in India, everything needs hardcopy paperwork, especially if you are an NRI. Your home loan agent will make you visit the bank branch to attest documents, your builder or seller will make you sign papers, you need power of attorney on a physical stamp paper, you need to fill paper forms for applying for a loan – yes the one with square boxes and 30 different fields. There are countless other documents. Unless you can time heist, all of this process is nearly impossible to pull off by yourself without significant help from your family or friends.</p><p><strong>3. Amount of Choice, Lack of builder reliability &amp; Litigations:</strong> In India, it wont be unfair to say that every street has an under construction property, and hundreds of builders constructing those. All of these properties get listed on online portals who proudly tout that they have thousands of properties listed. While more is usually better, in this case it just adds to confusion, every property listing looks more of the same and you cant get your decision done until you or someone actually visit the property.<br>Builder reliability is a huge factor in determining whether you will get your “possession” on the promised date or years later, and whether the final construction will look and feel anything like those pretty pictures. Some builders are established, litigation-free and financially sound, while others are not, and this hugely matter. It is merely impossible for someone to fully investigate and research the builder and property in their short buying timeline, its very easy to fall for the polished brochures and onsite air conditioned showing offices. Government of India has introduced RERA – aka The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 – to protect home buyers, however just RERA registered property doesn’t mean anything at all and requires much deeper research to actually make use of that information to infer whether the builder is legit and if the promised property is actually on track for completion.</p><p><strong>4. Return on Investment</strong>: Buying a property is a huge financial decision, it is a life event for most of us, regardless of whether its an investment property or a place where you may end up living some day.  In addition to all the above factors, there is generally an uncertainly about the actual want for buying a property abroad and what investment gains you can make from it. For example, one may contemplate the following: Am I actually going to live there? If I buy a property who will manage it? How much will the property price go up by? Is it better to just invest my money in stocks? What if someone encroaches on my property? Who is going to find tenants every year? What if USD exchange rate goes up?<br>All these questions are valid questions, and it is non trivial to answer these.</p></div>



<h2 id="methodology"><strong>How is GlobalHome solving this using data?</strong></h2>



<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.getglobalhome.com/?utm_source=cornerstone&amp;utm_medium=methodology&amp;utm_campaign=launch">GlobalHome</a> was built with a very clear mission:  <em>Bring Transparency and Simplicity to cross-border real estate transaction</em>s</p></blockquote>



<h4>Pre-vetted properties with Property Scores</h4>



<p>Too much choice is never a good thing. Don’t believe me? Think of all those options you have on Netflix, and how you end up spending hours browsing just to end up watching a crappy movie. You’d much rather search for the IMDB Rating for the movie and gain insight into whether you’d like the movie. You may not agree with all the ratings, but it will generally help you boil it down to a few choices – my favorite is the Imdb top 250 list, I’ll watch all those movies in a heart beat.</p>



<div><p><strong>Now let’s apply the IMDB analogy to Properties.<em> </em><br></strong><em>GlobalHome has pioneered a proprietary methodology to scientifically score thousands of under construction properties and builders so that we can rank and shortlist the ones which have the best ROI and reliability.</em></p><p>Each week, we score and add new featured pre-vetted properties.</p></div>



<p>We look at and make available unprecedented insights about the property, builder, locality, return on investment to ease your decision making. Most property portals will merely show you the list of amenities and past projects for the builder – this tells you nothing, sure it helps you shortlist from 5000 to maybe 100, but still it doesn’t get you down to those 1-2 properties you really would buy.</p>

<h4><strong>Below are some of the factors which go into the scoring:</strong></h4>



<ul><li><strong>Project construction detailed status </strong>– Is the excavation done? Is the tiling done? What percentage of construction is done? How long has the work been pending? Are they meeting their promised timelines?<br></li><li><strong>Builder or Developer Profile</strong> – Is this builder and project RERA registered? What are their past projects? Have they completed previous projects on time? Is the builder a registered company? Is the builder legit and can we find legal registrations for those?<br></li><li><strong>Financial Standing of Builder</strong> – What is the CRISIL or SMERA rating for the builder? How much debt does the builder has? Does the builder have any supplier issues? Is the builder in the news for financial issues?<br></li><li><strong>Litigations</strong> – Does the project or builder have any outstanding litigations? Is the land free of litigations? Are there any criminal proceeding against the directors or owners of the construction company?<br></li><li><strong>Locality Insights</strong> – Does the locality have water connectivity? Are the roads approved? Are there local shops nearby? How is the connectivity to freeways? Is the locality near any future planned metro or rail routes? Is it near major amenities such as malls, theatres?<br></li><li><strong>Pricing &amp; Rent Trends</strong>: What is the actual or expected year over year price growth for the area? Is it near IT hubs or any major colleges? How easy is it to rent out the apartment?  How easy is it to sell similar properties in the area?</li></ul>



<p>You must be thinking – Where are you getting all this data from? Are you actually doing data science? Is this information reliable?<br>All of these are great questions – and the answer is that there is indeed a lot of data available on RERA sites for each state, public land records, public litigation and court records, user reviews, pricing trends and rental data.<br>I want to show a few examples of what that data looks like so that you can get a sense of how this information can be leveraged</p>



<h4>Let’s look at a few examples of property insights data</h4>



<p>Is the work actually completed? How much units are available to buy? What are the pricing trends in localities?</p>

<p>These are just a few examples of how we are leveraging data to bring transparency and simplicity into property buying process.<br>Hopefully this gives you some insight into our scoring methodology!</p>

<p>A majority of programmers work in the massive field of web development, because there are so many jobs, resources and problems to solve! This is especially true for self-taught developers like myself or bootcamp grads. With that, there are also many people looking to try something other than web-development, whether it be out of boredom, curiousity or passion for another area of computer science.</p>
<p>I'm particularly a fan of this, as while web-development got me hooked into programming (and is partially what I do now), exploring other types of work made me a much <em>much</em> better engineer. I think that two months of working on backend development at Shopify helped me grow less than a three-month side project for which I built a very simple raytracer. My experience has also been that it's very hard to break out of web development since there's activation energy, and it's harder to be as impactful, so I'm hoping this will help.</p>
<h2 id="projects">Projects<a href="#projects" aria-label="Anchor link for: projects"> <i></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Projects listed in vague order of increasing difficulty / time committment. I have not done all these of course, but I at least know someone who did / have some special respect for the creator.</p>
<h3 id="ray-tracing-in-one-weekend">Ray Tracing In One Weekend<a href="#ray-tracing-in-one-weekend" aria-label="Anchor link for: ray-tracing-in-one-weekend"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html">Link to Book</a></p>
<p>This is one of the single most impactful projects I've done! With a raytracer you can model objects in 3D space and generate images for what they'd look like by applying your own colours, angles and lightning. It uses a little bit of math and teaches introductory graphics. The most fun part about raytracing is the development cycle, since you can instantly test software (limited by how fast your computer is) and see the result, without having to worry about hidden bugs.</p>
<p>I estimate for it to take less than a week if you work on it full time and a month if doing it in free time. There is also "Ray Tracing the Next Week" and "Ray Tracing the Rest of Your Life" if you want more!</p>
<h3 id="llvm-tutorial">LLVM Tutorial<a href="#llvm-tutorial" aria-label="Anchor link for: llvm-tutorial"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><a href="https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/">Link to Tutorial</a></p>
<p>The LLVM tutorial helps you to build an entire programming language with LLVM which is insanely fun and relevant to software we use everyday. It also includes teachings about JITs! I recommend <em>not</em> following the OCaml tutorials as the tutorials are old and you'll have trouble installing dependencies (like I did). I really like compilers as an area of focus because unlike graphics or GPU programming, your work is relevant to anyone who is a programmer.</p>
<p>I estimate this to take a week full time and 2+ weeks doing it in free time and no more than two months.</p>
<h3 id="crafting-interpreters">Crafting Interpreters<a href="#crafting-interpreters" aria-label="Anchor link for: crafting-interpreters"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html">Link to Book</a></p>
<p>I put this one after the LLVM tutorial just because it is longer, but Crafting Interpreters is an <em>excellent</em> resource. It actually teaches you how to build two interpreters, one with Java and another with C and also covers VMs and garbage collection. I think the type of interpreters you'll build through Crafting Interpreters will help you understand CRuby and CPython source code more than the LLVM Tutorial will help you understand Rust source code.</p>
<p>I recommend starting on the second interpreter iff you have a solid impression of how interpreters tend to work and you're familiar with programming in C as well as data structures. I estimate the entirety of Crafting Interpreters to take 3 - 6 weeks full time or a few months part time (more variable since it's longer and there are more opportunities to challenge yourself).</p>

</h3>
<p><a href="https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/">Link to Resource</a></p>
<p>This collection of resources / docs is created by Open AI and generally impressed me in quality of documentation (I generally have very little faith in big companies being able to document things well). It's not a tutorial, but is good at giving the full picture (how to get into the career, lingo, example implementations, etc). It also provides two exercises that are fairly long as well as fun information such as PyTorch vs Tensorflow comparisons.</p>
<p>I think of all the resources I listed, this one gets you the closest to a career change (partially just the nature of the ML field). I only list one Machine Learning related resource because other good intro-to-ML guides have good page rank (though I think Spinning Up in Deep RL has underrated pagerank). </p>
<p>Some resources for people who already have some background in AI (read the Wikipedia definitions and did Tensorflow/Pytorch tutorials): </p>
<ul>

</h3>
<p><a href="https://raft.github.io/">Link to Raft Info Page</a></p>
<p>Raft is a consensus algorithm. I'm not going to describe further, but it's an algorithm to solve problems with distributed systems -- something you may be familiar with! Unlike many of the projects I've listed, Raft will require a lot of reading / research to build background knowledge. Implementing Raft requires knowledge about operating systems, systems programming in general, networks and concurrency. I feel that it'll also test more software engineering skills since the process will include lots of logging, tests and error handling.</p>
<p>I'm not going to give time estimates about Raft since I've read a lot but haven't implemented it. More importantly, it depends on your background. If I had to say, it would be at least a week full time.</p>

<p>This one seems fun but I've only briefly attempted it.</p>

<p>Though challenging and a long project, I recommend OS dev because it's a surprisingly common project (you can probably find more resources for this than say, Raft). The difficult parts with this project is that it's more open-ended, longer even to get to a minimal project and the development cycle is a bit more painful.</p>
<p>Estimate 4+ weeks full time for a minimal-ish OS.</p>

<p><strong>Computer Vision</strong>. I didn't list any tutorials for this since none are particularly special, but <a href="https://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a> is powerful and there are a whole bunch of projects that can come out of it! The documentation is not as polished as most web-dev documentation which I think makes it extra fun.</p>
<p><strong>Blockchain</strong>. I'm generally pretty clueless about blockchain, so not listing any resources but I'm leaving it here in case anyone has ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Regex</strong>. This is not a career, nor is it distinct from webdev, but it certainly exercises your brain in a different way and is a unique skill! Being able to write regexes off the top of my head has been a great help to my software engineering. I learned/practiced through <a href="https://carolchen.me/blog/past-webdev/regexcrossword.com/">Regex Crosswords</a>.</p>

</h3>
<p>Hesistant about including this since it's sometimes just "leetcoding" but I think competitive programming was formative to my programming skills. <a href="https://carolchen.me/blog/past-webdev/codeforces.com/">Codeforces</a> has weekly contests (also see TopCoder, DMOJ). Some of the problems are more traditional data science and algorithms, but sites like Codeforces over Leetcode will have some more adhoc and math focused puzzles. Speaking of math, <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> is also a great source of problems. I also like throwing away writing good code sometimes and just writing code for me!</p>

</h3>
<p>Kaggle is a platform where users receive datasets and try to predict / compute some values in a contest format. They also have some open datasets with various tutorials on how to work with them, such as the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic">Titanic Dataset</a>.</p>

</h3>
<p>As a web developer, a lot of my learning was throug Stack Overflow, videos and Medium articles. I think my learning of compilers was high-friction because of my unwillingness to read papers (which I'm still working on). This is not applicable to <em>everything</em>, for example machine learning has a lot of strong Stack Overflow resources through uses of libraries (though you'll definitely need to read papers for ML), and for learning to do reverse engineering, individual blog posts with write-ups are probably your best resource. In general, you may have to relearn how you filter / search through content.</p>

</h3>
<p>Something missing from this article is "after I learn these skills, how do I get a job?", and the reason it's missing is because I'd be talking out of my ass if I tried to answer that. However, I do some know reliable ways through which that has been done and Open Source is definitely one of them!</p>
<p>Spend some time looking into different projects and start working up towards contributions. I recommend larger projects for exposure and also because they'll have better support systems for new contributors. I know numerous people who somewhat bypassed education through side projects and gained skills entirely through working on OSS!</p>

      <p><a href="https://crdt.tech/">CRDTs</a> are often praised as the "holy grail" for building collaborative applications because they don't require a central authority to resolve sync conflicts. They open up new possibilities to scale the backend infrastructure and are also well-suited as a data-model for distributed apps that don't require a server at all.</p><p>However, several text editor developers report not to use them because they impose a too significant overhead.</p><p>Just recently, Marijn Haverbeke wrote about his considerations against using CRDTs as a data model for <a href="https://codemirror.net/6/">CodeMirror 6</a>:</p><blockquote>[..] the cost of such a representation is significant, and in the end, I judged the requirement for converging positions to be too obscure to justify that level of extra complexity and memory use. <a href="https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/collaborative-editing-cm.html">(source)</a></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor">Xi Editor</a> used a CRDT as its data model to allow different processes (syntax highlighter, type checker, ..) to concurrently access the editor state without blocking the process. They reverted to a synchronous model because ..</p><blockquote>[..] CRDT is not pulling its (considerable) weight. <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor/issues/1187#issuecomment-491473599">(source)</a></blockquote><p>Apparently, everyone recognizes that CRDTs have a lot of potential, but concluded that the memory overhead of using them must be too expensive for real-world applications.</p><p>They bring up a fair point. Most CRDTs assign a unique ID to <em>every character</em> that was ever created in the document. In order to ensure that documents can always converge, the CRDT model preserves this metadata even when characters are deleted.</p><p>This seems to be particularly expensive in dynamic languages like JavaScript. Other languages allow you to efficiently represent all those characters and IDs in-memory using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)">structs</a> (e.g. C or Rust). In JavaScript, everything is represented as an <code>Object</code> - basically a key-value map that needs to keep track of all its keys and values. CRDTs assign multiple properties to every single character in the document to ensure conflict resolution. The memory overhead of merely representing a document as a CRDT could be immense.</p><p>Every user-interaction creates more metadata that the CRDT needs to retain in order to ensure conflict resolution. It is not uncommon that CRDTs create millions of objects to store all this metadata. The JavaScript engine manages these objects on the heap, checks if they are referenced, and, if possible, garbage collects them. Another major problem is that with an increasing number of object creations, the cost of creating additional objects increases exponentially. This is shown in the following graphic:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.kevinjahns.de/content/images/2020/07/scatter-plot.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.kevinjahns.de/content/images/2020/07/scatter-plot.png 600w"><figcaption>Average time to create one object increases with the number of objects on the heap <a href="https://jsperf.com/cost-of-objects">(Data Source)</a></figcaption></figure><p>So the question arises if CRDTs are actually suitable for shared editing on the web, or if they impose a too significant cost to be viable in practice.</p><p>In case you don't know me, I'm the author of a CRDT implementation named <a href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs">Yjs</a>, that is specifically designed for building shared editing applications on the web.</p><p>In this article, I will introduce you to a simple optimization for CRDTs and examine the exact performance trade-off of using Yjs for shared editing. I hope to convince you that the overhead is actually very small even for large documents with long edit histories.</p><h2 id="yjs">Yjs</h2><p>Yjs is a framework for building collaborative applications using CRDTs as the data model. It has a growing ecosystem of extensions that enable shared editing using different editors (<a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/yjs-prosemirror"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/prosemirror">ProseMirror</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@remirror/extension-yjs"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/remirror"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/remirror">Remirror</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/yjs-quilljs"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/quill">Quill</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/codemirror">CodeMirror</a>, ..), different networking technologies (<a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-websocket">WebSocket</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-webrtc">WebRTC</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-hyper">Hyper</a>, ..), and different persistence layers (<a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/database-provider/y-indexeddb">IndexedDB</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/database-provider/y-leveldb">LevelDB</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/database-provider/y-redis">Redis</a>, ..). Most shared editing solutions are tied to a specific editor and to a specific backend. With Yjs, you can make any of the supported editors collaborative and exchange document updates through your custom communication channel, over a peer-to-peer WebRTC network, or over a scalable server infrastructure. My vision for this project is that you can simply compose your collaborative application using the technologies that make sense for your project. </p><figure><a href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs"><div><p>yjs/yjs</p><p>Peer-to-peer shared types.

Yjs is a battle-proven technology that is used by several companies to enable collaboration. I'm only mentioning my sponsors here:</p><ul><li><a href="https://nimbusweb.me/note.php">Nimbus Note</a> scales collaborative note editing horizontally using Yjs.</li><li><a href="https://room.sh/">Room.sh</a> is a meeting software that allows collaborative editing &amp; drawing over WebRTC.</li></ul><p>I maintain a reproducible set of benchmarks that compares different CRDT implementations. Yjs is by far the fastest web-based CRDT implementation with the most efficient encoding. In this article I will often refer to specific benchmarks contained in the <code>crdt-benchmarks</code> repository as, for example, "<a href="https://github.com/dmonad/crdt-benchmarks/#b1-no-conflicts">[B1.11]</a>".</p><figure><a href="https://github.com/dmonad/crdt-benchmarks"><div><p>dmonad/crdt-benchmarks</p><p>A collection of CRDT benchmarks.

If not, and you want to dive into this rabbit hole, I recommend this fun interactive series:</p><figure><a href="https://lars.hupel.info/topics/crdt/01-intro/"><div><p>CRDTs: Part 1</p><p><img src="https://lars.hupel.info/img/profile.jpg"><span>Lars Hupel</span><span>Lars Hupel</span></p></div><p><img src="https://lars.hupel.info/img/topics/crdt/world.jpg"></p></a><figcaption>A fun interactive series about CRDTs</figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://crdt.tech/resources"><div><p>CRDT Resources • Conflict-free Replicated Data Types</p><p>Resources and community around CRDT technology — papers, blog posts, code and more.</p><p><img src="https://crdt.tech/assets/favicons/favicon-192x192.png"><span>Conflict-free Replicated Data Types</span></p></div><p><img src="https://crdt.tech/assets/img/crdt-favicon.png"></p></a><figcaption>Good entry point to find more CRDT related resources</figcaption></figure><p>The concept paper that describes Yjs' conflict resolution algorithm YATA is available on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310212186_Near_Real-Time_Peer-to-Peer_Shared_Editing_on_Extensible_Data_Types">Researchgate</a>. The concepts discussed here are pretty generic and could be extended to almost any CRDT.</p><p>In order to determine the performance cost, we are are going to examine how Yjs maintains data. Please bear with me while I describe how the CRDT model is represented using JavaScript objects. This will be relevant later.</p><p>Similarly to other CRDTs, the YATA CRDT assigns a unique ID to every character. These characters are then maintained in a doubly linked list.</p><p>The unique IDs are<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamp"> Lamport Timestamps</a>. They consist of a unique user identifier and a logical clock that increases with each character insertion.</p><p>When a user types the content "ABC" from left to right, it will perform the following operations: <code>insert(0, "A") • insert(1, "B") • insert(2, "C")</code>. The linked list of the YATA CRDT, which models the textual content, will look like this:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.kevinjahns.de/content/images/2020/07/crdt-datamodel.svg" alt=""><figcaption>CRDT model of inserting content "ABC" (assuming the user has the unique client identifier "1")</figcaption></figure><p>Notice how every character can be uniquely identified by the combination of the unique client-id and an ever-increasing <code>clock</code> counter.</p><p>Yjs represents the items of the linked list as <code>Item</code> objects that contain some content (in this case a String), a unique ID, the links to the adjacent <code>Item</code> objects, and additional metadata that is relevant for the CRDT algorithm.</p><p>All CRDTs assign some kind of unique ID and additional metadata to every character, which is very memory-consuming for large documents. We can't get rid of metadata as it is necessary for conflict resolution. Yjs also uniquely identifies each character and assigns metadata, but represents this information efficiently. Larger document insertions are represented as a single <code>Item</code> object using the character-offset to uniquely identify each character individually. The below <code>Item</code> uniquely identifies character <code>"A"</code> as <code>{ client: 1, clock: 0 }</code>, character <code>"B"</code> as <code>{ client: 1, clock: 1 }</code>, and so on..</p><figure><pre><code>Item {
    id: { client: 1, clock: 0 },
    content: 'ABC',
    ...
}</code></pre><figcaption>Yjs's internal representation of items in the linked list</figcaption></figure><p>If a user copy/pastes a lot of content into the document, the inserted content is represented by a single <code>Item</code>. Furthermore, single-character insertions that are written from left to right can be merged into a single <code>Item</code>. It is just important that we are able to split and merge items without losing any metadata.</p><p>This type of compound representation of the CRDT model and its split-functionality have first been described in <a href="https://kundoc.com/pdf-a-string-wise-crdt-algorithm-for-smart-and-large-scale-collaborative-editing-sys.html">"A string-wise CRDT algorithm for smart and large-scale collaborative systems"</a>. Yjs adapts this approach for YATA and also includes functionality to merge <code>Item</code> objects.</p><h2 id="the-cost-of-operations">The Cost of Operations</h2><p>With this simple optimization in mind, let's have a look at how the number of modifications on a document relates to the amount of metadata that needs to be retained. We will measure metadata by the amount of <code>Item</code> objects created and later examine what the cost of a single <code>Item</code> is.</p><p>Every user interaction with a text editor can be expressed as either an <strong>insert</strong> or a <strong>delete</strong> operation.</p><ul><li><code>insert(index: number, content: string)</code><strong> </strong>Insertions of any size create a single <code>Item</code> that is integrated into the document. In some cases the integration requires to split an existing <code>Item</code>. So we have a maximum of two <code>Item</code> creations per insertion.</li><li><code>delete(index: number, length: number)</code> Deleting an <code>Item</code> only marks it as deleted. I.e <code>item.deleted = true</code>. Therefore, <code>Item</code> deletions are free and will reduce the amount of memory used because the <code>Item.content</code> can be removed. The <code>Item</code> doesn't need to retain the content for doing conflict resolution. But deleting a range of content might require to split two existing items. Therefore, the cost of deletions is a maximum of two <code>Item</code> creations also.</li></ul><p>By using the compound representation of CRDTs, the amount of metadata only relates to the amount of operations produced by a user. Not to the amount of characters inserted. This makes a huge difference in practice. Most larger documents are created by copy-pasting existing content or by moving paragraphs to other positions. Any kind of operation, even copy-paste and undo/redo, only create at most two <code>Item</code> objects.</p><p>Yjs also supports rich-text and structured documents. The above statement, that the amount of metadata only relates to the amount of operations, still holds true for these kinds of documents. But measuring operation-cost for more complex operations is out of scope of this article. An interesting observation in practice is that the document size of long-running …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div>

We’ll call this flight AA2305, and we’ll use an Airbus A321 to operate it.</blockquote><p>Airlines distribute their schedules through industry data providers, who then make them available to other airlines, travel sellers and tech providers. <a href="https://www.oag.com/">OAG</a> and <a href="https://www.cirium.com/">Cirium</a> are the leaders in this space.</p><p>This isn’t just static data which changes infrequently - airlines generally update their schedules at least once a day, and there are about 800 scheduled airlines for the data providers to work with.</p><h2 id="fares">Fares</h2><p>A fare describes a price at which an airline is willing to sell seats on a particular flight, and the rules (sometimes known as "conditions") that go with that price.</p><p>A fare from American Airlines might look something like this:</p><blockquote>We’re willing to sell seats on our flights AA2305 and AA2307 for $200, as long as there is space in booking class N. However, you must book your seat as part of a return, you’ll have to stay in San Francisco for a Saturday night, and we won’t give you any refund if you want to cancel.</blockquote><p>A fare has a name, called a “fare basis code”. A fare basis code is a short set of letters and numbers - for example <code>NVAKZNM3</code>.</p><p>Fares are made up of rules which describe who is eligible for them, what flights they can be used for, and restrictions on how they can be sold or used. Examples of fare rules could include:</p><ul><li>You must fly via Los Angeles (<code>LAX</code>)</li><li>You can change flights, but only if you pay a $50 penalty</li><li>You can't have a "stopover" overnight on your journey</li></ul><p>The full fare rules for a fare can easily be thousands of words long - you can see the real-life fare rules for the American Airlines fare <code>NVAKZNM3</code> <a href="https://gist.github.com/timrogers/ef7a0070d29ea1ffa5d925184e7a4887">here</a>.</p><p>Fortunately, the most important fare rules can be described in a structured way which a computer can understand, allowing a search engine to work out what fares match your search without a human reading through manually.</p><p>Airlines file their fares in an industry directory run by <a href="https://www.atpco.net/">ATPCO</a>, which other airlines, travel sellers and tech providers can subscribe to. Each airline can change their pricing by refiling fares many times a day. All in all, ATPCO processes more than 10 million fare updates per day.</p><p>Airlines offer many fares for the same flight at the same time, since a traveller won’t always want the cheapest, most restrictive option. For example, you might want a checked bag, or the ability to change your flights free of charge.</p><h2 id="availability">Availability</h2><p>Airlines don’t just say “this flight has seats available” or “this flight doesn’t have seats available”.</p><p>Airlines want to make as much money as they can from their metal boxes flying through the sky, so they want to sell some seats cheaply, but hold some seats back for travellers who are willing to pay more.</p><p>A flight is broken into different “booking classes”, sometimes known as “reservation booking designators” (RBDs). These are letters of the alphabet, so a flight can be split into 26 different buckets: <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, etc..</p><p>A fare points to a specific booking class. The example fare we looked at above, <code>NVAKZNM3</code>, is for the booking class <code>N</code>. Usually, the first character of the fare basis code is the booking class.</p><p>Each booking class on a flight can have different availability. For example, imagine that American Airlines uses the booking classes <code>N</code>, <code>V</code> and <code>Y</code> for economy.</p><p>They might use <code>N</code> for the most restrictive economy fares, <code>Y</code> for the most flexible ones and <code>V</code> for ones in the middle. Being able to control availability for each booking class means that “cheap economy” can be sold out, but there can still be “expensive economy” seats left.</p><p>Airlines don’t “publish” their availability. To know the latest, up-to-the-minute availability, you have to go to the airline’s passenger service system (PSS). Popular passenger service systems include <a href="https://amadeus.com/en/industries/airlines/altea-suite">Amadeus Altéa</a>, <a href="https://www.sabreairlinesolutions.com/home/software_solutions/customer_sales_service/">Sabre Sonic</a> and <a href="https://www.navitaire.com/new-skies-reservation-system">Navitaire New Skies</a>.</p><h2 id="putting-this-all-together">Putting this all together</h2><p>To find results for a simple search, a flight search engine has to combine together schedules, fares and availability.</p><p>There is only a small number of flight searches engines on the market. Most travel sellers use the search built into the global distribution system (GDS) they use (for example <a href="https://amadeus.com/">Amadeus</a>, <a href="https://www.sabre.com/">Sabre</a> or <a href="https://www.travelport.com/">Travelport</a>). But there are competitors: airlines and larger sellers often use search solutions from providers like <a href="https://www.itasoftware.com/">ITA Software by Google</a> and <a href="https://pros.com/">PROS</a>.</p><p>Flight search is very complex, and it requires a lot of computer power.</p><p>The first step is to identify possible routings. For our trip from New York to San Francisco, there are tens of thousands of reasonable options if we take into account connecting flights and the full range of available airlines.</p><p>At the simple end, we could take a direct flight, <code>AA2305</code>. But we could also fly with Alaska Airlines on <code>AS17</code>, <code>AS398</code> and <code>AS3311</code>, connecting in Seattle (<code>SEA</code>) and Los Angeles (<code>LAX</code>).</p><p>For each of those routings, the search engine needs to work out what fares are applicable, checking all of the rules.</p><p>There can be hundreds or thousands of potentially relevant fares to check per airline, especially given that there can be many different ways to apply fares to a set of flights.</p><p>If we take our example above with Alaska Airlines, you’d fly from <code>JFK-SEA</code>, then <code>SEA-LAX</code> and finally <code>LAX-SFO</code>. In terms of fares, this could be structured as:</p><ul><li>A one-way from <code>JFK-SFO</code></li><li>A one-way from <code>JFK-SEA</code>, and then a one-way from <code>SEA-SFO</code></li><li>Three one-ways: <code>JFK-SEA</code>, <code>SEA-LAX</code> <code>LAX-SFO</code></li><li>…</li></ul><p>If we’re booking a round trip, this gets even more complex.</p><p>Once you’ve combined the schedules and fares, you’ll have a series of “priced itineraries” - for example:</p><blockquote>You can fly on AA2305 direct from JFK to SFO for $200, using fare NVAKZNM3, as long as booking class N is available</blockquote><p>The final step is to bring availability into the picture. You’ll probably find that a lot of your priced itineraries are not available because one or more of the booking classes you need are full.</p><p>The end result is a series of search results — or what we call "offers" in the Duffel API.</p><h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2><p>When you search for flights, a flight search engine has to combine schedules, fares and availability to generate your search results.</p><p>To do this, it has to consider hundreds of millions of options (at least!), turning them into a relatively small number of valid, relevant combinations. And all of that in just a couple of seconds!</p></section></div>]]>

		<h3>7 August 2020</h3>

<p>I've been using MyFitnessPal and it has the facility to load nutrition information by scanning the barcode on the product. I can guess how the retrieval works once the barcode number is obtained (a big database somewhere) but it struck me that I had no idea how the reading of the barcode <em>itself</em> worked and.. well, I'm curious and enjoy the opportunity to learn something new to me by writing the code to do it. I do enjoy being able to look up (almost) anything on the internet to find out how it works!</p>

<p><em>(For anyone who wants to either play along but not copy-paste the code themselves or for anyone who wants to jump to the end result, I've put the code - along with the example image I've used in this post - up on a <a href="https://github.com/ProductiveRage/BarcodeReader">GitHub repo</a>)</em></p>

<h3>The plan of attack</h3>

<p>There are two steps required here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read image and try to identify areas that look like barcodes</li>
<li>Try to extract numbers from the looks-like-a-barcode regions</li>
</ol>

<p>As with anything, these steps may be broken down into smaller tasks. The first step can be done like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Barcodes are black and white regions that have content that has steep "gradients" in image intensity horizontally (where there is a change from a black bar to a white space) and little change in intensity vertically (as each bar is a vertical line), so first we greyscale the image and then generate horizontal and vertical intensity gradients values for each point in the image and combine the values by subtracting vertical gradient from horizontal gradient</li>
<li>These values are normalised so that they are all on the scale zero to one - this data could be portrayed as another greyscale image where the brightest parts are most likely to be within barcodes</li>
<li>These values are then "spread out" or "blurred" and then a threshold value is applied where every value about it is changed into a 1 and every value below it a 0</li>
<li>This "mask" (where every value is a 0 or 1) should have identified many of the pixels within the barcodes and we want to group these pixels into distinct objects</li>
<li>There is a chance, though, that there could be gaps between bars that mean that a single barcode is spread across multiple masked-out objects and we need to try to piece them back together into one area (since the bars are tall and narrow, this may be done by considering a square area over every object and then combining objects whose squared areas overlap into one)</li>
<li>This process will result in a list of areas that may be barcodes - any that are taller than they are wide are ignored (because barcode regions are always wider than they are tall)</li>
</ol>

<p>The second step can be broken down into:</p>

<ol>
<li>Take the maybe-barcode region of the image, greyscale it and then turn into a mask by setting any pixel with an intensity less than a particular threshold to zero and otherwise to one</li>
<li>Take a horizontal slice across the image region - all of the pixels on the first row of the image - and change the zero-or-one raw data into a list of line lengths where a new line starts at any transition from zero-to-one or one-to-zero (so "01001000110" becomes "1,1,2,1,3,2,1" because there is 1x zero and then 1x one and then 2x zero and then 1x one, etc..)</li>
<li>These line lengths should correspond to bar sizes (and space-between-bar sizes) if we've found a barcode - so run the values through the magic barcode bar-size-reading algorithm (see section 2.1 in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2859730/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2859730/</a>) and if we get a number (and the checksum is correct) then we're done, hurrah!</li>
<li>If we couldn't get a number from this horizontal slice then move one pixel down and go back around</li>
<li>If it was not possible to extract a number from any of the slices through the image region then it's either not a barcode or it's somehow so distorted in the image that we can't read it</li>
</ol>

<p>This approach is fairly resilient to changes in lighting and orientation because the barcode regions are still likely to have the highest horizontal intensity gradient whether the image is dark or light (and even if <em>part</em> of the image is light and part of it is dark) and the barcode-reading algorithm works on ratios of bar/space-between-bar widths and these remain constant if the image is rotated.</p>

<p><em>(Some of the techniques are similar to things that I did in my <a href="https://www.productiverage.com/face-or-no-face-finding-faces-in-photos-using-c-sharp-and-accordnet">Face or no face (finding faces in photos using C# and Accord.NET)</a> and so I'll be using some of the same code shortly that I described then)</em></p>

<h3>Identifying maybe-barcode images</h3>

<p>Let's this image as an example to work with (peanut butter.. I <em>do</em> love peanut butter) -</p>

<p><img alt="Delicious peanut butter" src="https://www.productiverage.com/Content/Images/Posts/PeanutBarcode.jpg"></p>

<p>Before looking at any code, let's visualise the process.</p>

<p>We're going to consider horizontal and vertical gradient intensity maps - at every point in the image we either look to the pixels to the left and to the right (for the horizontal gradient) or we look at the pixels above and below (for the vertical gradient) and the larger the change, the brighter the pixel in the gradient intensity map</p>

<p><img alt="Horizontal gradient intensity" src="https://www.productiverage.com/Content/Images/Posts/PeanutBarcode-HorizontalAndVerticalGradients.jpg"></p>

<p>And when they're combined by subtracting the vertical gradient at each point from the horizontal gradient, it looks lke this:</p>

<p><img alt="Combined gradient intensity" src="https://www.productiverage.com/Content/Images/Posts/PeanutBarcode-CombinedGradients.jpg"></p>

<p>If this image is blurred then we get this:</p>

<p><img alt="Blurred combined gradient intensity" src="https://www.productiverage.com/Content/Images/Posts/PeanutBarcode-Blurred.jpg"></p>

<p>.. and if we create a binary mask by saying "normalise the intensity values so that their range goes from zero (for the darkest pixel) to one (for the brightest) and then set any pixels that are in the bottom third in terms of intensity to 0 and set the rest to 1" then we get this:</p>

<p><img alt="Mask of possibly-part-of-a-barcode areas" src="https://www.productiverage.com/Content/Images/Posts/PeanutBarcode-Mask.jpg"></p>

<p>If each distinct area (where an "area" means "a group of pixels that are connected") is identified and squares overlaid and centered around the areas then we see this:</p>

<p><img alt="Mask of possibly-part-of-a-barcode areas, extended into squared areas" src="https://www.productiverage.com/Content/Images/Posts/PeanutBarcode-MaskSquares.jpg"></p>

<p>.. and if the areas whose bounding squares overlap are combined and then cropped around the white pixels then we end up with this:</p>

<p><img alt="Combined possibly-a-barcode areas" src="https://www.productiverage.com/Content/Images/Posts/PeanutBarcode-MaskSquaresCombined.jpg"></p>

<p>This has identified the area around the barcode and also two tiny other areas - when we come to trying to read barcode numbers out of these, the tiny regions will result in no value while the area around the genuine barcode content <em>should</em> result in a number successfully being read. But I'm getting ahead of myself.. let's look at the code required to perform the above transformations.</p>

<p>I'm going to start with a <strong>DataRectangle</strong> for performing transformations -</p>

<pre><code>public static class DataRectangle
{
    public static DataRectangle&lt;T&gt; For&lt;T&gt;(T[,] values) =&gt; new DataRectangle&lt;T&gt;(values);
}

public sealed class DataRectangle&lt;T&gt;
{
    private readonly T[,] _protectedValues;
    public DataRectangle(T[,] values) : this(values, isolationCopyMayBeBypassed: false) { }
    private DataRectangle(T[,] values, bool isolationCopyMayBeBypassed)
    {
        if ((values.GetLowerBound(0) != 0) || (values.GetLowerBound(1) != 0))
            throw new ArgumentException("Both dimensions must have lower bound zero");
        var arrayWidth = values.GetUpperBound(0) + 1;
        var arrayHeight = values.GetUpperBound(1) + 1;
        if ((arrayWidth == 0) || (arrayHeight == 0))
            throw new ArgumentException("zero element arrays are not supported");

        Width = arrayWidth;
        Height = arrayHeight;

        if (isolationCopyMayBeBypassed)
            _protectedValues = values;
        else
        {
            _protectedValues = new T[Width, Height];
            Array.Copy(values, _protectedValues, Width * Height);
        }
    }

    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// This will always be greater than zero
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    public int Width { get; }

    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// This will always be greater than zero
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    public int Height { get; }

    public T this[int x, int y]
    {
        get
        {
            if ((x &lt; 0) || (x &gt;= Width))
                throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(x));
            if ((y &lt; 0) || (y &gt;= Height))
                throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(y));
            return _protectedValues[x, y];
        }
    }

    public IEnumerable&lt;Tuple&lt;Point, T&gt;&gt; Enumerate(Func&lt;Point, T, bool&gt;? optionalFilter = null)
    {
        for (var x = 0; x &lt; Width; x++)
        {
            for (var y = 0; y &lt; Height; y++)
            {
                var value = _protectedValues[x, y];
                var point = new Point(x, y);
                if (optionalFilter?.Invoke(point, value) ?? true)
                    yield return Tuple.Create(point, value);
            }
        }
    }

    public DataRectangle&lt;TResult&gt; Transform&lt;TResult&gt;(Func&lt;T, TResult&gt; transformer)
    {
        return Transform((value, coordinates) =&gt; transformer(value));
    }

    public DataRectangle&lt;TResult&gt; Transform&lt;TResult&gt;(Func&lt;T, Point, TResult&gt; transformer)
    {
        var transformed = new TResult[Width, Height];
        for (var x = 0; x &lt; Width; x++)
        {
            for (var y = 0; y &lt; Height; y++)
                transformed[x, y] = transformer(_protectedValues[x, y], new Point(x, y));
        }
        return new DataRectangle&lt;TResult&gt;(transformed, isolationCopyMayBeBypassed: true);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then I'm going to add a way to load image data into this structure -</p>

<pre><code>public static class BitmapExtensions
{
    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// This will return values in the range 0-255 (inclusive)
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    // Based on http://stackoverflow.com/a/4748383/3813189
    public static DataRectangle&lt;double&gt; GetGreyscale(this Bitmap image)
    {
        var values = new double[image.Width, image.Height];
        var data = image.LockBits(
            new Rectangle(0, 0, image.Width, image.Height),
            ImageLockMode.ReadOnly,

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-main" role="main"> <div> <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <meta itemprop="mainEntityOfPage" content="//advices-writing-blog-posts/"> <meta itemprop="description" content="">  <figure itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"> <meta itemprop="url" content="https://blog.frankel.ch/assets/resources/advices-writing-blog-posts/vintage-1148940_1280.jpg"> <meta itemprop="height" content="853"> <meta itemprop="width" content="1280"> </figure> <section> <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>At work, I’ve recently been asked to advise our engineers on how to write blog posts. A lot of such articles are already available. However, they tend to focus around two main themes:</p> <ul><li><span>The technical publishing platform <em>e.g.</em> Jekyll, Medium, etc.</span></li><li><span>Metrics <em>e.g.</em> readability score, <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>, etc.</span></li></ul> <p>Beyond that, everyone is on one’s own. But I believe that writing a good technical article is as much art as engineering.</p> <p>In this post, I’d like to try to address this gap: I’ve been writing this blog for more than a decade. I hope I’ve learned some things along the way, so here are my advices.</p> <p>Note that they are solely based on my humble experience, and not prescriptive in any way! Feel free to discard those that don’t feel relevant to you. And I’ll be happy about any feedback about your own experience.</p> <div> <h2 id="a-tentative-typology">A tentative typology</h2> <div> <p>Before detailing how to write a blog post, one should first accept it depends on the type of post. On this blog, I’ve noticed my posts can be mainly put into one of those categories:</p> <ol><li><span>Solving a problem</span></li><li><span>Learning in a step-by-step way</span></li><li><span>Comparing alternatives</span></li><li><span>Reviewing a book</span></li><li><span>Ranting!</span></li></ol> <p>Remember that all models are wrong, but some are helpful. While this typology is helpful, it might not be so clear-cut in every case. Also, there are a lot of other blog post types, but those listed are the ones that regularly worked for me. Let’s detail each of them in turn.</p> <div> <h3 id="solving-a-problem">Solving a problem</h3> <p>I started this blog when I was working as a consultant: my day-to-day job was basically to solve problems. The idea behind this kind of blog post is to make use of one’s work during one’s job. It also allows to deepen the understanding that one was not able to get due to time’s constraints during the project.</p> <div> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <i title="Warning"></i> </td> <td> <p>In this kind of post, the author should take utmost caution to remove any information that shouldn’t be made public. I’d very strongly advise that the post be proof-read by others before being published.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> </div> <p>Writing such a post should be structured around the following sections.</p> <div> <dl> <dt>The context</dt> <dd> <p>When reviewing other’s blog posts, this is the part that is the least detailed, when it’s not forgotten altogether. IMHO, it should be the most important one. Engineering is all about trade-offs. If the context is not described in detail, the rest of the post loses a lot of value.</p> </dd> <dt>Considered alternatives</dt> <dd> <p>Before choosing a specific solution, the team probably considered multiple alternatives. They should be listed with their pros and cons <strong>in regard to the context</strong> described in the previous section. Try to be as objective as possible.</p> </dd> <dt>Chosen solution</dt> <dd> <p>Now is time to describe the chosen solution, along with its pros and cons. More importantly, this section should tell why it was chosen, again in regard to the context.</p> <p>Remember that not everything is related to technical issues. In some cases, the reason bedind the choice might be because of the organization, the schedule, conflict between team members, etc. Those are perfectly valid reasons. If you feel comfortable - and you’re not covered by a <abbr title="Non-Disclosure Agreement">NDA</abbr>, feel free to say so. If not, tell explicitly you’re not at liberty to say why.</p> <p>The important bit to remember is to strive to be as transparent as possible in regard to the project.</p> </dd> <dt>Conclusion</dt> <dd> <p>This section recaps the above in a few sentences. With hindsight, tell whether the chosen solution was the right one. If no, explain the reasons why, and why others shouldn’t take the same decision in the same context. Make the conclusion your own retrospective.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> <p>Examples:</p> <ul><li><span><a href="https://blog.frankel.ch/what-version-jekyll-site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What’s the version of my Jekyll site?</a></span></li><li><span><a href="https://blog.frankel.ch/logging-additional-metadata/">Logging additional metadata</a></span></li></ul> </div>  <div> <h3 id="comparison-of-alternatives">Comparison of alternatives</h3> <p>This kind of post tries to help readers make an informed choice about some alternatives. The idea is to have a set of alternatives, as well as a set of criteria. An important part of the work is to find the relevant criteria: while it’s not feasible to be exhaustive, one should mention the major ones. Here’s a proposal about such a post’s structure.</p> <div> <dl> <dt>Evaluation of alternatives</dt> <dd> <p>Each section should be dedicated to a single criterion. Each alternative should be evaluated regarding this criterion in one, or a couple of paragraphs.</p> </dd> <dt>Recap matrix</dt> <dd> <p>The most important section should be a recap matrix of all alternative/criterion combination. It’s advised to make use of colored symbols.</p> </dd> <dt>Optional conclusion</dt> <dd> <p>To help readers, one can write a conclusion. It should flesh out a few contexts, and extrapolate the "best" alternative given the above matrix.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> <p>Examples:</p> <ul><li><span><a href="https://blog.frankel.ch/comparing-lombok-and-kotlin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Comparing Lombok and Kotlin</a></span></li><li><span><a href="https://blog.frankel.ch/git-service-providers-comparison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Git service providers comparison</a></span></li></ul> </div> <div> <h3 id="book-review">Book review</h3> <p>The name says it all: read a book, and write a review about it. Note that the reading part is actually the most time-consuming part of the blog post. It’s a great way to take notes, and let others benefit from it at the same time.</p> <p>While I’ve done a couple of book reviews in the past, I’m not sure I got them right. This is the way I did it, only time can tell if I continue doing them this way - or not. In the meantime, here’s the structure that I used before.</p> <div> <dl> <dt>Facts</dt> <dd> <ul><li><span>State the number of pages, of chapters, the price, etc.</span></li><li><span>Sum-up the whole book into a paragraph <em>i.e.</em> what’s the book about</span></li><li><span>Describe who the book is intended for</span></li></ul> </dd> <dt>Pros</dt> <dd> <p>State one thing you like, one paragraph for each</p> </dd> <dt>Cons</dt> <dd> <p>State one thing you dislike, one paragraph for each</p> </dd> <dt>Conclusion</dt> <dd> <p>This section is where you can be less objective, writing your personal feelings about what you read. The final sentence should be whether readers should acquire the book, or not.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> <p>For teams, there’s an alternative type of book reviews that I’ve successfully lead in the past: "What our team read". Each participating team member writes a short paragraph about one of the last books he liked.</p> <p>Examples:</p> <ul><li><span><a href="https://blog.frankel.ch/the-leprechauns-of-software-engineering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Leprechauns of Software Engineering</a></span></li><li><span><a href="https://blog.frankel.ch/specification-by-example-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Specification by Example review</a></span></li></ul> </div> <div> <h3 id="opinion-rant">Opinion rant</h3> <p>Again, the name is pretty descriptive. The structure depends a lot on the subject.</p> <p>The important bit in this kind of post is the choice of the subject:</p> <ul><li><span>The focus should be on an <em>unpopular opinion</em>. Howling with the wolves is pretty useless, both for you and readers.</span></li><li><span>You should be 100% convinced that you’re right despite not belonging to the majority</span></li><li><span>Last but not least, there should be enough arguments to support your position</span></li></ul>  </div> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="other-considerations">Other considerations</h2> <div> <div> <dl> <dt>Code repository</dt> <dd> <p>I assume most blog posts will be about code and programming. Hence, it makes sense to provide code along them. There are two cases:</p> <ul><li><span>The post is based on a full-fledged code repository. You can copy-paste code snippets in the relevant parts of the blog post. Also, don’t forget to link to the code repository. GitHub has a bit of an advantage here over GitLab: in the repository description, link back to the blog post.</span></li><li><span>If a code repository is not warranted, but code snippets are necessary, they should be tested in the IDE to make work as expected.</span></li></ul> </dd> <dt>Series</dt> <dd> <p>I’ve experienced an interesting fact: the longer a blog post is, the more chances I’ll skip reading it after some point. There’s a relationship between the content’s quality and the content’s size I’m willing to go through.</p> <p>But in all cases, if the post is too long, I will stop reading. I unfortunately cannot state a rule concerning the "right" size, it’s a matter of gut feeling for me. In all cases, I’d recommend splitting posts that feel too long into separate parts and create a serie.</p> </dd> <dt>Reuse</dt> <dd> <p>Writing a blog post is a significant time investment. Why not get more out of this investment by turning it into a talk? While not all blog posts can be turned into talks, some do. In that case, preparing the talk will be quite easy.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> <p>Remember that all this post is very empirical, so take the above advices with a pinch of salt. Also, please feel free to give your own advices in the comments, I’ll be happy to learn about upping my game myself.</p> </div> </div>   </div> </section>   </article> </div> </div></div>]]>

<!-- How to understand a system -->
<!-- Tales of feedback loops, leverage points and bottlenecks. -->

<p>To solve a problem, you first need to understand the problem.</p>

<p><a href="https://neilkakkar.com/How-to-see-Systems-in-everyday-life.html">Problems exist within systems.</a></p>

<p>So, to understand the problem, you need to understand the system.</p>

<!-- One of the key aspects of working with any system is figuring out how it works.[^1]  -->

<!-- [^1]: This is probably true for everything. To work with X you need to figure out how X works. -->

<p>By systems I mean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complex adaptive systems</a>. They are the most interesting kind, and difficult to deal with.</p>

<p>Complex, because removing a part destroys the system. Each part is interdependent on other parts. Like removing a heart from the human body.</p>

<p>Adaptive, because each part reacts to what the other parts do. Like the heart pumping faster when artery blockages develop.</p>

<p>Treating complex systems like a black-box, where you figure out the problem by trying solutions is a terrible idea. Imagine going to a doctor and without listening to you, the doctor gives you aspirin. Do you feel better? No? Then paracetamol. Still no? An antacid. Still no?&nbsp;.. Sigh, okay, tell me what’s wrong?</p>

<p>But that’s how we solve most surface problems. And in simple systems, it usually works.</p>

<p>The key is, can you distinguish between simple and complex systems?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you don’t know what to call it, you can’t distinguish it.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<!-- Every time you hit your mobile phone hoping it would start working, you're treating it like a black box. -->

<p>An alternative is white-box thinking. Here, we dissect the system, get into its internals and figure out why things weren’t working, or how the system works.</p>

<!-- With simple systems, it's faster to take the blackbox approach. Over time, this becomes a habit. Things get dangerous when we stop distinguishing between simple and complex systems. -->

<p>I think there are at least two ways to figure out a system.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Simulate the system</li>
  <li>Experiment with the system</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="simulation">Simulation</h2>

<p>Simulation is either computational or thought based.</p>

<p>One is running a computer simulation,<br>
the other is running a thought experiment.</p>

<p>In both cases, what you get are insights into how the system works. They go hand in hand.</p>

<p>Both need a basic understanding of how things will work - without an existing model, you can’t simulate. These methods are also used to refine your model. For example, you start with a barebones model built by experience. Then, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you run it</a>. Then, you improve the model based on the difference in results between your model and the world.</p>

<p>One pillar example of simulation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Limits to Growth</a> done in 1972. It tracks the demise of humans on the current trajectory of consumption and environment degradation.</p>

<p>Criticized in the beginning, LTG has come to be accepted as the model predicting reality, now that we have 50 years of living the model behind us.</p>

<!-- Put in enough loops in a system and what you get is the human world. Imperfect, lots of actors, lots of variables, no accepted unifying principle. -->

<!-- Humans are interesting. We can inspect systems we are a part of. Not that we succeed every time, with our emotions getting the better of us. -->

<h3 id="thought-experiments">Thought experiments</h3>

<p>Take a hypothesis, theory or a principle. Think through what will happen if it were true. That’s a thought experiment.</p>

<p>Consider an example - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schrödinger’s cat</a> (1935). It presents a cat that is indeterminately alive or dead, depending on a random <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_indeterminacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quantum event</a>. Figuring out if it’s alive or not is dependent on looking in the box. Till that point, it’s both, alive and dead.</p>

<p>What makes this thought experiment so great is the way it explains quantum theory. Say, instead, you had a coin inside the box. You can toss this coin by pressing a button outside the box. If it’s heads, the cat will die. Tails, and it lives. With every button press, the probability to live decreases, but at no point is that cat both alive and dead. Is your mind blowing to pieces yet?</p>

</figure>

<!-- Thought experiments are all about running experiments in the mind - to figure out the system, by simulating what you think will happen when you do X. 
unconsciously/consciously using the equations fed to your simulation model. -->

<h4 id="the-process">The process</h4>

<p>You begin with a set of hypothesis about what would happen.<br>
You run through them in your mind</p>

<p>There are two things that might happen.<br>
You arrive at an outcome different from what you expect<br>
You arrive at your version of reality</p>

<p>Both cases are a cause for concern.<br>
You confirm that’s what would happen in the real world, via experience<br>
If your model is close enough to the real world, profit.<br>
else you refine your hypothesis and restart.</p>

<h2 id="experimentation">Experimentation</h2>

<p>Here, we enter the territory of real world experiments with real world consequences that might change the state of the system.</p>

<p>You’re perturbing the system to try and figure out what will happen. Thus, you want to experiment with small changes first.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Want universal basic income? Try experimenting in a few cities first. it’s A/B testing on whatever scale works.</p>

<p>The only caveat: things break when you scale up.</p>

<p>Experimentation with system is needed when your imagination can’t keep up with what you’re seeing. This usually happens in complex systems. There are too many variables - you don’t know half of them, and you can’t keep the other half in your brain.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>The main aim, using the above approaches is to build an accurate-enough model. One that behaves the same way the system behaves, given the same input.</p>

<p>Input → System → Output<br>
Input → Model → Output</p>

<p>Fair warning though, knowing this model isn’t the same as controlling the system. That’s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(cybernetics)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Law of Requisite Variety</a> - to control a system, you need a controller at least as complex as the system.</p>

<p><a href="https://thesystemsthinker.com/behavior-over-time-diagrams-seeing-dynamic-interrelationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Behaviour over time diagrams</a> are an excellent tool to build this model. Sometimes sketching things out, looking at it all together helps see the relationships. That’s what BOTDs are for.</p>

<h2 id="questions-to-answer">Questions to answer</h2>

<p>In both approaches, you’re trying to fill in some blanks. Here are some important questions to answer. They exist in every system.</p>

<p>If you’re unsure what some of them mean, <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/How-to-see-Systems-in-everyday-life.html">head over to seeing systems.</a></p>

<p>Find the driving factors</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What would happen if I do X?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Figure out the loop structure</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If I do more of a driving factor, <strong>d</strong>, what will happen?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Figure out delays in systems</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>How long before the results of changing <strong>d</strong> occur?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Identify the current dominant loop</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A second from now, towards which driving factor is the system going?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="system-archetypes">System Archetypes</h2>

<p>Some very common models come into play again and again. If you know these well, the problem switches from trying to figure out what is happening, to which model fits? - This is powerful and dangerous.</p>

<p>Dangerous because you get a tendency to beat the current situation into one of these models.</p>

<p>Powerful because you don’t have to start from scratch every time.</p>

<p>This is how <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/A-Simplistic-explanation-to-Mental-Models.html">Mental Models work</a>. They are archetypes for life.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_archetype" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a> has an excellent introduction to system archetypes.</p>

<p>To dive into available archetypes, <a href="https://thesystemsthinker.com/systems-archetypes-i-diagnosing-systemic-issues-and-designing-interventions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Systems Thinker is an excellent resource.</a></p>

<p>I haven’t explored archetypes enough, yet.</p>

<p>What I do know, is that the above archetype list is incomplete.</p>

<p>As Charlie Munger found out, sometimes it’s easier to look in an adjacent field than diving deeper in yours.</p>

<p>That’s what I’ll do.</p>

<p>Into Chemistry - equilibriums. Systems can be thought of as an equilibrium.</p>

<p>That’s when we can use results from chemical equilibrium to explain system behaviour. Presenting, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Chatelier%27s_principle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Le Chateliers Principle</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a settled system is disturbed, it will adjust to diminish the change that has been made to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- With computer models: the language is clearer - explicit and shows the underlying assumptions. -->

<p>This is precisely what Jay Forrester says happens in social systems.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“At any time, a near-equilibrium exists affecting population mobility
between different areas of a country. To the extent that there is disequilibrium, it
means that some area is slightly more attractive than others and population begins
to move in the direction of the more attractive area. Movement continues until
rising population drives the more attractive area down in attractiveness to again
be in equilibrium with its surroundings. Other things being equal, an increase in
population of a city crowds housing, overloads job opportunities, causes
congestion, increases pollution, encourages crime, and reduces every component
of the quality of life.”<br>
- <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-988-system-dynamics-self-study-fall-1998-spring-1999/readings/behavior.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jay Forrester,  Counter intuitive behaviour of social systems</a></p>
</blockquote>

<!--

Efforts to improve some condition of a city will result primarily in increasing
population until other conditions deteriorate to reestablish an equilibrium.

Programs aimed at improving a city can
succeed only if they result in eventually raising the average quality of life for the
country as a whole.

Counter intuitive behaviour of social systems
1. Human intuition develops from exposure to simple systems. In simple systems,
the cause of a trouble is close in both time and space to symptoms of the trouble.
If one touches a hot stove, the burn occurs here and now; the cause is obvious.
However, in complex dynamic systems, causes are often far removed in both time
and space from the symptoms. True causes may lie far back in time and arise
from an entirely different part of the system from when and where the symptoms
occur. However, the complex system can mislead in devious ways by presenting
an apparent cause that meets the expectations derived from simple systems. A
person will observe what appear to be causes that lie close to the symptoms in
both time and space—shortly before in time and close to the symptoms.

For example, human suffering in cities is accompanied (some
think caused) by inadequate housing. As a result, housing is increased and
population rises to defeat the effort. More people are trapped in the depressed
urban system. As another example, symptoms of excess population are beginning
to overshadow all countries. 

2. social systems seem to have a few sensitive influence points
through which behavior can be changed. These high-influence points are not
where most people expect. Furthermore, when a high-influence policy is
identified, the chances are great that a person guided by intuition and judgment
will alter the system in the wrong direction. 

3. social systems exhibit a conflict between short-term and long-term
consequences of a policy change. A policy that produces improvement in the
short run is usually one that degrades a system in the long run. Likewise, policies
that produce long-run improvement may initially depress behavior of a system.
This is especially treacherous. The short run is more visible and more
compelling.

  <div id="concepts">

<p>Normandy is a system that allows Mozilla to instruct Firefox clients to
perform a variety of actions to aid the user and gather feedback to guide
Mozilla in developing a better browser for them. To do this, we need a way to
instruct Firefox to perform certain actions without having to download an
update or wait for a new release.</p>
<p>The system is made of two main components, a server and client. These
components are known simply as the Normandy client and Normandy server. The
server provides information that the client acts on.</p>
<p>Normandy’s execution is built around two main concepts: Actions and Recipes. This
document describes those concepts in detail.</p>
<div id="actions">
<h2>Actions<a href="#actions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An action is one of the capabilities provided by Normandy. As of Firefox 66,
actions are implemented entirely within the browser as native code (though
previously they were served by the server and retrieved at runtime). Actions are
identified in recipes by name, such as “preference-experiment” or
“show-heartbeat”.</p>
<p>Actions can accept a configuration object that is specified within the
Normandy control interface. This configuration, which is part of a
<a href="#recipes"><span>recipe</span></a>, contains data required by the action, such as
translated strings or boolean options for controlling behavior.</p>
<p>For example, a “survey” action could consist of code within Firefox to check
whether we have shown a survey to the user recently, to determine which
variant of a survey to show, and the code to actually display the survey
itself. When issued to clients, this action is paired with configuration for
the survey action would contain the text of the survey prompt and the URL to
redirect the user to after answering.</p>
</div>
<div id="recipes">
<h2>Recipes<a href="#recipes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A recipe is a model that represents a single instance of an action we want to
perform. Recipes contain three important pieces of information:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Client filtering data that determines which users the recipe should be run
for. This takes the form of a <a href="https://github.com/TechnologyAdvice/Jexl">JEXL</a> expression that is evaluated on the
client and has access to several pieces of data about the client, such as
the data collected by <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Telemetry">Telemetry</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The name of the <a href="#actions"><span>action</span></a> that this recipe should perform
when run.</p></li>
<li><p>The configuration data to pass to the Action code when it is executed, called
the recipe’s <strong>arguments</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Recipes are stored in the Normandy server’s database and the Normandy client
fetches them from the service during execution. All active recipes are sent
to every client, and filtering is done locally on the client.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a recipe in JSON format, as fetched by the Normandy
client:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>{</span>
   <span>"id"</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
   <span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Console Log Test"</span><span>,</span>
   <span>"revision_id"</span><span>:</span> <span>12</span><span>,</span>
   <span>"action"</span><span>:</span> <span>"console-log"</span><span>,</span>
   <span>"arguments"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>"message"</span><span>:</span> <span>"It works!"</span>
   <span>},</span>
   <span>"filter_expression"</span><span>:</span> <span>"normandy.version &gt;= '65.0' &amp;&amp; stableSample(0.5)"</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The data retrieved by the Normandy client is the minimum subset of data
that is needed execute the action. Other API end points return more
information about the recipe, including it’s history and approval status.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="normandy-client">
<h2>Normandy Client<a href="#normandy-client" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Normandy client is <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/toolkit/components/normandy">a Firefox component</a> that reads and executes
instructions from the server. Upon activation (typically every few hours),
the client:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Downloads <a href="#recipes"><span>recipes</span></a> from the Normandy service.</p></li>
<li><p>Verifies the signature of the recipes.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluates the recipe filters and removes recipes that do not match the
client.</p></li>
<li><p>Executes the corresponding action code using the recipe’s arguments.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="security-considerations">
<h2>Security Considerations<a href="#security-considerations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since the goal of SHIELD is to allow Mozilla to perform certain privileged
actions quickly without shipping full updates to Firefox, it is a tempting
target for compromising Firefox users. Normandy includes several security
controls to help mitigate this risk.</p>
<div id="action-and-recipe-signing">
<h3>Action and Recipe Signing<a href="#action-and-recipe-signing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Recipes that are downloaded by the client are signed according to the
Content-Signature protocol as provided by the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/autograph">Autograph</a> service. The client
verifies the signature upon downloading the recipes, ensuring that only
recipes that have been signed with a Mozilla-controlled key are executed.</p>
<p>This helps prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks where an adversary pretends to be
the remote Normandy service.</p>
</div>
<div id="peer-approval">
<h3>Peer Approval<a href="#peer-approval" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Recipes cannot be enabled in the Normandy admin interface without going through
an <cite>approval process &lt;/user/peer_approval&gt;</cite>. One user must submit the recipe
for approval, and a separate user must approve the recipe before it can be
distributed by the service.</p>
<p>This helps prevent compromise of a single account from compromising the entire
service, since two accounts need to be compromised to publish a recipe.</p>
</div>
<div id="safe-instructions">
<h3>Safe Instructions<a href="#safe-instructions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Recipe data is provided in either a non-executable format (JSON) or a safe
executable format designed specifically to be weak and without enough access
to exfiltrate data (JEXL filters). In technical terms, the JEXL filters are
not turing complete, by design. This means that even if an attacker could run
a malicious recipe in Firefox, they are limited to the actions implemented in
the existing client.</p>
</div>
<div id="configurable-admin">
<h3>Configurable Admin<a href="#configurable-admin" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The admin interface for Normandy can be disabled via a Django setting, which
allows for disabling the admin interface on public-facing web servers and
running them with read-only privileges. The writable admin interface is then
deployed behind a VPN to restrict access to authorized users.</p>

August 10, 2020 | https://yetiops.net/posts/proxmox-terraform-cloudinit-saltstack-prometheus/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://yetiops.net/posts/proxmox-terraform-cloudinit-saltstack-prometheus/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In the last <a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-consul-saltstack-part-1-linux/">two</a> <a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-openstack/">series</a> of posts on this site, I covered using SaltStack to deploy <a href="https://consul.io/">Consul</a> and <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> Exporters, and also using different Prometheus service discovery mechanisms to gather instances to monitor in each provider.</p>
<p>There is no Prometheus discovery mechanism for Proxmox, nor a consistent way to discover tagged instances in Proxmox (regardless of which tool queries the Proxmox API). Instead, we can implement something like Consul to discover the instances.</p>
<p>Also, Proxmox supports Cloud-Init, so we can bootstrap virtual machines and them register with Salt, install base packages and more without the cyclical dependency of needing to be registered to Salt to install Salt.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>As mentioned, we have covered some of what we are using here in different posts already: -</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-consul-node_exporter">Prometheus: Discovering Services with Consul</a> - Using Consul with Prometheus to discover instances to monitor</li>
<li><a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/saltstack-introduction">Configuration Seasoning: Getting started with Saltstack</a> - A primer on SaltStack, including how to configure a basic Salt environment</li>
<li><a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-consul-saltstack-part-1-linux/">Prometheus - Auto-deploying Consul and Exporters using Saltstack Part 1: Linux</a> - This post (and series) contains all of the Salt states we use in this post, as well as the Prometheus configuration</li>
<li>Prometheus Service Discovery posts on <a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-aws-gcp-azure/">AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform</a>, <a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-digitalocean/">Digital Ocean</a> and <a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/proxmox-terraform-cloudinit-saltstack-prometheus/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-openstack/">OpenStack</a> - This post cover using Terraform with various cloud providers, as well as making use of Cloud-Init</li>
</ul>
<p>By using elements of each of the above, we can treat Proxmox almost like another Cloud environment/provider.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-proxmox">Setting up Proxmox</h2>
<p>Proxmox can be installed using the <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads">ISOs</a> provided on the Proxmox website. Full instructions for how to install the Virtualization Environment are available <a href="https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Installation">here</a>.</p>
<p>The following videos also do a good job of explaining it too: -</p>

</p>

<p>Once installed, you should be able to view the Proxmox GUI on <code>https://$IP_OF_HOST:8006</code>: -</p>
<p><img src="https://yetiops.net/img/proxmox/proxmox-gui.png" alt="Proxmox GUI"></p>
<p>You can create Proxmox hosts in either standalone mode or multiple hosts in a cluster. The latter allows you to manage all of your instances from the UI of any host in the cluster. It also allows live migration of instances between Proxmox hosts (seamlessly, if using shared storage).</p>
<h2 id="terraform">Terraform</h2>
<p>Once Proxmox is installed, we can configure the Terraform Proxmox <a href="https://github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox">provider</a>.</p>
<p>For information on how to install Terraform and an example project structure, see <a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-aws-gcp-azure/#configure-terraform">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="install-the-provider">Install the provider</h3>
<p>As the provider is from a third party, and not an official Terraform provider, you need to install the provider manually on your machine. Full instructions for this are available <a href="https://github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox/blob/master/docs/installation.md">here</a>, but to summarize the steps: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># Clone the repository</span>
$ git clone https://github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox

<span># Go Install the provider and provisioner (requires a working Goland installation)</span>
$ cd terraform-provider-proxmox
$ go install github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox/cmd/terraform-provider-proxmox
$ go install github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox/cmd/terraform-provisioner-proxmox

<span># Run the Makefile</span>
$ make

<span># Create the Terraform plugins directory and move the generated plugins to it</span>
$ mkdir ~/.terraform.d/plugins
$ cp bin/terraform-provider-proxmox ~/.terraform.d/plugins
$ cp bin/terraform-provisioner-proxmox ~/.terraform.d/plugins
</code></pre></div><p>The provider will now be available to use within your Terraform environment.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-terraform-user-in-proxmox">Create a Terraform user in Proxmox</h3>
<p>Terraform requires a user to authenticate against the Proxmox API. You can create the user via the GUI, but you will need to use the CLI to assign it to the correct roles. Alternatively, you can create the user and assign roles with the CLI: -</p>
<h3 id="configure-the-proxmox-provider">Configure the Proxmox provider</h3>
<p>Within your Terraform directory, create a directory called <code>proxmox</code> and then add a <code>provider.tf</code> file: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span>provider</span> <span>"proxmox"</span> {
  pm_api_url <span>=</span> <span>"https://$IP_OF_HOST:8006/api2/json"</span>
  pm_user <span>=</span> <span>"<a href="https://yetiops.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="bacedfc8c8dbdcd5c8d797cac8d5ccfacaccdf">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span>
  pm_tls_insecure <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>You also need to supply the password, however it is not advisable to supply this as part of the configuration. Sensitive credentials should not be comitted to a version control system (like Git). Instead, you can use an environment variable: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ export PM_PASS<span>=</span><span>"PR0M0X_P8SS"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>You should now be able to configure instances in Proxmox using Terraform.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-template">Creating a template</h3>
<p>The Terraform provider can create instances using either the <code>iso</code> option (i.e. a CD-based installer) or via a <code>clone</code> (i.e. a copy of another instance). The former provides little benefit over installing via the GUI. Instead we can create a template instance ready to be cloned, with all the necessary dependencies for <a href="https://cloud-init.io/">Cloud-Init</a>.</p>
<p>There are two ways to achieve this: -</p>
<ul>
<li>Create your own instance, install the necessary dependencies and convert to a template</li>
<li>Use an image with the dependencies installed already.</li>
</ul>
<p>Proxmox recommend using the same <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/obtain-images.html">images</a> used for <a href="https://openstack.org/">OpenStack</a>, as OpenStack supports Cloud-Init. Also, Proxmox and OpenStack both use <a href="https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page">KVM</a> for virtualization, meaning the images use common dependencies and kernel modules.</p>
<p>To create the template, obtain one of the OpenStack images (I am using Debian Buster): -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># Navigate to the ISO directory for Proxmox</span>
$ cd /var/lib/vz/templates/isos

<span># Source the image</span>
$ wget http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/openstack/current-10/debian-10-openstack-amd64.qcow2
</code></pre></div><p>Use the following commands to create a template within Proxmox, ready to be cloned: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># Create the instance</span>
qm create <span>9000</span> -name debian-cloudinit -memory <span>1024</span> -net0 virtio,bridge<span>=</span>vmbr0 -cores <span>1</span> -sockets <span>1</span>

<span># Import the OpenStack disk image to Proxmox storage</span>
qm importdisk <span>9000</span> debian-10-openstack-amd64.qcow2 local-lvm

<span># Attach the disk to the virtual machine</span>
qm set <span>9000</span> -scsihw virtio-scsi-pci -virtio0 local-lvm:vm-9000-disk-0

<span># Add a serial output</span>
qm set <span>9000</span> -serial0 socket

<span># Set the bootdisk to the imported Openstack disk</span>
qm set <span>9000</span> -boot c -bootdisk virtio0

<span># Enable the Qemu agent</span>
qm set <span>9000</span> -agent <span>1</span>

<span># Allow hotplugging of network, USB and disks</span>
qm set <span>9000</span> -hotplug disk,network,usb

<span># Add a single vCPU (for now)</span>
qm set <span>9000</span> -vcpus <span>1</span>

<span># Add a video output</span>
qm set <span>9000</span> -vga qxl

<span># Set a second hard drive, using the inbuilt cloudinit drive</span>
qm set <span>9000</span> -ide2 local-lvm:cloudinit

<span># Resize the primary boot disk (otherwise it will be around 2G by default)</span>
<span># This step adds another 8G of disk space, but change this as you need to</span>
qm resize <span>9000</span> virtio0 +8G

<span># Convert the VM to the template</span>
qm template <span>9000</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This template will now be usable with Terraform with the name <code>debian-cloudinit</code> (i.e. the name specified when creating the instance).</p>
<h3 id="define-an-instance">Define an instance</h3>
<p>You can now create the configuration files for your first Proxmox instance. The below is from the file <code>vm.tf</code> in the <code>terraform/proxmox</code> directory: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span># Source the Cloud Init Config file

</code></pre></div><p>To summarize the steps being taken here, we are: -</p>
<ul>
<li>Source the <code>cloud-config</code> file, with steps that the instance should take at first boot
<ul>
<li>We also supply variables to set the hostname, domain and our SSH key to the instance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We generate a local file of the template with the variables applied</li>
<li>We use a <code>null_resource</code> in Terraform to copy the file to the Proxmox host
<ul>
<li>Null Resources are used instead of an existing provider</li>
<li>The provisioner is used to place the file in the remote location (i.e. the Proxmox host)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We create a QEMU-based virtual machine
<ul>
<li>This depends on the <code>cloud-config</code> file being generated and transferred to the Proxmox host</li>
<li>We specify the Proxmox node to build it on</li>
<li>We tell it to clone the <code>debian-cloudinit</code> image (from the <a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/proxmox-terraform-cloudinit-saltstack-prometheus/#creating-a-template">Creating a template</a> section)</li>
<li>We use the <code>cicustom</code> option to specify our <code>cloud-config</code> template</li>
<li>We use <code>ipconfig0</code> to specify the IP of the first network interface</li>
<li>We tell it to have a disk size of 10G</li>
<li>We create the network, with an ID of 0 (which matches the <code>ipconfig0</code> ID)</li>
<li>We ignore changes to the network</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The last step is because the Proxmox provider wants to recreate the interface on every apply, as the MAC address is randomly generated each time. You either need to ignore changes so that it doesn’t want to recreate the interface, or specify the MAC address in the <code>network</code> block using the <code>macaddr</code> field, eg: -</p>

<p>I recently got a <a href="https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=P0AUX">Behringer UMC22 sound card</a> for video conferencing and DJing. This page documents what I've learned about using this sound card, and USB audio in general, on FreeBSD.</p>

<p>tl;dr: Everything works as long as the sound card follows the USB audio device class specification.</p>

<img src="https://www.davidschlachter.com/thumbnails/freebsd-usb-audio-large.jpg" alt="Behringer UMC22 sound card connected to FreeBSD computer">

<h2>Hardware support</h2>

<p>Which USB sound cards are supported in FreeBSD? The <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/releases/12.0R/hardware.html">hardware notes</a> don't list USB sound cards, and neither does the manual page for the corresponding driver, <code><a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=snd_uaudio">snd_uaudio (4)</a></code>. Inspecting the <a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/sys/dev/sound/usb/uaudio.c?view=co">source code for the <code>snd_uaudio</code> driver</a> lists some cards that require custom tweaks, but a complete list isn't present.
</p>

<p>Hardware support for USB sound cards appears to be based on compliance with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131105223008/http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/audio10.pdf">USB audio device class specification</a>, rather than on specific chipsets or models.
</p>

<p>How can you verify whether a USB audio device is compliant with the specification? In the case of the UMC22, the chip used is the TI PCM 2902. The <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/pcm2902.pdf">specifications for the PCM2902 chipset</a> say somewhat ambiguously that "the whole board design should be considered to meet the USB specification as a USB-compliant product" and indicate that the interface communicates through a "the standard USB request and USB audio class specific request". There doesn't appear to be an explicit statement, but it is implied that the chipset is compliant with the USB audio device class specification. The same chipset is apparently used in other Behringer sound cards such as the UM2, UA222, UCA222, and UCA202.
</p>

<h2>Using the sound card</h2>

<p>When connected to a FreeBSD machine, <code>dmesg</code> shows that the UMC22 is recognized by the <code>uaudio</code> driver. Note the string identifying the PCM2902 chipset from the spec sheet ("Burr-Brown from TI"):
</p>

<p>
uaudio0 on uhub1<br>
uaudio0: &lt;Burr-Brown from TI USB Audio CODEC, class 0/0, rev 1.10/1.00, addr 2&gt; on usbus0<br>
uaudio0: Play: 48000 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit S-LE PCM format, 2x8ms buffer.<br>
uaudio0: Play: 44100 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit S-LE PCM format, 2x8ms buffer.<br>
uaudio0: Play: 32000 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit S-LE PCM format, 2x8ms buffer.<br>
uaudio0: Record: 48000 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit S-LE PCM format, 2x8ms buffer.<br>
uaudio0: Record: 44100 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit S-LE PCM format, 2x8ms buffer.<br>
uaudio0: Record: 32000 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit S-LE PCM format, 2x8ms buffer.<br>
uaudio0: Record: 22050 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit S-LE PCM format, 2x8ms buffer.<br>
uaudio0: Record: 16000 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit S-LE PCM format, 2x8ms buffer.<br>
uaudio0: Record: 11025 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit S-LE PCM format, 2x8ms buffer.<br>
uaudio0: No MIDI sequencer.<br>
pcm3: &lt;USB audio&gt; on uaudio0<br>
uaudio0: HID volume keys found.<br>
</p>

<p>The available sound devices can be listed using <code>cat /dev/sndstat</code>, which shows that the sound card is recognized for both playback and recording (here at pcm3):</p>

<p>
Installed devices:
pcm0: &lt;Realtek (0x0257) (Analog 2.0+HP/2.0)&gt; (play/rec) default<br>
pcm1: &lt;Realtek (0x0257) (Right Analog Mic)&gt; (rec)<br>
pcm2: &lt;Intel Kaby Lake (HDMI/DP 8ch)&gt; (play)<br>
pcm3: &lt;USB audio&gt; (play/rec)<br>
No devices installed from userspace.
</p>

<p>How can the sound card be set as the playback device? Some programs, such as <a href="https://www.mixxx.org/">mixxx</a> or <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>, allow setting the output device in their preferences. Other programs will only use the default output device, which can be set using:<br><code>   sysctl hw.snd.default_unit=3</code><br>with the appropriate number for the device (in this case, <code>pcm3</code> = 3).
</p>

<p>The device number shown in <code>/dev/sndstat</code> corresponds to the device number under <code>/dev/dsp</code> and <code>/dev/mixer</code>. For example, to view the volume levels on the sound card with <code>mixer (8)</code>, you would use:<br><code>   mixer -f /dev/mixer3</code><br>To set the volume, you would use a command such as:<br><code>   mixer -f /dev/mixer3 vol 75</code><br>(If the sound card has been set as the default device, there is no need to specify the device in the <code>mixer</code> command).
</p>


<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>If an application is playing audio from the sound card when the system goes into a suspend state, the system will get stuck until all programs using the sound card close the corresponding device nodes, with a series of messages like this on the console:</p>

<p>
pcm3: unregister: channel pcm3:virtual:dsp3.vp0 busy (pid 45989)<br>
pcm3: Waiting for sound application to exit!
</p>

<p>These messages will continue to repeat until the application releases the audio device, at which point the system will finally be able to enter suspend state.</p>

<p>To work around this, I currently set the default audio device back to ID 0 as part of my pre-suspend script. This will prevent an application using the default device (such as Firefox) from preventing suspend.</p>

<p>However, for applications that set the audio device explicitly, this doesn't work. In fact, they'll often keep the audio device open even when audio isn't playing, hanging the suspend process and eventually forcing a reboot.</p>

<p>To allow suspend to continue, I use my pre-suspend script to just quit any program that has the sound card open before suspend:</p>

<div><p>
# Close up the USB sound card before suspend<br>
sysctl hw.snd.default_unit=0</p><p>

# Close any programs still using the sound card<br>
while fstat | grep dsp3 2&gt;&amp;1; do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fstat | grep dsp3 | cut -w -f 3 | while read pid;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do kill -15 "$pid"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done<br>
done<br>
while [ "$(ls -l /dev | grep -c dsp3)" -gt 1 ]; do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sleep 1<br>
done
</p></div>

		<p>The NanoPi NEOLTS is a SBC from <a href="https://www.friendlyarm.com/index.php?route=product/product&amp;path=69&amp;product_id=132">FriendlyElec</a> that uses the Allwinner H3
SOC. The NanoPi NEOLTS has a nice selection of hardware including 100Mbit
Ethernet, 3 USB Ports and a bunch of exposed GPIO.</p>
<p>FreeBSD on the NanoPi uses GENERICSD image. This image requires a bootloader
to be added before it will work. We can prepare a single image to be copied to
many SD cards by using a memory disk as an intermediate step.</p>
<p><a href="https://adventurist.me/images/nanopi-neolts.jpg"><img src="https://adventurist.me/imagessmall/nanopi-neolts.jpg" alt="NanoPi NEOLTS" title="NanoPi NEOLTS"></a></p>
<p>We need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the latest GENERICSD card image snapshot</li>
<li>Install the correct boot loader pkg</li>
<li>Create a memory disk</li>
<li>Copy the GENERICSD image to memory disk</li>
<li>Copy the bootloader to the memory disk</li>
<li>Mount the root partition of the sd card image</li>
<li>Copy the programs and files we need for the tutorial to the sd card</li>
</ul>
<p>The latest image is as I write is 13 CURRENT from 20190829:</p>
<pre><code>$ fetch ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/snapshots/arm/armv7/ISO-IMAGES/13.0/FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-arm-armv7-GENERICSD-20190829-r351591.img.xz
</code></pre><p>We have to decompress the image before we can use it</p>
<pre><code>$ xz -d FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-arm-armv7-GENERICSD-20190829-r351591.img.xz
</code></pre><p>Each u-boot bootloader platform has its own package, currently there are 46
different bootloaders in the FreeBSD ports system. We want the u-boot for the
nanopi_neo (our target).</p>
<pre><code>$ pkg search nanopi     
u-boot-nanopi-neo2-2019.07     Cross-build das u-boot for model nanopi-neo2
u-boot-nanopi_a64-2019.07      Cross-build das u-boot for model nanopi_a64
u-boot-nanopi_m1plus-2019.07   Cross-build das u-boot for model nanopi_m1plus
u-boot-nanopi_neo-2019.07      Cross-build das u-boot for model nanopi_neo
u-boot-nanopi_neo_air-2019.07  Cross-build das u-boot for model nanopi_neo_air

# pkg install u-boot-nanopi_neo-2019.07
</code></pre><p>The <code>u-boot-nanopi_neo</code> package contains the binary bootloader we need in
<code>u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin</code></p>
<pre><code>$ pkg info -l u-boot-nanopi_neo-2019.07

u-boot-nanopi_neo-2019.07:
    /usr/local/share/licenses/u-boot-nanopi_neo-2019.07/GPLv2
    /usr/local/share/licenses/u-boot-nanopi_neo-2019.07/LICENSE
    /usr/local/share/licenses/u-boot-nanopi_neo-2019.07/catalog.mk
    /usr/local/share/u-boot/u-boot-nanopi_neo/README
    /usr/local/share/u-boot/u-boot-nanopi_neo/boot.scr
    /usr/local/share/u-boot/u-boot-nanopi_neo/metadata
    /usr/local/share/u-boot/u-boot-nanopi_neo/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin
</code></pre><p>With the GENERICSD image and the bootloader we need to create the memory disk
image we will use for staging. First we need to create a large enough backing
file.</p>
<pre><code>$ truncate -s 8G nanopi.img
# mdconfig -f nanopi.img
md0
</code></pre><p>Now we can <code>dd</code> the GENERICSD image to the memory disk</p>
<pre><code># dd if=FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-arm-armv7-GENERICSD-20190829-r351591.img of=/dev/md0 bs=1m
</code></pre><p>We need to <code>dd</code> the bootloader to the start of the SD card, i.e. the entire
device and not a partition.</p>
<pre><code># dd if=/usr/local/share/u-boot/u-boot-nanopi_neo/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=/dev/da0 bs=1k seek=8 conv=sync
</code></pre><p>With the memory disk attached we can interact with the image file as if it were
a real USB drive or SD card. </p>
<pre><code>$ gpart show md0
=&gt;      63  16777153  md0  MBR  (8.0G)
        63      2016       - free -  (1.0M)
      2079    102312    1  fat32lba  [active]  (50M)
    104391   6187041    2  freebsd  (3.0G)
   6291432  10485784       - free -  (5.0G)
</code></pre><p>We can mount the root partition of the SD card and modify or add any files we
wish:</p>
<pre><code># mount /dev/md0sa mnt
</code></pre><p>When we are done changing things we have to disconnect the memory disk:</p>
<pre><code># sudo mdconfig -d -u md0
</code></pre><p>Finally we can copy the memory disk to a real sd card using <code>dd</code>:</p>
<pre><code># sudo dd if=nanopi.img of=/dev/da0 bs=1m
</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>I like open source. I use open source software when it’s appropriate. I write open source software, at that, and I’m happy to do so. (To wit: PortalWizard, LogN, Opensymphony components, RSSLibJ, as well as others.) That said, I really,&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;dislike the&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061113044900/http://www.gnu.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>. When I have a choice between their offerings and someone else’s, I nearly always go with the alternatives. I don’t use their licenses. I don’t defend them, or even their goals, really. In many ways, I’m actively antagonistic.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It’s pretty simple. I thought the FSF rocked until I had to deal with them directly, and the repercussions of that interaction made me reconsider all my assumptions.</p>
<h2>Starting Down the Slippery Slope</h2>
<p>I was working as a consultant for IBM in 1997, on their ProductManager suite. ProductManager needed a little language, for which I designed a grammar and lexer. When you need a compiler compiler and a lexer, you look at packages in the&nbsp;<code>yacc</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>lex</code>&nbsp;family… and the best of those, for C, remain the FSF’s&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061113044900/http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/bison.html"><code>bison</code></a>&nbsp;and Vern Paxson’s&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061113044900/http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/flex.html"><code>flex</code></a>. Not only was I trying to do well for IBM, but I was also aiming at using the best products available.</p>
<p>IBM, understandably, wanted to cover its pockets in the case of liability, so they had me talk to the respective authors to make sure that their code was actually theirs to give away. The reasoning was, as I understand it, that if (say)&nbsp;<code>flex</code>&nbsp;incorporated some copyrighted Microsoft code, and Microsoft discovered that IBM was using that code, Microsoft could sue both the author of&nbsp;<code>flex</code>&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;IBM. However, if IBM had a signed affadavit from the respective authors that asserted their right to distribute code, then IBM would have done due diligence to protect itself and other companies from illegal activity. It wouldn’t have been a full defense, but would be enough to mitigate most damage in court. (The realisation that IBM didn’t expect due diligence to be a complete shield was a blow to my faith in civil courts, too, even though that faith was pretty weak to begin with.)</p>
<p>So I wrote Vern Paxson and the FSF (because Richard Stallman was listed as the author of&nbsp;<code>bison</code>, which surprised me.) Vern got back with me after a few hours, and said he’d be happy to sign a form for us. When I talked to him on the phone and explained the exact situation, he reversed his position, saying that he simply couldn’t honestly say that&nbsp;<code>flex</code>&nbsp;had no copyrighted code in it. He didn’t think it did, but he wasn’t able to get such an assertion from each author.</p>
<p>That eliminated&nbsp;<code>flex</code>&nbsp;for our project. I didn’t mind, for a few reasons: one was that lexers are fairly trivial, and we could replace lex with something feature-comparable; another reason was that Vern was very straightforward about the situation. I got the feeling that he actually considered the needs of his potential userbase.</p>
<p>A few hours after Vern’s initial reply came back, the FSF responded, too. (I was genuinely surprised at how rapid both responses were made.) They said that Richard Stallman was, indeed, the author of&nbsp;<code>bison</code>, and soon we managed to strike up a dialog with him directly.</p>
<p>Eventually, we were in a conference call with him. I was a little awed, considering that I’d been using some of RMS’s tools (like Emacs) for quite some time even then. Basically, we had in mind a sort of&nbsp;<em>quid pro quo</em>, in that we wanted an affadavit signed and he wanted a monetary grant. It was also a chance for the FSF to score points in the courts, since the GPL hadn’t been challenged. Our reasoning was that if IBM was using the code, and was challenged, then the FSF would be piggybacking a defense of the LGPL from IBM’s defense team.</p>
<p>RMS would have none of it. What we were asking for, to be clear, was an assertion that the FSF had the right to apply their license to the software they made available. A denial of that assertion undermines their whole reason for being, after all, and we were certainly going to recompense the FSF for making good software available. Instead, RMS refused outright to sign the affadavit, and suggested quite bluntly that ProductManager (which costed IBM millions to develop, and was a pretty vertical product) should be open source, and we could send a check to him at this address, etc.</p>
<p>I was&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;impressed. It wasn’t so much the open source spiel that bothered me, but the refusal of the assertion. If it was&nbsp;<em>my</em>&nbsp;code, I’d have been happy to say it was mine, as long as I knew (a la Vern Paxson’s response). RMS, however, didn’t even entertain the thought from the impression he gave us. Instead, he came across as a complete hypocrite, an impression confirmed with further investigation of the FSF’s policies and approach. He was effectively implying that he’d stolen the code, and released it as open source just to further his personal views on software source code availability.</p>
<h2>The Air Over There</h2>
<p>I think the FSF is on crack. They want software to be open-sourced, as a statement of ethics, and yet they advocate strong-arming companies in order to get what they want. They don’t want the code, even – they just want all code to be open source, and they’re willing to act like brown-shirts to do it.</p>
<p>If you go to their&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061113044900/http://www.gnu.org/">home page</a>, for example, you see this announcement at the end of the first paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>Variants of the GNU operating system, which use the kernel Linux, are now widely used; though these systems are often referred to as `Linux”, they are more accurately called GNU/Linux systems.</p></blockquote>
<p>The opening sentence for the paragraph is “Welcome to the GNU Project web server.”</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Not only is the sentence about Linux inappropriate for the paragraph’s subject matter, it’s retarded. Their&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061113044900/http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html">justification</a>&nbsp;is something like this: “Linux is just the kernel, and GNU provides the rest of the system that makes the kernel useful, so the name should be GNU/Linux instead of just Linux.”</p>
<p>That’s idiotic. For one thing, they’re targeting Linux in this, for reasons of publicity only. (Yes, that’s right, I just said the FSF was a bunch of publicity whores.) If they were going to be fair about this, they’d apply that reasoning to a lot of software: “GNU/Cygwin,” et cetera. To my knowledge, they don’t do this. For another, they presume that GNU is central to Linux… and it’s not. I know of developers who’ve created Linux distributions with BSD tools instead of GNU, for example, and the mere fact that it’s doable suggests that maybe GNU isn’t as critical to Linux as the FSF seems to suggest. Sure, maybe Linus used GNU tools to generate the kernel. Does that mean that every Visual Basic app needs to trumpet “MS/Whatever” as part of its name, too?</p>
<p>It gets worse. The FSF not only demands recognition (which, by the way, it got plenty of already), but it actively supports piracy, offering&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061113044900/http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Piracy">this newspeak</a>&nbsp;as a replacement. “Use neutral terms to describe piracy,” they suggest, offering “unauthorized copying” as well as “sharing information with your neighbor.” Pardon me, fellows, for actually setting the price I want as recompense for my effort. The freedoms the FSF supposedly tries to work for include the rights to say “No, I wrote this with my blood, sweat, and tears, I want $100 for it or you don’t have to use it.”</p>
<p>And that brings up another annoyance with the FSF – the&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061113044900/http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL">GPL</a>. The GPL is a viral license, requiring programs that use GPLed code to be under the GPL themselves. In a way, that makes sense, although most other similar licenses are less militaristic;most of them respect the right of authors to keep their code proprietary, usually requesting links to the source of licensed software. The GPL, on the other hand, says that it’s&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;open, and they choose licenses accordingly.</p>
<p>To wit, they have a “Lesser GPL,” the&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061113044900/http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#LGPL">LGPL</a>, which doesn’t have the same viral effect that the GPL does. The FSF has a document, called&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061113044900/http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html">Why you shouldn’t use the Library GPL for your next library</a>&nbsp;(written before the LGPL was renamed to “Lesser GPL”), which explains that the LGPL is used where there’s no real reason to rely on the GNU offering. In other words, all the truly useful stuff they have (and there’s a good bit of it) is basically bait for the GPL; “use GetOpt, and&nbsp;<em><strong>we have you!</strong></em>”</p>
<p>That’s cowardly, in my opinion, arguing from a position of weakness.</p>
<p>And that’s the FSF for you.</p>

This idea took root and, over the years, we've gradually started tackling the surrounding challenges, such as:</p><ul><li><p>a fast and reliable build system much needed in front-end development, </p></li><li><p>various JS interop features that spawned an ecosystem of well typed libraries,</p></li><li><p>a production-ready standard library,</p></li><li><p>and recently, a fresh, solid syntax.</p></li></ul><p>These developments have attracted many people into our community. But one bigger challenge persisted: newcomers dropped out at the sheer amount of extra incongruent tools and learning overhead from having to understand OCaml concepts, Reason concepts, and BuckleScript's own concepts. Take, for example, what's required to make a ReasonReact app:</p><ul><li><p>Knowledge of React.</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of JS.</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of ReasonReact's specific idioms (that we've tried hard to keep to a minimum).</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of OCaml idioms, on top of which BuckleScript is built.</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of BuckleScript's JS interop and the build system.</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of the Reason syntax.</p></li></ul><p>Ironically, the more documentation we pile up, the more mental overhead newcomers suffered. During the various BuckleScript &amp; Reason meetups, we've frequently seen folks' enthusiasm crushed at the sheer prospect of making a web app while keeping 5+ tabs' worth of documentations open. This was discouraging, both for said eager developers and for us maintainers. </p><p>The adoption barrier is real, and it's about time we finally solve it.</p><p>Today, we'll start to truly unify the various BuckleScript-related projects under a single name: ReScript. This includes:</p><ul><li><p>The compiler, the build system and the syntax unified and shipping under a single install. Likewise for future efforts such as editor plugin.</p></li><li><p>A single documentation site which covers the above: <a href="https://rescript-lang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">rescript-lang.org</a>.</p></li><li><p>Streamlined communication through said website, a <a href="https://forum.rescript-lang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">new dedicated forum</a> and a new <a href="http://twitter.com/rescriptlang" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter account</a>.</p></li><li><p>The renaming of various tools, always in a backward-compatible way.</p></li></ul><p>In short, all JS-related tools are now called ReScript. Previously, due to the messy situation, most real-world BuckleScript adoption came from a few heroic community members suffering through the technical and social risk of spreading our tech to their coworkers. From today onward, you can simply tell to your coworkers: "this is ReScript", and point to them a clear starting point instead of sending them to various incompatible sources, with a risk of losing goodwill and credibility.</p><p>It's worth emphasizing that while this rebranding seems to be very disruptive, in reality it's mostly a bunch of name changes for the same tech. To reiterate our stance on existing userland code:</p><ul><li><p>Please read our <a href="https://reasonml.org/blog/a-note-on-bucklescripts-future-commitments" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous post</a> on backward compatibility with pure OCaml &amp; Reason syntax.</p></li><li><p>The current Reason website will keep existing, with proper redirects to our new one when relevant. Existing Reason-to-JS users' code keep working, as per above post. Reason itself will continue tackling the parts BuckleScript didn't tackle before, such as native.</p></li><li><p>The various BuckleScript binaries will keep working. Instead of renaming those, we'd create new binaries instead.</p></li><li><p>The BuckleScript docs will redirect to the new site without breaking links.</p></li></ul><p>Thank you for your support and keep shipping. A brighter future awaits us!</p><p>Stay safe,</p><p>The ReScript team (Bob, Cheng, Cristiano, Maxim, Patrick, Ricky).</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>This guide covers timeless ideas that are helpful to keep in mind while working with
systems where performance matters. Many of these ideas are fairly “durable”
and will apply regardless of what hardware, programming language, operating
system, or decade you are working in.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for follow-up articles that will drill into hardware and
more Rust-specific techniques.</p>

<p>Skip to the <a href="#contents">table of contents</a> if you don’t like intros.</p>

<p>There’s some foul language in here. Enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="executive-summary">executive summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>make it work, then make it pretty, then make it fast</li>
  <li>only do things that are necessary for correctness and safety</li>
  <li>your engineers will burn out, leave your team, and relentlessly shit talk you
if they don’t make their code pretty and low-friction to work with</li>
  <li>align all latency-throughput queuing positions for everything in the
serial dependency graph, or you will get worst-of-all-worlds
latency-throughput behavior, increasing latency and lowering throughput</li>
  <li>if something necessary can be done in the background without blocking,
queue it up for eventual batch processing to improve cache performance</li>
  <li>look at allocation lifetime using DHAT, avoid short-lived allocations
and ensure that long-lived allocations employ time-space trade-offs
that consume plentiful resources instead of scarce ones where possible</li>
  <li>seriously, it’s always your fault if your engineers quit.</li>
  <li>performance happens naturally when engineers love the codebase and they
are aware of which parts of the system can be sped up</li>
  <li>before wasting time optimizing things that don’t matter, we can easily test
whether optimizing could be useful at all by adding delays or deleting
relevant code to see what the impact of infinite optimization would be</li>
  <li>by default your machine will randomly change your cpu frequency, yank
processes across cores and sockets, and generally make measurements
deceptive and non-reproducible. we can control this behavior. if you
don’t account for this behavior, your measurements are not sound justifications
for code changes</li>
  <li>wait, why does an executive care about performance, anyway?</li>

<p>Ok, now that the executives are gone, it is time to party.</p>

<p>Let’s put on some nice music.</p>

<p>Take a deep breath.</p>

<p>Let it out.</p>

<p>The year is 2020. and we are utterly fucked.</p>

<p>Supposedly we are here reading this article because we “like computers” or
something but let’s be clear about one thing - you’re not here because of that.
I know. You know. We all know. You couldn’t give two fried pennies about
computers if they didn’t help you feel the things you so desperately need to
feel.</p>

<p>You’re here, ultimately, because of control. Your entire life is entombed
in an elaborate, entirely abstract labyrinth of machines that define so
many aspects of every moment of your waking life. You’re here to better
understand the prison you find yourself within. You’re here to sympathize
with the machine.</p>

<p>While you will only seep ever more deeply into this morass of gold and glass,
you have the power to turn your captors into familiar friends. You have the
power to make the machines into the only friends you will ever need. You are
here to abandon the organic and the analogue. There is nothing for you on the
other side of your window. As you lounge (please fix your posture now) in your
designated quarantine pit, gazing listlessly into the LED mesh while biding
your time, I invite you to join me - your newest simulated human experience -
on a once-in-a-lifetime adventure into the bowels of the machine through which
you experience joy and place orders for more toilet paper.</p>

<p>It begins today.</p>

<p><img src="http://sled.rs/art/sunrise.jpg" alt="warm sun rising over the water with a boat and mountains in the background"></p>

<p>This guide contains basic information for getting started with
performance-sensitive engineering. I think most folks will learn something new.
I know I have. And, part of why I wrote this is to have a single place with a
memorable URL where I can return to when I forget most of this stuff. More
importantly, when I unfurl fiery screeds in random internet comments I want to
have an intimidating reference to which I can mercilesly link.</p>

<p>I initially wrote this guide for the Rust ecosystem, where many people are now
trying their hands at optimization for the first time. But nearly all of this document
applies to general programming, with a few of the hardware effects mentioned
being specific to x86 and ARM circa 2020. Linux is assumed, because that’s
what the overwhelming majority of server workloads run today.</p>

<p>This guide brings together ideas from systems engineering, systems theory,
psychology, hardware, queuing theory, statistics, economics,
distributed systems, concurrency and philosophy of science with the goals of
helping you to be less of an asshole and write code that tends to improve
the metrics you care about.</p>

<p>Performance is about being thoughtful about the metrics that matter to us and
allowing ourselves to be aware of them while making decisions.</p>

<p>These materials are based on Tyler Neely’s Rust workshop content, and have been

<h2 id="principles">principles</h2>

<div><div><pre><code>You are not a Bayesian homunculus whose
reasoning is “corrupted” by cognitive biases.

You just are cognitive biases.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Rationality-An-Introduction">- Luke Muehlhauser, via R:AZ</a>.</p>

<p>The first thing to consider is that our minds are pure shit and everything we
know is wrong. We must accept our fallibility before embarking down the path to
fast-as-fuck machinery.</p>

<p>We build towers of assumptions that are bound to specific contexts, and when the
conditions that caused us to form these beliefs change, we tend not to revisit
the now-invalidated beliefs. Cache invalidation is hard when we are so rarely
aware of the dependency graphs of what we believe.</p>

<p>So, we measure. Even when we’re convinced that we’re right. Because we are
always out of sync with reality, and we are fundamentally incapable of altering
this fact. But we can be responsible in the face of that.</p>

<p>Corollary: allow yourself to be wrong. Allowing yourself to be wrong with
yourself, your collaborators, and in public is a key optimization for learning
faster and building better things with less effort and in less time.</p>

<p>Luckily for us, machines tend to be somewhat amenable to measurement. We built
them that way. Indeed, constructing them to be somewhat measurable in the first
place was the only way we were able to assemble them at all despite our
innumerable shortcomings. We took the predecessor to your current machine,
chose some metrics to improve, made a huge number of mistakes while continuing
to measure, and occasionally we got lucky: the metrics we cared about improved
enough to alter production lines, crystallizing our occasionally successful
results into new production processes that eventually put your machine in front
of you.</p>

<p>We must measure.</p>

<p>The only thing that matters is that real programs on real hardware see real
improvements in relevant metrics like total cost of ownership, responsiveness,
etc… If a metric doesn’t help a human, it’s just a vanity pursuit that may
make the important metrics worse due to under-investment.</p>

<p>We must select our measurements with care. Our time is precious.</p>

<p>By making decisions that are considerate of available data, we are able to cut
through so much bullshit. We have so many ideas that our experience tells us
should cause our code to improve, but it simply isn’t true when we actually
measure. Code changes that made your Java, C++, Haskell or JS programs faster
may not make Rust any faster. Don’t make Rust code ugly just because some
program you wrote in the 90s worked better with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device">manual loop
unrolling</a>. Compilers change,
in many ways for the better.</p>

<p>Don’t be macho. Make decisions while having real data on-hand and limit the
damage of hubris.</p>

<h2 id="e-prime-and-precise-language">e-prime and precise language</h2>

<p>So many aspects of performance-critical engineering can be highly contextual
and may vary wildly from one machine to another. It helps to avoid the verb
“to be” and its conjugations “is”, “are” etc… when describing observations.</p>

<p>When we say something “is” something else, we are casually equating two
similar things for convenience purposes, and we are lying to some extent.
By avoiding false equivalences (usually easily spotted through use of “is”, “are” etc…)
we can both communicate more precisely and we can allow ourselves to reason
about complexity far more effectively. Situations that may seem completely
ambiguous when described using “to be” phrases are often quite unambiguous
when taking care to avoid false equivalences. This general form of speech
is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime">E-Prime</a>.</p>

<p>Don’t say “lock-free queues are faster than mutex-backed queues”, say “on
hardware H with T threads running in tight loops performing operations O, our
specific lock-free queue has been measured to achieve a latency distribution of
X1 and our specicific mutex-backed queue has been measured to achieve a latency
distribution of X2.” It’s likely your lock-free queue will sometimes perform
worse than a well-made mutex-backed queue given certain hardware, contention
and many other factors. What does “perform worse” even …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>After so lengthy underneath lockdown, what higher lunch companion than the “happiest man on this planet”? Matthieu Ricard pops up on my iPhone display screen, immediately recognisable by his heat smile and darkish purple and orange monastic robes.</p>
<p>The 74-year-old biologist-turned-Buddhist, the French interpreter to the Dalai Lama, gained the epithet — which, by the way in which, he thinks absurd — within the 2000s, after collaborating in a 12-year research on the long-term impression of meditation. By means of a long time of coaching, he was discovered to have considerably altered the construction of his mind. The outcomes despatched digital camera crews dashing to the Himalayas to find his secret (spoiler alert: there isn’t one — it’s a lifetime of arduous work). And it later led the media to christen him “the world’s happiest man”.</p>
<p>Ricard is the best visitor for these anxious occasions. He has an intimate know­ledge of solitude, having spent a complete of 5 years of his life in contemplative retreat. He’s the primary to confess that “confinement, in fact, for me it’s an exquisite factor”. His recommendation for the remainder of us? “Make peace with your individual thoughts . . . after which the time won’t really feel so heavy and so troublesome.”</p>
<p>In a nod to Ricard’s stints in retreat, I’ve come to a distant sanctuary of my very own: a small hut within the hills close to my dwelling in south-west Scotland. It’s roughly the identical measurement because the three-metre-square refuge in Nepal the place he spends months on finish.</p>
<p>We start with a digital tour of our respective environment. “I at all times needed to go to Scotland to take pictures,” says Ricard, who has travelled to the likes of Patagonia, Iceland and Yukon in north-west Canada to {photograph} their wild landscapes, together with his photographs praised by Cartier-Bresson.</p>
<p>Ricard eyes the little hut the place I’ve laid a small wood desk for lunch. “It appears like a hermitage,” he says approvingly. A cuckoo calls within the distance; nearer by is the sound of bleating lambs on the hillside.</p>
<p>“If this had been final week, I might have proven you the whole Himalayan mountain vary with 4 8,000-metre peaks,” he provides. “However now it’s largely French forest, which is gorgeous, however doesn’t have the identical dimensions.”</p>
<p>A couple of week earlier than our encounter in early Could, Ricard left the Shechen Tennyi Dargyeling Monastery in Nepal on the final flight in another country organised by the French embassy there. He returned to Dordogne in south-west France to be together with his 97-year-old mom. Now he’s sitting on her balcony, avoiding coming into the home throughout a 14-day quarantine interval. I catch a glimpse of her inside. “Hiya&nbsp;<em>maman</em>,” Ricard waves. “<em>Maman, on t’a dit bonjour de l’Écosse</em>.”</p>

<p>Lunch doesn’t usually characteristic prominently in my companion’s routine. His late father wrote an anthology of gastronomy (<em>Tradition and Delicacies: a Journey By means of the Historical past of Meals</em>), however, says Ricard, “I’m completely the other. I don’t bear in mind 10 minutes later what I ate. I’m actually not .”</p>
<p>I attain for my flask and pour a mug of steaming leek and potato soup. Ricard is vegetarian — “I don’t need to dwell on the struggling and the dying of different animals” — and he has in entrance of him a easy salad starter of lettuce, grated carrot and corn blinis.</p>
<p>What does Ricard make of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ft.com/coronavirus" data-trackable="link" rel="noopener noreferrer">coronavirus</a> and the worldwide confinements to halt its unfold? “I feel we must be very humble,” he says. “There are individuals who have large difficulties, monetary difficulties, well being difficulties, household difficulties. It will be pretentious to say something about that as a result of they’re going through unimaginable hardship.” But “there’s a entire class of people who find themselves doing fairly OK materially” however who’re nonetheless disoriented. A submicroscopic speck has overthrown us, “shattering an phantasm that fashionable man has constructed up.”</p>
<p>The notion that we will management exterior situations is mistaken, he explains, gesticulating with a corn blini on his fork for emphasis. “We now have this very boastful concept that we have now extracted ourselves from nature. We’re masters of the universe, we will ship folks to the Moon, we will manipulate genes. Plainly we’re invincible.”</p>
<p>He’s horrified, too, by the thought of transhumanism, and its adherents’ quest to delay dramatically the human lifespan. “Think about Donald Trump being elected for the 50th time or Lionel Messi scoring his 50,000th aim. How boring!” I chortle in settlement. He goes on: “I imply, I really like my hermitage, however a thousand years? As my mom likes to say, eternity is terribly lengthy, particularly close to the tip.”</p>

<p><strong>Ricard’s path to Tibetan Buddhism</strong> started removed from the Himalayas, in Savoie, south-eastern France. He grew up in and close to Paris, raised agnostic by dad and mom who had been on the centre of French mental life. His father, Jean-François Revel, was a political commentator who turned well-known for his challenges to each communism and Christianity; his mom, Yahne le Toumelin, is an abstractionist painter.</p>
<p>By means of his dad and mom’ circles, Ricard’s upbringing was spent socialising with a few of the nice artists of the day: André Breton, the daddy of Surrealism, Russian composer Igor Stravinsky, and Spanish film-maker Luis Buñuel, to call however a couple of. “I used to be extra fascinated about watching birds and taking part in music and soccer, however I used to be there at dinner so I noticed them, and listened roughly to their dialogue,” Ricard remembers.</p>

<p>He struggled to search out the position mannequin he was in search of. “I realised later, after I tried to determine why, that there was no correlation between their specific abilities or genius and being a superb human being.” He offers an excessive instance: one among his father’s greatest associates was the French Marxist thinker Louis Althusser. “He turned loopy and killed his spouse.”</p>
<p>Ricard was 20 when he watched a documentary about Tibetan Buddhist masters and “noticed that there have been 20 St Francis of Assisi, 20 Socrates who had been alive immediately.” He travelled to Darjeeling, within the Himalayan foothills, the place his conversion to Tibetan Buddhism started. Ricard credit his mom with instilling in him an curiosity in “spirituality at giant” throughout his childhood. In return he urged her to go to India to expertise “a residing custom . . . not simply in books.” She adopted his recommendation and, remarkably, additionally deserted French bohemia and have become a Tibetan Buddhist nun.</p>
<p>Whereas Ricard accomplished a PhD in cell genetics on the Pasteur Institute in Paris, every summer season he would return to the mountains. As quickly as he completed his doctorate within the early 1970s, he moved to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It was by means of one among his academics that Ricard first met the Dalai Lama, the non secular chief of the Tibetan folks. After a number of years of figuring out one another, the Dalai Lama requested Ricard — who’s fluent in French, English and Tibetan — to grow to be his French interpreter. “It was fantastic as a result of it’s so wonderful to be with him intimately. The principle factor is that the Dalai Lama is strictly the identical with a head of state and with the woman who cleans the lodge,” says Ricard.</p>
<p>He remembers accompanying him to satisfy the late French president François Mitterrand on the Elysée Palace. “Usually, after the assembly, you get within the automotive and the president says goodbye and also you go. However the Dalai Lama went throughout the courtyard to shake palms with the guards, faucet them on the shoulder, chortle with them. Mitterrand didn’t know whether or not to remain or return in.” The Dalai Lama lives in India, in everlasting exile from Tibet. Ricard gained’t be drawn on Tibet’s relations with China, saying solely: “I actually hope I can return to Tibet earlier than I die.”</p>
<p>By now we have now moved on from our starters. My companion is having fun with a plate of seitan, a vegan meat substitute that’s made out of hydrated gluten. In step with Ricard’s ordinary regime, I’ve additionally ready a easy, vegan major course: a salad of lettuce, tomato and grated carrot, with do-it-yourself hummus.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>It wasn’t till 1997</strong> that Ricard turned a family title in France, when he co-authored a e-book together with his father,&nbsp;<em>The Monk and the Thinker: A Father and Son Talk about the That means of Life</em>. It was framed as an east-meets-west dialogue on the preoccupations which might be as outdated as humankind: the which means of life, consciousness, freedom and struggling.</p>
<p>On the time, Revel was a widely known French thinker and journalist, however his son was a relative unknown. The e-book turned a bestseller in Europe and was translated into 23 languages. “That was an enormous change,” he says. “It was both the start of my hassle, or the start of a chance, I don’t know.</p>
<p>“It exhibits you the way fully synthetic movie star may be as a result of no person is aware of something about you after which abruptly inside weeks they cease you on the street. I’m simple to recognise as a result of I’m like a strolling flag with this monk gown.”</p>

<p>As we end our starters, we flip to the theme with which he’s maybe most synonymous: happiness. His 2004 TED speak “The habits of happiness” has been considered greater than 9m occasions. In it, he makes the excellence between happiness as one thing that may be learnt and cultivated, and pleasure, which is anchored in time and place, and exhausts itself as you expertise it.</p>
<p>“There’s a tendency immediately to search for hedonic happiness,” he tells me, pointing to obsessions with standing, wealth and picture; and the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>I come from a musical background, with <a href="https://helen.blog/music/" data-type="page" data-id="2033">degrees in piano performance and piano accompanying and chamber music</a>, and I think a lot about how that’s shaped who I’ve become in web and software development. I’ve even gotten to give <a href="https://wordpress.tv/2016/06/30/helen-hou-sandi-code-is-poetry-musicians-tale/">a talk relating musicianship skills to programming and open source management in a concert hall in Vienna that included a piano performance</a>. For this blog post I want to talk about another particular aspect of the classical music world: masterclasses.</p>



<p>Masterclasses are not unique to classical music, but they do form a central and critical component of music study. <strong>A masterclass is a format in which musicians perform a work for an established artist and the artist then gives them feedback rather like a lesson, except that all of this happens in front of an audience.</strong> You might also hear about “studio class” in music school settings, which are similar except that it is not an open audience but instead one made up of your peers who share the same primary professor. For big artists coming to a school or a region, you might have to audition (compete) for a spot to be criticized publicly on your performance. Put that way, it might not sound very appealing, but it is foundational in how to function and succeed as a musician and really in any profession, including as a part of a software team, which is what I do today.</p>



<h2>Managing feedback in group settings</h2>



<p>The first experience in managing professional feedback is typically how you receive it. Sometimes you might not immediately agree with what you’re being asked to do, and that’s okay. What’s important is to respect the time and effort of the person giving you the feedback and show them that you understand it, even if after synthesizing that information you decide it’s not the direction you want to go. In music, that means acknowledging what you’ve heard by demonstrating the requested change on the spot. This might be a specific request, like “play this section softer”, or something that requires more interpretation, like “don’t lose momentum by getting stuck before the high point of this phrase”. This kind of flexibility is itself a skill, and one that is of high value.</p>



<p>In software, your feedback sessions might not involve direct and immediate action in the same way, but it can be very helpful to show that you understand a concept. For instance, you might say “I hear you, and I need to think about it some more; I’ll start by trying out a different way of structuring this file”. Do be careful not to just repeat back verbatim all the time or come across as explaining back in a condescending way.</p>



<p>As you progress through your career, you will likely find yourself in the position of also <em>giving</em> feedback in a group setting. For many people who are just beginning this part of the journey, this can be quite intimidating because you have not previously had experience in doing this. You also may have had bad experiences in the past with feedback that was not delivered in a constructive way. This is where an early culture of group feedback comes in so handy, notably in the studio class setting: professors are asking your peers to also learn how to process, structure, and deliver feedback in real time. You hear from your professor every week; this is an opportunity for students to deliver a polished performance, receive feedback, and give feedback all at once.</p>



<p>That said, peer groups can also be intimidating. This is not unlike having to give a talk or demo some code in front of your coworkers – it can feel like more pressure than a large room of strangers because these are people whose opinions you are exposed to on a near-daily basis and hopefully care about. Remember that we are all learning all the time, and your peers may also need to work on their delivery! Some strategies you may have encountered are to use “yes, and” instead of “but”, or to begin feedback with related praise.</p>



<p>I highly recommend that teams actively solicit peer feedback at various stages throughout a project and also workshop methods of requesting and giving feedback, something that can be facilitated by an engineering manager. An EM might even want to structure some team meetings much like a studio class, where people present on something they’re working on so that not only do they have a chance to share about something they might not otherwise get to talk about, but the team also has a mechanism built-in for giving and receiving feedback. Soliciting feedback is also a skill in its own right – a culture of regular and expected feedback goes a long way toward building that in all levels of team members.</p>



<h2>Arriving prepared</h2>



<p>Another major difference between masterclasses and lessons is that you are expected to present a polished product at a masterclass, whereas lessons are to workshop that polish. In a masterclass setting, you and any collaborators enter the stage, bow, and perform to applause before proceeding with the feedback from the masterclass artist. Some professors, especially at the conservatory level, also require performance attire when performing in studio class (though perhaps not black tie).</p>



<p>Working on a software team typically does not involve building something in a vacuum until you’re ready to release it to the world – you hopefully have team checkpoints that are more equivalent to music lessons. But there is a lot to be said for knowing that even though you’re ready to share your work publicly and have met your deadline, there’s still more that can be done, rather like a software beta. And even for something you’ve been performing for a long time, a fresh perspective can change not only how you’re approaching that piece, but how you think about your craft in general. Always be prepared to show your best and recognize that true mastery is in knowing that there’s always another level to reach for.</p>



<h2>Cross-discipline knowledge</h2>



<p>While masterclasses are typically with an individual artist who specializes in an instrument, many works involve other musicians, such as a string quartet or a piano trio. These are things that are worth bringing to masterclasses too! Related, it’s also valuable to have lessons from people who might normally be considered outside of your discipline – one of the best lessons I’ve ever had was with a jazz professor who spent 2 hours pushing me to express myself more and more.</p>



<p>Not only do your collaborators need to be equally prepared, you need to work together to really achieve artistry. All too often you will see lower-level instrumental masterclasses where the pianist is an afterthought, plunking their way dutifully through concerto reductions, and it shows. Sometimes the masterclass artist will also dutifully ignore them, but more often they have to involve all collaborators in their feedback. No amount of telling a vocalist to evoke the dreamy sparkling of Debussy’s <em>Nuit d’Etoiles</em> is going to work if the pianist is heavy-handed on those rolled chords, or vice versa. (This is also why collaborative pianists have to study lyric diction and multiple languages and can specialize in vocal coaching, but I digress.)</p>



<p>Not only does feedback need to be inclusive of a group while also targeted to each individual, it needs to be clearly contextualized. In music, that means including music history and theory as well – the performance practices of the era, specific notational quirks of the composer, what harmonies are and how do they drive the piece, and limitations of instruments and how they interact together. So when giving feedback to a software team, be sure to continually frame things within broader feature or product goals, and tie the various disciplines together to create that cohesive whole.</p>



<p>In both giving and receiving that style of feedback, you will find that you need to have some amount of understanding of disciplines outside of your own. That doesn’t mean that you need to be an expert; in fact, you will probably be received poorly if you try to instruct somebody on how specifically to accomplish something you don’t normally work on. Instead, much like framing within broader goals, think about how you might inspire somebody to look at something a different way, or contextualize within your own discipline so that they can understand you better as well.</p>



<h2>Bonus: watch a masterclass!</h2>



<p>Here’s a 45 minute masterclass session with Benjamin Zander, the music director/conductor of the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra and the Boston Philharmonic Youth Orchestra, and Amanda Chi, the cello section lead of the youth orchestra. I promise you don’t need to be a musician to get something out of this – at one point, Maestro Zander acknowledges non-musicians in the audience and gives them a brief explanation of what he means by the direction and pull of harmonies. But even outside of that, you’ll see some real mastery of not only the musical material from both parties, but also how to address both audience and performer, contextualize the feedback, and deliver that feedback in a constructive and suggestive way rather than making it into a personal demand. I also really enjoy what he talks about at the end, differentiating between what you need to do as a performer of this solo piece versus what you need to do as the leader of your group.</p>

<p>We spent the whole <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-06-21-zero-to-production-2-learn-by-building-an-email-newsletter/">Chapter 2</a> defining what we will be building (an email newsletter!), narrowing down a precise set of requirements. It is now time to roll up our sleeves and get started with it.</p>

<p>This chapter will take a first stab at implementing this user story:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a blog visitor,<br>
I want to subscribe to the newsletter,<br>
So that I can receive email updates when new content is published on the blog.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We expect our blog visitors to input their email address in a form embedded on a web page.<br>
The form will trigger an API call to a backend server that will actually process the information, store it and send back a response.<br>
This chapter will focus on that backend server - we will implement the <code>/subscribe</code> POST endpoint.</p>

<h2 id="1-1-our-strategy">1.1. Our Strategy</h2>

<p>We are starting a new project from scratch - there is a fair amount of upfront heavy-lifting we need to take care of:</p>

<ul>
<li>choose a web framework and get familiar with it;<br></li>
<li>define our testing strategy;<br></li>
<li>choose a crate to interact with our database (we will have to save those emails somewhere!);<br></li>
<li>define how we want to manage changes to our database schemas over time (a.k.a. migrations);<br></li>
<li>actually write some queries.</li>
</ul>

<p>That is a lot and jumping in head-first might be overwhelming.<br>
We will add a stepping stone to make the journey more approachable: before tackling <code>/subscribe</code> we will implement a <code>/health_check</code> endpoint. No business logic, but a good opportunity to become friends with our web framework and get an understanding of all its different moving parts.</p>

<p>We will be relying on our Continuous Integration pipeline to keep us in check throughout the process - if you have not set it up yet, have a quick look at <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-06-06-zero-to-production-1-setup-toolchain-ides-ci/">Chapter 1</a> (or grab one of the <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-06-06-zero-to-production-1-setup-toolchain-ides-ci/#5-2-ready-to-go-ci-pipelines">ready-made templates</a>).</p>



<p>What web framework should we use to write our Rust API?<br>
This was supposed to be a section on the pros and cons of the Rust web frameworks currently available. It eventually grew to be so long that it did not make sense to embed it here and I published it as a spin-off article: check out <em><a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-07-04-choosing-a-rust-web-framework-2020-edition/">Choosing a Rust web framework, 2020 edition</a></em> for a deep-dive on <code>actix-web</code>, <code>rocket</code>, <code>tide</code> and <code>warp</code>.</p>

<p><em>TL;DR:</em> as of August 2020, <code>actix-web</code> should be your go-to web framework when it comes to Rust APIs aimed for production usage - it has seen extensive usage in the past couple of years, it has a large and healthy community behind it and it runs on <code>tokio</code>, therefore minimising the likelihood of having to deal with incompatibilities/interop between different async runtimes.<br>
It will thus be our choice for Zero To Production.</p>

<p>Nonetheless <code>tide</code>, <code>rocket</code> and <code>warp</code> have huge potential and we might end up making a different decision in 2021 - if you are following along Zero To Production using a different framework I’d be delighted to have a look at your code! Please shoot me an email at <em>contact@lpalmieri.com</em></p>

<p>Throughout this chapter and beyond I suggest you to keep a couple of extra browser tabs open: <a href="https://actix.rs/"><code>actix-web</code>’s website</a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/"><code>actix-web</code>’s documentation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/actix/examples"><code>actix-web</code>’s examples collection</a>.</p>



<p>Let’s try to get off the ground by implementing a health-check endpoint: when we receive a <code>GET</code> request for <code>/health_check</code> we want to return a <code>200 OK</code> response with no body.</p>

<p>We can use <code>/health_check</code> to verify that the application is up and ready to accept incoming requests.<br>
Combine it with a SaaS service like <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/">pingdom.com</a> and you can be <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/product/alerting/#">alerted</a> when your API goes dark - quite a good baseline for an email newsletter that you are running on the side.</p>

<p>A health-check endpoint can also be handy if you are using a container orchestrator to juggle your application (e.g. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#define-a-liveness-command">Kubernetes</a> or <a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/service#service-parameters">Nomad</a>): the orchestrator can call <code>/health_check</code> to detect if the API has become unresponsive and trigger a restart.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="3-2-1-server-httpserver">3.2.1. Server - <code>HttpServer</code></h3>

<p><a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/struct.HttpServer.html"><code>HttpServer</code></a> is the backbone supporting our application. It takes care of things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>where should the application be listening for incoming requests? A TCP socket (e.g. <code>127.0.0.1:8000</code>)? A Unix domain socket?<br></li>
<li>what is the maximum number of concurrent connections that we should allow? How many new connections per unit of time?<br></li>
<li>should we enable transport level security (TLS)?<br></li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>HttpServer</code>, in other words, handles all <em>transport level</em> concerns.<br>
What happens afterwards? What does <code>HttpServer</code> do when it has established a new connection with a client of our API and we need to start handling their requests?<br>
That is where <code>App</code> comes into play!</p>

<h3 id="3-2-2-application-app">3.2.2. Application - <code>App</code></h3>

<p><a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/struct.App.html"><code>App</code></a> is where all your application logic lives: routing, middlewares, request handlers, etc.<br>
<code>App</code> is the component whose job is to take an incoming request as input and spit out a response.<br>
Let’s zoom in on our code snippet:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>App</span>::<span>new</span>()
    .<span>route</span>(<span>"/"</span>, <span>web</span>::<span>get</span>().<span>to</span>(<span>greet</span>))
    .<span>route</span>(<span>"/{name}"</span>, <span>web</span>::<span>get</span>().<span>to</span>(<span>greet</span>))
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p><code>App</code> is a practical example of the <em>builder pattern</em>: <code>new()</code> gives us a clean slate to which we can add, one bit at a time, new behaviour using a fluent API (i.e. chaining method calls one after the other).<br>
We will cover the majority of <code>App</code>’s API surface on a need-to-know basis over the course of the whole book: by the end of our journey you should have touched most of its methods at least once.</p>

<h3 id="3-2-3-endpoint-route">3.2.3. Endpoint - <code>Route</code></h3>

<p>How do we add a new endpoint to our <code>App</code>?<br>
The <a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/struct.App.html#method.route"><code>route</code></a> method is probably the simplest way to go about doing it - it is used in an <em>Hello World!</em> example after all!</p>

<p><code>route</code> takes two parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>path</code>, a string, possibly templated (e.g. <code>"/{name}"</code>) to accommodate dynamic path segments;<br></li>
<li><code>route</code>, an instance of the <code>Route</code> struct.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/struct.Route.html"><code>Route</code></a> combines a <em>handler</em> with a set of <em>guards</em>.<br>
Guards specify conditions that a request must satisfy in order to “match” and be passed over to the handler. From an implementation standpoint guards are implementors of the <a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/guard/trait.Guard.html"><code>Guard</code></a> trait: <code>Guard::check</code> is where the magic happens.</p>

<p>In our snippet we have</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="rust">.<span>route</span>(<span>"/"</span>, <span>web</span>::<span>get</span>().<span>to</span>(<span>greet</span>))
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p><code>"/"</code> will match all requests without any segment following the base path - i.e. <code>http://localhost:8000/</code>.<br>
<code>web::get()</code> is a short-cut for <code>Route::new().guard(guard::Get())</code> a.k.a. the request should be passed to the handler if and only if its HTTP method is <code>GET</code>.</p>

<p>You can start to picture what happens when a new request comes in: <code>App</code> iterates over all registered endpoints until it finds a matching one (both path template and guards are satisfied) and passes over the request object to the handler.<br>
This is not 100% accurate but it is a good enough mental model for the time being.</p>

<p>What does a handler look like instead? What is its function signature?<br>
We only have one example at the moment, <code>greet</code>:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4

    [...]
}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p><code>greet</code> is an asynchronous function that takes a <code>HttpRequest</code> as input and returns <em>~something~</em> that implements the <a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/trait.Responder.html"><code>Responder</code></a> trait<sup id="fnref:impl-trait-syntax"><a href="#fn:impl-trait-syntax">3</a></sup>.<br>
A type implements the <code>Responder</code> trait if it can be converted (asynchronously) into a <code>HttpResponse</code> - it is implemented off the shelf for a variety of common types (e.g. strings, status codes, bytes, <code>Http…</code></p></div></div>

  <p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) automates network architecture engineering. It aims to learn a network topology that can achieve best performance on a certain task. By dissecting the methods for NAS into three components: search space, search algorithm and child model evolution strategy, this post reviews many interesting ideas for better, faster and more cost-efficient automatic neural architecture search.</p>
</blockquote>

<!--more-->

<p>Although most popular and successful model architectures are designed by human experts, it doesn’t mean we have explored the entire network architecture space and settled down with the best option. We would have a better chance to find the optimal solution if we adopt a systematic and automatic way of learning high-performance model architectures.</p>

<p>Automatically learning and evolving network topologies is not a new idea (<a href="http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf">Stanley &amp; Miikkulainen, 2002</a>). In recent years, the pioneering work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02167">Baker et al. 2017</a> has attracted a lot of attention into the field of Neural Architecture Search (NAS), leading to many interesting ideas for better, faster and more cost-efficient NAS methods.</p>

<p>As I started looking into NAS, I found this nice survey very helpful by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05377">Elsken, et al 2019</a>. They characterize NAS as a system with three major components, which is clean &amp; concise, and also commonly adopted in other NAS papers.</p>

  <li><strong>Search space</strong>: The NAS search space defines a set of operations (e.g. convolution, fully-connected, pooling) and how operations can be connected to form valid network architectures. The design of search space usually involves human expertise, as well as unavoidably human biases.</li>
  <li><strong>Search algorithm</strong>: A NAS search algorithm samples a population of network architecture candidates. It receives the child model performance metrics as rewards (e.g. high accuracy, low latency) and optimizes to generate high-performance architecture candidates.</li>
  <li><strong>Evaluation strategy</strong>: We need to measure, estimate, or predict the performance of a large number of proposed child models in order to obtain feedback for the search algorithm to learn. The process of candidate evaluation could be very expensive and many new methods have been proposed to save time or computation resources.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="search-space">Search Space</h2>

<p>The NAS search space defines a set of basic network operations and how operations can be connected to construct valid network architectures.</p>

<h3 id="sequential-layer-wise-operations">Sequential Layer-wise Operations</h3>

<p>The most naive way to design the search space for neural network architectures is to depict network topologies, either CNN or RNN, with a list of <em>sequential layer-wise operations</em>, as seen in the early work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a> &amp; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02167">Baker et al. 2017</a>. The serialization of network representation requires a decent amount of expert knowledge, since each operation is associated with different layer-specific parameters and such associations need to be hardcoded. For example, after predicting a <code>conv</code> op, the model should output kernel size, stride size, etc; or after predicting an <code>FC</code> op, we need to see the number of units as the next prediction.</p>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/NAS-search-space.png" alt="The sequential layer-wise operation search space"></p>
<p><em>Figure 2. (Top) A sequential representation of CNN. (Bottom) A sequential representation of the tree structure of a recurrent cell. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a>)</em></p>

<p>To make sure the generated architecture is valid, additional rules might be needed (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a>):</p>
<ul>
  <li>If a layer is not connected to any input layer then it is used as the input layer;</li>
  <li>At the final layer, take all layer outputs that have not been connected and concatenate them;</li>
  <li>If one layer has many input layers, then all input layers are concatenated in the depth dimension;</li>
  <li>If input layers to be concatenated have different sizes, we pad the small layers with zeros so that the concatenated layers have the same sizes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The skip connection can be predicted as well, using an <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log%20/2018/06/24/attention-attention.html">attention</a>-style mechanism. At layer \(i\) , an anchor point is added with \(i−1\) content-based sigmoids to indicate which of the previous layers to be connected. Each sigmoid takes as input the hidden states of the current node \(h_i\) and \(i-1\) previous nodes \(h_j, j=1, \dots, i-1\) .</p><p>

\[P(\text{Layer j is an input to layer i}) = \text{sigmoid}(v^\top \tanh(\mathbf{W}_\text{prev} h_j + \mathbf{W}_\text{curr} h_i))\]

</p><p>The sequential search space has a lot of representation power, but it is very large and consumes a ton of computation resources to exhaustively cover the search space. In the experiments by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a>, they were running 800 GPUs in parallel for 28 days and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02167">Baker et al. 2017</a> restricted the search space to contain at most 2 <code>FC</code> layers.</p>

<h3 id="cell-based-representation">Cell-based Representation</h3>

<p>Inspired by the design of using repeated modules in successful vision model architectures (e.g. Inception, ResNet), the <em>NASNet search space</em> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07012">Zoph et al. 2018</a>) defines the architecture of a conv net as the same cell getting repeated multiple times and each cell contains several operations predicted by the NAS algorithm. A well-designed cell module enables transferability between datasets. It is also easy to scale down or up the model size by adjusting the number of cell repeats.</p>

<p>Precisely, the NASNet search space learns two types of cells for network construction:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Normal Cell</em>: The input and output feature maps have the same dimension.</li>
  <li><em>Reduction Cell</em>: The output feature map has its width and height reduced by half.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/NASNet-search-space.png" alt="NASNet search space"></p>
<p><em>Figure 3. The NASNet search space constrains the architecture as a repeated stack of cells. The cell architecture is optimized via NAS algorithms. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07012">Zoph et al. 2018</a>)</em></p>

<p>The predictions for each cell are grouped into \(B\) blocks (\(B=5\) in the NASNet paper), where each block has 5 prediction steps made by 5 distinct softmax classifiers corresponding to discrete choices of the elements of a block. Note that the NASNet search space does not have residual connections between cells and the model only learns skip connections on their own within blocks.</p>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/cell-prediction-steps.png" alt="5 prediction steps in one block"></p>
<p><em>Figure 4. (a) Each cell consists of \(B\) blocks and each block is predicted by 5 discrete decisions. (b) An concrete example of what operations can be chosen in each decision step.</em></p>

<p><a name="ScheduledDropPath"></a>During the experiments, they discovered that a modified version of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07648"><em>DropPath</em></a>, named <em>ScheduledDropPath</em>, significantly improves the final performance of NASNet experiments. DropPath stochastically drops out paths (i.e. edges with operations attached in NASNet) with a fixed probability. ScheduledDropPath is DropPath with a linearly increasing probability of path dropping during training time.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05377">Elsken, et al (2019)</a> point out three major advantages of the NASNet search space:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The search space size is reduced drastically;</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_motif">motif</a>-based architecture can be more easily transferred to different datasets.</li>
  <li>It demonstrates a strong proof of a useful design pattern of repeatedly stacking modules in architecture engineering. For example, we can build strong models by stacking residual blocks in CNN or stacking multi-headed attention blocks in Transformer.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="hierarchical-structure">Hierarchical Structure</h3>

<p>To take advantage of already discovered well-designed network <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_motif">motifs</a>, the NAS search space can be constrained as a hierarchical structure, as in <em>Hierarchical NAS</em> (<strong>HNAS</strong>; (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00436">Liu et al 2017</a>)). It starts with a small set of primitives, including individual operations like convolution operation, pooling, identity, etc. Then small sub-graphs (or “motifs”) that consist of primitive operations are recursively used to form higher-level computation graphs.</p>

<p>A computation motif at level \(\ell=1, \dots, L\) can be represented by \((G^{(\ell)}, \mathcal{O}^{(\ell)})\), where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(\mathcal{O}^{(\ell)}\) is a set of operations, \(\mathcal{O}^{(\ell)} = \{ o^{(\ell)}_1, o^{(\ell)}_2, \dots \}\)</li>
  <li>\(G^{(\ell)}\) is an adjacency matrix, where the entry \(G_{ij}=k\) indicates that operation \(o^{(\ell)}_k\) is placed between node \(i\) and \(j\). The node indices follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">topological ordering</a> in DAG, where the index \(1\) is the source and the maximal index is the sink node.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/hierarchical-NAS-search-space.png" alt="Hierarchical search space"></p>
<p><em>Figure 5. (Top) Three level-1 primitive operations are composed into a level-2 motif. (Bottom) Three level-2 motifs are plugged into a base network structure and assembled into a level-3 motif. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00436">Liu et al 2017</a>)</em></p>

<p>To build a network according to the hierarchical structure, we start from the lowest level \(\ell=1\) and recursively define the \(m\)-th motif operation at level \(\ell\) as</p><p>

\[o^{(\ell)}_m = \text{assemble}\Big( G_m^{(\ell)}, \mathcal{O}^{(\ell-1)} \Big)\]

</p><p>A hierarchical representation becomes \(\Big( \big\{ \{ G_m^{(\ell)} \}_{m=1}^{M_\ell} \big\}_{\ell=2}^L, \mathcal{O}^{(1)} \Big), \forall \ell=2, \dots, L\), where \(\mathcal{O}^{(1)}\) contains a set of primitive operations.</p>

<p>The \(\text{assemble}()\) process is equivalent to sequentially compute the feature map of node \(i\) by aggregating all the feature maps of its predecessor node \(j\) following the topological ordering:</p><p>

\[x_i = \text{merge} \big[ \{ o^{(\ell)}_{G^{(\ell)}_{ij}}(x_j) \}_{j &lt; i} \big], i = 2, \dots, \vert G^{(\ell)} \vert\]

</p><p>where \(\text{merge}[]\) is implemented as depth-wise concatenation in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00436">paper</a>.</p>

<p>Same as NASNet, experiments in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00436">Liu et al (2017)</a> focused on discovering good cell architecture within a predefined “macro” structure with repeated modules. They showed that the power of simple search methods (e.g. random search or evolutionary algorithms) can be substantially enhanced using well-designed search spaces.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02639">Cai et al (2018b)</a> propose a tree-structure search space using path-level network transformation. Each node in a tree structure defines an <em>allocation</em> scheme for splitting inputs for child nodes and a <em>merge</em> scheme for combining results from child nodes. The path-level network transformation allows replacing a single layer with a multi-branch motif if its corresponding merge scheme is add or concat.</p>

<p><em>This is a guest post from James Turnbull. Enjoy.</em></p>



<p>Dear new developer,</p>



<p>Steve Jobs made the phrase “Good artists copy, great artists steal” famous in the tech industry. However, there’s considerable debate about the origin of the expression. Ironically, he was possibly cribbing from Picasso, who might have been cribbing from Igor Stravinsky, William Faulkner, or perhaps T.S. Eliot. Of all the many variants, I prefer Faulkner’s “Immature artists copy, great artists steal.”</p>



<p>What does this phrase have to do with writing code? More than you’d imagine. As engineers, we’re often stuck on something, banging our heads against a wall over a block of code, or a problem we can’t solve. Some people go for a walk to overcome these blocks, and others take a shower or switch contexts. But many of us go searching the Internet for answers. We try Google, Stack Overflow, or Github for error messages, snippets of code, or implementations that might overcome our problem. When we find something that helps we take this code, often morph it a little, and then use it in our codebase:</p>

<p>Or in a code comment:</p>


<pre title=""># From https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62048888/how-to-select-a-floating-point-or-integer-using-a-regular-expression-from-text
text.lines.find { |l| l[' Running Total '] }[/[\d.]+/]
. . .
</pre>


<p>But there is a lot of disdain, even hate, for this approach from other engineers. This hate is often combined with gatekeeper overtones or remarks about how this wasn’t how things were done when they were learning. I’ve heard it described as “copy-pasta coding” or “cargo coding,” or sometimes even described as outright plagiarism. So is it plagiarism?</p>



<p>To me, there’s a clear distinction between imitation and inspiration. When you go looking for that code, you’re looking for inspiration to solve the problem you have. It is rare to find the exact code you need that you can without modification, nor do you often find code can be used by simply copying it in place. By the very nature of trying to understand how someone else solved the problem, you’re learning, inspired by their creation. Later, as someone finds your code when they seek to solve the same or a similar problem, they can see your implementation and the original, and potentially receive further inspiration and insight.</p>



<p>There are best practices, though, that you should abide by when you use this approach. Firstly, credit the source of your inspiration, acknowledge the work of the original author, and help the next person who is following the same path to a solution. Indeed, if you feel uncomfortable about acknowledging the source of the code that inspired you, perhaps that’s a signal that you’re not doing right by the original creator?</p>



<p>Secondly, use the code as a learning tool; experiment and apply your knowledge and perspective to it. I recently found a Ruby method to work with a nested hash. I liked the solution but realized there was a way to make it more functional and easier to understand. So I took the code, modified it, and made it my own. In has been my experience that the best code results from code shared, whether developed with others or even code reviewed to get other’s perspectives. This process is how we learn to be better coders by learning the lessons of those who came before us and building upon them.</p>



<p>So ignore those folks who hate on this approach. I am sure they protest too much because I can guarantee they have done this in the past, and their disdain draws from the rose-colored glasses that inhibit memories of how they learned. Great artists don’t spawn from nothing, and “Great artists steal” is about finding inspiration; finding the key or the “eureka” moment someone else’s implementation sparks and using it as a starting point to creatively solve your problems.</p>

As important health care access points, these hospitals serve a population that is disproportionately older, impoverished and burdened by chronic disease.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1997, with small rural hospitals under increasing financial strain and closing in large numbers, the federal CAH designation was established to increase their viability and to ensure that rural communities have adequate access to health care.</p><p>Prior research studies comparing the quality of care provided by CAHs and non-CAHs have found that risk-adjusted mortality rates at CAHs were higher, and the hospitals’ quality of care, therefore, lower. But a new study led by investigators at the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brown.edu%2Facademics%2Fpublic-health%2Fcghr%2F%3Futm_source%3DSPHResearch%26utm_medium%3Daccordion&amp;t=NzEzYmJkN2IxZGNlN2ExMzQwNTczNDhkNWVmZGM3YWUxOWQ4NjgxZixzM0VvaXFFWg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F626083780719951873%2Frural-us-hospitals-quality-of-care&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1597292416">Center for Gerontology and Healthcare Research</a> in Brown’s School of Public Health suggests that standard risk-adjustment methodologies have been unfairly penalizing CAHs.</p><p>According to the study, for Medicare beneficiaries in rural areas who were hospitalized during the period of 2007 to 2017, CAHs submitted significantly fewer hospital diagnosis codes than did non-CAHs. The primary reason for the relative under-reporting of diagnoses at CAHs has to do with differences in Medicare reimbursements — while non-CAHs are incentivized by Medicare to complete diagnosis coding, CAHs, which receive cost-based reimbursements, are not.</p><p>“When payments for episodes of care are tied to the acuity of patients, health care providers have the incentive to fully report or even overstate acuity,” said study senior author Momotazur Rahman, an associate professor of health services, policy and practice at Brown. “Since payments for non-CAHs are dependent on reported acuity while payments for CAHs are not, non-CAH patients will appear comparatively sicker than they actually are.”</p><p>Because mortality rates are adjusted per severity of illness — acuity, in Rahman’s words — the result is that CAHs appear to have higher mortality rates for patients with similar conditions, when in reality their patients may in fact be sicker than those in non-CAHs, from the standpoint of risk adjustment.</p><p>The <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fjamanetwork.com%2Fjournals%2Fjama%2Farticle-abstract%2F2768976&amp;t=NzJkYThjODIwZDZmODBjM2NmYzg1MzQwMWY4MGVjOWM2ZmY5NTE3NSxzM0VvaXFFWg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F626083780719951873%2Frural-us-hospitals-quality-of-care&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1597292416">study</a> was published in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> on Tuesday, Aug. 4.</p><p>How did the researchers determine that CAHs tend to overreport diagnoses? In 2010, Medicare increased the allowable number of billing codes for hospitalizations from 10 to 25.</p><p>“We observed a large jump in reported acuity among non-CAH patients in 2010,” Rahman said, “but we saw a much smaller jump for CAH patients. We found that due to this difference in acuity reporting, when compared to non-CAHs, the risk-adjusted performance of CAHs on short-term mortality measures looks much worse than it actually is.”</p><p>The CAH program, created to prevent rural hospitals from closing, has repeatedly come under threat. Given that in many parts of the U.S., CAHs serve as sole health care providers, Rahman said that examining differences in quality of care is important for understanding the value of the CAH program and informing decisions about the allocation of funding for rural health care.</p><p>The finding that short-term mortality outcomes at rural CAHs may not differ from those of non-CAHs after accounting for different coding practices, he added, is essential knowledge for ensuring timely access to acute care for vulnerable rural communities.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brown.edu%2Fnews%2F2020-08-10%2Fcah&amp;t=NjRmZTEwNjI4Y2Y3ODMyZjdkYjE4YTZhMTQxNjkyMDY4ZTcwYmYwMCxzM0VvaXFFWg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F626083780719951873%2Frural-us-hospitals-quality-of-care&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1597292416">Brown University</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“Association of Diagnosis Coding With Differences in Risk-Adjusted Short-term Mortality Between Critical Access and Non–Critical Access Hospitals”,&nbsp;<i>Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.1001%2Fjama.2020.9935&amp;t=MDFiZmU2ZTcxMThlMWQ4ZTg4NDJmNWNhODA1ODVkYTA0YTUzNjFiNCxzM0VvaXFFWg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F626083780719951873%2Frural-us-hospitals-quality-of-care&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1597292416">http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.9935</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/175410522827/rural-healthtech-podcast">Rural Health Tech’s enormous potential (podcast)</a></p>

		<div>

			
<p>Do you think writing a book in just 2 weeks is possible?</p>



<p>Well, I just finished and launched one. On my own and without any help.</p>



<p>To be fair, I did have some experience writing… Instagram captions. </p>



<p>Now, seriously. All (bad) jokes aside. I’ve liked writing since I was a teenager, so I’ve naturally written some stuff. I’ve written some short articles. I’ve written some cheesy poems. A couple of crappy songs too. But I wrote most of it a long time ago. And it was always occasional. I never had a writing habit. I had <strong>never </strong>written long-form content in my life either.</p>



<p>Yet I pulled it off. I wrote a real, 35-page-long book in just two weeks. And you know what? I think you <em>should</em> do it too.</p>



<h2>Why you <em>should </em>consider writing a book</h2>



<p>When I started working on my book, <strong><a href="https://gum.co/flyonyourown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fly On Your Own</a></strong>, my only goal was to help my younger brother. <a href="https://twitter.com/dbustac/status/1285055600393695232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I wanted to teach him a couple of things about making money online</a>. That was it.</p>



<p>Now, I realize that by writing the book I didn’t just help my brother, I helped myself too. A LOT:</p>



<ul><li>I created a writing habit</li><li>My writing is getting better thanks to the feedback I’m getting from people who read the book</li><li>I have a bunch of content that I can repurpose and post on my blog and social media  </li><li>I learned to do new things</li><li>I learned a ton about myself</li><li>I had a lot of fun </li></ul>



<p>In summary, I gained experience, I gained some skills, and I created something that hopefully will add value to my brother and even other people. And that has already created a lot of value for me. </p>



<p>That’s why I think you should write a book too – it’s a very entertaining and rewarding way to learn and improve yourself. Also, it’s a good way to start making money online. You can sell your book on <a href="https://gumroad.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gumroad </a>or <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon </a>and make some money out of it. </p>



<h2>The 7 things I learned</h2>



<p>As I mentioned before, writing Fly On Your Own was very instructive. It taught me a great deal about myself and about writing. After reflecting on my experience, I think these are the 7 key lessons I got (at least from a writing perspective):</p>



<h3> 1. You don’t need credentials </h3>



<p>There are a lot of myths about writing and publishing a book. The first one is that you need credentials.</p>



<p>You don’t need to be a “professional” writer. You don’t have to be an expert on a particular subject or field.You don’t need a publisher. </p>



<p>The only thing you need is to have something to say or teach. And I’m pretty sure you do.</p>



<h3>2. There’s something you know that other people would like to learn</h3>



<p>The same way I “knew” some things that my brother didn’t, there are things you know that other people probably don’t and would love to learn about. Maybe you <strong>take them for granted</strong>. But all your knowledge, skills, and experiences are valuable. They can help other people. Unfortunately, sometimes we don’t realize it. </p>



<p>Even if you’re just starting out and don’t have a lot of baggage, you can still write about other people’s ideas and experiences. You can curate, explain and simplify things from your own perspective. That can be super valuable too. </p>



<p>It doesn’t matter that other people know what you know or have written about the same topic. That will always be the case. So don’t get discouraged by that. Don’t aim to be original, aim to be unique. </p>



<h3>3. You don’t need to be a “talented” writer</h3>



<p> If you can write a tweet or a text message, you are talented enough to write a book. </p>



<p>What matters is that you’re <strong>concise, clear and direct</strong>. Make sure you use simple, common words most of the time. Keep your sentences and paragraphs short. Avoid using passive voice. </p>



<p>Your goal is to get people to understand your message as fast and effortlessly as possible. And that’s how you do it.</p>



<h3>4. You need a deadline</h3>



<p>The only reason why I finished the book in 2 weeks is because I had a <strong>public</strong> <strong>deadline</strong>. </p>



<p>I tweeted that I was going to do it the same day I started working on it. I told some close friends too.</p>



<p>Believe it or not, that forced me to stick to my word. I didn’t care that it was only a few people who knew about it. That was enough to make me want to keep my promise.</p>



<h3>5. You need to manage your time and your attention</h3>



<p>If you want to stick to your word and your deadline, then you’ll need to get in <strong>production mode.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll need to reduce your inputs and increase your outputs. Put another way, you’ll need to <strong>produce more than you consume</strong>. </p>



<p>Set aside time to work, limit your distractions and make sure you <strong>actually do </strong>the work. Simple as that.</p>



<h3>6. You need an outline</h3>



<p>An outline is a list of topics or points you want to touch on the book and each chapter. It’s your structure. Your framework. </p>



<p>Although writing an outline will probably feel like hard work at first, it will make the whole process smooth and easy later on. </p>



<p>You won’t spend hours staring at the blank page trying to figure out what to say. You already know what you want to say. Because you already did the heavy lifting.</p>



<h3>7. You need immediate feedback</h3>



<p>In a way, writing a book is like building a product for a startup. </p>



<p>It’s not a good idea to wait until your book is 100% ready to start getting feedback. You should seek constant feedback from the beginning. </p>



<p>Ask somebody close to you to read all your drafts as you write them. Don’t ask them to judge for aesthetics or style, though. Ask them to judge the <strong>clarity </strong>of your writing. You want to make sure you’re being concise, clear and direct, remember? </p>



<p>Make sure your message is being delivered <strong>quickly and painlessly.</strong></p>



<h2>Wrapping up</h2>



<p>Thanks to this experience, I realized how much you can get done and learn in very little time when you focus and do the work. Likewise, I realized how powerful and underrated is experimentation as a learning strategy. </p>



<p>There’s a famous Bill Gates’ quote that goes:&nbsp;“<em>Most&nbsp;people overestimate what they can do in one year&nbsp;and&nbsp;underestimate what they can do&nbsp;in ten&nbsp;years.</em>”</p>



<p>But now I see there’s another side to this: Sometimes <strong>people underestimate what they can do in two weeks</strong> and <strong>overestimate what they can do in two months.</strong></p>



<p>I hope this post inspires you to start writing your own book, and that my insights can help make your process easier. </p>



<p>If you have any questions or just want to say hi, <a href="https://twitter.com/dbustac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reach out to me on Twitter</a>. I’d love to hear from you!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>I am sure you have heard about <strong> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://discord.com/new">Discord</a></strong>, a real-time chatting tool that started as a <strong><em>Slack for Gamers</em></strong>. </p>
<p>Today, Discord is used as a community for designers, developers, artists, business managers, friends hangout zones, and more. It has become a reliable and welcoming place, no matter your interest or background. Features like video calling, audio calling and broadcasting make it a powerhouse. Surprisingly, these features work better in Discord than Slack and Microsoft Teams from my experience. </p>
<p>Here's an interesting video by Discord that shares its future goals and vision:</p>

<p>I am glad that at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hashnode.com/">Hashnode</a>, we switched from Slack to Discord for our team discussions and collaborations. It's been two years now, and we are thrilled with the experience so far. Recently, we opened up our Discord server for anyone to join and get help directly from the Hashnode team and community.

<p>By MEGAN FROST BABB, MD (1)</p>



<p>The other day while I walked to work, I deliberately slowed my pace to allow time for my left hand to lightly graze the brick wall I was passing. I watched as my fingers ebbed and flowed through every groove and imperfection. There was a familiarity to this. Perhaps it was the texture, perhaps the grit. Either way, memories emanated as I was no stranger to brick walls. Over the years as I pursued a career in medicine, my hands had gotten quite used to dismantling them.</p>



<p>The journey to becoming a physician is a long one. When I started upon it, littered everywhere were remnants of items belonging to predecessors who had once traveled the same path. At one point along the way, I found a piece of literature recommending whiskey for a teething child. This provided me some context to its age. Interestingly, despite the medical and technological advancements throughout healthcare in the last few centuries, for female physicians, significant inequities still exist. And as a result, for those of us on this road, brick walls are a common obstacle to meet.</p>



<p>The first wall I encountered came at the beginning of my third year of medical school while on a surgical rotation. Its brick-supplier was one man: an attending surgeon. Its building contractor was the system that employed him. The project itself was funded by the profits he generated for them. My brick was #864. I remember the day mine got added to the wall.</p>



<p>It started with, “Your hair smells incredible<em>.”</em>&nbsp;Followed by, “My hands may touch you. They are hard to control.” It even went as far as, “You were in my dream last night. Did I mention it was wet?” He made my skin crawl. I spent more time focused on trying to be where he wasn’t that I had no space left to focus on why I was there in the first place, and that was to learn. The awkward stares from OR staff looking upon me with pity made me want to vomit. And the number of male physician on-lookers who seemed to watch this behavior for sport did nothing but enable his behavior (when one brought his daughter to work with him, it was all I could do but hope she never had to experience from a man what I was experiencing from him). The lack of shock of such behavior from everyone aware in the system confirmed its normalcy.</p>







<p>The bricks that these walls are built, each have a unique story to tell. They all represent the individual experiences of female physicians plight with gender bias. The misogyny is the mortar that holds each brick together. The wall itself represents the cumulative effects of sexism in healthcare. And the support lending to each wall comes from those controlling these systems who allow the pervasiveness of such behaviors to continue.</p>



<p>The wall I stare at today, more than one-thousand bricks tall and wide. Inspired originally by the&nbsp;<strong>#MeToo</strong>&nbsp;movement and most recently by representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s most poignant address on sexism in politics (that provided the confidence I needed to publish this), the following vignettes have been collected from fellow female physicians who, like me, have a story to share.</p>



<p><strong>Brick #4:</strong>&nbsp;I was asked by a male patient if I needed to practice my prostate exam technique because he was happy to allow me to do so on him. When I asked the administrative team to move him to the service of any one of my many male colleagues I was told, “These are the sort of things that build character. I think we need to thicken your skin. The patient will remain on your service.”</p>



<p><strong>Brick #29:</strong>&nbsp;I recently gave a presentation at grand rounds in my hospital. When I walked to the podium, I overheard a male physician say to a group of others, “Isn’t the lecture today supposed to be given by an orthopedic surgeon?” I am the orthopedic surgeon he speaks of.</p>



<p><strong>Brick #56:</strong>&nbsp;I am a trauma surgeon. When I was in fellowship, a male attending told me he wasn’t a fan of women being trauma surgeons because he didn’t think we could stomach the type of injuries that they typically treated.</p>



<p><strong>Brick #82:</strong>&nbsp;My research team was being introduced at a major medical conference in front of an audience of over 10,000 physicians. I was the only female in our group of eight. Each male was introduced as Dr. So-and-so. I was introduced as Susan. Just to be clear, like the other seven, I am also a physician.</p>



<p><strong>Brick #122:</strong>&nbsp;Today a physician asked me why I didn’t go to nursing school. “Because I wanted to go to medical school. Why didn’t you go to nursing school?” I asked. He looked puzzled.</p>



<p><strong>Brick #215:</strong>&nbsp;At our medical group’s Christmas party a male colleague approached me and said, “Who knew that under your usual frumpy outfits there existed a body like that!”</p>



<p><strong>Brick #297:</strong>&nbsp;I am currently in residency and one of my male attendings said to me, “I don’t know how any female physician finds a husband. Don’t most men find your level of education unattractive?”</p>



<p><strong>Brick #365:</strong>&nbsp;I once disagreed with the treatment plan of one of my hospitalist colleagues and made different recommendations to the management of the patient’s kidney disease. He later saw me in the physician’s lounge at lunch and said, “I appreciate your input but I am going to ask Dr. X (another nephrologist but male) to consult on the case because I don’t agree with your recommendations. You don’t care do you?”</p>



<p><strong>Brick #398:</strong>&nbsp;Our hospital board of directors recently sent out an email welcoming their new diversity officer. He is a white male. We now have sixteen board members. Sixteen of them are white males.</p>



<p><strong>Brick #441:</strong>&nbsp;I am a cardiology fellow and every month my male colleagues ask if I am still taking my birth control. They are worried about me getting pregnant and going on maternity leave.</p>



<p><strong>Brick #507:&nbsp;</strong>As a medical student I was on a surgical rotation with a male urologist. While assisting him with a TURP he asked me, “Would you like to see what a well-endowed penis looks like?”</p>



<p><strong>Brick #558:</strong>&nbsp;One of my kids got sick and so I had to cancel my patients for the day. My male boss responded to my text message with, “Don’t you have a nanny for that?”</p>



<p><strong>Brick #606:&nbsp;</strong>I was a medical student when my breast was grabbed by a male attending. When I went to report it, the individual taking down the information asked if I had done anything to make this physician think I wanted him to do that.</p>



<p><strong>Brick #670:&nbsp;</strong>I am a surgeon. It happened to be a Friday afternoon when I was doing a routine surgical procedure that was taking longer than expected. The male anesthesiologist on the case yelled out in front of everyone in the OR, “If you weren’t a female perfectionist, we would have been done hours ago!”</p>



<p><strong>Brick #781:</strong>&nbsp;A colleague of mine was offended when I told him he tended to be sexist. He told me that was impossible. “I have three daughters!” As if being a father to daughters excludes men from this behavior.</p>



<p><strong>Brick #836:</strong>&nbsp;I asked my medical school classmate why he wanted to pursue a career in obstetrics and gynecology. His response, “Because who doesn’t like to watch women moan?” I found out where he was applying and emailed each program with the following:&nbsp;<em>If you have any doubt about this candidate, there is a reason for it. Listen to your gut.</em></p>



<p><strong>Brick #887:</strong>&nbsp;I emailed an orthopedic residency program I had just interviewed with to thank them and to express my enjoyment in meeting them. The Program Director replied-all to the group asking, “Can someone find out if she is married, with or without kids?” I was crushed. For those that don’t know, this is unethical and highly frowned upon.</p>



<p><strong>Brick #914:</strong>&nbsp;To improve physician retention in my medical group I suggested we consider offering the female physicians twelve weeks of fully paid maternity leave following the delivery or adoption of a baby. A male colleague was quick to shut down the idea stating, “Nah, that’s a terrible idea. Women will just take advantage of it.”</p>



<p><strong>Brick #991:</strong>&nbsp;The following is an excerpt from a note written by a female colleague who died by suicide (this is shared with family permission under the premises that she remain anonymous), “You sexually harassed me for months. Your desire was that I believe in myself to be nothing. You win. The system weakened me. You broke me. I did physically what you did verbally. Words can kill too.”</p>



<p>It is incredible how much information can be gathered by the fingertips. I require myself to feel every brick so that each experience they represent can be heard. With each behavior tolerated, left unattended by those with the authority to correct them, the mortar strengthens and in turn the wall itself. As women, we are taught that it must be us who improves uncomfortable situations. And since it is clear these walls strengthen with time and that only we can improve the uncomfortableness of it all, I leave you with just one suggestion: Get yourself a sledgehammer because getting uncomfortable just got a whole lot easier. It is about time these walls start coming down… indefinitely.</p>

          <h2 id="learn-what-user-testing-methods-are-right-for-you-during-your-stage-of-product-development">Learn what user testing methods are right for you during your stage of product development <br></h2><p>User Testing is an integral part of the product development process and can save thousands of dollars when implemented correctly. Throughout the development lifecycle, product owners can often feel stuck when trying to imagine all the quirks a user needs from the solution. While having a grand vision for how a product can solve a problem <em>is</em> possible, understanding exactly how it will be used without talking directly to the user <strong>is not</strong>. If you’re new to User Testing, <a href="https://blog.codelitt.com/the-most-overlooked-design-skill-user-testing/">check out our Beginner’s Guide</a>. </p><p>Fortunately, integrating User Testing into the development process is easy. User Testing encompasses a seemingly endless list of ways to engage users, attain their feedback, and set yourself up best for success. On average, testing <a href="https://www.intechnic.com/blog/100-ux-statistics-every-user-experience-professional-needs-to-know/">5 users can find 85% of user issues within a system.</a> User Testing is easy to implement, information-rich and completely flexible. That’s why more and more companies are jumping to make it a part of their workflow. However, if you’re not familiar with User Testing, understanding when and how to do it in your project can be tough.</p><h2 id="so-when-should-i-implement-user-testing">So When Should I Implement User Testing?</h2><p>To put it simply: <strong>as soon as possible</strong>! Implementing User Testing early and often can help you identify problems and roadblocks before the project even gets fully conceptualized. Below you’ll find a breakdown of a few different ways you can do testing. Keep in mind that most of these tests are variable and can be implemented at any time during your product lifecycle!</p><h3 id="product-conception-and-discovery">Product Conception and Discovery</h3><p>You’ve suddenly awoken in the middle of the night with a great idea for an innovative solution that could potentially change the way you work. Now what? As you begin to conceptualize your product and try to validate the idea, it’s a perfect time to conduct some preliminary research.</p><ul><li><strong>User Interviews </strong>- Sitting down with your target users to understand what their current problem is. Learning how important it is for them to have a solution can help you validate if the idea that's keeping you up at night might become a viable product.</li><li><strong>Stakeholders Interviews </strong>- Speaking with other people who will be involved in the production of the product and understanding their motivations will help in clarifying product requirements and success metrics.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Ethnographic Interviews or Observation</strong> </strong></strong>- &nbsp;Watching your target users interact with technology you are looking to replace.

<p>The village hall in Bowerchalke is an unlikely setting for a mobile technology revolution. Yet local residents, surrounded by crocheted goods and local jams, have spent three years forging a mobile phone network to bridge their own “digital divide”. </p>
 <!-- A generated by theme --> 



 <!-- end A --> 


<p>The experimental Ch4lke Mobile, which runs over just five masts, can connect homes to a network capable of delivering broadband-like speeds, in an area that had been left behind by the digital revolution.</p>
<p>The fledgling network has just secured part of a £2.25m government grant to fill in England’s largest “not-spot” — an area with no mobile signal — and could offer a solution to other pockets in the country blighted by a lack of coverage.</p>
<p>The village sits in the picturesque Chalke valley in Wiltshire little more than 10 miles south of the world-famous Stonehenge. It is known for its high quality watercress and a number of celebrity residents, including film director Guy Ritchie and TV presenter <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c72387ca-31aa-11ea-a329-0bcf87a328f2" data-trackable="link">James May</a>. </p>
<p>But perhaps more fortunately for its inhabitants, the village also boasts a small group of residents with technology backgrounds. </p>
<p>Ed Gairdner, who used to work with tech start ups in Silicon Valley, moved to the Chalke Valley from Hampshire four years ago and became frustrated at the paucity of coverage. “We looked at the coverage maps in Carphone Warehouse before buying phones. We tried to do our due diligence — but there is no coverage here,” he said.</p>

						</figcaption></figure>
<p>According to tests performed by network measurement company GWS signals are weak to non-existent in the valley. There is even a divide within the ‘digital divide’ as some residents with houses high on the downs get a signal while others have no coverage at all. “It became a non-discussion subject in the pub as it would start too many arguments,” said James Body, chair of the parish council.</p>
<p>Mr Body was unusually well placed when villagers began to complain to him about the lack of coverage. As a former officer in the British army’s Royal Signals, he spent a career in the military building networks and then went on to work in telecoms in the private sector.</p>
<p>Bowerchalke lies just a few miles west of the cathedral city of Salisbury, which now has one of the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cdf430ba-499f-11ea-aeb3-955839e06441" data-trackable="link">fastest broadband networks in the country</a>. But the steep, narrow Chalke valley has cut it off from the wireless revolution after an earlier government project failed to deliver five large mobile towers.</p>
<p>Despite few wanting the giant metallic structures, locals were angry at having no coverage. For Sue Lee, who runs a B&amp;B next to the village hall, the lack of connectivity has cost her business.</p>
<p>She describes various visitors abruptly leaving without paying after finding there was no mobile reception. She decided to harangue Mr Body. “Isn’t there anything we can do? It is ridiculous,” she recalled asking him. </p>
<p>Since then, Mr Body has spent three years working with the community to develop a test network that operates off small antennas attached to the chimneys of thatched cottages.</p>
<p>Inspired by an earlier initiative to set up a rural broadband network in Lancashire in north-west England called <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/32f013fc-91e1-11e9-aea1-2b1d33ac3271" data-trackable="link">B4rn</a>, the new mobile network relies on the willingness of the community to solve the problem themselves rather than wait for the government or the industry to sort it out.</p>
<p>This also helps to lower costs as there is no rental or paperwork. The small base stations, that house the antennas, are also less of an eyesore than a mobile tower. The company compares its array of small cells to fairy lights reaching “every nook and cranny” of the valley. </p>
<figure><figcaption>

						</figcaption></figure>
<p>The government funding for Ch4lke will allow the network to move from the experimental phase — where it is still encountering gremlins such as the text messages it occasionally spits out welcoming people to Jersey — to a fully fledged system capable of delivering 5G speeds.</p>
<p>The small base stations are put up by the local TV installer: Mr Body’s house and the village hall already have one and with the funding in place the aim is to build the network out with about 50 across the valley.</p>
<p>The tiny network is pioneering with its use of a so-called neutral host network, which taps into unused spectrum — the frequencies that carry mobile signals — to interconnect with the large UK players — Vodafone, EE, O2 and Three.</p>
<p>Ch4lke Mobile, which is community owned, is using British-made hardware and software from a small Cambridge company called CellXica. The company is also working with O2 on a small trial at a Surrey train station but believes the ingenuity of the rural solution shows that British technology can play a bigger role in a UK market set to phase out radio equipment from China’s Huawei, the largest supplier.</p>

						</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ch4lke could offer a solution for other communities affected by not-spots in areas that the government-backed <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cd83abc8-f70c-11e9-a79c-bc9acae3b654" data-trackable="link">Shared Rural Network</a> programme, launched earlier this year to fill in most of the rural areas with poor coverage, won’t reach. “I’d love to have our radios in every not spot in the country now we have proved this is working,” said Ant Timpson of CellXica.</p>
<p>However getting the large telecoms on-side remains a key part of the process. The government backing for this scheme will help its cause. For John Glen, the local MP, the initiative is an example of a community banding together finding a solution to a debilitating problem where the government and industry has failed. </p>
<p>“You need to think laterally. You can’t conceive of this in Whitehall,” he said, sitting in the village hall. “This will be transformative for social cohesion. Everyone needs to benefit from the B&amp;B owner to the tech entrepreneur to the 85 year old,” he said.</p>

<div><p>You probably haven’t read the whole internet. Slacker.</p><p>GPT-3 has. It’s read all of Wikipedia, even the article about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berserk_llama_syndrome">Berserk llama syndrome</a>. It’s gone through all of Google Books. It read every month of the <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/">Common Crawl</a> dataset from 2016 to October 2019, comprising every piece of writing on the web during that time. It has read 45 terabytes of text, which equals a book about 3,375,000,000 pages long. It is <em>well-read</em>.</p><p>That’s why it’s writing everything at the moment. By day it’s a <a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282676454690451457">coder</a>, and by night it’s a <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3#poetry">poet</a>. Need a Seinfeld script written? <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanqnorth/status/1280501755067981826">No problem</a>. Want to chat with Shakespeare? <a href="https://twitter.com/mckaywrigley/status/1284110063498522624">He’s here for you</a>. Bored with writing emails to your partner? Just <a href="https://twitter.com/othersideai/status/1285776335638614017?s=11">write a bullet list</a>, and it’ll take care of the rest. GPT-3 can now write seemingly anything.</p><p>How? And how well? We’ve been experimenting with the API over the past few weeks to understand how it works, where it works best, and to discover how it’s going to fit into the content marketing world.</p></div>

<h2>GPT-3’s Mission in Artificial Life Is to Write Just One More Word</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What has GPT-3 done with all that text? Its name alone contains the answer. GPT stands for, in reverse order:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Transformer</strong> is the algorithm the model uses. It specializes in being able to process long pieces of text, pay attention to the salient information therein, and understand how words are used in natural language.</li><li><strong>Pre-trained</strong> means that the weights of the algorithm are already set for you based on the massive corpus of data it has imbibed. When you run it, you don’t need to do any more training.</li><li><strong>Generative</strong> means that the model’s goal is to generate text. It wants to predict what word comes next in any given sentence.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So Generative Pre-trained Transformer Number 3 has analyzed billions of lines of text, figured out what matters and what doesn’t in language, and then uses that information to produce more text.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>All it cares about is producing that next word and that word ‘fitting in’ with everything that has come before. It produces different probabilities for different words, and then picks the one with the highest likelihood. With the GPT-3 API, you give it a prompt—a piece of writing—and then it tries to predict what would come after that, based on all the stuff it has read and the rules it has learned. You can ask for five words or 1,000 words, and it’ll try to ‘complete’ your writing.</p><p>This is obviously different to how humans write.</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>We build abstract mental models. As I write this, I’m not just thinking that the word after this is <em>is</em>. I’m trying to synthesize my thoughts about GPT-3 with my knowledge of content marketing and my knowledge of neuroscience. I wrote this paragraph before I wrote the paragraph above. I have a construct of this entire article formed in my head that I am trying to make manifest with every word.</p><p>This is because people are more than just memory. We have higher executive functions that allow us to exhibit reasoning, planning, cognitive flexibility, and problem-solving. We also have lower-order emotions that allow us to have opinions and care about one idea over another, one word over another, not just as the output of a probability function.</p><p>GPT-3 doesn’t have any of this.</p><p>But even without these advanced neural functions honed by hundreds of thousands of years of evolution, GPT-3 seems to do A-OK on a lot of writing tasks. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">the paper detailing GPT-3</a>, the researchers gave test subjects 200-word news articles written by either humans or the model and asked them to state which one had written them. On average, they chose right only 52% of the time, which is basically chance.</p><p>Only 12% of human subjects were able to recognize this was written by a computer:</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":2243,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure><img src="https://2l4ff1gokdmn317w442ckjyu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-4.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-08-04 at 9.44.57 PM.png"></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The implications of this are enormous. If a computer can write text indistinguishable from humans <em>without</em> all that reasoning and emotion, where does that leave writers? If instead of writing 200 words, a journalist has to just write a title and subtitle and let a computer fill out the rest, then they can 10X their output. And, of course, a newspaper can employ just one journalist instead of 10.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And where does it leave humans? If reasoning and emotion aren't needed, are we over-engineered? No. As we've understood better how GPT-3 works, we've also understood better its limitations, where humans thrive, and how we can work together with AIs for greater success.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Getting GPT-3 to Write Great Long-Form Content Is Hard</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>Can GPT-3 write good content? Good enough that you’d be happy to publish it on your site? We decided the best way to test it out was to get it to write this article—an article about itself. It failed. This isn’t <em>that</em> article.</p><p>If you want to read what GPT-3 wrote, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZAGglPX-6J2rdvFyTIGQoUjc_rtEbc-Gd-xze_tWDi4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">you can check it out here</a>.</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->

<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We generated that article following these steps:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Gave GPT-3 a small prompt: a title and a brief synopsis of what we were looking for in the article (like you can see in the news article above).<br></li><li>Used that to generate a couple of paragraphs of text output.<br></li><li>Used the first (human) prompt plus the new (GPT-3) text as the next prompt.<br></li><li>Repeated Step 3 until we bootstrapped a nice content-marketing piece at 1,200 words.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>We did a little curating here and there, but with the exception of the title and the first paragraph, everything in that article is generated by GPT-3.</p><p>Now, the article’s not bad. Or rather it is, but it makes superficial sense.</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s a vast gulf between something that sounds good and something that’s actually good. GPT-3 is fantastic at creating a simulacrum of good content, something that imitates the flow and style of a human writer, but everything that makes an article useful is absent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are a few examples.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>It Lacks a Narrative Thread</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>One of the first skills a writer develops is the ability to thread together the component parts of an argument into a cohesive, logical narrative. It’s here that GPT-3 has its biggest failing: the writing meanders and skirts around the topic. It can write <em>about </em>a question but struggles to directly <em>answer </em>the question.</p><p>When we asked <a href="https://twitter.com/gmariethatsme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gail Marie</a>, our lead editor, to edit the article, she tore it to shreds:</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>"The reasoning throughout is dizzying and often illogical. A paragraph will begin by stating that X is true, and end stating that X is false. Here’s one example (these sentences come one after the other):</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>‘The real problem is that you can't automate value, entertainment, or authority. At the low end, you can automate value.'</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>My brain hurts."</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is a sample comment, inline:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":2242,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure><img src="https://2l4ff1gokdmn317w442ckjyu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-08-05 at 9.42.19 AM.png"></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was a common trait when we tried to generate long-form content with GPT-3. It loses the point.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>The end of its articles doesn’t relate strongly to the beginning. Whereas a great piece of writing presents you with an idea at the outset and then builds up evidence to a logical conclusion, GPT-3 has a tendency to do what a bad piece of writing does—just say stuff.</p><p>A single narrative thread can be seen in the article <a href="https://medium.com/@arjunsethi/the-hive-is-the-new-network-260b432a6720">The Hive is the New Network</a>. It takes a single idea—the emergent properties of the hive and how they relate to human networks—and pulls it through the entire article, adding on evidence and opinion to build up a compelling argument. The point is never lost because the human writer was capable of understanding the point throughout the writing.</p><p>The ability to build a compelling argument requires showing proof, something else GPT-3 is sorely lacking.</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>There Is No (Real) Evidence for Claims</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>GPT-3 is good at making claims and bad at validating them with data or reasoning, in a few ways.</p><p>The first is it just won’t back anything up. It makes assertions about the world but doesn’t link or cite any evidence. Within our editing process, this would lead to both editors and copyeditors highlighting the text with ‘citation/source?’ Unfortunately, it’s not uncommon to see this in articles written by humans, either. There are plenty of blogs that don’t cite their sources.</p><p>The second way GPT-3 is bad at validating claims is slightly more unnerving: it makes mistakes with factual data. You can see an example of this in the news article shared above. It wrote in reference to the Methodist schism:</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote><p>The first occurred in 1968, when roughly 10% of the denomination left to form the Evangelical United Brethren Church.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>This isn’t true—it is the other way round. The Evangelical United Brethren Church merged with the United Methodist Church that year.</p><p>But it’s the third mistake that is more insidious. It will make stuff up. Sometimes this is funny. In the article we prompted it to write, GPT-3 had trouble with simple addition and subtraction.</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":2244,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure><img src="https://2l4ff1gokdmn317w442ckjyu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-5.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-08-03 at 8.08.34 PM.png"></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>It says 5,000 - 2,000 = 500. This is not true.</p><p>Sometimes it is much less funny. When I was experimenting with generating content from small ‘thought leadership’ style sentences, GPT-3 wrote:</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote><p>“If you design a good process,” says O’Reilly Media CEO Tim O’Reilly, “you can’t really have a bad business”</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>I can’t find that quote online. Maybe it’s on some obscure corner of the web that GPT-3 knows about but Google doesn’t. But this is a massive no-no in any writing profession. Not only is there no citation, but it looks like this is just plain made-up. This is unethical. It can get a human fired.</p><p>Backing stuff up is a core component of good content marketing. In this example, <a href="https://amplitude.com/blog/2016/10/25/month-over-month-growth-rates">3 Mistakes You're Making with Month-Over-Month Growth Rates</a>, the writer has a) got the math correct, and b) shown examples and evidence of the ideas throughout. This makes the article more authoritative and leaves the reader with the intuition and knowledge that convinces them it’s true.</p><p>The mistakes themselves are the result of human-generated insight, something GPT-3 can’t mimic.</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>The Article Is Missing Insight</h3>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>The future of DevOps solutions is bright. The <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/devops-824.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">global DevOps market size</a> is expected to <strong>increase from $2.90 billion in 2017 to $10.31 billion by 2023</strong>, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 24.7% during the forecast period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The growing need for fast app delivery is driving the market growth, with organizations that want to achieve both speed and quality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the world is facing <a href="https://www.shuttleops.io/the-shortage-of-devops-skills" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a shortage of DevOps skills</a>. That’s why DevOps engineers are highly-paid, with <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/devops-engineer-salary-SRCH_KO0,15.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Glassdoor estimating</a> <strong>the average annual pay at around $100,000</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, if you’re looking for a career switch or upgrade, learning DevOps is a good idea. From books to podcasts, <em>here are the best DevOps resources to start with:&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Phoenix-Project-Gene-Kim/9781942788294?ref=grid-view&amp;qid=1588577029418&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">The Phoenix Project</a></strong></h2>



<p>Who would have thought you could write a novel about DevOps? Well, Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford obviously did a great job!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The Phoenix Project </strong>is an amazing novel about DevOps. The story revolves around a fictional company called “Parts Unlimited”, where the IT manager gets promoted into a senior position. Then, he gets a deadline of 90 days to repair “The Phoenix Project”, a failing and messy code project that’s crucial to the future of the company. If he fails, the CEO threatens to outsource the entire IT department and let go of the people working in it.</p>



<p>So, he starts working on it with the help of some board members. The most important thing here is his philosophy called The Three Ways. It consists of (obviously) three parts—maximizing the flow of work from left-to-right, starting from business to development to IT operations to the end-user; increasing the feedback loop from right to left, and developing and nurturing a culture of <a href="https://microtica.com/cracking-the-continuous-deployment-code/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continuous deployment</a> and learning.</p>



<p>This philosophy helps him create <strong>a streamlined workflow in the department</strong>, <a href="https://microtica.com/6-tips-to-solve-miscommunication-in-dev-teams/">improve </a><strong><a href="https://microtica.com/6-tips-to-solve-miscommunication-in-dev-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">communication</a> and effectiveness</strong>, and make the IT department really valuable to the company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think this is a really great book, especially for beginners. It gives a sense of what problems IT departments face every day, and offers realistic solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/infrastructure-as-code/9781491924334/" target="_blank">Infrastructure as Code</a></strong></h2>



<p>Coming from ThoughtWorks, this is another book that focuses on <strong>the entire DevOps movement from a more technical aspect</strong>. This book covers the principles of Infrastructure as Code, practical examples, dynamic infrastructure platforms, various cloud options, tools, patterns, software engineering practices, <a href="https://microtica.com/how-to-create-simple-ci-cd-pipeline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">creation and management of pipelines</a>, workflows, and infrastructure management. They are all divided into three sections—Foundations, Patterns, and Practices.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="js-article">
    <img src="https://nikodoko.com/img/best_practices.jpg" alt="Beware Of Best Practices /img/best_practices.jpg" data-action="zoom">


<p>As software engineers, our relationship with best practices is an evolving one. We start off unaware
of what they are. One day, because someone told us or because we read about it somewhere, we
discover them. This is usually where we start to revere them as some kind of holy scripture. The
cleaner our code gets, the more obsessed we become. For many of us, it can take a while before we
open our eyes again to the cold, hard truth: best practices are nothing but tools. Good tools, but
not always the most appropriate for the job.</p>

<p>Take DRY for example. Most may know its meaning<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, but how many wondered why it came to be? DRY is
the core principle the authors of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer"><em>The Pragmatic
Programmer</em></a> came up with after years of
struggling with hard to maintain, entangled code bases. It is a <em>concrete solution</em> to a <em>concrete
problem</em>, and it involves abstraction, which also has drawbacks<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Best practices are in fact just that: experienced programmers’ solutions to recurrent problems,
stripped of their context and boiled down to an easy to remember, catchy phrase. They are not golden
rules, but <em>trade-offs</em>. They come with less drawbacks than advantages - they are <em>best</em> practices
after all - but it is no excuse to not weigh up their benefits and costs before adopting them.  And
for that, it is often necessary to go back to their origins, and understand the problem they were
trying to solve in the first place.</p>

<p>But if the real value of best practices lies in knowing their costs and benefits, why do we always
teach them in a simplified, dumbed-down form? Of course, the most obvious answer to that
question pertains to our brain’s limited storage space. It is easier to remember a three letter
acronym than a full explanatory paragraph! But I feel like our love for best practices is also
deeply anchored in our subconsciousness.</p>

<p>Developing software is a complex and mentally taxing task, that often involves spending hours
pondering over what choice to make. Worse yet, when we finally take a decision, we often do so with
doubt lingering in our minds: did we really chose the right thing? In contrast, best practices
seduce us with the promise of simplicity, stability and certainty. By blindly following them, we
leave the responsibility of making decisions to a greater authority (the people who came up with
said best practice) and assume the more relaxing role of simply applying pre-made rules<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.
Besides, because their formulation is so simple, best practices also easily translate into metrics.
We then turn those metrics into targets - another of our little weaknesses<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> - and reaching those
targets ultimately grants us what we are longing for: peace of mind (“I reached 100% test
coverage! My code must be safe!“). As we all know deep down, this is but a mirage. But this false
sense of security can make us dangerously complacent. Reaching 100% test coverage does <em>not</em>
guarantee that our code is bug free, and should not be an excuse to let our guard down!</p>

<p>Obviously, I am not saying best practices should not be followed. They are valuable advice from the
wise software engineers who came before us. But I do believe that we should always remember that
they are not absolute truths.</p>

<p>As always, shoot me a message or tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/@nicol4s_c">@nicol4s_c</a> if you want to
chat about any of this, if you spotted any mistakes or typos, or if you’d like me to cover anything
else! Have a great day :)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="article" id="scroll" itemprop="articleBody">
                <p>With a lack of hardware updates, buggy keyboards that never get fixed, removed SD card slots and useless touchbars, the Macbook ecosystem has been languishing for a while. Apple seems intent on cutting away the long tail of power-users, be it audio professionals, video editors or developers. With the recent ARM-transition and Big Sur, it was clear to me that Apple and the Macbook were moving in a direction that I couldn’t join them in, and I refuse to be dragged to along. An iPad with a keyboard running on an ARM chip might honestly be a great computer for the vast majority of users, but I don’t see my requirements fitting into that box - at least for the next five years. I might do a second part on why I left and what the other side offered, along with the choices encountered and an evaluation of the options, but I’ll cut it short here by mentioning my final choice: Ubuntu 20.04 running on an XPS 13 9300 Non-Developer Edition.</p>

<p>The Linux ecosystem is a lot better than it was when I left five years ago, but it still has a ways to go. I’ve had to do quite a bit to get my system to a point where I can reliably and comfortably work on my computer, without spending too much time <em>working on my computer</em>. Don’t get me wrong, I do quite enjoy recompiling kernels and tweaking my workflow - and Linux gives you the most control there - but I still do want a machine I can feel at home in, and not a permanent work-in-progress. Here’s a guide on what I ended up doing to port over the functionality I missed from the Mac and additional improvements made. It was a day or two of work but in the end, I’m happy to say that I haven’t felt the urge to open up my Mac since I finished, despite it being my happy home for the last half-decade or more.</p>

<p>We’ll go through setting up biometrics, backups, gestures, optimizing battery life, and some good alternatives to tools you’ll need.</p>

<h2 id="first-steps">First steps</h2>

<p>Before you get started with the specifics, doing some things first will speed up the process. The tools to work on the tools if you will, and some creature comforts.</p>

<h3 id="gnome-shell-extensions">Gnome Shell Extensions</h3>

<p>Ubuntu uses Gnome 3, which (despite the reports I see online) has been a relatively light and power-sipping window manager in my use. It’s the Goldilocks spot for me - you’ll have better battery life and speed with LFCE, more customization with KDE, but Gnome is yet to give me a reason to leave. Gnome Extensions make it a lot more customizable and powerful, so the first thing you’ll want to do is to install <a href="https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-tweak-tool-on-ubuntu-20-04-lts-focal-fossa-linux">the Gnome Tweak Tool</a>. Don’t forget to install the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gnome-shell-integration/gphhapmejobijbbhgpjhcjognlahblep?hl=en">browser extension</a> for Chrome (or the browser of your choice), it makes installation and management painless.</p>

<p>Once that’s done, you’ll want to install a nice theme and set up a few extensions. Here’s what I’m running:</p>

<p><img src="https://hrishioa.github.io/assets/img/MacToLinux/theme.png" alt="theme"></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1214931/">Flat Remix Blue Theme</a> - simple aesthetic preference but I like the transparency (if it has an impact on battery life I’m yet to see it), and the blue accents.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1485/workspace-matrix/">Workspace Matrix</a> - I held off on this one for a while, hearing about issues but I’ve been a happy camper ever since I switched. Workspace Matrix lets to change the workspace arrangement in Ubuntu (usually top to bottom), to any grid pattern you wish. Set rows to 1 for a more Mac-like experience with workspaces.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/517/caffeine/">Caffeine</a> - very similar to the one I had on MacOS, keeps your device from going to sleep. Turn it on when you’ve got something you’d like to run uninterrupted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/779/clipboard-indicator/">Clipboard Indicator</a>, <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/104/netspeed/">NetSpeed</a>, <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1867/wattmeter/">Wattmeter</a> and <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1082/cpufreq/">CPUFreq</a> - helpful if you’d like to interact with the clipboard, CPU frequency governors and keep track of the internet speed. Netspeed comes in handy when you’re trying to find out whether your program or your connection is being laggy. Wattmeter doesn’t do anything intelligent - it simply multiplies the amperage used by the voltage to get Watts, but it’s been useful in letting me know when Dropbox is eating all of my battery.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/708/panel-osd/">Panel OSD</a> - I hate the default position and background of Ubuntu notifications, and Panel OSD helps move them to a less obtrusive location.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1708/transparent-top-bar/">Transparent Top Bar</a> - I like transparency. I’m one of those people that actually <em>liked</em> Aero effects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/">Dash-to-Dock</a> - I wouldn’t personally recommend dash-to-dock. It’s crashed on me pretty regularly and hiccups on multi-monitor setups. But the rest of the world seems to be having a better experience than me - and it’s great when it works - so it’s worth a try.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="install-a-terminal-emulator-and-a-shell">Install a terminal emulator (and a shell)</h3>

<p>Nothing wrong with the one that comes in the box, but if you’re expecting to spend any time in the Terminal, I would recommend <a href="https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/">Tilix</a>. Pretty lightweight, all the settings I was looking for, and it supports Quake-style dropdown terminal which is a godsend on a small laptop screen.</p>

<p>I also installed <a href="https://dev.to/mskian/install-z-shell-oh-my-zsh-on-ubuntu-1804-lts-4cm4">Zsh and oh-my-zsh</a> that I’d gotten quite used to on MacOS. While I initially hated the reason Apple moved away from Bash, Zsh won me over with its innocent features. <a href="https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k">Powerlevel10K</a> has one of the best set-up processes I’ve ever seen, and <a href="https://github.com/romkatv/gitstatus">gitstatus</a> gets rid of lag when opening a complex git directory. I use node on a regular basis, and adding <code>--no-use</code> to the nvm loading script in <code>~/.zshrc</code> (or <code>~/.bashrc</code>) sped things up quite a bit. Tilix also needs to use the Virtual Terminal Emulator which zsh doesn’t add by default, but <a href="https://github.com/gnunn1/tilix/wiki/VTE-Configuration-Issue">adding it is quite simple</a>.</p>

<h3 id="set-up-gestures">Set up gestures</h3>

<p>I’m placing this early so you don’t have to go through what I did. I had a lot of trouble setting up reliable gestures to port over my muscle memory from MacOS. I failed, gave up, came back and eventually managed to do it. If you do this from the beginning, you won’t need to go through the repeated re-adaptation I needed.</p>

<p>A number of utilities exist for gesture support on Linux and Ubuntu, and I’ve tried most. <a href="https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma">Fusuma</a> was the one that finally worked for me. I’d recommend setting up Workspace Matrix (see above) for a horizontal workspace configuration. Not only is this similar to MacOS, but the up and down gestures are often prevented by applications like Chrome, which seem to want to capture and keep the event for themselves (why this is I have no idea). This means that for three-finger swipe, left and right is far more reliable than up and down.</p>

<p>Best runner up is <a href="https://github.com/Hikari9/comfortable-swipe">comfortable-swipe</a>, which worked well but proved slightly unreliable with gesture recognition. When you’re trying to build in muscle memory, I found that 90-95% wasn’t good enough - your brain simply goes back to the other way of doing it.</p>

<p>I recommend installing the <a href="https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma-plugin-sendkey">sendkey plugin</a> for fusuma, which has lower latency compared to the default <a href="https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool">xdotool</a>. Pinch and four-finger swipes also work well. Here’s my configuration:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>swipe</span><span>:</span>
  <span>3</span><span>:</span>
    <span>left</span><span>:</span>

<h3 id="4-development-environment">4. Development Environment</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/micro">Micro</a> is a good upgrade from nano (if you’re not already on emacs or vim), with clipboard support, good syntax highlighting and plugins. Makes editing the odd commit message or crontab easier.</p>

<p>I’ll also mention VS Code, as porting over settings and extensions took a few extra steps. Proper <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync">Settings Sync</a> isn’t in the stable build yet, so if it still isn’t when you’re reading this, the extension to <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync">sync settings through a gist</a> is a workable option.</p>

<h3 id="file-explorer">File Explorer</h3>

<p>This is entirely personal preference, but I’d recommend <a href="https://itsfoss.com/install-nemo-file-manager-ubuntu/">Nemo</a> over the default Nautilus on Ubuntu. It’s got more settings, looks better (to me), and loads faster on my system. If you’re a Dropbox user and you go this route, you’ll also need <a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/nemo-extensions/tree/master/nemo-dropbox">nemo-dropbox</a> for better integration - although Ubuntu 20.04 doesn’t seem to have proper support just yet. Not an issue - you can install it from the <a href="https://pkgs.org/download/nemo-dropbox">.deb release</a>.</p>

<h2 id="backups">Backups</h2>

<p>The next big thing for me was configuring backups. From past experience, setting up backups is a lot easier on a clean system and a lot easier to forget once you’re up and running. There are a number of good options out there, but I’ll rip the bandaid off: I couldn’t find one that was as good as Time Machine. If you’re looking for something that can backup your entire system into a bootable copy while it’s running, you’ll have to cobble the functionality together in pieces. If anyone knows anything better than what I’m suggesting here, please do reach out - you’ll make my life easier.</p>

<p>For timed backups and archive management, you need something that can keep incremental (or differential) backups and prune old ones. It’s entirely possible to set something up with <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync">rsync</a>, but that comes with its own problems. If you roll your own, you either have to be very diligent in setting it up or make sure you have enough reporting in place. You don’t want to discover that your backups have been silently failing for the last four months, and you certainly don’t want to discover it when staring at a dead machine.</p>

<p><a href="https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Borg</a> has been the best solution for my case, with <a href="https://github.com/borgbase/vorta">Vorta</a> as the GUI. It’s got something of a learning curve, but once it works, it works well. I’m using a Synology NAS at home running RAID as the main onsite backup, and using an SSH Repository worked best for me. Simply mounting an NFS or Samba share will also work, but you then need to take care of making sure the …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>Many people concentrate on saving and investing as a way to achieve their financial goals.  Both of these are easier to grow with a higher income.  No matter what your <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/set-and-achieve-financial-goals/">financial goals</a> are, negotiating a higher salary will make them easier to achieve.</p>



<p>The time you spend researching your fair market value, preparing requests for raises, and making requests for adjustments might very well be the most valuable use of your time.</p>



<p>Considering the importance of salary you would think that people would constantly be on top of their market value ensuring they are compensated fairly.  In my experience this is often not the case.</p>



<h2>Many People are Underpaid and Don’t Even Know it</h2>



<p>Like most people I knew, I never talked about my salary with my friends or co-workers.  It’s taboo for many Americans.  This lack of transparency makes it easy to be underpaid while being unaware of it.  This benefits your employer, but not you!</p>



<p>Once I took on a senior leadership position I begun to understand the severity of differences in how people are compensated for similar positions.  In some cases employees with the same job title were compensated double what others were.</p>



<p>I am sure that most people are aware these inequities exist and might blame them on <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/study-finds-salary-history-bans-boost-pay-for-african-americans-women-11592472602?mod=e2fb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discrimination</a>, differences in quality of work, education or level of education.  In my experience a lack of salary negotiation and keeping their salary up to date is the main driver. </p>



<p>Negotiating your salary can be uncomfortable, and asking for raises can be even more so.  This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it though!  Many will shy away from it and those that do not will end up making much more money over time to do the same job.</p>







<h2>Increases in Salary Compound Over Your Career</h2>



<p>As people get further along in their careers these differences can grow to nearly overwhelming numbers.  Employees can literally make over double what others make for the same job.  This is because of the compounding nature of raises on your salary over the course of your career.</p>



<p>Raises are generally given on a percentage basis of your current salary.  What this means is every single time you get a raise you are also getting a raise on all of your previous raises.  This adds up the same way compound interest adds up.  Over time the numbers can get large and with a 40 year long career for many there can be a lot of time for this to happen.</p>



<h2>Examples of Compounding Salary</h2>



<p>Lets look at a few simple scenarios over a 20 year job with a company.  The first scenario shows the affect of negotiating a higher starting salary and the second one shows the affect of negotiating occasional large raises.</p>



<h3>Affect of Negotiating a Higher Starting Salary</h3>



<p>Jack and Jill both were offered the same job, but Jill negotiated a very modest 10% higher salary than Jack.  They both did well and received 3% raises over the course of 20 years working for the company.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Base</td><td>Year 5</td><td>Year 10</td><td>Year 15</td><td>Year 20</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Jack</td><td>$45000</td><td>$52,167</td><td>$60,476</td><td>$70,108</td><td>$81,275</td><td>$1.29M</td></tr><tr><td>Jill</td><td>$50,000</td><td>$57,963</td><td>$67,195</td><td>$77,898</td><td>$90,305</td><td>$1.43M</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>3% annual raises over 20 years</figcaption></figure>



<p>The $5,000 starting difference turns into a little over $9,000 a year difference over 20 years.  This resulted in Jill making an extra $140,000 over the course of her job with this company.</p>



<h3>Affects of Negotiating Larger Raises</h3>



<p>Here we will modify the above table to show Jill negotiating a 10% raise for herself every 5 years while Jack happily accepts the standard 3%.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Base</td><td>Year 5</td><td>Year 10</td><td>Year 15</td><td>Year 20</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Jack</td><td>$45000</td><td>$52,167</td><td>$60,476</td><td>$70,108</td><td>$81,275</td><td>$1.29M</td></tr><tr><td>Jill</td><td>$50,000</td><td>$61,903</td><td>$76,640</td><td>$94,884</td><td>$117,473</td><td>$1.63M</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>3% annual raises over 20 years, Jill get’s 10% every 5 years</figcaption></figure>



<p>After 20 years with a salary of $81,275 jack would need a whopping 45% raise just to catch up to Jill and still would be behind by $340,000 in lifetime earnings!</p>



<h2>How do I Keep My Salary Up to Date</h2>



<h3>Know Your Fair Market Value</h3>



<p>This always starts with knowing what your fair market value is.  There are several websites that can help here.  I like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.glassdoor.com/" target="_blank">Glassdoor</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.salary.com/" target="_blank">Salary.com</a>.  Do a little research and come up with a range that you feel is reasonable.  </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="548" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image.png?resize=640%2C548&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image.png?resize=640%2C548&amp;ssl=1" alt="salary chart" data-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image.png?w=731&amp;ssl=1 731w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image.png?resize=300%2C257&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Taken from salary.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>You should be honest with yourself about your skills and experience, but I recommend starting at the high end of the range and working down from there.  If someone else can make $100,000 a year doing your job, why not you?</p>



<h3>Getting Your Salary Right to Start</h3>



<p>In my experience the majority of people will accept the first salary offer given.  This is generally a mistake.  Why would a hiring manager make you his absolute top dollar offer to start?  He is generally wise to leave a little room for negotiation for the candidates that do counteroffer.  Some candidates will want to counteroffer no matter what you offer them first!</p>



<p>Once you accept a lower salary it is VERY difficult to get it corrected.  You may have some success here at smaller companies but with larger companies and their bureaucracy don’t get your hopes up.  In my experience the best way to fix this is to find a new job.  You can avoid it by knowing your market value and negotiating a proper base to start.</p>



<h3>Constantly Update Skills</h3>



<p>The job market is always changing.  You need to keep up with it and try to stay out in front of it to maximize your earning potential.  Whatever field you are in set annual goals to achieve certifications, complete continuing education, learn a new tool or attend a conference.  </p>



<p>While one of these things by itself may not change your career, the culmination of annual self improvement over 5 to 10 years can make a massive difference in your marketability.  Senior level employees with relevant certifications and experience can be worth many times what an entry level employee is.</p>



<h3>Take Advantage of Your Time at Work</h3>



<p>You are going to be there for 8 hours a day so you might as well make the most of it.  Always seek out new projects that allow you to learn and develop your skills.  Ask about company paid training, certification or tuition.  Look for ways to add value above and beyond normal for your task.</p>



<p>Most employers will provide you with the tools, money or time to improve your skills because it directly benefits them.  If they won’t help you out here, you may want to re-consider if working there is good for your long term success.</p>



<h3>Write Down Accomplishments as They Happen</h3>



<p>Many companies do a once per year salary adjustment.  Isn’t it basically impossible to remember what all you did when walking into this conversation?</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="426" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist.jpg?resize=640%2C426&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist.jpg?resize=640%2C426&amp;ssl=1" alt="checklist" data-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1022&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1363&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w" data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Keep a running list of your accomplishments</figcaption></figure>



<p>The best way to remember it all is to write it down as it happens.  Keep a running log of your accomplishments. Write them all down and come into the annual review process armed with the information you need.</p>



<h3>Frequently Update Your Fair Market Value</h3>



<p>Your fair market value is likely always changing.  Make sure to check the websites and understand if you are compensated fairly on a regular basis.  Always do this before an annual review.  </p>



<p>If the market has shifted for your skill set, or a new skill you learned is valuable, make sure your employer knows!  This is the time to ask for a larger than standard raise.  That new certification you acquired could be a great reason to go after a 5 or 10% raise this year.</p>



<h2>Asking for an Adjustment When You are Underpaid</h2>



<p>If you want to stick it out with your company, but found that you were underpaid you will need to ask for an adjustment to market value.  I find that the request should have the following basic supporting documentation:</p>



<ol><li>Report’s on salary range for your job from multiple sources.  If you are underpaid, show them multiple sources that validate this.  The more you can find the better.</li><li>Detail any recent skills you have developed or certifications that you have obtained. </li><li>List of recent accomplishments at work that show you have gone above and beyond.  You have been keeping the list like I recommend above right?</li></ol>



<p>I have asked for larger raises(&gt;10%) multiple times in my career and always gotten what I wanted by using the above method.  I have also been asked for raises by quite a few employees over the years.  Those with accompanying documentation like above were taken much more seriously.</p>



<h2>Leave If Your Employer Doesn’t Value You Correctly</h2>



<p>Some employers will never pay you fair market value.  This could be because they don’t value you fairly or because they don’t need the skills you have.  They may also just not have the money in the budget for someone of your skill level.  </p>



<p>Don’t let their decisions hold you back.  If they won’t pay you fairly then be prepared to get up and leave.  If you have been updating your skills regularly as I mentioned above you may find that moving to a better position is surprisingly easy.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I hope this has shed a little light onto the importance of salary negotiations when being hired and frequently during the course of your career.  If you ignore these conversations because they can be uncomfortable you will pay dearly for it over the long term.  </p>



<p>Ultimately, your <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/2020/06/09/net-worth-explained/">net worth</a> can be dramatically reduced and result in you having to work for many extra years in order to meet your <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/set-and-achieve-financial-goals/">financial goals</a>.  You should take charge of this part of your career before you look back and wish you had.</p>

With the US elections closing in, this will be no inadvertent hack.</p><p>Subreddit pages of r/food, r/NFL, and r/space – all with over a million members – were compromised. Banner images of Trump Make America Great Again were all over these pages as well as other related trump-support images.</p><p>These hack attacks were first noticed on Friday morning as there were reports of subreddit moderator’s accounts being accessed without authorization. This included moderator accounts of the previously mentioned pages and also those in smaller niches. Not long after, pro-Trump imagery and messages with “We Stand With Donald Trump #MIGA2020” as the subject were all over the place.</p><p>Speaking on the matter, a spokesperson of the social media platform stated that they are currently carrying out investigation on the subreddits that were hacked and he confirmed that the attacks were carried out via moderator accounts and the accounts were soon to be locked.</p><p>On Twitter, hackers released a tweet claiming responsibility for the attack. In the tweet, they revealed that they were able to carry out the attack using social engineering and password stuffing. It seems to be a get-back to the <a href="https://secureblitz.com/twitter-hack-major-celebrities-accounts-used-for-bitcoin-scam/">Twitter bitcoin hack</a>.</p><p>About 3 weeks ago, some hackers did penetrate through Twitter to perpetrate a Bitcoin scam which involved accounts of top celebrities and public figures. Notably, this included the Twitter account of former vice president and current presidential candidate, Joe Biden.</p><p>Almost not unanticipated, the account of Donald Trump was not compromised with Twitter naming the reason to be that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21327782/trump-twitter-hacked-massive-attack-bitcoin-scam">Trump’s account has extra protections</a>.

That creates a major issue for any organisation in the EU that’s using a service provider (such as a messaging app) that stores - or backs-up - data on servers based outside of the EU. <br></p><p>The ruling comes after several months of pandemic-related lockdown, which has seen organisations turn to messaging apps and collaboration to support widespread working from home. Consumer-grade messaging apps have seeped into organisations, and collaboration tools have been put in place with <a href="https://element.io/blog/seven-questions-to-ask-yourself-about-the-collaboration-tools-you-chose/">more haste than thought</a>. <br></p><div><p>All of which means that centralised messaging apps such as Signal, Telegram and WhatsApp are now under intense scrutiny, as well as collaboration tools such as Slack and Microsoft Teams, and video calling services like Zoom.</p></div><p><strong>The rise of digital sovereignty</strong></p><p>Conscious that centralised systems see their data stored on third party servers in territories outside their own, governments and NGOs have been moving towards digital sovereignty for quite some time.<br></p><p>Certainly for governments, on-premise is a very attractive option. The notion of cloud is not necessarily wrong; at least not at an IaaS or PaaS level, but passing data over to a third party that stores it on servers in a different jurisdiction is now a liability. <br></p><p>In the corporate world, the issue of data residency has been an unsexy, complex topic towards the bottom of both IT and Risk’s long to-do lists. Privacy Shield, the EARN IT Act and the Lawful Access to Encrypted Data (LAED) Act are seeing data sovereignty suddenly shoot up the rankings to become a boardroom issue.<br></p><div><p>Companies are now having to assess their exposure and, suddenly, the idea of handing over sensitive company data to a third party vendor - who stores that data in a completely different country, with different privacy laws and a different privacy culture - seems startlingly shortsighted.</p></div><p><strong>Decentralisation is the foundation for privacy</strong></p><p>The idea of decentralised computing for privacy is not new. It can be traced back to the work of David Chaum and his 1979 decentralised computer system, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mix_network">Mix Network</a>, which paved the way for other protocols such as <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> and <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix;</a> the open, end-to-end encrypted decentralised communication protocol that Element uses.<br></p><p>The original web, of course, was also an open and decentralised network but has become far more centralised - and is now dominated by centralised providers such as Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon.<br></p><p>A decentralised approach enables organisations to participate in a global open network, but to do so while retaining their independence to host and manage their own data - free to choose their own deployment solution, including which countries and jurisdictions.<br></p><p>Conversely the centralised models of Apple (iMessage), Microsoft Teams, Signal, Slack, Telegram and WhatsApp lets those proprietary systems transport, host and own their customers’ data. Some of those organisations’ business model is based upon data mining their customers’ data. Even when that’s not the case, these data honeypots attract all sorts of nefarious attention (such as the recent <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53425822">Bitcoin scam on Twitter</a> and the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53528329">ransomware hit on Blackbaud</a>) including commercial data mining and - as evidenced by EARN IT and LAED - routine surveillance.<br></p><div><p>Matrix, in contrast, provides an open decentralised network that also offers end-to-end encryption and cross-signed device verification. It is the foundation layer for secure, private, decentralised real time communications.</p></div><p><strong>EU rules apply outside of the EU</strong></p><p>When the EU introduced General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) the implications were felt worldwide as it impacted any organisation intending to interact with people protected by EU law. </p><p>GDPR is a relatively straight-forward and high-level piece of legislation put in place to protect people’s rights to personal data protection (indeed it arguably simply extended existing pre-digital consumer protection rights). GDPR underlines that the EU takes the protection of personal data seriously, even if in practice this goal has not always materialised.<br></p><p>Similarly, the Court of Justice of the European Union <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2020-07/cp200091en.pdf">judgement on case C-311/18</a> (colloquially known as Schrems II) that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield agreement fails to provide sufficient protection for personal data, also has ramifications outside of the EU.<br></p><p>It means nearly every privacy consultant, lawyer and Data Protection Officer should be going through a review of their organisational data flows before agreeing on any next steps. <br></p><p>None of Your Business (<a href="https://noyb.eu/en">NOYB</a>), the NGO headed up Max Schrems who challenged Privacy Shield (and its predecessor Safe Harbor) offers this <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/next-steps-eu-companies-faqs">checklist of steps</a>:<br></p><ol><li><em><em><em>Review all your external data flows (including to EU processors or controllers that in turn may transfer data to a non-EU entity) for data flows to third countries</em></em></em></li><li><em><em><em>Identify the relevant legal basis (e.g. Adequacy, Article 49, Privacy Shield, SCCs, etc)</em></em></em></li><li><em><em><em>In relation to 50 USC § 1881a (= FISA 702) and EO 12.333 identify especially any US "electronic communication service providers" and any data flow to the US that is not secured against wire tapping by the NSA (see model requests below)</em></em></em></li><li><em><em><em>Stop your data transfers if: </em></em></em></li></ol><ul><li><em><em><em>You or one of our partners still use the Privacy Shield</em></em></em></li><li><em><em><em>A relevant US entity is an "electronic communication service provider" or</em></em></em></li><li><em><em><em>You cannot protect your data flows from NSA wire tapping</em></em></em></li></ul><ol><li><em><em><em>Notify the DPA if you continue to use SCCs, BCRs or any other instrument despite a negative assessment</em></em></em></li></ol><p><strong>When six worlds collide</strong><br></p><p>It’s difficult to know if the Court of Justice of the European Union ruling that invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield is primarily a clash of ideology, government or technology. But it is safe to say that all three are involved, and that as a result we’re seeing six worlds collide.<br></p><p>The ideological difference is perhaps the most fundamental. It sees the EU’s data subject centric stance in direct conflict with the US’ preference towards centralised control, and a greater comfort-level with technology-enabled surveillance.<br></p><p>Whatever the drivers and complexities, European governments are clearly warmer to open source software than traditional proprietary vendors. They are also demonstrating a growing preference for decentralised systems that grant data sovereignty, as opposed to working with centralised service providers which sees government data locked into the systems of overseas vendors.<br></p><p>For our point of view, we see traditional centralised systems (Slack, Teams, Discord, Signal et al) being displaced by a grass-roots open-source movement. The negative effects of data centralisation have become incredibly clear in recent years thanks to Cambridge Analytica, unilateral algorithmic filtering and surveillance capitalism. The pendulum is swinging back towards an internet which is more open, decentralised, secure and vibrant.</p></div></div>]]>

They consume content written by technical writers in the form of documentation, and they also produce technical content. Companies and open source projects alike understand that well-written documentation is key to product adoption. In fact, </span><a href="https://opensourcesurvey.org/2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>93% of respondents to a 2017 GitHub survey said that “incomplete or outdated documentation is a pervasive problem”</u></span></a><span> in open source.</span></p><p id="viewer-34g8i"><span>So we understand <em>why</em> technical writing matters, but <em>what</em> is technical writing exactly?</span></p><p id="viewer-eglpo"><span>In this post, you’ll learn what technical writing is, discover examples of technical writing in software and beyond, and gain an understanding of other skills technical writers develop to create successful and effective documentation.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-cai1i"><span>What is technical writing?</span></h3><p id="viewer-ec8gf"><span>Technical writing is the practice of creating primarily text-based instructional or informational documents for users. In software development, common genres of technical writing include product and API documentation, manpages, tutorials, and guides. But technical writing isn’t limited to software or even the developer tools space; technical writing also includes user manuals for everything from consumer products to manufacturing, aerospace engineering, and medical technology. And in certain contexts, documents like data visualizations, whitepapers, knowledge bases/online help articles are also forms of technical writing. (Technical writing is a specialty of a much wider field of practice known as technical communication.)</span></p><h3 id="viewer-d3pr5"><span>How technical writing differs from other forms of writing</span></h3><p id="viewer-5spkq"><span>Unlike other forms of writing—for example, marketing or ad copywriting—technical writing aims for precision and utility. Think, for example, of a recipe you get in a meal-delivery kit. The recipe lists the exact ingredients you need and the precise measurements for each ingredient. The writing is both precise and concise; recipe writers know that people who are in the middle of cooking a meal don’t want to follow a super long recipe! Technical writers try to convey information in a similar fashion. The writing style is meant to create a frictionless user experience that is almost imperceptible to the reader. </span></p><p id="viewer-ef2ai"><span>When technical writing is effective, a reader can do more quickly.</span> <span>But when the writing is poor, the reader may have trouble moving forward which can lead to frustration. For example, a developer trying to troubleshoot a problem at work decides to look at the official documentation for a specific package manager. They are in a time crunch and they need to be able to skim the document quickly to find a solution. They’re scanning the page for specific words, phrases, or code snippets that will point them in the right direction. Good technical writing keeps this in mind.</span></p><p id="viewer-26s29"><span>If the troubleshooting steps are vague, incomplete, or full of superfluous language, it will take the developer much longer to accomplish the task. In this scenario, the developer isn’t visiting the docs to admire the writing capabilities of the person who wrote the doc; they’re visiting the docs to help them do something. </span></p><p id="viewer-143dl"><span>Let’s consider an example outside of software. A co-pilot has to refer to a manual in-flight. They need to be able to quickly locate a section in the manual that can help them interpret one of the flight instruments. In this situation, the user (an airplane pilot) cannot afford to spend time pondering what the instructions mean, especially if they’re faced with an emergency. They don’t want jokes or flair, and they don’t want a back story. They want to find the solution to their problem and they don’t want to use more mental energy than they need to. </span></p><p id="viewer-1t39f"><span>This is why some technical documents seem “dry” or “lacking in flair” compared to the writing we see in email newsletters, blog posts, or landing pages. While copywriting is used to persuade a user to take a certain action, technical writing exists to support the user and remove barriers to getting something done. Good technical writing is hard because writers must get straight to the point without losing or confusing readers. It requires a familiarity with the subject matter, the ability to listen and observe, and a deep understanding of the reader.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-c0n7h"><span>Technical writers can do more than write</span></h3><p id="viewer-c63p8"><span>In addition to tone, technical writers pay a lot of attention to document design. We don’t read online content the same way we read content in print, so document design is also dependent on document format. Elements of document design include layout, page formatting, typography, color, and other visual aids. Technical writers structure their documents to facilitate reading comprehension. They understand that many readers skim and scan documents in search of the information they need, and writers look for ways to surface relevant and important information to readers. And they also recognize that users need to take steps in a certain order to achieve the desired result.</span></p><p id="viewer-9hs07"><span>Technical writing isn’t limited to the act of writing a draft. Technical writers must be familiar with research methods, usability, visual design, and instructional design, among other things. They must know their users and the scenarios that drive users to interact with documentation. They have to be able to search for the right information and know how to ask questions of subject matter experts. They understand how text and visual design work together to create a cohesive user experience. And they review and revise their work as needed, acknowledging the importance of editing in the writing process.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-44eps"><span>Want to learn more about technical writing? </span></h3><p id="viewer-4bg5p"><span>I </span><a href="https://github.com/rubymorillo/pocket-tech-writing-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>compiled a list of technical writing resources</u></span></a><span> for continued learning. It includes style guides, books, online material, and courses.</span></p><p id="viewer-1qaan"><span>I learn best in environments where I can learn from experts and apply what I’m learning in the form of a project or an assignment.

<p><em>Update: this generated a pretty good <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24109726">Hacker News discussion</a>.</em></p>



<p>Does your company have a wiki? If you had to guess, what percentage of that wiki would you say is:</p>



<ul><li>Up to date</li><li>Still relevant</li><li>Viewed at least once per year by someone</li></ul>



<p>I’m going to take a wild guess that your answer is somewhere below 25%. If so, you’re saying that over 75% of your company’s wiki is either irrelevant, unused, or downright incorrect. In other words, the vast majority of your company’s wiki is at best not useful, and is at worst actively harmful if it’s giving people incorrect information. </p>



<p>This is called Wiki Rot. It’s spreading in companies worldwide, and it must be stopped. </p>



<p>What if you had to start over? What if, once a year, everything in your company’s wiki was deleted? Call it Wiki Bankruptcy. Here’s how it could go down:</p>



<ol><li>Tell everyone at your company that in 2 weeks, all wiki contents will be deleted. Let everyone take those 2 weeks to copy/back up/download any pages they want to keep.</li><li>After those 2 weeks end, you back up and delete everything in the wiki.</li><li>Tell everyone that they can now resume creating wiki pages, and are free to recreate the pages they thought were important.</li><li>For all of the people who realize they need stuff that they didn’t think about copying in step 1, allow them to access it from your back up from step 2. But do not allow linking directly to pages in that back up, or else you run the risk of people just continuing to read the backed up wiki pages.</li><li>Repeat after 1 year.</li></ol>



<p>Yes, it’s a huge pain, and there will be a couple weeks where everyone is grumpy about it. But Wiki Bankruptcy is the price we must pay to kill Wiki Rot. Wiki Bankruptcy ensures that the vast majority of your wiki will be up to date and relevant, and it’s a sure-fire way to clear out all the cruft nobody is ever looking at anymore.</p>



<p>Now, let’s hear all the reasons why you hate it. <a href="https://twitter.com/mcrittenden">Tweet me about it</a>!</p>

Slides from this talk are available </em><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_DG1mWP8rmDDyjBXPe3q5VE7xPPbfHw1/view?usp=sharing"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><strong>Paul Osman: </strong>I lead the SRE team at Under Armour. Who here knows about Under Armour as a tech company? Does anybody think about Under Armour as a tech company? Under Armour makes athletic attire, shirts and shoes. We are also the company that owns MapMyFitness, MyFitnessPal and Endomondo, which are all fitness trackers that our customers use to either keep track of nutrition goals or fitness goals. That's Under Armour, and specifically that's actually my team. We work on the reliability of those consumer applications.</p><p>I'm going to be talking today about postmortems and the postmortem process. First, I'm going to zoom out a little bit and talk about incident analysis, which is actually a much bigger field. Incident analysis is the study of how to actually analyze what happened during events that we can learn from. I'm going to try to give some lessons that we've learned doing incident analysis.</p><p>Let's talk about postmortems. The term comes from medicine and the actual definition is an examination of a dead body to determine the cause of death. That was the first thing that came up when I Googled it. That's awful. I'm really glad that's not what I do. I have a huge amount of respect for doctors. I don't have the stomach for it, and I'm really glad that nobody tends to die when our systems go down. I'm sure there are maybe some people in this room for whom that's true, but that's certainly not true for us.&nbsp;</p><p>The reason I'm bringing this up is, I hate the term. I hate that we've all decided that postmortem is the term for what we do. I don't think it is, but I'm probably not going to change the vernacular of our industry, so we'll go with it.</p><p>Postmortems have to do with incidents, accidents that happen in production systems usually in this context. <a href="https://twitter.com/allspaw">John Allspaw</a>, who's the former CTO of Etsy, has described incidents this way: “Incidents are unplanned investments.” There's two things that I really like about that. One is the emphasis on the fact that incidents are unplanned. They're surprises. The other thing is that they're investments. Incidents take time. They add stress to people's lives, not just customers, but internally to engineers, people who are working customer support cues, and other stakeholders.</p><p>These are all people that we're paying. If we're making that investment, then what we talk about when we discuss postmortems and the postmortem process is opportunities to try to get some return from those investments. I've always thought of incident analysis or postmortems as opportunities for trying to recoup some return on that investment of that incident. What are those returns going to look like?</p><p>Action items are one way that we can recoup some return on those investments. Increasingly, I'm becoming convinced, however, that the real return is actually in learning. If we can figure out ways to improve how learning happens internally after an incident, then we improve lives for our customers and for our engineers, and we generally get better as an organization.<br></p><blockquote>Increasingly, I'm becoming convinced, however, that the real return is actually in learning. If we can figure out ways to improve how learning happens internally after an incident, then we improve lives for our customers and for our engineers, and we generally get better as an organization.</blockquote><p>In practice, this is roughly what that process might look like: you construct a timeline of events that took place during an incident, you get a big group of people together—it can vary in size from the people who are directly involved in an incident to being an open invitation to everyone in the company—and you discuss that timeline. You go over the causal chain of events and then you talk about what went well. What are the things that we should preserve? You talk about what went wrong. And, depending on the group, this can get to be a very interesting discussion. Out of that, there will be a bunch of action items and that's the real value that you get.&nbsp;</p><p>This is definitely how I used to think about incidents. This was my primary mental model and it served me for a while. It definitely resonated with teams I was on and there is some use to it. But what are the problems here? I think there are a few.</p><p>One of the things that I found is that I've been a part of many postmortem review meetings where attendance was really poor. That's awful. This is an opportunity to learn from things that happened and to get better, so it shouldn't be like that. That seems like we might be doing something wrong. I've also heard people discuss these as theater, and I've certainly described them as theater in the past, meaning there's a trap you can fall into where you go through this review process, you generate a bunch of action items at the end and you're done, and then those action items sit in a backlog forever. That can really detract from morale and contributes to the first problem which is people not being excited to go to these things.</p><p>The other thing is that the timeline can be just pre-agreed upon. In this model, you've already assembled the timeline. You've come up with what happened by the time you get a group of people together to discuss it. That can be limiting.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the problems that I started to think about is that big meetings aren't the best place to talk about that timeline. If you are getting a big group of people together and you're asking them about this incredibly stressful, sometimes traumatic event, then having a big group of people isn't going to encourage people to get back into that mindset where they were responding to an incident. Maybe it was 2:00 in the morning, maybe they were under a lot of stress. I don't know about you, but a big group is not the place where I necessarily want to go through that again.<br></p><blockquote>One of the problems that I started to think about is that big meetings aren't the best place to talk about that timeline.

This is something that we've started experimenting with, which is having one-on-one interviews as part of your review process. Actually, <a href="https://twitter.com/MissAmyTobey">Amy Tobey</a> has a great talk called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFiF-G10WY">One-on-One SRE</a>. Amy talks about her experiences conducting these interviews as part of the postmortem review process. We've started doing this internally at Under Armour and it has dramatically improved the experience.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the things that I found in conducting these interviews is that you can do things that you can't do in big meetings, which is like establish rapport, relate experiences, get people talking about what mindframe they were in, and what context they had during the response. Funnily enough, I've had people give me feedback that when we go through the process like this where someone interviews them and then we get together as a big group and we read back what we've been told, people felt more heard than if they were actually just given the floor during a postmortem review process. That was a really interesting takeaway for me.&nbsp;</p><p>But more than anything else, some of the gems that have come out of these interviews have been amazing. People talking about the ergonomics of tools that they're using, talking about some dashboard where they know is not right. There are all sorts of things that can come up in that one-on-one context that might not necessarily get surfaced otherwise. This emphasizes something I wanted to bring up. I've experienced this a lot and I've heard this repeated a lot: blamelessness is not the same as psychological safety.&nbsp;</p><p>Psychological safety is super important, and I think it's a great thing, but it's not blamelessness. What I mean by that is you can have a group of people who are super psychologically safe or comfortable with being vulnerable in front of each other, who are really close and work as a team effectively, and they will still not come up with this info. If you're doing things in a certain way, they will still be susceptible to falling into traps.<br></p><blockquote>Psychological safety is super important, and I think it's a great thing, but it's not blamelessness.</blockquote><p>Blamelessness is not being safe to say, "I fucked up," because that's still centering you as the person who made a bad decision, which is actually inherently blameful even though it's an example of psychological safety. This tends to tease out some of these subtle nuances in the way that we use some of the vernacular.</p><p>Another problem that I've certainly experienced is that action items never get done. You have these postmortem review processes and these action items just sit at the bottom, which really makes me question if they're the key value that comes out of these things. If action items aren't getting done, are they that important or was the process geared to generate action items and that's why you did them?</p><p>Another thing that I've noticed here is that action items get done and you didn't know about it. You had the meeting, you went through what went well, what didn't go well, and you generated a list of action items. It turns out there's a whole bunch of stuff that engineers actually already did. Well, how could they know? You hadn't had the meeting yet, you hadn't come up with a list of action items, but it's because they had the context right after the incident.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have that engineer who's like, "You know what? I've been meaning to fix that thing. I knew it was wrong. We just had an incident; I'm going to schedule like five hours and just fix this thing,” that's not going to come up in one of these meetings necessarily, but you still want to capture that. This can be more …</p></div></div>

            <ul>
              <li><code>autoRun</code> (default: <code>true</code>): if <code>false</code>, call <code>topbar.progress()</code> manually to run.</li>
              <li><code>barThickness</code> (default: <code>3</code>): the progress bar thickness.</li>
              <li><code>barColors</code>: list of gradient color stops used to draw the progress bar.</li>
              <li><code>shadowBlur</code> (default: <code>10</code>): the shadow blur.</li>
              <li><code>shadowColor</code>: the shadow color.</li>
              <li><code>className</code>: the CSS class name for the progress bar.</li>

            <p>Note: <code>topbar.progress()</code> can take a number or string value. If string, you can use <code>+</code> or <code>-</code> to change the progress relatively to current position. If no argument is specified, return the current progress (<code>0</code> to <code>1</code>).</p>
            Show Progress
            Hide Progress
            <pre>$('#btnStartAdvanced').click(function() {

Because we don't really know," Joordens&nbsp;told CBC Ottawa.</p>  <p>Joordens said the concept particularly doesn't work well for younger folks who want&nbsp;to socialize and meet new people, be it friends or romantic partners.</p>  <p>"It almost becomes the opposite of what [it's]&nbsp;meant to be. It's meant to be a really safe space, but [it isn't]&nbsp;if one member of that bubble brings the virus into it."</p>  <h2>Difficult in practice</h2>  <p>For many people, the bubbles — also known as social circles — are a conundrum,&nbsp;said Dr. Gerald Evans, a professor and chair of the infectious diseases division of the department of medicine at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont.</p>  <p>Evans said many of them can't remain&nbsp;pure, given&nbsp;that people often come into close contact with others outside their bubbles.</p>  <p>"What people don't fundamentally understand is that&nbsp;then allows for transmission of the virus from one circle to another," he said.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="" sizes="" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5678685.1597065218!/fileImage/httpImage/bubble-explainer-gif.gif"></p></div><figcaption>If just one person in a bubble comes into close contact with another person in another bubble, it opens up their bubbles to more potential sources of exposure.<!-- --> <!-- -->(CBC News)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>The challenge to maintain an "exclusive" bubble will be particularly difficult with schools opening in the fall, Evans said.</p>  <p>Most parents have&nbsp;likely been able to restrict the size of their social network during isolation, he said, but September will pose a whole new challenge.</p>  <p>"These are kids who have been starving for some social contact ... so it's going to be very, very difficult to control that."</p>  <h2>'It's kind of like counting calories at this point'</h2>  <p>Ottawa parent Ash Zade is facing that very challenge.</p>  <p>Zade said his family&nbsp;has tried to only be around those in their bubble: four grandparents and one or two families in their neighbourhood.</p>    <p>But he's concerned about sending his four-year-old daughter to junior kindergarten in September, given he was already running into problems with his two-year-old daughter attending&nbsp;home daycare,&nbsp;which exceeded the family's bubble limit.</p>  <p>His&nbsp;wife is an elementary school teacher, which only makes it more complicated.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"It's kind of like counting calories at this point, where you're like, 'Fruit doesn't count,'" he said. "So daycare, we don't count as [part of the] 10. Although we should."&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5594646.1596835677!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/covid-19-back-to-school.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5594646.1596835677!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/covid-19-back-to-school.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5594646.1596835677!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/covid-19-back-to-school.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5594646.1596835677!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/covid-19-back-to-school.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5594646.1596835677!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/covid-19-back-to-school.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5594646.1596835677!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/covid-19-back-to-school.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Parents like Ash Zade and Natalee Rubec say when schools reopen in September, there's no way they'll be able to maintain a 10-person social bubble.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Ben Nelms/CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Natalee Rubec, a mother of four who works full time from home, said if her kids return to school in September, they would all be going to four separate schools&nbsp;— meaning four times the exposure.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"By my calculations, it effectively opens our bubble from 10 to 15 to 18,300," she said. "It's an impossible situation."&nbsp;</p>    <h2>Bubble tensions</h2>  <p>Joordens said the habits that people are&nbsp;forming post-lockdown will be difficult to change, especially within families and friend groups.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"I think we had a certain safety when we were under lockdown in our own place. But now&nbsp;... we're&nbsp;all gambling with other people's money to an extent."&nbsp;</p>    <p>He said one big anxiety-inducing issue&nbsp;is not knowing whether it's safe to visit&nbsp;grandparents or family if your bubble has expanded.</p>  <p>"If you're in a bubble and you feel like somebody else in the bubble is not taking things seriously — and they're&nbsp;thereby endangering everyone in your bubble&nbsp;— it leads to a lot of uncomfortable discussions and arguments."</p>  <p>He's also worried those who've gotten more at ease during the pandemic&nbsp;might not even know they're potentially putting themselves and others at risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>"They've been living in the bubble&nbsp;and feeling safe&nbsp;and engaging in certain behaviours," he said.

The standard advice is to take an iterative approach, prioritising things and then cycling quickly through them, finding solutions just good enough to move things forwards before moving onto the next thing.</p><p data-reactid="45">It's good advice, but hard to follow in practice. Often when you explore solutions to a problem, even simple ones, the problem reveals itself to be more complex than you'd anticipated. You find sub-problems, and tangental problems, which look just as important as the original. It's easy to go off track and end up deep into the problem you were supposed to just find a quick solution to. After all, it's just one more thing, you're thinking about it, and you'll have to solve it at some point anyway. Why not now?</p><p data-reactid="46">I've made this mistake a lot. I'm trying to get better at being strict about saying "not now" to new problems that I discover in the middle of an iteration, and avoid getting sidetracked from shipping by working on things that can be left for later. I'd like to share a tactic I use to do this that has worked well for me. It's to ask a simple question about each new problem I encounter: "From my perspective right now, is this a nice problem to have?". If yes, I skip it. If no, I work on it immediately.</p><p data-reactid="48">An example to illustrate is signup functionality. Let's say I'm starting on a new product. Without signup, there's no possibility of getting any users, which is a problem. From my perspective right now, is this a nice problem to have? No - I have zero users right now, and can't get any until signup is done. The only way to move forwards is to build signup.</p><p data-reactid="49">Whilst I'm building signup, I realise that I probably also need reset password functionality. If a user signs up, but then forgets their password, that's a problem. But from my perspective right now, is this a nice problem to have? Actually, yes! I have zero users, but having this problem implies I would have users, which would be great. Reset password functionality is important, and will absolutely be required eventually, but I can do it later. First, I should ship anything that's stopping me from getting users in the first place.</p><p data-reactid="51">There are always tiers of functionality which build upon one another, and this simple question provides a neat hack to sort things in order of when they'll actually be useful so you can build and ship that functionality in faster iterations, rather than delaying shipping while you batch and build everything up front. Try it out when you next build something.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

            <p>What does the upstream for major packages <em>really</em> look like? Over the past few years, the shape of the open source ecosystem landscape has shifted drastically, exploding both in the volume of published code, and also the number of dependencies that live upstream from a given library.</p><h3 id="scoping-the-discussion">Scoping the Discussion</h3><p>In order to have a real discussion about software packages and ecosystem health, it's important to first understand the current state of the ecosystem. &nbsp;For the sake of simplicity, we'll keep the focus of this discussion to NPM - which represents the logical extreme of the problems and ideas discussed here. Keep in mind, however, that this is <em>absolutely</em> not exclusively a Javascript issue - a cursory glance shows that all of these <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09535">problems are just as present and relevant in every other programming language ecosystem</a> - even if the awareness is somewhat lower.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div><p>

While code reuse has probably been a part of software development from the earliest days of industry, the practices around this period began to favor it very heavily - during this decade, languages and APIs &nbsp;built around Object Oriented (OO) concepts started to really rise to prominence, and the earliest iterations of package managers were minted. Interface definitions and library packaging were at the forefront of the tooling. If we fast forward to the end of the 90's, specifically to the year 1999 - the year when <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em> was published - we see this whole concept codified with the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. &nbsp;This, to be entirely fair, is a great thing for software - reusing previously-written code (that has already been tested, validated, and vetted) probably saves billions in development costs annually. On the other hand, however, it <em>does</em> come with some implicit risks.</p><h3 id="software-reuse-the-implications">Software Reuse: The Implications</h3><p>While all of this was not only very well intentioned, but also a generally smart way to think about the problem, the landscape has shifted drastically since then. Gone are the days when the people <em>behind</em> the software you consume as part of your build process are really understandable - the scope and scale of the open source ecosystem have ballooned over the last few years, and continue to do so at every turn. The implication here is two-fold: Firstly, it is difficult to really reason about <em>what</em> you are incorporating into your codebase when leveraging an external library, giving rise to a whole host of paid solutions that simply provide you with a "bill of materials," and second, there are a whole host of hidden costs bundled into the upstream packages and libraries. The technical debt contained in those packages becomes <em>your</em> technical debt, their issues (to varying degrees) become <em>your</em> issues. This also leads to a great deal of what-ifs: <em>what if</em> one of those packages has a critical vulnerability? <em>What if</em> one of them contains licenses that may impact your commercial viability? <em>What if</em> some of them are abandoned? <a href="https://blog.bitsrc.io/malicious-npm-development-kit-a02401e6537e?gi=8b38c3b8b606">Contain malware? Have backdoors?</a> &nbsp;</p><p>The short answer is: All of these are valid concerns. Some of them have come to the forefront of the public focus (particularly issues around licenses and vulnerabilities), but as for the rest - they represent a veritable ticking time bomb in the community; one which has arguably gone off <em>already</em> in the form of <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2020/04/rubygem-typosquatting-malware.html">700 malicious RubyGems</a>, hundreds to thousands of de-listed npm packages, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/8hvzja/backdoor_in_sshdecorator_package/">dozens</a> <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/malware-in-pypi-code-shows-supply-chain-risks/d/d-id/1335310">of</a> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/two-malicious-python-libraries-removed-from-pypi/">Python</a> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/malicious-python-libraries-targeting-linux-servers-removed-from-pypi/">libraries</a>, and <a href="https://containerjournal.com/topics/container-security/docker-hub-distributing-cryptomining-malware/">tens of Docker images</a>, among others (while I <em>did</em> promise up front that we'd be focused on NPM, it very much bears mentioning the scope of these issues in other, tangential ecosystems).</p><h3 id="rough-numbers">Rough Numbers</h3><p>So even <em>if</em> we believe that all of this is a big issue, that begs the question: How big is it? Just to get a rough idea, this <a href="https://www.linux.com/news/state-union-npm/">"State of the Union"</a> post about NPM (published in early 2017) indicates that in 2015 - 5 years ago (at the time of writing) - NPM contained a scant 12,500 packages. Fast forward to today, and it contains <em>nearly 1.4 million</em>, and continues to grow at an average rate of almost 900 a day. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.phylum.io/content/images/2020/07/npm-growth.PNG" alt="npm growth rate"><figcaption>NPM Growth Trajectory - Graph courtesy of modulecounts.com</figcaption></figure><p>Keep in mind that this is <em>net new</em> packages - not at all counting updates to existing ones under active development. </p><p>What does this really mean, though? Do we really care about the <em>size</em> of the ecosystem if we only use one or two major packages during development? In order to get a better understanding here, we did some more detailed analysis on React (an immensely popular UI framework, for those unfamiliar) to figure out what its dependency graph looks like. A first pass at this seemed like a good spot to simply look at some products that do commodity "bill of materials" and vulnerability analysis. Picking a popular tool, we checked out the latest react build (at the time of writing), and looked to see what its dependency tree would look like: </p><figure><img src="https://blog.phylum.io/content/images/2020/07/react-s-number.PNG" alt="React Dependencies Misleading"><figcaption>Proported React Dependency Count</figcaption></figure><p>At first glance, this doesn't really seem to tell the whole story; if we pull open react's <code>package.json</code> directly, we also see this: </p><figure><img src="https://blog.phylum.io/content/images/2020/07/react-dev-deps.PNG" alt="react dev dependencies"><figcaption>... And on for tens more lines</figcaption></figure><p>The <code>"devDependencies"</code> are totally ignored! While this may not seem like a big deal at first blush (they aren't included in the final build, after all!), in many ways, they actually pose an even <em>bigger</em> security threat than the production dependencies. Production dependencies for React run in the web browser's sandbox - and while there is certainly a <a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/im-harvesting-credit-card-numbers-and-passwords-from-your-site-here-s-how-9a8cb347c5b5">whole host of bad stuff that can be done there</a>, dev dependencies have the ability to interact directly with the host they are running on without any sandbox, meaning they are free to access files, connect to remote servers, and run additional programs with the same permissions as the current user. </p><p>Really, at its core this means that fundamentally untrusted code, written by random developers, runs on sensitive systems where security credentials are stored, such as developer workstations, CI runners, and more. If stealing some customer data here and there from the browser seems really bad, what does the ability to steal any keys, credentials, and access that a developer or CI runner has the ability to access mean? Most developers have root access to their own system, and often have access to sensitive infrastructure and data, including production systems. CI runners are often worse - modern CI/CD processes frequently inject credentials to <em>everything</em> during the build and deployment process, giving an attacker the proverbial "keys to the kingdom".</p><p>To make matters even worse, simply looking at the <code>package.json</code> doesn't <em>really</em> tell the whole story - nearly all of the dependencies in that list in turn have dependencies, which <em>in turn</em> have more dependencies, and so on. If we pull down the <em>entire</em> graph just for React, we get something like <em>7,000 total dependencies for a single library. </em></p><figure><img src="https://blog.phylum.io/content/images/2020/08/react-deps.jpg" alt="react full dependency graph" srcset="https://blog.phylum.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/react-deps.jpg 600w, https://blog.phylum.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/react-deps.jpg 1000w, https://blog.phylum.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/react-deps.jpg 1600w, https://blog.phylum.io/content/images/2020/08/react-deps.jpg 1621w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The <em>real</em> dependency graph</figcaption></figure><p>To be totally clear, this is <em>not</em> what you'll get every time you run <code>npm install</code>, but rather a <em>superset</em> of what you'll get during that process. Due to semantic versioning (notionally, the option to specify <em>ranges</em> of acceptable package versions in your <code>package.json</code> which will satisfy a dependency), it is all but impossible to say exactly <em>what</em> you'll get <em>a priori</em>, as large parts of the dependency graph may change substantially between package versions. </p><p>Really, all of this simply compounds the root problem: well meaning development principles have been pushed to their logical extreme. This ultimately makes simply understanding what you'll get with a given install an almost impossibly hard problem. This is doubly true if you want to develop anything more than a cursory understanding of the stuff that sits upstream from your development efforts - not mentioning the authors and maintainers <em>behind</em> those packages.</p><h3 id="not-just-security">Not <em>Just</em> Security</h3><p>While security concerns are certainly at the forefront of this discussion, a whole separate class of issues presents itself here: How does the code quality of upstream packages impact the technical debt of your projects? While this seems like sort of a subjective thing to measure on its face, some clear problems present themselves: Does the repository in question have good test coverage? Does it have unit tests at all? What about the contributors, how responsive are they to issues? How many contributors have the ability to commit code - if it is only one, what will happen if that contributor stops working on the project? And as a follow on, does the repository appear to be abandoned?</p><p>These are certainly all concerns for every consumer of open source - issues in any of these areas in a single library will be issues for every package that depends upon them. </p><h3 id="it-only-gets-worse">It Only Gets Worse</h3><p>While all of this seems bad enough, what about updates to those 7,000 existing packages? Even if we have undeniable proof that all of the authors sitting upstream are honest and well intentioned, what happens if they suffer a credential breach, like the <a href="https://duo.com/decipher/docker-hub-breach-can-have-a-long-reach">relatively-recent one suffered by Docker Hub</a>? Additionally, what if their account credentials are compromised in some other way? Either scenario puts every package downstream completely at the mercy of whoever obtains their credentials. This may seem like something of a hypothetical situation, but that is unfortunately not the case; doing some very high-level sampling of some top contributors (with hundreds of published packages, all upstream from dozens of major projects) and comparing the results with some major password breach datasets yielded disturbing results: <em>the very first</em> such contributor we looked at appeared in no less than three such datasets, with the same password in use in all cases - a password extremely vulnerable to dictionary attacks, no less. At this point, …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <!-- Toc if any -->
                
                    
                    
                
                <!-- End Toc -->
                <p>I’ll tell you some of my opinions about Software Architecture and what are our plans for Looset.</p>

<p>It’ll watch you source files changes to show in real time a dependencies diagram and Code Block viewer independent of the filesystem. Check it out on the <a href="https://jponline.github.io/looset-landing/">main page</a>.</p>

<p>We haven’t started to work in Looset yet, but I’ve thought a bit about its architecture. I believe the “building” metaphor is bad when talking about software, I prefer the “grow” metaphor. When we think about our software as a living organism that needs constant care we make better decisions about it.</p>

<p>There are a lot of rules around how to create software, “you should use this design pattern”, “you should write your tests first”, TDD, “you should model according to your domain first”, DDD, “behavior first”, BDD, SOLID, Hexagonal (Onion) Architecture, Layers and Modules, etc. I value most of what I mentioned here, but I prefer to understand the principles they reflect. In this direction I like <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/">The Art of Unix Programming</a> and there’s a summary of the principles stated there in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Eric_Raymond's_17_Unix_Rules">a wiki</a>.</p>

<p>I’m influenced by two other ideas: The first, I’ve heard from Martin Fowler, opposing the statement that “The architect is the responsible for making the big important initial decisions” he said something as <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/oss-lockin.html">“The architect should let options open”</a>. The second I got by reading <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-architecture-a/9780134494272/#toc">Clean Architecture</a> by Uncle Bob, where he points out that the farther a module is from the business rules, more this module should work as a plugin. I.e, frameworks and databases should work as plugins. And then I started to think what other decisions can I let open and structure as a plugin? Maybe an i18n system, maybe the programming language itself.</p>

<p>To see this project becoming reality you can contribute in the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/looset-team/looset?ref=1i0fmm">Kickstarter Campaign</a>. We’re asking what we need to be able to work on it, and it will be a Free Open Source Software.</p>

<p>I have some general goals when writing software:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Extensibility: that the accretion of features don’t become slow and dangerous to existent features when the projects grow big.</li>
  <li>Readability - Easy to read and understand.</li>
  <li>Maintainability, Flexibility or Testability - Decoupling in a way that if we change a module it won’t break the system in different places.</li>
  <li>Robust - Handles well unexpected errors.</li>
</ul>

<p>For Looset we have some more specific goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Community contribution</li>
  <li>Speed</li>
  <li>Modularity</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="back-end">Back-end</h2>
<p>I’ve been working in Clojure for some time now and it has been a constant match between my personal development philosophy and its own and community philosophy. But I understand that other people might have other personal preferences or use a different stack that works better in specific domains.</p>

<p>For this reason we decided to write Looset modules as independent scripts programs that are called using bash. For instance we’ll write a Basic Analyzer in Clojure using <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/babashka">babashka</a>, but we’ll let it open for other language specific analyzers to be written in any script language. What could be seen as a sort of Micro Service architecture. One could decide to use Python to write an analyzer for C or even integrate a project as <a href="https://lezer.codemirror.net/">Lezer</a>.</p>

<p>In Clojure, most of the data are maps, it is part of the philosophy. As data will need to be shared across different languages and even the front end, it’d make sense to write it in Clojure EDN (Extensible Data Notation), but thinking in more general adoption we’ll write the data as files in JSON, also being inspired on how Git works.</p>

<h2 id="front-end">Front-end</h2>
<p>Most people would agree that making decisions about the Front-end is very different from making decisions about the back-end. But we still want to maximize the community contribution and modularity, still letting options open. So we decided to write Looset views as independent Web Components that will be used in a basic HTML page. For instance we’ll write components using Clojurescript and <a href="https://reagent-project.github.io/">Reagent</a>, but we’ll let it open for other languages and frameworks that support exporting as Web Components. One could decide to use Angular or Vue.js to write a new functionality.</p>

<p>I’ve already created a web app from scratch without a State Management System as Redux or <a href="http://day8.github.io/re-frame/">Re-Frame</a> and I know how this is important. I would say that the most important is not the library but the idea, so the main point is to have the app state to be global, change it by firing events and subscribe components to the changes. I’m still investigating how we’re going to use it in a way it’s available to any web component in any framework.</p>

<p>Other decisions about how to structure the app state also needs to be done. I like to have it as normalized as possible and splitting what are domain entities (basically what we would write in a database) and UI models (component states) also computing as little as possible in the rendering phase, <a href="https://cognitect.com/blog/2017/5/22/restate-your-ui-using-state-machines-to-simplify-user-interface-development">treating the UI as a Finite State Machine</a>.</p>

<h2 id="tests">Tests</h2>
<p>I like the Test Driven Development approach, what is good not only for tests but for structuring dependencies in a testable way. I tend to write them in a BDD style using the <a href="https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/">Given, When, Then Gherkin syntax</a>. We’ll mostly write unit tests for the back-end, but I don’t think unit tests are that valuable for the front-end. I’ve already used <a href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer">Puppeteer</a> to write end-to-end tests, clicking in buttons, taking screenshots, etc. But for Looset we’ll use it basically to have a production like environment, but only firing events and checking the result app state.</p>

<p>Another strategy that is sometimes viewed as tests, but I use more as a way to develop and prototype is <a href="https://github.com/bhauman/devcards">Devcards</a>. We’ll use it to visualize all components in multiple states at once while we’re developing and tweaking the app state.</p>

<h2 id="speed">Speed</h2>
<p>In most projects the performance is not a top priority for me because I don’t expect to work with huge amounts of data, what’s different in this project. A main concern is how fast it’s going to be to interact with big projects generating large graphs. To address this problem we’ll have Web Workers or background processes generating caches for the visualizations.</p>

<h2 id="kickstarter">Kickstarter</h2>
<p>We created a campaign to both validate the interest and also to be able to invest the amount of time that this project requires. The campaign asks for a one time contribution of any amount and it’s all or nothing, you’ll be changed at the end of the month and only if we reach the goal.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>First off, no-code isn't going to replace code. No-code is simply a set of tools and products that allow someone to do previously difficult actions without hand-writing the code involved.</p><p>Most websites are built with a common set of building blocks, so a few companies got together and made tools that package those building blocks and let you assemble them however you want - namely Wix, Wordpress, SquareSpace, and Webflow.</p><p>Most web/phone apps are built with similar base structures and rely on simple backend databases, so a few companies created tools that made organizing those structures and databases easy - namely Glide, Adalo, and Bubble.</p><p>Then, on a deeper level, there are tools that tie other tools together, creating workflows between components and letting you build larger structures. A few companies that do that are Zapier, Integromat, and Parabola.</p><p>But let's get one thing straight, all these tools work within expected parameters. They were created to solve simple development problems people had over and over again, and thus, they can't go outside those expected parameters. If you have an insane idea for a software product that breaks a ton of new ground, you probably can't build it with no-code. If you have an app idea that's super insane and unique, you probably can't build it with no-code.</p><p>But, if your idea even remotely fits into the building blocks of what's been done before, no-code can be extremely powerful. With a tool like Adalo, and a little practice, you can whip up a fully-functional marketplace app with payment processing, backend databases, and everything else in about two hours. Your idea doesn't have to be incredibly unique to be successful - and no-code can help you build and perfect that first MVP insanely quick. That's what it's good for.</p><p>As an example, ProductHunt is a super successful company - but their site could be built on Webflow and Zapier in less than a day. It's not the tech that's the valuable part, it's the market gap they filled.</p><p>So, no-code is useful for anyone looking to quickly make a piece of technology come to life. I especially love it because you don't need to learn an entire programming language to get started. You do need to understand some basic programming logic to get into advanced functionality, but you're no longer dealing with syntax, you're just building. No-code is also incredibly useful for businesses looking to automate some simple tasks - if you're not trying to build some entirely new product.</p><p>This does replace some code, in the sense that you might not need a technical co-founder right away, or need to hire a consultant to solve a simple tech problem. You may be able to prototype your idea quickly, and start testing. In a lot of cases, even if you're already incredible at programming, you might want to use no-code to start. Often times, no-code tools work off pre-built templates that already optimized for UI/UX and design - you won't have to worry about any of that, and you can always re-build it from the ground up later if you want. I personally think all minimum viable products should be created with no-code to start (if possible) so if your initial draft doesn't stick (and it rarely does) you can change everything super rapidly.</p><p>I was personally able to spin up a small app from a google sheet in less than 20 minutes using Glide, and now I can quickly publish that and start messing with it until something sticks.</p><p>I'm no expert on no-code, but I've been learning a ton from some lessons at Makerpad - would recommend you check it out if you want to get started yourself.</p><p>Also, if this was valuable at all, a retweet would help me spread the word a ton - no pressure though, of course. :)</p></div></div>]]>

<div>
      <p>ARM CPUs are coming to Java. Amazon offers cloud instances based on ARM-compatible processors. And there is now a <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/388">new JEP to create an OpenJDK port for Windows on ARM</a>. And Apple plans to use ARM Processors for its Macs and Macbooks.</p>
<p>What is the difference between ARM and x86 when we program in Java? As long as you follow the rules: None. So let us break the rules</p>

<p>The following test leads to different results on the two processor types. We use a dedicated tool for those types of tests, <a href="https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/CodeTools/jcstress">the OpenJDK tool jcstress</a>. The test consists of two methods which are annotated with the annotation <code>@Actor</code>. The annotated methods get called from different threads:</p>
<pre>public class TestReorderWriteWrite {
 SingeltonWithDataRace singelton = new SingeltonWithDataRace();
 @Actor
 public void actor1(II_Result r) {
  if (singelton.instance().initialized) {
   r.r1 = 1;
  } else {
   r.r1 = 0;
  }
 }
 @Actor
 public void actor2(II_Result r) {
  if (singelton.instance().initialized) {
   r.r2 = 1;
  } else {
   r.r2 = 0;
  }
 }
}</pre>
<p>The class <code>Singelton</code> checks if the variable <code>instance</code> is null and if yes, creates a new <code>SingeltonValue</code>:</p>
<pre>public class SingeltonWithDataRace {
 SingeltonValue instance;
 public SingeltonValue instance() {
  if (instance == null) {
   instance = new SingeltonValue();
  }
  return instance;
 }
}</pre>
<p>SingeltonValue sets the variable <code>initialized</code> to true in the constructor:</p>
<pre>public class SingeltonValue {
 boolean initialized;
 public SingeltonValue() {
  initialized = true;
 }
}</pre>
<p>Since we always first write to the variable <code>initialized</code> and then to <code>instance</code>, the variable <code>initialized</code> should always  be true. If I run this test on my development machine, an Intel i5 4 core CPU, I see the following results.</p>
<pre>  Observed state   Occurrences              Expectation
            1, 1      52368551               ACCEPTABLE</pre>
<p>So as expected the variable <code>initialized</code> is always true. Running the same test on an ARM AWS Graviton Processor with 2 vpus gives the following results:</p>
<pre>  Observed state   Occurrences              Expectation
            0, 0             0                FORBIDDEN
            0, 1             7   ACCEPTABLE_INTERESTING
            1, 0            14   ACCEPTABLE_INTERESTING
            1, 1    57,117,820               ACCEPTABLE</pre>
<p>On ARM the variable <code>initialized</code> is sometimes false, the state 0 1 and 1 0. So on ARM the write to <code>instance</code> and to <code>initialized</code> can be reordered, when we read the variables from a different thread. Why?</p>

<p>CPU Cores cache the values from the main memory in caches. This bridges the gap between the fast core and the slower memory system. A read from the level 1 cache is about 200 times faster than a read from the main memory.</p>
<pre>L1 cache reference      0.5 ns
Branch mispredict         5 ns
L2 cache reference        7 ns    14x L1 cache
Main memory reference 	100 ns    20x L2 cache, 200x L1 cache</pre>
<p>From <a href="https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832">jboner/latency.txt</a></p>
<p>The result of the test is the effect of this cache system. The behavior of the cache system is specified in a memory model. A memory model answers the question: What happens when multiple threads access the same memory location?</p>
<p>The two processor types have different memory models. The ARM memory model allows the reordering of two writes to different memory locations. And the x86 memory model forbids this. This is the reason why the test leads to different results on the different processor architectures.</p>
<p>Other reorderings like read and write to different memory locations are allowed by both memory models.</p>

<p>The following test shows this. Again we use two methods annotated with <code>@Actor</code>. The two methods run in different threads during the test. The first method writes to the field <code>first</code> and reads from the field <code>second</code>. The second method writes to the field <code>second</code> and reads from the field <code>first</code>:</p>
<pre>public class TestReorderReadWrite {
 private int first;
 private int second;
 @Actor
 public void actor1(II_Result r) {
  first = 1;
  r.r1 = second;
 }
 @Actor
 public void actor2(II_Result r) {
  second = 1;
  r.r2 = first;
 }
}</pre>
<p>And here are the results from a test run on my development machine, an Intel i5 4 core CPU:</p>
<pre>  Observed state   Occurrences              Expectation
            0, 0     5,688,756   ACCEPTABLE_INTERESTING
            0, 1    46,185,263               ACCEPTABLE
            1, 0    26,244,626               ACCEPTABLE
            1, 1            86               ACCEPTABLE</pre>
<p>Here is the result from the ARM AWS Graviton Processor with 2 vpus:</p>
<pre>  Observed state   Occurrences              Expectation                                  
            0, 0     5,361,697   ACCEPTABLE_INTERESTING                      
            0, 1    55,586,568               ACCEPTABLE           
            1, 0    25,740,292               ACCEPTABLE          
            1, 1             4               ACCEPTABLE</pre>
<p>Sometimes both method reads the default value zero. This means that the read and the write to the variables were reordered.</p>

<p>If we want to write meaningful multi-threaded programs we need a way to tell the processor that he should stop reordering. At least at specific points. The processor provides memory barriers for that. If we annotate the field with a volatile variable the JVM generates memory barriers. Here is the assembler code from my development machine, an Intel i5 4 core CPU:</p>
<pre>movl    $0x1,0xc(%r10)    ;*putfield first
lock addl $0x0,(%rsp)     : Memory Barrier
mov     0x10(%r10),%edx   ;*getfield second                                   </pre>
<p>The JVM inserts the statement <code>lock addl</code>. This makes sure that read and writes do not get reordered.</p>

<p>When we write Java we do not write for a specific processor architecture. So Java also needs a memory model. A memory model which answers the question, what happens when multiple threads access the same memory location, for Java.</p>
<p>The answer is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.4.3">If a program has no data races, then all executions of the program will appear to be sequentially consistent.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sequential consistency means that reads and writes are not reordered. A run of a multi-threaded program is simply one specific interleaving of the source code statements of the different threads.</p>
<p>A Java program is only sequential consistent when it does not contains data races. A data race is a read and a write or two writes to the same memory location which is not ordered by synchronization actions. Synchronization actions like the read and write from a volatile field create an order between multiple threads, the happens-before order. For example the write to a volatile variable happens-before all subsequent volatile reads from this variable. And if all memory accesses can be ordered through this happens-before relation our program is data race free.</p>

<p>The processor core is not the only system that reorders statements. The compiler also reorders statements to improve the performance. Therefore we need a memory model at the language level. Only we, the programmers, can tell how our program needs to be ordered.<br>
But we do not control at which hardware or JVM our program runs on, so we need a way to specify this order in the program code. We do this by the synchronization actions of the Java Memory Model.</p>
<p><img src="https://vmlens.com/img/articles/cp/systemsReordering.png"></p>
<p>Typical suspects for reordering our program are the processor and the JVM compiler, which compiles the bytecode to machine code.</p>

<p>Sarita V. Adve and  Hans-J. Boehm give a nice overview of the reasoning which led to the Java Memory Model in the paper, <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/8/96610-memory-models-a-case-for-rethinking-parallel-languages-and-hardware/fulltext">Memory Models: A Case For Rethinking Parallel Languages and Hardware</a>. And Aleksey Shipilёv, the developer of the tool JCstress, has written <a href="https://shipilev.net/blog/2016/close-encounters-of-jmm-kind/">a comprehensive blog post over the Java Memory Model.</a> And Paul E. Mckenney  gives a detailed view of the cache system in the paper, <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.152.5245">Memory Barriers: a Hardware View for Software Hackers</a></p>

<p>As we have two writes to different variables can only be reordered on ARM CPUs, while it is forbidden on x86 CPUs. The reordering of reading and writing from different variables can be reordered on both CPU types.</p>
<p>When I first read about the Java Memory Model in the book <a href="https://jcip.net/">Java Concurrency in Practice, from Brian Goetz et al.</a> I did not understand it. It took long for me to accept that we need to tell the JVM how memory reads and writes should be ordered. So I am happy that we have now another system, ARM,  which reorders read and writes. And that we can write small Java programs that demonstrate that we need the Java Memory Model.</p>

<p>Microsoft has been in negotiations with TikTok for several weeks and is looking to acquire the social media application for as much as $50 billion. If the acquisition should go ahead despite the complications associated with such a deal, it will likely be one of the largest tech acquisitions to date and carry significant implications for Microsoft’s positioning against its Big Tech competitors. Until TikTok, Microsoft, when compared to Google and Facebook, did not have an avenue to leverage or tap into the internet’s social media revolution. The question, however, remains, despite four decades of exemplary performance as an enterprise service provider, how will Microsoft integrate TikTok into its ecosystem to either augment its existing proposition or create new avenues for value creation?</p>



<p>Assuming the negotiations result in a deal, two potential trajectories emerge for Microsoft in taking TikTok forward. TikTok can be appended to the enterprise and consumer product line Microsoft presently carries, largely acting as an independent entity like Xbox or it can be spun out as a product hub of its own. The decision will hinge on Microsoft’s plans for its future in the consumer sector, with one of the fastest growing consumer reach platforms in the world in its arsenal, Microsoft could springboard off the TikTok deal to become one of the decades unlikeliest Facebook competitors.</p>



<h3>Can TikTok help Microsoft replicate its enterprise success in consumer products?</h3>



<p>Over four decades now Microsoft has been synonymous with enterprise success. Their suite of enterprise products across software, cloud and infrastructure have formed a formidable ecosystem which the company has leveraged to create loyalty amongst its enterprise user base. The Microsoft model of utilising its software touchpoints with companies to onboard other services like cloud and infrastructure products has allowed it to successfully operate without much innovation over the last few years. In its enterprise suite of products the interdependencies are clear and the feedback loop from one to the other forms a convincing argument for why enterprise customers should continue to onboard more and more Microsoft products as they themselves scale and change. Microsoft heavily leans into this advantage, the most recent example being its introduction of Teams. Teams saw very quick adoption amid the pandemic particularly provided its ability to complement other Microsoft enterprise products.</p>



<p>Despite the pervasive reach of the Windows OS into consumer lives, Microsoft has not as successfully created interdependencies across its consumer products. While it offers Microsoft 365 for consumers, this hasn’t been able to strengthen consumer ties to the ecosystem as well as the company was able to in the enterprise sector. Its consumer focused products have not seen similar interdependent success, as it struggles to leverage its consumer relationship to further its ambitions concerning cloud (One Drive), the gaming ecosystem (Xbox) or its search engine (Bing). With the acquisition of TikTok, the question is will social media provide the means to create an interdependent ecosystem that will flush value across Microsoft’s consumer products?</p>



<p>TikTok is bringing with it what most would describe as social capital, user-generated content and access to a new and younger consumer base. These seem like very valuable assets for Microsoft to absorb and flush its ecosystem with stronger consumer touchpoints. It’s important to note that, in this deal, the most important asset Microsoft is acquiring is the consumer base. TikTok users’ unique characteristics of consumption on the platform revolve around a high turn-over rate of content and rapid cycles of endorphin release. Even though a user spends hours on the application, they cycle through the content bank every 1 – 60 seconds placing their rate of consumption at incredibly high levels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A consumer base engaged in this mode of discretionary high-rate of consumption is at odds with the characteristics of the consumers that utilise Microsoft’s other consumer products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it might appear as though the Xbox ecosystem and its users are best aligned with TikTok’s platform, the consumption rate that the physical product of Xbox and the consumption of games represents is still at odds with the TikTok form of consumption. For example, the Xbox ecosystem would have been able to create interdependencies with the likes of a consumer base represented by YouTube users, where both brands share mutual points of value creation in-game streaming and consumption of videos. Given how different TikTok is to anything Microsoft has ever owned, translating engagement and loyalty from the platform to the broader Microsoft ecosystem is not as straightforward as integrating it into a sales funnel alongside Microsoft’s other consumer products.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Microsoft’s path forward with TikTok</h3>



<p>Ultimately TikTok represents an aberration to the Microsoft consumer ecosystem, something the Microsoft team has no experience with to date. The acquisition is focused on ensuring that the value available in its consumer base isn’t dispersed to competing platforms upon being banned in the US – a powerful tool, if it is retained in it, ’s existing form and with its existing user base growth. Tiktok in and of itself is a valuable model and a lucrative platform that is already on its way to profitability. Microsoft’s best play here is to allow TikTok to run as a parallel platform and build out its social capital potential. However, with the acquisition of a consumer social media platform, Microsoft will need to be ready for the societal and regulatory burden of managing misinformation, content moderation and the perceived negative implications of social media overuse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ecosystems as large as Microsoft and GAFA will see the future as a digitally interconnected world where the lines will increasingly start to blur between models servicing consumers and models servicing enterprises. In many ways even now ecosystems that service both already have tenuous links that feed into each other but not explicitly taken advantage of – for e.g. Amazon’s e-commerce data moat feeds into its AI/ML capabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Microsoft’s TikTok acquisition represents a future-proofing strategy rather than an immediately integratable one, in which the world’s largest tech companies will not silo their value capture into enterprise only or consumer only products. Creating interdependencies across the entire product ecosystem is a way to continually innovate and continue compounding on growth. Where Microsoft has done this with its enterprise side to an extent, TikTok and its social capital represent an avenue for true ecosystem innovation – as it matures Microsoft will have more leeway to morph it alongside its own evolution.</p>

<h3><span>Down the Rabbit Hole</span></h3>
</p>



<h3>1. Ecosystems: broadening the locus of value creation</h3>



<p>The pervasive use of the term ‘ecosystem’ to describe business models is a deviation from primary business theory which focuses on supply and value chains to elucidate organizational models. The term ‘ecosystem’ and the stream of research around its related characteristics and modelling is a telling phenomenon of the internet driven transformation of organisations towards greater degrees of connectivity. Kapoor writing for the Journal of Organization Design, explores the usefulness of ecosystem-based theorizing and the tenets that differentiate an ecosystem based perspective from that of value-chains, supply chains, alliances and networks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Simply put, an ecosystem encompasses a set of actors that contribute to the focal offer’s user value proposition.</p>



<p>… Value creation in an ecosystem is enabled by the presence of complementarities and interdependencies between actors, whose offers contribute to the focal offer’s user value proposition.</p>



<p>… Interdependencies represent a structural relationship between actors in terms of how their offers are connected for the value to be created.”</p>



<p>Kapoor goes on to point out that the ‘locus’ or what we would understand as the central point of integration in an ecosystem is a wholly separate construct to that of the ‘scope’ of integration. Where the scope is the reach into the ecosystem that can be attained through integration into that ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The locus of integration is an ecosystem-level construct that is based on the flow of inputs and outputs in an ecosystem, and the integrator is an actor that bundles inputs. Hence, the integrator has decision rights over the downstream bundling of different offers that are produced upstream with an ecosystem.”</p>



<p>“In contrast, the scope of integration is a firm-level construct that is based on the production of different offers within an ecosystem. An important strategic choice for a firm in an ecosystem is whether to expand its scope and produce different offers that underlie the focal offer’s value proposition”</p>



<p>Kapoor further posits that characterizing ecosystems in terms of what is connected to what within both the supply and demand sides of the ecosystem’s architecture presents three avenues of further inquiry and exploration. These avenues are necessary to both understand and design for maximizing value output from ecosystems.</p>



<p><strong>1. Bottlenecks&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>“In an ecosystem, bottlenecks are component offers in the ecosystem whose performance, cost, or scarcity constrains the focal offer’s value proposition, thereby limiting its demand or growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>… The technological architecture can also create system-level interactions between the different components such that an improvement in one component can exacerbate or mitigate the constraints imposed by other components.”</p>

<p>This guide covers timeless ideas that are helpful to keep in mind while working with
systems where performance matters. Many of these ideas are fairly “durable”
and will apply regardless of what hardware, programming language, operating
system, or decade you are working in.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for follow-up articles that will drill into hardware and
more Rust-specific techniques.</p>

<p>There’s some foul language in here. Enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="executive-summary">executive summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>make it work, then make it pretty, then make it fast</li>
  <li>only do things that are necessary for correctness and safety</li>
  <li>your engineers will burn out, leave your team, and relentlessly shit talk you
if they don’t make their code pretty and low-friction to work with</li>
  <li>align all latency-throughput queuing positions for everything in the
serial dependency graph, or you will get worst-of-all-worlds
latency-throughput behavior, increasing latency and lowering throughput</li>
  <li>if something necessary can be done in the background without blocking,
queue it up for eventual batch processing to improve cache performance</li>
  <li>look at allocation lifetime using DHAT, avoid short-lived allocations
and ensure that long-lived allocations employ time-space trade-offs
that consume plentiful resources instead of scarce ones where possible</li>
  <li>seriously, it’s always your fault if your engineers quit.</li>
  <li>performance happens naturally when engineers love the codebase and they
are aware of which parts of the system can be sped up</li>
  <li>before wasting time optimizing things that don’t matter, we can easily test
whether optimizing could be useful at all by adding delays or deleting
relevant code to see what the impact of infinite optimization would be</li>
  <li>by default your machine will randomly change your cpu frequency, yank
processes across cores and sockets, and generally make measurements
deceptive and non-reproducible. we can control this behavior. if you
don’t account for this behavior, your measurements are not sound justifications
for code changes</li>
  <li>wait, why does an executive care about performance, anyway?</li>

<p>Ok, now that the executives are gone, it is time to party.</p>

<p>Let’s put on some nice music.</p>

<p>Take a deep breath.</p>

<p>Let it out.</p>

<p>The year is 2020. and we are utterly fucked.</p>

<p>Supposedly we are here reading this article because we “like computers” or
something but let’s be clear about one thing - you’re not here because of that.
I know. You know. We all know. You couldn’t give two fried pennies about
computers if they didn’t help you feel the things you so desperately need to
feel.</p>

<p>You’re here, ultimately, because of control. Your entire life is entombed
in an elaborate, entirely abstract labyrinth of machines that define so
many aspects of every moment of your waking life. You’re here to better
understand the prison you find yourself within. You’re here to sympathize
with the machine.</p>

<p>While you will only seep ever more deeply into this morass of gold and glass,
you have the power to turn your captors into familiar friends. You have the
power to make the machines into the only friends you will ever need. You are
here to abandon the organic and the analogue. There is nothing for you on the
other side of your window. As you lounge (please fix your posture now) in your
designated quarantine pit, gazing listlessly into the LED mesh while biding
your time, I invite you to join me - your newest simulated human experience -
on a once-in-a-lifetime adventure into the bowels of the machine through which
you experience joy and place orders for more toilet paper.</p>

<p>It begins today.</p>

<p>This guide contains basic information for getting started with
performance-sensitive engineering. I think most folks will learn something new.
I know I have. And, part of why I wrote this is to have a single place with a
memorable URL where I can return to when I forget most of this stuff. More
importantly, when I unfurl fiery screeds in random internet comments I want to
have an intimidating reference to which I can mercilesly link.</p>

<p>I initially wrote this guide for the Rust ecosystem, where many people are now
trying their hands at optimization for the first time. But nearly all of this document
applies to general programming, with a few of the hardware effects mentioned
being specific to x86 and ARM circa 2020. Linux is assumed, because that’s
what the overwhelming majority of server workloads run today.</p>

<p>This guide brings together ideas from systems engineering, systems theory,
psychology, hardware, queuing theory, statistics, economics,
distributed systems, concurrency and philosophy of science with the goals of
helping you to be less of an asshole and write code that tends to improve
the metrics you care about.</p>

<p>Performance is about being thoughtful about the metrics that matter to us and
allowing ourselves to be aware of them while making decisions.</p>

<p>These materials are based on Tyler Neely’s Rust workshop content, and have been

<h2 id="principles">principles</h2>

<div><div><pre><code>You are not a Bayesian homunculus whose
reasoning is “corrupted” by cognitive biases.

You just are cognitive biases.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Rationality-An-Introduction">- Luke Muehlhauser, via R:AZ</a>.</p>

<p>The first thing to consider is that our minds are pure shit and everything we
know is wrong. We must accept our fallibility before embarking down the path to
fast-as-fuck machinery.</p>

<p>We build towers of assumptions that are bound to specific contexts, and when the
conditions that caused us to form these beliefs change, we tend not to revisit
the now-invalidated beliefs. Cache invalidation is hard when we are so rarely
aware of the dependency graphs of what we believe.</p>

<p>So, we measure. Even when we’re convinced that we’re right. Because we are
always out of sync with reality, and we are fundamentally incapable of altering
this fact. But we can be responsible in the face of that.</p>

<p>Corollary: allow yourself to be wrong. Allowing yourself to be wrong with
yourself, your collaborators, and in public is a key optimization for learning
faster and building better things with less effort and in less time.</p>

<p>Luckily for us, machines tend to be somewhat amenable to measurement. We built
them that way. Indeed, constructing them to be somewhat measurable in the first
place was the only way we were able to assemble them at all despite our
innumerable shortcomings. We took the predecessor to your current machine,
chose some metrics to improve, made a huge number of mistakes while continuing
to measure, and occasionally we got lucky: the metrics we cared about improved
enough to alter production lines, crystallizing our occasionally successful
results into new production processes that eventually put your machine in front
of you.</p>

<p>We must measure.</p>

<p>The only thing that matters is that real programs on real hardware see real
improvements in relevant metrics like total cost of ownership, responsiveness,
etc… If a metric doesn’t help a human, it’s just a vanity pursuit that may
make the important metrics worse due to under-investment.</p>

<p>We must select our measurements with care. Our time is precious.</p>

<p>By making decisions that are considerate of available data, we are able to cut
through so much bullshit. We have so many ideas that our experience tells us
should cause our code to improve, but it simply isn’t true when we actually
measure. Code changes that made your Java, C++, Haskell or JS programs faster
may not make Rust any faster. Don’t make Rust code ugly just because some
program you wrote in the 90s worked better with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device">manual loop
unrolling</a>. Compilers change,
in many ways for the better.</p>

<p>Don’t be macho. Make decisions while having real data on-hand and limit the
damage of hubris.</p>

<h2 id="e-prime-and-precise-language">e-prime and precise language</h2>

<p>So many aspects of performance-critical engineering can be highly contextual
and may vary wildly from one machine to another. It helps to avoid the verb
“to be” and its conjugations “is”, “are” etc… when describing observations.</p>

<p>When we say something “is” something else, we are casually equating two
similar things for convenience purposes, and we are lying to some extent.
By avoiding false equivalences (usually easily spotted through use of “is”, “are” etc…)
we can both communicate more precisely and we can allow ourselves to reason
about complexity far more effectively. Situations that may seem completely
ambiguous when described using “to be” phrases are often quite unambiguous
when taking care to avoid false equivalences. This general form of speech
is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime">E-Prime</a>.</p>

<p>Don’t say “lock-free queues are faster than mutex-backed queues”, say “on
hardware H with T threads running in tight loops performing operations O, our
specific lock-free queue has been measured to achieve a latency distribution of
X1 and our specicific mutex-backed queue has been measured to achieve a latency
distribution of X2.” It’s likely your lock-free queue will sometimes perform
worse than a well-made mutex-backed queue given certain hardware, contention
and many other factors. What does “perform worse” even …</p></section></div>

    <article>

        

        <section>
            <p>In this piece I would like to describe a practice I adopted a few years ago, after seeing how effectively colleagues were applying it. The idea of what I will call <em>structured debugging</em> is very simple: Document every step of the debugging effort of a complicated bug in an interactive environment in such a way that your thought process and deductions can be followed and verified. Despite its usefulness, simplicity and effectivenes, I see structured debugging practiced rarely. It helped me with complex bugs on multiple occasions, especially in distributed applications, and also leads to artefacts that have value on their own, independent of the debugging.</p>

<p>The first step of structured debugging is figuring out where to document your progress. If you are happy working with the bug tracker that is at your disposal, you can document your work as comments on the bug ticket. If you prefer working in your editor, as I do, I would advise you to create a markdown file named after the ID of the bug. When you want to quickly switch to this buffer, you can use the bug ID, and once you are done, or want to notify others of your work-in-progress, you can copy-paste the contents. Every half decent bug tracker out there accepts markdown input these days; by editing the report in your editor as markdown, you will have best of both worlds, with local shortcuts and utilities, in addition to clickable links and decent formatting for code snippets etc.</p>

<p>Once you have picked out the documentation environment, you should start proceeding in a systematic way. This can be done in the standard debug loop (gather information, set up conjectures, test them, repeat). What you want to achieve iterating over this loop is a <em>reproducible narrative</em>: Document each of the steps in such a way that any other developer with acquintence to the code base can open the ticket, follow through the comments and repeat any commands, arriving at the same conclusions as you do. When gathering information, it is common to make use of SQL queries, for example, or even simple scripts that join data from multiple sources. You should gather all of these in your report, together with the results at the point you ran them. One nice side effect of making this information available in a nice form is that you can take the time to make them as informative and simple as possible, for example by using joins instead of multiple queries in SQL. In order to gather information from your colleagues, you can tag them in the bug ticket, so that they can write their responses there, enriching the bug hunt.</p>

<p>The most relevant source of information in debugging live systems is logs. In the old days, web application logs were stored either as text files on servers, rotated and zipped regularly, or piped to syslog. Both made accessing these in a linkable form problematic. More recently, however, dedicated systems for log analysis have become more and more widely used. These all (or nearly all; CloudWatch doesn't allow linking to a single line) have means for linking to individual lines, time windows or the results of specific queries. Instead of just copy-pasting the relevant log lines, or in addition to that, consider using these links. Any readers can open these links and try alternative searches. Another important source of information for especially complicated bugs is diagrams for explaining workflows, relationships or complex constellations. Timeline of events, for example can be explained using sequence diagrams, which are much better than convoluted text. When the difficulty of the bug warrants it, these are a great addition to the narrative.</p>

<p>Structured debugging can cause significant extra work, but it has major benefits. Most importantly, the end result will leave little doubt as to anything was missed. The conclusions you derive will not be based on conjectures and assumptions, but concrete data and tooling, open for everyone to read and verify. Furthermore, the artefacts resulting from structured debugging are valuable on their own. Not only once did I see the tools used in such debugging actually getting incorporated into internal products, such as SQL queries turned into internal web pages &amp; reports, or Kibana searches that were added to dashboards as graphs. In case the bug proves tougher than you thought, or something more important comes in between, the report will prove invaluable: Once it's taken up again, you or anyone else can read it, and easily take off from where you left. Last but not least, this method will make it visible to the team what gaps in visibility and diagnostics exist, making analyzing and linking the whole system harder or incomplete.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Starlight lets you Google something quickly, so you don't have to ruin your workflow by opening your browser.</p>
<p>As it stands, to quickly google something while coding / working on a doc, you need to:</p>
<p>Open Browser → Google → Search → Click Result → Scan website → Back → Click Result → Scan Website .... you get the point</p>
<p>With Starlight, it's as simple as pressing ⌘+Esc and searching.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/KqMG9YC/Screen-Shot-2020-08-08-at-5-23-47-AM.png" alt="Image"></p><p>Google results appear on the left, while websites are loaded on the right. Use F/D to go through results on the left, and J/K to scroll the corresponding site on the right.</p>
<p>No more clicking back / forth, extraneous tabs etc. 🤮</p>
<p>Shortcuts:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/hy9z1v3/Screen-Shot-2020-08-08-at-6-55-16-AM.png" alt="Image"></p>
<p>I built Starlight last Monday out of pure necessity while working on
<a href="https://fitnessai.com/">FitnessAI</a>, and haven't stopped using it since. I don't even code with a browser open anymore. I shared it with a few friends and everyone seems to love it, so I thought I would share it here.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>I’ve been coding websites for a long time but even I was a little puzzled when I came across a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21617580" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hacker News comment</a> where the commenter described their own makeshift CMS that involves using your own file system. The most interesting part to me was when the person said they <strong>add CSS to pages on their personal projects by means of HTTP headers.</strong></p><p>I had heard of this technique before and the person does say in the comment that this doesn’t work in every browser. But I decided to do some research to figure out how one might do this and why this would be easier than just dropping in one or more <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> elements in the HTML.</p><p>I’m sure many of you who have been developing sites for more some time now are familiar with this. But I thought I’d write it up for those looking for a quick solution. This should especially be helpful because this apparently isn’t the easiest topic to search for since the terms “HTTP” and “header” are quite common in web development (and due to the fact that Google search has sucked for many years now).</p><p>Before getting to the actual solution, let’s take a brief look at how to add HTTP headers in general. You can put a line like the following in your website’s (or directory’s) .htaccess file (assuming you’re on an Apache server):</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>Header add Header-Name "parameter=value"</span></p></pre></div><p>This uses <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_headers.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Apache’s <strong>Header</strong> directive</a>. The part inside the quotes is a parameter/value pair that works as the value for that specific header.</p><p>To demonstrate, I’ll do the following, which creates a custom header:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>Header add Funky-Music "getdownand=boogie"</span></p></pre></div><p>This is just a header that I made up. You can also add any <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">valid HTTP header</a>, assuming you use the correct syntax. You also have the option to use the <strong>set</strong> argument instead of <strong>add</strong>, which will overwrite the header if it already exists. There are other arguments you can use, described in the aforementioned apache.org doc.</p><p>I’ve set up a <a href="https://www.impressivewebs.com/demo-files/http-header/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">demo directory</a> and I’ve added an .htaccess file to that directory, along with a basic HTML file called index.html. When you load up that page in your browser, you can see the headers that the server responds with by viewing the Network tab in the browser’s developer tools:</p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/481d3bf643bb9c65ac0d2ecf7aff4682/28eab/35e80182b2594c27805d057448c89677.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/481d3bf643bb9c65ac0d2ecf7aff4682/28eab/35e80182b2594c27805d057448c89677.png 770w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" alt="Custom Header"></p><p>In Firefox it looks like this:</p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/144ee440200e1a9a4b6799d05da731ec/28eab/0327e8af8080447480a8fb2476ae4d06.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/144ee440200e1a9a4b6799d05da731ec/28eab/0327e8af8080447480a8fb2476ae4d06.png 770w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" alt="Custom Header Firefox"></p><p>In both cases you can see the custom header that I added. You can also see any other headers that are added by default.</p><p>That’s a fairly basic summary of adding HTTP headers, including adding custom headers. For a more thorough discussion of the topic, check out <a href="https://htaccessbook.com/add-custom-headers-htaccess/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this post by Jeff Starr</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.impressivewebs.com/demo-files/http-header/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CUSTOM HEADER DEMO -&gt;</a></p><p>Now that you have a basic idea of how to add HTTP headers, let’s take a look at how to add a stylesheet via the same method. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/present/styles.html#h-14.6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The W3C’s HTML4 spec</a> has some info on how to do this, however it notes:</p><blockquote><p>This section only applies to user agents conforming to versions of HTTP that define a Link header field. Note that HTTP 1.1 as defined by <!-- -->[RFC2616]<!-- --> does not include a Link header field.</p></blockquote><p>According to my testing, the only current desktop browser that supports this feature is Firefox. The only mobile browser that I could find that supports this is Opera Mini (tested on iPad). This leads me to believe that pre-WebKit Opera supported the feature.</p><p>Nonetheless, to add CSS using an HTTP header, you can put the following line in your .htaccess file:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>Header add Link "&lt;style.css&gt;;rel=stylesheet;media=all"</span></p></pre></div><p>The syntax is the same as that for the custom header I added previously, and basically the same syntax as when adding any HTTP headers, custom or not.</p><p>In this case, I’m using <code>Link</code> as the name of the header. This is what tells a supporting browser that I want to add a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element to my page. The value for the header consists of:</p><ul><li>The URL of the stylesheet inside angle brackets</li><li>Attribute/value pairs separated by semi-colons</li></ul><p>The quotes around the full value are optional if the value doesn’t contain spaces. If it does, then the quotes are mandatory for correct parsing.</p><p>So the above header would be equivalent to adding the following to the HTML:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>&lt;</span><span>link</span><span> </span><span>rel</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>stylesheet</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>style.css</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>media</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>all</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div><p>The <code>href</code> value can of course be relative or absolute. And, as you probably figured out, this isn’t just for CSS but for anything that can be added using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HTML’s <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element</a>.</p><p>I’ve set up <a href="https://www.impressivewebs.com/demo-files/http-header-css/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">another demo page</a> that adds some CSS using the <code>Link header</code>. As mentioned, you’ll have to view it in Firefox to see it work. View the HTTP headers in the Network tab of the developer tools, and you’ll see the stylesheet included:</p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/5d2494481deccafe52b679057432e645/28eab/617ce98f2fbc490e9d13d22ec933d9ed.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/5d2494481deccafe52b679057432e645/28eab/617ce98f2fbc490e9d13d22ec933d9ed.png 770w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" alt="Link Header"></p><p>Viewing a Link HTTP Header in Firefox</p><p>Try viewing source on the page itself. You’ll see there’s no CSS file in the source, but the styles are there if you inspect each element. The header will be visible in the Network tab of any browser, but the CSS will only work in Firefox or another browser that supports the <code>Link</code> HTTP header.</p><p><a href="https://www.impressivewebs.com/demo-files/http-header-css/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CSS HEADER DEMO -&gt;</a></p><p>From what I can see, the <code>Link</code> header is not a deprecated or obsolete feature, it’s just not well supported. It’s confusing to try to figure out if this is still considered a valid web feature, but here’s what I’ve uncovered:</p><p>MDN has an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">article on it</a> and doesn’t indicate that it’s obsolete (though the browser support section is missing).
The <code>Link Header</code> is described in the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8288#section-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">IETF’s RFC 8288</a>, which I believe is the latest proposed standard for “Web Linking”.
As the HTML4 spec mentions, the last version of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HTTP 1.1 spec</a> doesn’t include it, whereas the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HTTP2 spec</a> seems to mention the <code>Link</code> header in passing.</p><p>With so little browser support, it’s hard to justify any use for this other than novelty. As the user on Hacker News said, personal projects can be fun because you can do whatever you want, including using a feature that apparently more than 90% of your users won’t see.</p><p>I suppose if you have a lot of HTML pages and you’re not using any kind of back-end scripting or includes, then maybe the best solution is using the <code>Link</code> header. But the fact that it’s so poorly supported doesn’t make it very attractive, personal project or not.</p><p>At this point, the only thing I can think of that could justify use for this in production is as a way to include some Firefox-only CSS, which <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2009/01/22/using-http-headers-to-serve-styles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Eric Meyer mentions</a> as a possibility in an old post on this subject. But it’s not guaranteed to always only work in Firefox, so that’s still a problem.</p><p>Do with this what you like, but it’s extremely unlikely that this will have any use in a real project. I just thought it would be fun to mess around with it and write it up.</p><div><p><img tabindex="0" src="https://asayer-content.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/89dc00ab92b9450a9c01853f291866c5.jpg"></p></div><p>This article was originally published on <a href="https://www.impressivewebs.com/adding-css-to-a-page-via-http-headers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Impressive Webs</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Managers are responsible for partnering with reports to grow their career. This growth should be primarily facilitated by the work that is given to the report. This growth should not be primarily facilitated by “extracurriculars.” Let’s dive into some details.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of ways people can grow skill-sets: the work the business needs or extracurriculars. Extracurriculars are things that are not (or are not in service of accomplishing) a priority for the business. Extracurriculars commonly include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reading a book</li>
  <li>Doing side projects</li>
  <li>Taking an online class</li>
  <li>Going to meetups</li>
  <li>Going to conferences</li>
</ul>

<p>Companies should to the best of their ability support people who want to do these things. However, it’s a common anti-pattern for managers (and reports, and companies) to treat these activities as primary drivers of growth. There’s a couple main reasons why people intuitively lean on extracurriculars when trying to drive growth:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The alternative to extracurriculars is having people take on work that stretches their ability/skill set, which is less efficient for the business. Stated otherwise: extracurriculars are perceived as 0-risk to the business.</li>
  <li>Interests are confused with growth. Instead of finding ways to strategically grow in a role and in the company, people start growth conversations from “what kind of stuff are you interested in?”*</li>
</ul>

<p>Extracurriculars-as-growth has some major problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The machinery of the company is not set up to hold you accountable to actual delivery of extracurriculars. Nobody ever got a raise because they read a book. Nobody ever got fired because they didn’t read a book. It’s very common to see  extracurricular tasks in growth plans only to never be followed up on.</li>
  <li>Extracurriculars are usually done off the clock. Companies often don’t make time for people to actually do that work and it’s implicit that the report needs to find time to do both those things and their regular work. Company-driven growth should be done nearly exclusively on the company’s time. Because homework is often not a priority, the company often doesn’t support it being done on the clock, and this - appropriately, obviously - leads to conflict. Expecting homework from an employee isn’t fair.</li>
  <li>Extracurriculars are often interest-based, not growth-based. So the work often doesn’t translate into any meaningful increase in impact at the company.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ok, so extracurriculars-as-growth is bad. Let’s fix it. It’s easy - skills should be grown via work the business needs. The company supports that work and holds people accountable to doing it. That growth will be directly in-line with what the company needs. And growing via that work will also actually deliver impact in a way that gets you rewards.</p>

<p>Like eating your vegetables or daily exercise - it sounds easy, but putting this into practice can be difficult. In fact, getting it done is a major culture shift. You have to build a culture that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is willing to invest in people at the cost of optimal delivery in the short term.</li>
  <li>Trusts people to fail. The other main anti-pattern is to give people a chance and then pull them out of the critical path the minute they make a mistake.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>August 10, 2020<!-- --> <span>—<!-- --> <a href="https://healeycodes.com/tags/python">Python</a></span></p></header><section><p>I wanted to learn more about web analytics so I budgeted myself a few hours and built a toy analytics system.</p>
<p>The goal was to collect information about page views in a <em>privacy focused</em> manner so that no GDPR notice is required. With that in mind, I made these decisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Events on a website aren’t attributed to a particular user (no reading or setting cookies)</li>
<li>No personally-identifying information is stored on disk</li>
</ul>
<p>The system should be able to be used on a third-party host (e.g. GitHub Pages) and the alterations to an existing codebase should be minimal i.e. including a HTML snippet. The web server that captures the tracking requests can be hosted on anything that runs Flask.</p>
<p>The following analytics should be available:</p>
<ul>
<li>What pages users visit</li>
<li>Where users are referred from</li>
<li>What browsers and screen sizes are used</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tracking-pixels"><a href="#tracking-pixels" aria-label="tracking pixels permalink"></a>Tracking Pixels</h2>
<p>A page view can be captured by sending a request to the analytics server. This happens when a browser loads an image. By including an 1x1 transparent image (a tracking pixel) we can initiate this request.</p>
<p>I implemented two methods, one that works with JavaScript enabled and one that works without.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dynamically add an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element with the data encoded in the search parameters of the URL</li>
<li>(In the case of no JavaScript) Render an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element with the path and title in the search parameters of the URL</li>
</ul>
<p>They are toggled by the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>/<code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> pattern.</p>
<p>We’ll get some data from the search parameters and the rest from the request’s headers. Here’s the HTML snippet that includes both methods.</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>

<p>When the user’s browser has JavaScript disabled there is far less information available. For either solution, the user’s country and their browser information can be captured on the analytics server.</p>
<h2 id="serving-the-gif"><a href="#serving-the-gif" aria-label="serving the gif permalink"></a>Serving The GIF</h2>
<p>Let’s start with a Flask application that serves a tracking pixel.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>

<span>import</span> base64
<span>from</span> flask <span>import</span> Flask<span>,</span> Response
app <span>=</span> Flask<span>(</span>__name__<span>)</span>


<span>@app<span>.</span>route</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>index</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span>
    
    <span>return</span> render_template<span>(</span><span>"index.html"</span><span>)</span>


<span>@app<span>.</span>route</span><span>(</span><span>'/pixel.gif'</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>pixel</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span>
    
    gif <span>=</span> base64<span>.</span>b64decode<span>(</span>
        <span>'R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP8AAP8AACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=='</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> Response<span>(</span>gif<span>,</span> mimetype<span>=</span><span>"image/gif"</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This can be run by exporting the <code>FLASK_APP</code> variable:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>
<span>export</span> <span>FLASK_APP</span><span>=</span>analytics.py
flask run</code></pre></div>
<p>The first time I loaded the test page, I ran into a <code>net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT</code> error in the console. My tracking pixel was blocked by my own ad blocker. Perhaps it’s allergic to 1x1 images.</p>
<p>After toggling my ad blocker, the Flask logs showed that the information we want is being sent, and also that we responded with a 200 status code.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>"GET /pixel.gif?path=%2F&amp;title=Analytics%20Test%20Page&amp;referrer=&amp;resolution=1920%2C1080 HTTP/1.1"</span> <span>200</span> -</code></pre></div>
<p>By using the search parameters object, URL encoding (also known as percent-encoding) was used automatically. For example, <code>%2F</code> decodes to <code>/</code>. You can read more about the reasoning behind this type of encoding in the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/std66#page-12">URI Generic Syntax</a> RFC.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A percent-encoded octet is encoded as a character triplet, consisting of the percent character ”%” followed by the two hexadecimal digits representing that octet’s numeric value. For example, “%20” is the percent-encoding for the binary octet “00100000” (ABNF: %x20), which in US-ASCII corresponds to the space character (SP).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="anonymizing-user-data"><a href="#anonymizing-user-data" aria-label="anonymizing user data permalink"></a>Anonymizing User Data</h2>
<p>Depending on how your application is deployed you may have a reverse-proxy server before the request reaches Flask. So <code>request.remote_addr</code> might describe a local address. The reverse-proxy server will usually add the user’s IP address to the <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> header. We can check for that with a fallback to <code>request.remote_addr</code>.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>ip <span>=</span> request<span>.</span>headers<span>.</span>get<span>(</span><span>'X-Forwarded-For'</span><span>,</span> request<span>.</span>remote_addr<span>)</span>
user_agent <span>=</span> request<span>.</span>user_agent<span>.</span>string</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>User-Agent</code> header describes the device. For Chrome it looks something like this: <code>Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/84.0.4147.105 Safari/537.36</code>. Some mobiles also add the firmware version. We don’t want to keep this, or an IP address, on file because both pieces can be identifiable information which would require a GDPR notice.</p>
<p>Rather than keeping the exact <code>User-Agent</code> we can strip away the information that’s most important to us — browser and major version.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>
user_agent <span>=</span> request<span>.</span>user_agent<span>.</span>browser <span>+</span> <span>' '</span> <span>+</span> \
    request<span>.</span>user_agent<span>.</span>version<span>.</span>split<span>(</span><span>'.'</span><span>)</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Converting an IP address to a country is a little harder. A simple solution is to use a free geolocation API but shipping IP addresses to a third-party service isn’t exactly privacy focused. I found <a href="https://github.com/maxmind/GeoIP2-python">GeoIP2-python</a>, a package that can be combined with a free <a href="https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/">GeoLite2 country database</a>. With this method, the geolocation happens without any user data leaving our server.</p>
<p>After downloading the database, the package can be used to get a country from an IP:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>  <span>import</span> geoip2<span>.</span>database
  
  reader <span>=</span> geoip2<span>.</span>database<span>.</span>Reader<span>(</span><span>'./GeoLite2-Country.mmdb'</span><span>)</span>
  country <span>=</span> <span>''</span>
  <span>try</span><span>:</span>
      response <span>=</span> reader<span>.</span>country<span>(</span><span>'127.0.0.1'</span><span>)</span>
      country <span>=</span> response<span>.</span>country<span>.</span>name
  <span>except</span> geoip2<span>.</span>errors<span>.</span>AddressNotFoundError<span>:</span>
      <span>pass</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We could also check for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language">Accept-Language</a> via <code>request.accept_languages</code>.</p>
<p>The rest of the page view information comes from the search parameters and we use default values to handle the case where JavaScript isn’t enabled and less information is sent.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>timestamp <span>=</span> <span>int</span><span>(</span>time<span>.</span>time<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
path <span>=</span> request<span>.</span>args<span>.</span>get<span>(</span><span>'path'</span><span>,</span> <span>''</span><span>)</span>
title <span>=</span> request<span>.</span>args<span>.</span>get<span>(</span><span>'title'</span><span>,</span> <span>''</span><span>)</span>

<h2 id="storing-page-views"><a href="#storing-page-views" aria-label="storing page views permalink"></a>Storing Page Views</h2>
<p>I used <code>sqlite3</code> from the standard library to save and load this data. Normally, I’d use SQLAlchemy but for this experiment I only need two functions (save/load) and I don’t think I’ll be extending it.</p>
<p>I need to be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Store the tracking information for a page view</li>
<li>Retrieve tracking information for a slice of time</li>
</ul>
<p>For tiny prototypes like this, a pattern I sometimes use is checking if the table exists whenever the module is imported. This aggressive check makes it easier to share this code without thinking about the database setup. The database file either exists or will be created.</p>

<h2 id="displaying-user-analytics"><a href="#displaying-user-analytics" aria-label="displaying user analytics permalink"></a>Displaying User Analytics</h2>
<p>It’s common to want to view analytics for a given time period like the previous week. So the view that displays user analytics should accept two parameters that define the start time and end time of the slice.</p>
<p>A minimal page should look something like this:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Sun Aug 2 10:32:01 2020 - Sun Aug 9 10:32:01 2020

Paths
('/', 2)

Referrers
('', 2)

Countries
('', 2)

Devices
('safari 13', 2)

Resolutions
('414x736', 2)</code></pre></div>
<p>When no parameters are passed, I chose to load all data from the beginning of time.</p>
<p>The analytics view that accomplishes all of that looks like this. <code>Counter</code> from <code>collections</code> saves a few lines of code when aggregating page views.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>@app<span>.</span>route</span><span>(</span><span>"/analytics"</span><span>)</span>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> We recently raised 1,5M euros from LocalGlobe, Seedcamp, Kima &amp; Tiny.vc. This funding will allow us to focus on building a community of early adopters &amp; contributors around our open search engine <a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch">MeiliSearch</a>.</p><p>We are still at the very beginning of our open source adventure and we are thrilled to see that more and more people believe in this project. This is our first fundraise and it means the world for the Meili team 🎉</p><h3 id="meili-got-funded-">Meili got funded!</h3><p>Meili SAS (the company) was created in November of 2018 with the idea of building an alternative to existing search engine APIs like Algolia. After some successes and failures as a team and company, we decided to raise some money to keep focus on building MeiliSearch and its ecosystem.</p><p>We believe that an exceptionalsearch experience on websites and applications should be the norm, not an exclusive feature. Thus we are building the most straightforward technology for developers to offer state-of-the-art search to their users, scaling from the tiniest of operations all the way up to enterprise.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.meilisearch.com/content/images/2020/08/david-armstrong-srpE-a5W418-unsplash.jpg"></figure><h2 id="how-we-got-there">How we got there</h2><p>MeiliSearch has been open source since the <a href="https://blog.meilisearch.com/open-source-or-not/">earliest days</a> of its development. As developers, we made our project accessible on GitHub from day one but without the idea of being an "open source company". First and foremost we set out to make a simpler alternative to Algolia for smaller businesses who needed something more developer-friendly and affordable.</p><p>After describing our project to many developers, we quickly realize that one of the main differences from Algolia was that MeiliSearch is open source. Still we weren't using open source as a force.</p><p>In late 2019, after some substantial discussion within the team, we decided to <a href="https://blog.meilisearch.com/to-open-source-and-beyond/">fully commit to orienting the business around open source</a>. We could not quietly bootstrap anymore since we decided to build a community around our project to get feedback and contributions from external developers. </p><p>We wrote our <a href="https://blog.meilisearch.com/meilisearch-beta-release/">Beta release blog post</a> for MeiliSearch in November of 2019. Since then we have been working hard at making MeiliSearch the new obvious choice for developers when it comes to building a search box.</p><p>Charlotte, who joined us in August of 2019, did an incredible job of directing the writing and making of our <a href="https://docs.meilisearch.com/">documentation</a> while Clémentine, who joined us one month later, took charge of developing the <a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides">SDKs and integrations</a> to ease the use of MeiliSearch.</p><h2 id="fundraise">Fundraise</h2><p>In late 2019 we began to meet with investors because we knew we wouldn't be able to develop the business without help from industry veterans.</p><div><p>The first key meeting that we had was with <a href="https://twitter.com/ale6_">Alexis from Kima</a> who helped us make our pitch understandable to VCs. Alexis was presented to us as <code>THE investor who understand tech</code> in Paris. Not only did he understood what we wanted to build, he also did an amazing job at introing us to relevant funds regarding our stage &amp; business 😁 </p><p> Then from meeting to meeting we met the different persons we are now working with: <a href="https://twitter.com/mishmashkautsan?lang=en">Mish</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/knightwebb/?originalSubdomain=uk">Louis</a> from <a href="https://localglobe.vc/">LocalGlobe</a> as lead investor, <a href="https://twitter.com/siahouchangnia?lang=en">Sia</a> from <a href="https://seedcamp.com/">SeedCamp</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ale6_">Alexis</a> from <a href="https://www.kimaventures.com/">Kima</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/pmoe?lang=en">Philipp</a> from <a href="https://www.tiny.vc/">Tiny.vc</a>.</p></div><p>The deal we made with the VCs is that we develop the community and the usage around MeiliSearch while we better understand the use-cases of our search engine. From there we will be able to generate revenue. <a href="https://blog.meilisearch.com/meilisearch-open-business-plan-v0-1/">Our business plan is publicly available</a> as a iteratively developed document.</p><h2 id="what-s-next">What's next?</h2><h3 id="core-features">Core features</h3><p>We made an <a href="https://github.com/orgs/meilisearch/projects/2">open roadmap on GitHub</a>, and we will publish more roadmap communications in the coming weeks to get better feedback on what developers need in a search engine API.</p><p>There are some features that we know we need to build in order to be competitive as a search engine backend (basic analytics and authorization system 🚧) that are already planned. We are also discussing with developers &amp; companies to gain more insight on features that should be game-changers in the enterprise search industry!</p><h3 id="integrations-documentation">Integrations &amp; Documentation</h3><p>All of this work around MeiliSearch would not make any sense if MeiliSearch is not used. To ease the integration of MeiliSearch we are building different <a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides">SDKs</a> in different languages and improving our <a href="https://docs.meilisearch.com/">documentation</a> every week. </p><p>We want anyone to be able to integrate MeiliSearch in any common programming environment in less than 5 minutes. Today, with our most mature front- and back-end libraries you should be able to setup a proof-of-concept in less than an hour.

		<p><em>If you enjoy this article, please check out my free book by clicking <a href="https://deponysum.com/2020/03/30/something-to-read-in-quarantine-essays-2018-to-2020/">Here: “Something to Read in Quarantine: Essays 2018-2020.”</a></em></p>
<p id="b9a9">Natural Language Processing (NLP) per Wikipedia:</p>
<p id="34cf">“Is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.”</p>
<p id="7dd8">The field has seen tremendous advances during the recent explosion of progress in machine learning techniques.</p>
<p id="b5f8">Here are some of its more impressive recent achievements:</p>
<p id="cb15"><strong>A)</strong>&nbsp;The Winograd Schema is a test of common sense reasoning- easy for humans, but historically almost impossible for computers- which requires the test taker to indicate which noun an ambiguous pronoun stands for. The correct answer hinges on a single word, which is different between two separate versions of the question. For example:</p>
<p id="512d"><em>The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they feared violence.</em></p>
<p id="ece3"><em>The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence.</em></p>
<p id="0ddf">Who does the pronoun “They” refer to in each of the instances?</p>
<p id="d33c">The Winograd schema test was originally intended to be a more rigorous replacement for the Turing test, because it seems to require deep knowledge of how things fit together in the world, and the ability to reason about that knowledge in a linguistic context. Recent advances in NLP have allowed computers to achieve near human scores:(<a href="https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard/</a>).</p>
<p id="0a43"><strong>B)</strong>&nbsp;The New York Regent’s science exam is a test requiring both scientific knowledge and reasoning skills, covering an extremely broad range of topics. Some of the questions include:</p>
<p id="a36d"><em>1.Which equipment will best separate a mixture of iron filings and black pepper? (1) magnet (2) filter paper (3) triplebeam balance (4) voltmeter</em></p>
<p id="9797"><em>2. Which form of energy is produced when a rubber band vibrates? (1) chemical (2) light (3) electrical (4) sound</em></p>
<p id="966a"><em>3. Because copper is a metal, it is (1) liquid at room temperature (2) nonreactive with other substances (3) a poor conductor of electricity (4) a good conductor of heat</em></p>
<p id="6d70"><em>4. Which process in an apple tree primarily results from cell division? (1) growth (2) photosynthesis (3) gas exchange (4) waste removal</em></p>
<p id="3a8a">On the 8th grade, non-diagram based questions of the test, a program was recently able to score 90%. (&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01958.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01958.pdf</a>&nbsp;)</p>
<p id="2f49"><strong>C)</strong></p>
<p id="267a">It’s not just about answer selection either. Progress in text generation has been impressive. See, for example, some of the text samples created by Megatron:&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08053.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08053.pdf</a></p>
<p id="b8f7"><strong>2.</strong></p>
<p id="db13">Much of this progress has been rapid. Big progress on the Winograd schema, for example, still looked like it might be decades away back in (from memory) much of 2018. The computer science is advancing very fast, but it’s not clear our concepts have kept up.</p>
<p id="1a6c">I found this relatively sudden progress in NLP surprising. In my head- and maybe this was naive- I had thought that, in order to attempt these sorts of tasks with any facility, it wouldn’t be sufficient to simply feed a computer lots of text. Instead, any “proper” attempt to understand language would have to integrate different modalities of experience and understanding, like visual and auditory, in order to build up a full picture of how things relate to each other in the world. Only on the basis of this extra-linguistic grounding could it deal flexibly with problems involving rich meanings- we might call this the multi-modality thesis. Whether the multi-modality thesis is true for some kinds of problems or not, it’s certainly true for far fewer problems than I, and many others, had suspected.</p>
<p id="5a4d">I think science-fictiony speculations generally backed me up on this (false) hunch. Most people imagined that this kind of high-level language “understanding” would be the capstone of AI research, the thing that comes after the program already has a sophisticated extra-linguistic model of the world. This sort of just seemed obvious- a great example of how assumptions you didn’t even know you were making can ruin attempts to predict the future.</p>
<p id="f943">In hindsight it makes a certain sense that reams and reams of text alone can be used to build the capabilities needed to answer questions like these. A lot of people remind us that these programs are really just statistical analyses of the co-occurence of words, however complex and glorified. However we should not forget that the relationships between words are isomorphic to the relations between things- that isomorphism is why language works. This is to say the patterns in language use mirror the patterns of how things are(1). Models are transitive- if x models y, and y models z, then x models z. The upshot of these facts are that if you have a really good statistical model of how words relate to each other, that model is also implicitly a model of the world.</p>
<p id="12db">It might be instructive to think about what it would take to create a program which has a model of eighth grade science sufficient to understand and answer questions about hundreds of different things like “growth is driven by cell division”, and “What can magnets be used for” that wasn’t NLP led. It would be a nightmare of many different (probably handcrafted) models. Speaking somewhat loosely, language allows for intellectual capacities to be greatly compressed. From this point of view, it shouldn’t be surprising that some of the first signs of really broad capacity- common sense reasoning, wide ranging problem solving etc., have been found in language based programs- words and their relationships are just a vastly more efficient way of representing knowledge than the alternatives.</p>
<p id="1e8b">So I find myself wondering if language is not the crown of general intelligence, but a potential shortcut to it.</p>
<p id="beea"><strong>3.</strong></p>
<p id="0095">A couple of weeks ago I finished this essay, read through it, and decided it was not good enough to publish. The point about language being isomorphic to the world, and that therefore any sufficiently good model of language&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a model of the world, is important, but it’s kind of abstract, and far from original.</p>
<p id="e0e2">Then today I read&nbsp;<a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/01/06/a-very-unlikely-chess-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this report</a>&nbsp;by Scott Alexander of having trained GPT-2 (a language program) to play chess. I realised this was the perfect example. GPT-2 has no (visual) understanding of things like the arrangement of a chess board. But if you feed it enough sequences of alphanumerically encoded games- 1.Kt-f3, d5 and so on- it begins to understand patterns in these strings of characters which are isomorphic to chess itself. Thus, for all intents and purposes, it develops a model of chess.</p>
<p id="1a14">Exactly how strong this approach is- whether GPT-2 is capable of some limited analysis, or can only overfit openings- remains to be seen. We might have a better idea as it is optimised — for example, once it is fed board states instead of sequences of moves. Either way though, it illustrates the point about isomorphism.</p>
<p id="a87a">Of course everyday language stands in a woolier relation to sheep, pine cones, desire and quarks than the formal language of chess moves stands in relation to chess moves, and the patterns are far more complex. Modality, uncertainty, vagueness and other complexities enter but the isomorphism between world and language is there, even if inexact.</p>
<p id="b6c0"><strong>Postscript- The Chinese Room Argument</strong></p>
<p id="f901">After similar arguments are made, someone usually mentions the Chinese room thought experiment. There are, I think, two useful things to say about it:</p>
<p id="3d7e">A) The thought experiment is an argument about consciousness, a difficult thing to quantify or understand. It’s unclear that there is a practical upshot for what&nbsp;<em>AI can actually do.</em></p>
<p id="1f79">B) A lot of the power of the thought experiment hinges on the fact that the room solves questions using a lookup table, this stacks the deck. Perhaps we be more willing to say that the room as a whole understood language if it formed an (implicit) model of how things are, and of the current context, and used those models to answer questions? Even if this doesn’t deal with all the intuition that the room cannot understand Chinese, I think it takes a bite from it.</p>
<p id="96a9">— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —</p>
<p id="4642">(1)- Strictly of course only the patterns in true sentences mirror, or are isomorphic to, the arrangement of the world, but most sentences people utter are at least approximately true.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In college, I took a self-defense class, taught by Sensei Flagg. The next semester, I took a kickboxing class, taught by Sensei Flagg. The next and final semester, I took an Isshin-Ryū Karate class, taught by Sensei Flagg.</p>

<p>It was the exact same class each time. The administrators just couldn’t decide how to categorize it.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9eba9012f62648f5678b4fc512636f33c4fb1368/1dcd7/images/uploads/karate.jpg" alt="Karate Kata"></p>

<p>According to the school’s policy, retakes did not provide additional credits or grades. But when I noticed the administration’s constant category changes of the same karate class, I realized it would count for a new credit and grade each time. So I kept enrolling and boosted my grades and course-credit total.</p>

<p>This category shuffle had a minor effect on my overall grade (and belt ranking). In the business of software, however, companies live or die by the category they compete in. It affects the number of potential buyers, their budgets, their perceived value of the product, and the alternatives they compare against the product. It even affects how much interest the company can garner from investors and job candidates.</p>

<p>Some think product categories have a loophole similar to my college karate classes: Instead of slugging it out in an existing category, just create a new one! Instead of extra credits, the thinking goes, you become the default market leader and get millions in revenue from the many buyers who realize they can’t live without this kind of product.</p>

<p>On top of that, startup founders are told that legends such as Steve Jobs, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and Marc Benioff succeeded because they <em>created</em> categories instead of disrupting old ones.</p>

<p>An exploitable loophole. Growth and revenue. The secret behind the success of legends. No wonder so many founders wonder whether they should create a new category.</p>

<p>From helping startups since 2013 and analyzing tech IPOs from the past two years, I’ve reached this surprising conclusion:</p>

<p><strong>You don’t need a new category.</strong> In fact, the vast majority of startups succeed in an <em>existing</em> category. As did, it turns out, Steve Jobs, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and Marc Benioff.</p>

<p>The smartphone category existed over a decade before Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone. Although Salesforce was one of the first breakthrough Software-as-a-Service companies, its founder Marc Benioff neither coined nor used the term “SaaS,” which really emerged in a 2001 industry publication (more on that below). Larry Page and Sergey Brin created an innovative method of ranking web sites but always called Google a “search engine.”</p>

<p>And if you do try it, <strong>category creation is much harder and costlier than it seems</strong>.</p>

<p>This article summarizes my perspective on the matter, based on extensive research and actual go-to-market experiences — some of which are included here as anecdotal stories — and makes the case that startups are more likely to succeed by competing in an existing category than by trying to create a new one.</p>

<h2 id="categories-are-just-words">Categories Are Just Words</h2>

<p>A <strong>category</strong> (“market category” or “product category”) is a group of products that solve a similar problem, in a similar way, to a similar audience. Examples in software include Application Performance Monitoring (APM), Marketing Platforms, and Platforms as a Service (PaaS).</p>

<p>But really, categories are just words.</p>

<p>There’s no single authority that decides what is or isn’t a word, or their meaning. A word is real if enough people use it and it means what most people think it means. Some words change meaning; some disappear; new ones emerge; everything is fluid. And so with categories.</p>

<p>Changes happen as a result of significant innovations, shifts in buyer perceptions or needs, economic environments, and many other factors. Whatever the cause, the change first spreads in the wild before being documented and standardized by some influential person or organization.</p>

<p>As one analyst from the research firm Gartner told me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When we either create or advance terms that we’re hearing, it’s always to provide clarity to the market.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, in 2001, the Software &amp; Information Industry Association <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/Shelly38/software-as-a-service-strategic-backgrounder">introduced the world to SaaS</a>: “Software as a Service (SaaS), commonly referred to as the Application Service Provider (ASP) model, is heralded by many as the new wave in application software distribution.” Salesforce, which launched two years prior and uniquely provided its software through the cloud, influenced this change, but it did not coin the term.</p>

<p>None of this diminishes the power of categories. In addition to meaning, they also carry associations, expectations, and perceptions. They can even evoke emotions.</p>

<p>Take NoSQL, for instance. If you’re familiar with databases, that label might stir expectations such as “open-source” and “distributed”; product associations such as DynamoDB, Cassandra, and MongoDB; and perceptions such as “risk of data loss,” “fad,” or “best choice for big data.” Depending on your experience with databases or the year in which you read this, you may involuntarily feel either glee or disgust.</p>

<p>Such reactions have tremendous implications for the company behind the product. The category with which buyers associate that product impacts their level of interest, what they compare it against, how much they expect and are willing to pay, what they expect the product to do, and so on. Companies can influence — but not control — the category they’re associated with through positioning.</p>

<p><strong>Positioning</strong> is the deliberate effort to make a product or service be associated with a specific category for some advantage. Everything from the way the product is built to the way it’s packaged, priced, sold, and marketed can be a part of that effort.</p>

<p>For example, Redis makes a database that fits the NoSQL definition, but maybe they prefer not to be associated with “cheap” and “fad,” nor to compete with the many NoSQL solutions in the market. So they consistently label the product as an “in-memory database” and avoid mentionioning NoSQL throughout the corporate or open-source sites. (This is speculation for illustrative purposes.)</p>

<p>Although successful positioning could make a significant impact for a startup, <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/bff/">it takes work</a> to figure out how and where to position the product to maximize returns. What’s more, any category with a sizable market is sure to already include competition from market leaders or a swarm of other startups.</p>

<p>Which is why some startups attempt a shortcut with category creation.</p>

<p><strong>Category creation</strong> is a marketing strategy in which a company designs a new product category — along with name, problems, solutions, and audience — and promotes that category alongside the product itself. The goal is to convince buyers they need a certain kind of product, then win that growing market by virtue of having the only (or leading) product in it.</p>

<p>The idea of <em>hacking</em> your way to market dominance and unicorn status is understandably alluring to startup founders. If you could mold the market in your favor and sidestep the incumbents and startup competition, why wouldn’t you?</p>

<p>Because, as it turns out, category creation is neither a shortcut nor a surefire way to succeed.</p>

<h2 id="category-creation-is-not-a-shortcut">Category Creation Is Not a Shortcut</h2>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0363448a27ef0cfd5093782fea2c49ae2124d8a8/23fb9/images/uploads/270.jpg" alt="Cartoon about living as kings on a desert island."></p>

<p>Category creation is much harder and costlier than it seems — in time, energy, resources, and opportunity cost.</p>

<p>The hard part isn’t coming up with the strategy. The hard part is moving the market — the buyers and their purchasing behavior — with you to the new category. Until then, you’re not a king; you’re just the mayor of a one-person town.</p>

<p>In other words, everyone can be “#1” in their own category, but that isn’t enough.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/01bf2eb3e730274b39ae85c5b4dd8c734984b23c/fbadf/images/uploads/category-example-1.png" alt="Message on the Drift homepage boasting about their position in their category.">

<em>Message on the Intercom homepage, boasting about their position in their category.</em></p>

<p>This requirement to move the market is badly and consistently underestimated by startups considering this strategy. It is underestimated in part because it is unacknowledged by proponents of category creation, who say much about “category kings” and market dominance but not enough about the time and cost it takes to get there, nor about the many companies that tried and failed to build a market around their new category.</p>

<p>What does it take to move the market? Marketing. So launching a product and category together just doubles the effort, resources, and time required for sales and marketing. Instead of helping explain the product, the new category just creates another thing that needs explaining.</p>

<p>The cost may be even worse than that, because new categories face more resistance from buyers than new products. As <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2833208">one research study</a> explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Owing to their vested interest in constructing and conveying the value of a new category in the market, producers’ discursive attempts at category-creation are liable to be discounted and viewed with suspicion by other constituents, especially consumers, in a market.” (Durand &amp; Khaire, 2016)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the worst case, it can be repulsive. Buyers might feel they’re being sold buzzwords and snake oil. This is a big risk for startups selling to technical audiences who are already sensitive to anything that smells like marketing.</p>

<p>Launching a category at the same time as bringing a product to market is like trying to bring <em>two products</em> to market. Companies like Monday.com, HubSpot, and Fastly can afford to take shots at creating new categories — Work OS, Flywheel Model, and Edge Cloud Platform, respectively — because they have the resources and cash runway to see it through, just as they would with a new product or major release. Those who don’t have the resources to launch two products at the same time also don’t have the resources to successfully launch a product and a category at the same time.</p>

<![CDATA[Variables and Memory Management in Rust]]>

August 10, 2020 | https://www.warambil.com/variables-and-memory-management-in-rust | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.warambil.com/variables-and-memory-management-in-rust">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lately there has been a lot of fuss around the <strong>Rust</strong> programming language developed by the Mozilla team around 2010. </p>
<p>The reality is that this language that was created as an alternative to C++ has gained popularity once it has become more mature, due to the following key features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safety</li>
<li>Great performance</li>
<li>Packaging and distribution</li>
<li>Helpful community</li>
</ul>
<p>The objective of this post is to learn more about how Rust handles variables and memory to catch errors at compile time rather than in runtime. This is one of the features that makes it the safe language of choice for critical applications.</p>
<p>Rust applies a concept called:  <em>linear types</em>. This means that is based on a <em>linear logic</em> that ensures that objects are only used once and then safely removed or deallocated. </p>
<p>Linear type systems allow references but not aliases. In Rust variables are immutable by default, therefore the following code triggers a compile error</p>
<pre data-language="rust" data-index="0"><code><span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span>() {</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> x = </span><span>5</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x is: {}"</span><span>, x);</span></span>
<span><span>    x = </span><span>6</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x is: {}"</span><span>, x);</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>If you really need to modify a variable once a value has been assigned to it, you must specify it this way:</p>
<pre data-language="rust" data-index="1"><code><span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span>() {</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> x = </span><span>5</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x is: {}"</span><span>, x);</span></span>
<span><span>    x = </span><span>6</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x is: {}"</span><span>, x);</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Now, you must be wondering why immutability should be a <em>de-facto</em> feature and how this may contribute to a produce a safer code. </p>
<p>Then you should understand another Rust concept in  memory management: <strong><em>Ownership</em></strong>.</p>
<h2>Understanding Ownership</h2>
<p>Rust does not have a garbage collector like Java or other languages. Its philosophy is based on the premise that whoever declares a variable should own it until the end of the flow. But before digging into this concept, we need to refresh a few old concepts about memory: <strong><em>stack</em></strong> and <strong><em>heap</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Even when <em>stack</em> and heap are memory spaces available to be used during runtime, their structure differs. <em>Stack</em> works in a LIFO (<em>last in, first out</em>) fashion, meaning it stores values in the order it arrive and remove them in the opposite order. </p>
<p>The most important concept about <em>stack</em> is that all data stored there must have a known, fixed size. If we don´t know the size of what we are going to store, then we should use the <em>heap</em>. </p>
<p><em>Heap</em> is less organized and whenever you need to put data on the <em>heap</em>, you request a certain amount of space, the operating system finds an  empty spot that could fit and returns a pointer, which holds the address of that location in memory. This process is called <em>allocating</em>.</p>
<p>Pushing values onto the stack is not considered allocating since the reserved space for data is known before hand. Thus, using the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the operating system does not have to search for a new place to store data. Data in the stack is always on top. </p>
<p>When a function is called, the values passed into the function as well as the function's local variables get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those values get removed from the stack.</p>
<p>Now, historically the main problem with languages that allow developers to allocate data in the heap (using pointers), was keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap and the deallocation of unused data from the heap. This is what the Rust concept of  <strong>ownership</strong> attempts to solve.</p>
<p><em>Each value in Rust has a variable that could be seen as its owner and each variable can have one owner at a time. Whenever the owner goes out of scope, the value is gone.</em></p>
<p>Let's see the following example:</p>
<pre data-language="rust" data-index="2"><code><span><span>let</span><span> s = </span><span>String</span><span>::</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>"hello"</span><span>);</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Here we are using a variable that <em>points</em> to a String structure in memory. The string structure is allocated in the heap area and <em>s1</em> is a variable that has information about the address of the String structure, its length and capacity.</p>
<p>Now, the <em>s</em> variable is <em>immutable</em> by default, so if we wanted to modify the String data, we should do this:</p>
<pre data-language="rust" data-index="3"><code><span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> s = </span><span>String</span><span>::</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>"hello"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>s.</span><span>push_str</span><span>(</span><span>", world!"</span><span>); </span><span>// push_str() appends a literal to a String</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>, s); </span><span>// This </span></span></code></pre>
<p>The <em>mut</em> keyword lets Rust know about the variable mutability. </p>
<p>Now, here comes the interesting part about ownership, let's take a look at the following code:</p>
<pre data-language="rust" data-index="4"><code><span><span>let</span><span> s1 = </span><span>String</span><span>::</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>"hello"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>let</span><span> s2 = s1;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>In this case, <em>s1</em> is assigned to <em>s2</em>, therefore if we think of other languages like C++, both <em>s2</em> and <em>s1</em> would be pointing to the same structure. So, after the assignment in the same function I should be able to do this:</p>
<pre data-language="rust" data-index="5"><code><span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}, world!"</span><span>, s1);</span></span></code></pre>
<p>However this code fails in Rust because once <em>s1</em> has been assigned to <em>s2</em>, <em>s1</em> does not belong the owner so it is not longer valid. This is what ownership is about. This way, Rust does not have to worry about keeping track of scenarios where the structure is removed from <em>s2</em> and <em>s1</em> may remain orfan.</p>
<p>At this point you may ask, is there then a way to actually deep copy structures and make <em>s1</em> and <em>s2</em> point to a valid structure with the a replicated data? The answer is yes by using a function called <em>clone</em>.</p>
<pre data-language="rust" data-index="6"><code><span><span>let</span><span> s1 = </span><span>String</span><span>::</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>"hello"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>let</span><span> s2 = s1.</span><span>clone</span><span>();</span></span></code></pre>
<p>So far so good, we know how ownership works in Rust but what about functions? In order to understand this, let's look at the following example:</p>
<pre data-language="rust" data-index="7"><code><span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span>() {</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> s1 = </span><span>String</span><span>::</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>"hello"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> s2 = </span><span>takes_ownership</span><span>(s1);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"s1 '{}'."</span><span>, s1); </span><span>//not ok</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"s2 '{}'."</span><span>, s2); </span><span>//ok</span></span>
<span><span>} </span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>takes_ownership</span><span>(st: </span><span>String</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>String</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    st</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Here, <em>s1</em> is passed as parameter to the <em>take_ownership</em> function. Unlike other languages where functions naturally make a copy of parameter into an local variable, Rust keeps clinging to its rules and <em>s1</em> once it is passed to <em>takes_ownership</em> function, so it stops existing within the <em>main()</em> function scope.</p>
<p>Now, what if we actually need to <strong><em>borrow</em></strong> ownership? Then we should pass a reference to the variable like this:</p>
<pre data-language="rust" data-index="8"><code><span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span>() {</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> s1 = </span><span>String</span><span>::</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>"hello"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> len = </span><span>calculate_length</span><span>(&amp;s1);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The length of '{}' is {}."</span><span>, s1, len);</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>calculate_length</span><span>(s: &amp;</span><span>String</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>usize</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    s.</span><span>len</span><span>()</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Here, we are passing a reference of <em>s1</em>, then s and <em>s1</em> points to the same structure. Semantics  is important here because <em>&amp;s1</em> lets us create a reference to the value of <em>s1</em> but <u>does not own it</u>. This is a very important distinction because the actual value of <em>s1</em> will only be dropped after the real owner from the <em>main()</em> scope, stops using it. </p>
<p>The <code>&amp;s1</code> syntax lets us create a reference that <em>refers</em> to the value of <code>s1</code> but does not own it. Because it does not own it, the value it points to will not be dropped when the reference goes out of scope.</p>
<p>We cannot modify the String structure from within the <em>calculate_length()</em> function because we borrowed <em>s1</em>, we don´t own it.</p>
<p>Now, what if we need to modify the String owned by <em>s1</em> and we want to continue to let <em>s1</em> as owner of the struct in the <em>main()</em> function?</p>
<p>For this case we have something called <strong><em>Mutable References</em></strong>. </p>
<pre data-language="rust" data-index="9"><code><span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span>() {</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> s = </span><span>String</span><span>::</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>"hello"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>change</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> s);</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>change</span><span>(some_string: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>    some_string.</span><span>push_str</span><span>(</span><span>", world"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Using <em>mut</em> this way does the trick but there is only one caveat, for security reasons you can only use mutable references only once in a particular scope for a particular piece of data. </p>
<p>Therefore, something like this will fail:</p>
<pre data-language="rust" data-index="10"><code><span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> s = </span><span>String</span><span>::</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>"hello"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>let</span><span> r1 = &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> s;</span></span>
<span><span>let</span><span> r2 = &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> s;</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}, {}"</span><span>, r1, r2);</span></span></code></pre>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Any number of immutable references or one mutable reference can exist at any time of your code. However, references must always be valid. </p>
<p><strong><em>Notice</em></strong>: The objective of this post was to find another way to explain how variables are handled by Rust, therefore most of the source code examples here have been borrowed from the official <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html">Rust website</a> documentation.</p>

According to <a href="https://www.cato.org/publications/survey-reports/poll-62-americans-say-they-have-political-views-theyre-afraid-share">a recent poll by the Cato Institute</a>, a third of Americans say that they are personally worried about losing their jobs or missing out on career opportunities if they express their real political opinions. Americans in all walks of life have been publicly shamed, pressured into ritualistic apologies or summarily fired.</p><p>But critics of the critics of cancel culture make a powerful retort. Accusing others of canceling can, they claim, be a way to stigmatize legitimate criticism. As Hannah Giorgis <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/07/harpers-letter-free-speech/614080/">writes in the </a><em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/07/harpers-letter-free-speech/614080/">Atlantic</a></em>, “critical tweets are not censorship.”</p><p>So what, exactly, does a cancellation consist of? And how does it differ from the exercise of free speech and robust critical debate? </p><p>At a conceptual level, the difference is clear. Criticism marshals evidence and arguments in a rational effort to persuade. Canceling, by contrast, seeks to organize and manipulate the social or media environment in order to isolate, deplatform or intimidate ideological opponents. It is about shaping the information battlefield, not seeking truth; and its intent—or at least its predictable outcome—is to coerce conformity and reduce the scope for forms of criticism that are not sanctioned by the prevailing consensus of some local majority.</p><p>In practice, however, telling canceling apart from criticism can be difficult because both take the <em>form</em> of criticizing others. That is why it is probably impossible to devise a simple bright-line test of what should count as a harmful instance of cancelation.</p><p>A better approach might therefore be diagnostic. Like the symptoms of cancer, the hallmarks of a cancellation are many. Though not all instances involve every single characteristic, they all involve <em>some </em>of its key attributes. Rather than issuing a single litmus test, the diagnostic approach allows us to draw up a checklist of warning signs. The more signs you see, the more certain you can be that you are looking at a cancel campaign.</p><p>Six warning signs make up my personal checklist for cancel culture. </p><p><strong>Punitiveness</strong></p><p><em>Are people denouncing you to your employer, your professional groups or your social connections? Are you being blacklisted from jobs and social opportunities? Does what is being said to or about you have the goal—or foreseeable effect—of jeopardizing your livelihood or isolating you socially?</em></p><p>A critical culture seeks to correct rather than punish. In science, the penalty for being wrong is not that you lose your job or your friends. Normally, the only penalty is that you lose the argument. Even the phenomenon of retracting papers is new and deservedly controversial, because the usual—and very effective—method has been for science to simply discard mistakes and move on. Wrong answers and bad science die on the vine and disappear. Incentives are mostly positive, not punitive: for being right, you win citations, promotions, fame and fancy prizes. Taking a punitive attitude toward mistakes undermines the scientific process because knowledge advances by trial and error.</p><p>Canceling, by contrast, seeks to punish rather than correct—and often for a single misstep rather than a long track record of failure. A professor <a href="https://spectator.us/academics-get-paper-retracted-some-havent-read-nathan-cofnas/">swears</a> to “ruin [a graduate student’s] reputation permanently and deservedly.” Campaigners against an art curator <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/gary-garrels-departure-sfmoma-1893964">declare</a> he “must be removed from his job, effective immediately.”</p><p>The point is to make the errant suffer. </p><p><strong>Deplatforming</strong></p><p><em>Are campaigners attempting to prevent you from publishing your work, giving speeches or attending meetings? Are they claiming that allowing you to be heard is violence against them or makes them unsafe?</em></p><p>A critical culture tolerates dissent rather than silencing it. It understands that dissent can seem obnoxious, harmful, hateful and, yes, <em>unsafe</em>. To minimize unnecessary damage, it goes to great lengths to encourage people to express themselves in a civil manner. But it also understands that, every so often, an obnoxious dissenter is right—and so it opposes silencing and deplatforming.</p><p>Canceling, by contrast, seeks to shut up and shout down its targets. Cancelers often define the mere act of disagreeing with them as a threat to their safety or even an act of violence. Staffers at the <em>New York Times </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/07/business/media/new-york-times-washington-post-protests.html">claimed</a> that the mere act of publishing a controversial op-ed piece endangered them. Staffers at the <em>New Yorker</em> demanded that Steve Bannon be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/opinion/bannon-new-yorker-festival-remnick.html">deplatformed</a>. Shout-downs, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjYkNS36ILrAhVUYDUKHWcADuIQFjAAegQIARAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thefire.org%2Fresearch%2Fdisinvitation-database%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ONE1G9KXx27R20K-ezA56">disinvitations</a> and demands for retractions and withdrawals are cancelers’ stock in trade.</p><p><strong>Organization</strong></p><p><em>Does criticism appear to be organized and targeted? Are the organizers recruiting others to pile on? Are you being swarmed and brigaded? Are people hunting through your work and scouring social media to find ammunition to use against you?</em></p><p>Critical culture relies on persuasion. The way to win an argument is to convince others that you are right. Often, of course, schools of thought form, and arguments between them can grow heated; but organizing pressure campaigns against political or ideological targets is usually considered out of bounds.</p><p>By contrast, it’s common to see cancelers organize hundreds of petition-signers or thousands of social media users to dig up and prosecute an indictment. Recently, for example, campaigners picked through the social media posts of the psychologist (and member of <em>Persuasion</em>’s Board of Advisers) Steven Pinker in the hope of digging up some kind of case against him. Though they only came up with <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2020/07/05/the-purity-posse-pursues-pinker/">trivial charges</a>, such as that he had twice used the terms “urban crime” and “urban violence,” they got hundreds of signatories to join a group denunciation.</p><p><strong>Secondary Boycotts</strong></p><p><em>Is there an explicit or implicit threat that people who support you will get the same punitive treatment that you are receiving? Are people putting pressure on employers and professional colleagues to fire you or stop associating with you? Do people who defend you, or criticize the campaign against you, have to fear adverse consequences?</em></p><p>With its commitments to exploring a wide range of ideas and correcting rather than coercing the errant, a critical culture sees no value in instilling a climate of fear. But instilling fear is what canceling is all about. By choosing targets unpredictably (almost anything can trigger a campaign), providing no safe harbors (even conformists can get hit), and implicitly threatening anyone who sides with those who are targeted, canceling sends the message: “you could be next.”</p><p>Thus, a canceled journalist was quickly dropped by his employer, his professional association and his publisher, becoming “<a href="https://reason.com/2019/08/23/im-radioactive/">radioactive</a>,” as he put it. (At last check, he was applying to law schools.) In the resulting climate, people will often join public denunciations or <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/stand-up-for-the-wrongly-accused-341">refrain from defending targets they believe to be innocent</a>, to avoid becoming controversial themselves.</p><p><strong>Moral Grandstanding</strong></p><p><em>Is the tone of the discourse ad hominem, repetitive, ritualistic, posturing, accusatory, outraged? Are people flattening distinctions, demonizing you, slinging inflammatory labels and engaging in moral one-upmanship? Are people ignoring what you actually say—talking about but not to you? </em></p><p>Precisely because speech can be hurtful, critical culture discourages extreme rhetoric. It encourages people to listen to each other, to use evidence and argumentation, to behave reasonably and to avoid personal attacks.</p><p>Cancel culture is much more invested in what philosophers Justin Tosi and Brandon Warmke call “<a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/grandstanding-9780190900151?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">moral grandstanding</a>”: the display of moral outrage to impress one’s peer group, dominate others, or both. Grandstanders who condemn someone are not interested in persuading or correcting her; in fact, they are not really talking <em>to</em> her at all. Rather, they are using her as a convenient object in a campaign to elevate their own status. Pile-ons, personal attacks and bidding wars to show the most outrage are all ways of engaging in moral grandstanding.</p><p><strong>Truthiness</strong></p><p><em>Are the things being said about you inaccurate? Do the people saying them not even seem to care about their veracity? Do they feel at liberty to distort your words, ignore corrections and make false accusations?</em></p><p>Concern for accuracy is the north star of a critical culture. Not everyone gets every fact right, nor do people always agree on what is true; and yet people in a critical culture try to present their own and others’ viewpoints honestly and accurately. Though I may fail to live up to this standard in some cases, I recognize that I should address what you actually said, not an inflammatory caricature or some out-of-context quotation.</p><p>One of many reasons Donald Trump is a menace to democracy is that he views truth instrumentally, as something to use, abuse or ignore depending on the needs of the moment. He repeats discredited assertions <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/12/10/meet-bottomless-pinocchio-new-rating-false-claim-repeated-over-over-again/">again and again</a>—or shifts ground <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-says-it-doesnt-really-matter-if-iranian-general-posed-an-imminent-threat/2020/01/13/c9f7ea1c-362e-11ea-9541-9107303481a4_story.html">to another</a> when one assertion is definitively debunked. Cancelers often play the same kind of <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/rhetorical-calvinball">rhetorical Calvinball</a>.</p><p>Cancelers’ characterizations of a paper by the philosopher Rebecca Tuvel, for example, were <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/05/transracialism-article-controversy.html">demonstrably incorrect</a>. The person who initiated the campaign even admitted to <a href="http://www.butterfliesandwheels.org/2017/can-we-get-this-person-fired/">not having read</a> the supposedly objectionable paper. “So little of what has been said … is based upon people actually reading what I wrote,” Tuvel <a href="http://dailynous.com/2017/05/01/philosophers-article-transracialism-sparks-controversy/">lamented</a> in a public statement. </p><p>But that did not stop anybody. For canceling is not about seeking truth or persuading others; it is a form of information warfare, in which <a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/63ite2/the-colbert-report-the-word---truthiness">truthiness</a> suffices if it serves the cause.</p><p>Those are my six warning signs. If you spot one or two, you should fear that a canceling may be happening; if you see five or six, you can be sure.</p><p>Obviously, mine is not the only approach. Other people, such as <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/a-taxonomy-of-fear">Emily Yoffe</a> and <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/04/whats-the-best-way-to-protect-free-speech-ken-white-and-greg-lukianoff-debate-cancel-culture/">Greg Lukianoff</a>, have made their own attempts at characterizing the current climate of fear or defining cancel culture. Hopefully, many more suggestions and refinements will follow. </p><p>As with most other concepts, we might never come to a complete consensus about its best definition. Still, I predict …</p></div></div>

      <p>Short answer: because we said so.<!--more--></p>

<p>:)</p>



<p>Alright, fine, that’s too short to make it an article, dear reader, and my inflammatory words demand an explanation.</p>

<p>The C Committee meeting – originally scheduled for Freiburg, Germany but not happening there because <em>(* vague gesturing towards outside *)</em> – concluded Friday, August 7th. It went pretty well, with us making good progress on all fronts. Yes, we make real progress; I promise we do, and this is not a dead language.</p>

<p>As a side note I’ve also become the Project Editor for C so before you take this as an uninformed rant of a person too lazy to “make things better”, let me assure that I am, indeed, incredibly invested in making sure C can begin to meet the needs of developers without needing 50 vendor-specific extensions to build remotely nice/usable libraries and applications.</p>

<p>Still, I made a claim (the C Language will never stop you from making mistakes), and therefore I need to substantiate it. We could look at the thousands of CVEs and the inherent issues with tons of C Code, or the need for MISRA to vigorously police every last little potential C feature to prevent misuse (<a href="https://twitter.com/thephantomderp/status/1290824683399663616">hello, K&amp;R prototype declarations</a>…), or other more intricate and fun bugs related to portability and undefined behavior. But instead, we are just going to take the words from the horse’s mouth: the Committee itself.</p>



<p>No, dear reader, put the popcorn away. As with all ISO proceedings, I am not allowed to quote anyone verbatim, and this is not a name-and-shame article. It will, however, explain why things that we can easily diagnose and identify as bad behavior in standards-conforming ISO C will never go away. And we will start with a paper by Dr. Philipp Klaus Krause:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2526.htm">N2526, use const for data from the library that shall not be modified</a>.</p>

<p>N2526 is a very simple paper. “Some data returned by the library is <code>const</code> morally, spiritually, and in fact even by its implementation. It’s undefined behavior and wrong to write into it, so let’s stop teasing each other about it and put a ring on that finger bad boy!” … Okay, that’s not exactly what it says, but I’m sure the idea makes sense to you, dear reader. Originally, when the vote for this paper was taken, there was almost no votes against the paper. Then, a few people voiced their <em>strong</em> objections to the paper because it breaks old code. And, well, of course that’s bad: even my breath caught and I strained to think about this – adding <code>const</code>? C has no ABI that could be affected by this, C (their implementations) doesn’t even respect qualifiers, how are we breaking things?! So, let’s talk about why this would be a breaking change in the eyes of certain folk.</p>



<p>Or, as I like to call it, “The Type Safety Is For Losers Language”. Of course, that’s a mouthful, so “C” will have to do. You may be wondering why I would call a language like C as having no type safety. After all,</p>

<p>
Yes, two entirely unrelated pointer types can be set to one another in standards-conforming C. Most compilers warn, but it is standards-conforming to accept this code unless you crank up the <code>-Werror</code> <code>-Wall</code> <code>-Wpedantic</code> etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>In fact, other pointer-related things the compiler can accept without an explicit cast are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>volatile</code> (who needs those semantics anyways?!)</li>
  <li><code>const</code> (write into all the read-only data you like!)</li>
  <li><code>_Atomic</code> (thread safety, shred shmafety!)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, note I am not arguing that you should not be able to do these things at all. But when you’re working in C – wherein it is very easy to get yourself a 500, 1000-line function alongside variable names that do not describe WTF they are for – the Hard Facts™ is that you work primarily with pointers, and you lack any amount of safety at all insofar as the Core Language cares. (NOTE: It <strong>is</strong> a constraint violation, but there’s so much legacy code that every implementation ignores qualifiers anyhow, so your code won’t ever <em>stop</em> compiling because of this (<a href="https://twitter.com/fanf/status/1292826424345337868">thanks, @fanf!</a>)!) Every potential failure here is diagnosable – easily so – with a compiler, and they all warn, but they will never require you to cast to communicate to the compiler that you Seriously, Really Meant It. It also means – much more importantly – that the human beings who come after you will have no bloody idea if you meant to do this, either.</p>

<p>All someone has to do is strip the build of <code>-Werror</code> <code>-Wall</code> <code>-Wpedantic</code> and you’ll be off to the races in committing multithreading, read-only, and hardware register crimes.</p>

<p>Now, this is fair, right? If someone strips off all of these warning/error flags, they obviously do not care about whatever faux pas or silly gaffe you’ve committed. Which means that, at the end of the day, these warnings are ultimately irrelevant and harmless as far as standards-conforming, ISO C is concerned. And yet…</p>



<p>Yes.</p>

<p>This is a special kind of hell that C developers have grown comfortable with, and to a lesser extent C++ developers. Warnings are seen as annoyances; and, as is shown by ever turning on <code>-Weverything</code> or <code>/W4</code>, they very well are. Shadowing warnings from variables in the global namespace (thanks, every header and C library ever is now a problem), using “reserved” names (as the kids say, “<a href="https://wg14.link/n2493">lol nice one xd!!</a>”), and “this struct has padding because you used <code>alignof</code>” (… yes, yes I know it has padding, I explicitly asked it to increase my padding BECAUSE I USED <code>alignof</code> MR. COMPILER) are all incredibly time-wasting.</p>

<p>But they are warnings.</p>

<p>Even if they are annoying, they prevent problems. The fact that I can blithely <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/rEbPvd">ignore all qualifiers and dumpster all forms of read, write, thread, and read-only safety</a> is a serious issue when it comes to communicating intent and preventing bugs. Even the old K&amp;R syntax produced bugs in industrial and government codebases because users did the wrong thing. This is not because they are shit programmers: it’s because they are straddling codebases sometimes older than they are and gearing up to ride on a multi-million line technical liability. You cannot keep the entirety of the codebase in your head: this is what conventions, static analysis, high warning levels, and everything are supposed to combat. Unfortunately,</p>

<p>everyone likes to have Warning Free code.</p>

<p>This means that the moment a GCC developer makes a warning more sensitive to potential problematic cases, maintainers (not the original developers) will suddenly get hefty several-gigabyte logs containing all the newest vomit of warnings and other things from their old code. “This is stupid”, they say, “the code has been running for Y E A R S, why is GCC complaining now?”. This means that even doing something like adding <code>const</code> to a function signature, even if it is morally, spiritually, and factually the right thing to do, is avoided. “Breaking” people is “they now have to look at code which has questionable intentions”. This is code that would – on pain of Undefined Behavior – crash your chip or <a href="https://twitter.com/MalwareMinigun/status/1260061878614556684">corrupt your memory</a>. But that’s the other problem with being a C developer in today’s ecosystem, really.</p>

<h3 id="age-as-a-measure-of-quality">Age as a Measure of Quality</h3>

<p>How many people would have ever guessed <code>sudo</code> had a vulnerability as jaw-droppingly simple as “-1 or integer overflow gives you access to everything”? How many people thought Heartbleed would be a real problem? How many game developers are shipping stb’s “tiny” libraries without ever having run a fuzzer on them and realizing they contain more significant exploitable input vulnerabilities than they could imagine? This is not a dig at any of these pieces of code or the programmers behind them: they are providing a vital service that the world has depended on for decades, often with little to no support from anyone until a big problem exploded. But, the people worshipping and deploying these pieces of code end up fermenting a toxic adage under the auspice of survivorship bias:</p>

<p>“This code is so old and used by so many, how could it possibly have problems?”</p>

<p>By holding backwards compatibility and “not being a bother” as the highest ideals for C code, people who survive long enough in the industry begin to equate age with quality, as if codebases were barrels of wine in a cellar. The older and longer the code is used, the finer and more delectable the wine.</p>

<p>The reality is, unfortunately, far less romantic and cute: crawling with more bugs than you can shake a stick at, security vulnerabilities by the basketful, these technical liabilities only grow more risky with each passing day. Each system evolves into a half-alive, unaddressed, and partially-unmaintained rotting husk. They are gussied up and given the veneer of nobility and greatness when it is in fact an embalmed corpse, just waiting to be poked the wrong way before its festering, antediluvian pustules burst and fill your application with its finely aged botulism.</p>

<h3 id="okay-gross-but-like-what-about-the-c-standard">Okay… Gross, but like what about the C Standard?</h3>

<p>The problem I have noticed in my (incredibly short) tenure as a member is that we prefer backwards compatibility over all else, attributing old applications and their use cases over any chance at improving the safety, …</p></section></div>

                 <p>Wayback Wednesdays: Richelieu</p>
<p>On this day in 1624, Cardinal Armand Jean du Plessis, Duke of Richelieu (known simply as "Richelieu" ) was made president of the council of ministers of France</p>
<p>When I say "France", I mean something as we know it today, but back then it was anything but a country. There were severe internal differences, each little fiefdom had it's own lord, and national control was a rare if non-existent thing. The old joke is that the phrase "Holy Roman Empire" was wrong on all counts: It wasn't holy, it wasn't Roman, and it wasn't an Empire.</p>
<p>After the Western Roman Empire slowly disintegrated into little kingdoms, the people in the west still thought of themselves as Romans. Why wouldn't they? In fact, if you look at some very modern terms for leader, like "Tsar" and "Keiser", they're just different ways of saying Caesar.</p>

                 <p>Theory Tuesdays: The MAT</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, I created the Markham Assessment Tool (MAT). The idea wasn't to implement processes, or make some new "maturity scale" for organizations to use to monitor and punish teams. Instead, every team, even the most successful ones, had things they should probably talk about but had been putting it off (or never realized it) The MAT was an effort to provide a standard language to begin conversations no matter how big or what the nature of the team was.</p>
<p>The first job was finding a detailed enough language to try to pinpoint where the conversations should happen. The default was a combination of the RUP and the CMMI's "common obstacles to process improvement" (Once again, this tool had nothing to do with process; it was just about creating a standard language that could be used by coaches across teams) Other combinations were used as well during field testing.</p>            </div>

<h3>Department of State Emergency Relocation Site and Communications Station, Front Royal, VA (demolished)</h3>
<p>These facilities were located at what is now the Smithsonian Institution's Conservation and Research Center.
According to the Center's <a href="http://nationalzoo.si.edu/ConservationAndScience/CRC/FrontRoyal/about_us/CRC_history/"> official history</a>:</p>
<p>"In addition to the USDA functions, the Department of State used a portion of the Center's facilities as an Emergency Relocation site and a communications station.
The State Department equipped several buildings as offices in case of national emergency--enough for the Secretary and 700 State Department employees.
By 1972, all that was left of this activity was the communication station.
In the winter of 1973, USDA decided to close down the Research Station's operations."</p>

<p><b><span lang="EN-US">The Boring Company Continues
Expansion Plans as Elon Musk has been granted permission to extend his
tunnel under Las Vegas. This tunnel will link the city from one end to the
other, reducing the crossing time from 30 minutes to only 3 minutes.</span></b></p>

<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-k8TD5Ci7OII/XzEjoYKdh5I/AAAAAAAABP0/AdnqIOXBMT4RiP_eS4OcQWy8OImDVoVLwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/boring-company-tunnel.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img alt="las-vegas-tunnel-boring-company" data-original-height="600" data-original-width="1200" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-k8TD5Ci7OII/XzEjoYKdh5I/AAAAAAAABP0/AdnqIOXBMT4RiP_eS4OcQWy8OImDVoVLwCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/boring-company-tunnel.jpg" title="boring company tunnel" width="640"></a></p>


<p><span lang="EN-US">This extension follows
the first section completed between the east and west of the Las Vegas
Convention Center. This network of tunnels under the city would avoid congestion
on the main roads.<o:p></o:p></span></p>




<h2>
<b><span lang="EN-US"><span>Crossing
the city at 155 mph</span></span></b></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The purpose of the tunnel
built by The Boring Company is to reduce the time it takes to cross the city by
offering several stations to serve different destinations located on its axis.
The center of Las Vegas, like many large cities, is congested with too much
traffic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QxnwMWUn4ug/XzEjx4Unv0I/AAAAAAAABP4/ef-6APb0ewEsrDQF8SBt-I1idNX0DbOHwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/elon-musk-tesla-tunnel-boring.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img alt="elon-musk-boring-tesla-tunnel" data-original-height="726" data-original-width="968" height="480" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QxnwMWUn4ug/XzEjx4Unv0I/AAAAAAAABP4/ef-6APb0ewEsrDQF8SBt-I1idNX0DbOHwCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/elon-musk-tesla-tunnel-boring.jpg" title="las vegas tunnel" width="640"></a></p>





<p><span lang="EN-US">The Boring Company
provides an original solution by placing vehicles travelling at very high speed
under the city in a tunnel specially designed for this purpose. The vehicles
will be able to reach a top speed of 155 mph, making it possible to link the
city from north to south in only 3 minutes instead of 30 minutes using the

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Content sites are great, low barrier to entry businesses that (when done right) can generate a sustainable source of cash. </p><p>Not only that, but they’re also fun. Using the method I’m going to outline below, you can pick a topic that really interests you — learn more about it — and make money in the process.</p><p>I started two of my own content sites a few years ago. They were my first foray into internet businesses and affiliate marketing. When I started the first one (about running — Let’s Go Run), I had no idea what I was doing, and no money to do it. </p><p>I scrounged around the internet finding resources about SEO, keyword planning and blogging. I went through about three SemRush trial’s (sorry SemRush!) with different emails trying to come up with a keyword plan, and figure out why the hell my blog posts weren’t coming up on Google! Then, after about 4 months of working on it and putting out content religiously, I started ranking for one of my main keywords. </p><p>I made it to the front page of Google! I’ll never forget the excitement.</p><p>That got me hooked. I spent the next few years growing out that site, and creating another one with my mom (who loves golf). </p><p>I got them to the small-medium level (each had traffic of about 10k monthly visits) and then sold them online. I needed the cash to start what I thought was a ‘real’ business. </p><p>The thing is, I sold them way before I had monetized each of them properly. I just didn’t know what I was doing! And the buyer knew it. All the income was from affiliate earnings, and they were running off the same account (so I don’t have specific figures for each website), earning around about $80 to $100 mark per month combined.</p><p>Knowing what I do now about niche content sites, and their ability to generate a sustainable cash flow, I would have never sold those sites. </p><p>This is my approach to building content sites that are monetized effectively, and how you can too.</p><h2>Background</h2><h3>What Are They?</h3><p>A niche content site is just a website where people wanting to know about something in a certain niche go to find that out.</p><p>If you take any subreddit, and create content specifically tailored to that audience, it would be a niche content site.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5f2a52457e66346b8d05835d_0*gL3fHRm-e86x0tgu.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Swim University is the perfect example of a niche site: Everything you need to know about keeping a pool clean.</p><h3>How Do They Work?</h3><p>The fundamentals of it are as follows:</p><ol role="list"><li>Pick a specific niche.</li><li>Create content around that niche, and post it on the website.</li><li>Drive readers to that website.</li><li>Build an audience of readers.</li><li>Monetize that audience.</li></ol><h3>A Modified Approach</h3><p>The approach I’m going to give you here uses the framework above, but modifies the Monetization step slightly.</p><p>The goal is simple: <strong>Get to revenue as fast as possible.</strong></p><p>We’ll go into monetization further below, but the gist of it is this:</p><ul role="list"><li>Traditional niche site model requires a ton of traffic to make decent money (especially today).</li><li>My model requires a few thousand views a month with high intent and in a specific niche.</li></ul><h3>Examples</h3><p><strong>SwimUniversity.com</strong> (above) — Pool care</p><p><strong>GearLab.com</strong> — Outdoor gear reviews</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5f2a524647ea4173bd1d6c06_0*d8YHEXfmp62TptgH.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>ApartmentTherapy.com — </strong>Kit out and care for your trendy apartment</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5f2a524669ed957a4dbc995f_0*9KPXKzA3bD2Qt04E.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>Fatherly.com</strong> — A site for dad’s</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5f2a5245e566339d3104c7a4_0*kZ2EoL3V_m9I3aZ7.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Motivation</h3><p>Before you continue, understand your motivation for wanting to do this.</p><p>Here’s mine: <strong>Cash</strong>. Niche sites are great cash generators if you can get them right. As long as you have a steady flow of traffic, they can bring in a (mostly) reliable income every single month.</p><p>For me, that means not having to worry about rent as an expense.</p><p>For you, it might mean an additional income to fund your startup.</p><p>Get clear on your motivation to do this so that when things aren’t going so well, you know whether to knuckle down and commit, or bail out because it’s taking too much time and energy to achieve what you want.</p><p>These aren’t sexy businesses, but they work if you do ’em right.</p><h2>🚵 Pick A Niche</h2><p><strong>And validate it, too.</strong></p><p>This is my unconventional advice: <strong>Start with your interests</strong>.</p><p>The thesis behind that is: If you’re not interested in it, you’re not going to want to create content about it.</p><p>One thing I do know is that for this to be successful you have to commit to creating enough content.</p><p>There are a few things you need to consider when picking a niche, though.</p><h3><strong>Audience size</strong></h3><ul role="list"><li>You need a big enough audience to make this viable. <em>Golf</em> = too broad and too competitive. <em>Left-Handed Blind Golfers</em> = too niche. You get the point.</li><li>I would define niche as SwimUniversity.com (above).</li><li>I would define micro-niche as SwimUniversity.com but for glass fibre pools only.</li><li>As a guide — though this is very dependent on your audience and monetization method — your monthly search volume shouldn’t be lower than 30k visits (or 1k visitors a day).</li></ul><h3><strong>Can you monetize it?</strong></h3><ul role="list"><li>Does this audience typically spend money on this interest? Either directly or indirectly. If yes, then the answer will almost always be continue.</li></ul><p>or…</p><ul role="list"><li>Can you generate a ton of search traffic (100k monthly +), which you’d be able to monetize through Display Ads? This would require large search volume for your search keywords, as well as low domain authority for the competing sites. This is generally only available in completely unexplored niches (of which there are very few around).</li></ul><h3><strong>How does that audience consume most of their content?</strong></h3><ul role="list"><li>And can you create that content. If your niche consumes mainly blog posts, great. Low barrier. If they mostly consume well produced video content, and you have no experience doing that = bit higher barrier.</li></ul><h3>Do This Now</h3><ol role="list"><li>Write down all your interests, and then some. Aim for 50 ideas.</li><li>Rank them in order of how ‘niche’ they are. Ie: How many other people are there who share this interest in the world.</li><li>Then rank them in order of your interest in each of them.</li><li>Choose the top 5 combined ranking.</li><li>Sign up for a keyword volume research tool (Most of them offer free trials). I use <a href="https://app.kwfinder.com/#a5dca93d6feebf8609c185b05" target="_blank">Mangools</a>. It’s a lot cheaper (and a bit less powerful) than <a href="https://www.semrush.com/lp/all-in-one-marketing-toolkit/en/?ref=3487429516&amp;refer_source=15-business-ideas-blog-post&amp;utm_source=berush&amp;utm_medium=promo&amp;utm_campaign=link_landing_page:_all-in-one_marketing_toolkit" target="_blank">SEMrush </a>or Ahrefs, but it suits my needs perfectly.</li><li>Do a search for your topic and start collating and creating keywords with monthly search volume &gt; 500 and keyword difficulty &lt; 30. Go after long-tail keywords if you can’t find any.</li><li>If you’re new to this, I haven’t found a better resource than <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/keyword-research/?ref=SimonBlogs" target="_blank">Neil Patel’s guide to keyword research.</a></li><li>When you’re done, you should have a good idea of the amount of monthly traffic you can generate (remember, you’re going to have to rank on the first page for those search terms to get a <em>portion </em>of that traffic!).</li><li>Giving hard and fast rules about traffic volume and keyword difficulty targets is difficult.</li><li>Andrew Boscini put it well to me on Twitter the other day:</li></ol><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5f2a52453067ff4556a6074b_1*hPVtmGrOkuYQX1g7uGPTmQ.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Are you going for a ton of traffic that converts in the low % range, or are you going more niche, with very high search intent?</p><p>I’d also recommend snooping around the following forums/places to get a sense for the community you’re diving into and what the pain points are:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Reddit </strong>(Find all the applicable sub-reddits)</li><li><strong>Quora </strong>(What questions are people asking)</li><li><strong>Websites</strong>/<strong>Forums </strong>(Who are you competing with)</li><li><strong>Wikipedia </strong>(What information can I give on this niche)</li><li><strong>Twitter </strong>(Do a search and see who the top authorities in the space are)</li><li><strong>Facebook Groups </strong>(How many are they, are they engaged or spammy?)</li></ul><p>As you pick up on areas of discussion, do a search for them as they relate to your niche in the keyword finder and add all those keywords to your list too.</p><h2>✍🏽 Content</h2><p>That’s the fun part done.</p><p>Now that you’ve got your keyword list defined, you need to start writing content. Religiously.</p><p>This is where most people fail on niche sites. They write a few (maybe 5 or 6) articles, and then they get bored and move on. That’s why I said earlier you need to pick a niche that you’re interested in.</p><p>As a guideline, you’re likely going to need to write 100-odd pieces of content in a year.</p><p>If you think that’s unachievable in the niche you’ve selected (because you’ll get bored or otherwise) you have two choices:</p><ol role="list"><li>Go back to the step above and choose a different niche that you’re going to be interested enough in.</li><li>Hire writers (money required).</li></ol><h3>Do This Now</h3><ol role="list"><li>Once you’ve decided on your niche, start writing. Open a Google Doc and begin on your first piece of content. Aim to put out 2 or 3 pieces for 3 or 4 days back to back.</li><li>You should be going after your most valuable keyword’s (high search, low keyword difficulty) first.</li><li>After 3 or 4 days, you’ll have a good idea for the tone/style of your content and you’ll be better positioned to register a domain and setup a home for your content.</li><li>Try and follow the theme of the example domains I showed above. Preferably including one of the main keywords which describes your niche in the url.</li><li>Don’t get hung up if the ideal .com domain isn’t available. There are other options:</li></ol><ul role="list"><li>Your country’s domain extension (only do this if you’re looking to only attract an audience in your own country)</li><li>.co is a great option</li><li>.io is well recognized in the tech-space</li></ul><p>Your domain name is not the be-all and end-all. A nice one is nice to have, but it’s not essential.</p><p>6. Without a doubt, Wordpress is the best option for a quick and easy setup.</p><p>Your domain/hosting provider will likely have some sort of installer for Wordpress available in the backend (Softaculous, usually) which will do it for you.</p><p>7. Install a theme. I get mine from <a href="https://creativemarket.com/themes/wordpress/blog?u=simonpurdon10" target="_blank">Creative Market.</a></p><p>Again, don’t get hung up on the details. You’ll be surprised by how little people care about the nitty-gritty things that seem to be a big deal to the website-owner.</p><p>If your site works well, looks reasonably good, loads quickly, with great content — that’ll do.</p><p>8. Post your content. Add images. Add external links (more on this later).</p><p>9. Add a method of collecting email addresses! Don’t just have a generic “Join our newsletter” either. No one wants to join just another newsletter.</p><p>Give your readers an actual incentive for signing up: “Join our newsletter for exclusive access to subscriber-only content”.</p><p>10. Remember to install:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/" target="_blank">Yoast SEO plugin</a> (for on-site SEO help)</li><li>Google Analytics</li><li>Facebook Pixel</li></ul><h2>🖱️ Traffic</h2><p>Now for the most important (but also the most tedious, for me) part: <strong>Driving traffic.</strong></p><p>Putting up content and hoping …</p></div></div>

  <p>This story has a soundtrack – as you read, the music changes.</p>

<p>Kyra pulled off her headphones and dumped them onto her desk. She rubbed her eyes then tried to focus on the room around her. It was dark. It was… some time in the night. Thank goodness she wasn’t on shift tomorrow… today… whatever. The glow from her screen still burned into her eyes so all she saw as she looked around was a black-green haze. She picked up her oversized mug and tried to take a mouthful of cold coffee before coming to the disappointing discovery that it was empty. Optimistically, Kyra tipped it upside down until a single drop landed on her tongue then she glanced back at the confirmation dialog on her screen. Release or cancel?</p>

<p>She spun half way round in her chair, hoping to get some of her sight back. Her rollercat appeared from under her bed, its digital eyes dim red in night mode.</p>

<p>The rollercat was about 10 years old and well overdue for an upgrade but Kyra had become attached to it so had just kept upgrading the firmware. It was a ball suspended in fluid inside another ball. However you turned it, the face stayed upright. Inside the inner ball was a tiny computer, a small screen, a motor and a weight. To move around, the motor moved the weight, the ball rolled, the insides stayed upright. It was simple but it was cute. It liked to think it was deadly.</p>

<p>Rollercat purred inquisitively as it rolled over to her and bumped against her bare toes.</p>

<p>“Hey, kitty. Any messages?”</p>

<p>The quiet ‘dunk’ noise told her there weren’t. The rollercat’s face looked open as it tried to read her expression about whether no messages was a good thing or a bad thing. Seeing the corner of Kyra’s mouth curl up ever-so-slightly in the darkness, rollercat smiled contentedly then rolled back and forth along the side of Kyra’s foot.</p>

<p>Kyra had just spent somewhere between 6 and 12 hours (she couldn’t be sure) putting the final touches on her new project. She’d been working on it every night for the last month. Maybe 2 months. Wait, was it winter yet?</p>

<p>She had just completed a new compiler that matched the interface of The Pool. From the outside, it worked like every other Piece but inside it contained what she hoped would be a completely new method of compilation.</p>

<p>Kyra stood up and, barely looking at the screen, tapped ‘release’ before making the gesture to switch off her screen. Although she had become accustomed to the half-light of her room, she was now in complete darkness and, once again, couldn’t see a damned thing. Moving by memory, she deftly stepped over a pile of books, side-stepped a bicycle wheel and felt gingerly for the ceramic of the sink before hitting her knee on it. She brushed her teeth in darkness then collapsed back onto her bed. Rollercat disappeared under the bed once more and the pale red glow of its eyes faded.</p>

<p>She was exhausted but her brain was still twitching with ideas. Should she have waited? Had she made a mistake? Was this a stupid idea?</p>

<p>She tried to marshal her thoughts into place by letting her mind go back to the beginning. The Pool.</p>

<hr><b data-chapter="the-pool">the-pool</b>

<p>It all started from advances in software engineering. The realisation that music creation was a form of <em>declarative programming</em>. You specify what the outcome should be and the instrument renders it without you digging into the details of exactly how it gets there. Much the same way that mathematical problems found in algebra can be restated in geometric terms to provide greater insight and flexibility, tools and techniques from software engineering were applied to music composition and produced new and interesting solutions, new musical forms.</p>

<p>Of course, the flow went two ways. Once there was a clear relationship between the domains, people began applying musical techniques and solutions to software problems. This led to the development of ‘<em>Intention-Based Programming</em>’ or IBP. Beyond simply declaring the desired state, music could be written that conveyed a specific intention with the actual notes being left up to the player. A representative proof-of-concept compiler was developed that mapped this back into the software domain and it became possible to develop programs simply by stating an intention and leaving the details up to the compilers.</p>

<p>It was around this time that the first form of ‘The Pool’ developed. Musicians have always been inspired by other musicians and software developers have always tried to build on top of the work of others – why build something when you can copy-paste it? This led to the combination of algorithms and musical forms to create new pieces. Soon, there were online spaces where algorithms could be mixed freely and start to affect each other, start to produce hybrid algorithmic and musical works that combined the intentions of multiple developers into a single expression. These online spaces grew and merged. With the community coming together around the specification of the Algorhythmic Interface, all the individual online spaces for musical evolution became interlinked. The growth from then was exponential.</p>

<!--b class="mark" data-chapter="loud" data-if="the-pool" data-when="now" >loud</b -->

<p>As pieces grew and mixed, they began to display emergent behaviour. Popular algorithms would be listened to more and become stronger, they would produce random variations which would go on to merge with other pieces. The resultant new pieces payed homage to their predecessors but grew into something different – sometimes better, sometimes worse.</p>

<p>Soon, people were able to load a combination of sources onto their players and listen to them as they evolved through the day then reconnect to The Pool to release the resultant mix. Traditional musicians and software developers still existed but popular algorithm creators became the new trend setters. They were briefly known as Algorhythmists in the press but were mostly referred to as “beaters” (who focused on rhythmic generation) and “beepers” who created the melodies and chord structures.</p>

<p>Due to the specification of the Algorhythmic Interface, every individual user could have their own interpretation of the music and the same piece could sound like anything from slow romantic strings to breakbeat to metal even though they were all driven by the same numbers and equations. There were also visualisers that interpreted aspects of an algorithm into shapes, colours and movement. There were so many ways to create and consume this new form of expression that in only a few years, it became the dominant way to enjoy music, especially as more and more publishers converted and released their back-catalogues with the “Plays in the Pool™” industry movement. Classics were re-engineered as algorithms and released into The Pool. New developments could then build upon the whole of human musical history.</p>

<p>Kyra started as a developer. In high school, she became fascinated with compilers. Particularly those compilers that are written in the language they are compiling, bootstrapped compilers that build on their own previous generations. After years of dabbling around the edges, Kyra got involved in a few open-source projects. Fixing issues here and there, optimising loops, updating docs.</p>

<p>She was in her first year at college when intention-based programming became a big thing. As soon as she heard of it, she started working on a brand-new compiler from scratch. She wanted to bootstrap it completely so she started at the very lowest level, individual machine instructions running on the bare metal of the computer. Every step of the way, she kept the design principles of IBP in the front of her mind so that she was quickly able to make huge leaps forward in the development. Every time she enabled a new type of intention, she could use that in the next iteration and let the compiler worry about the best way to make that happen. Within a few months, her public repository had gained some attention and by the time the Kyral compiler (yes, she’d named it after herself) hit v1, she was already kinda internet-famous. For a certain definition of famous. In very specialised circles.</p>

<p>The open licence she released it under combined with the fact that it was leaps and bounds better at understanding intention than any of the competitors made her compiler the go-to standard. Soon, nearly every piece of music software and IDE embedded Kyral. One of the largest music publishing companies in the world offered her an in-house position that would let her work full-time on Kyral v2 but she turned them down. Despite never charging anyone for the compiler, Kyra had a donation button on her website with the text “If you like this, feel free to buy me a coffee”.</p>

<p>The donations let Kyra do more than buy a coffee. A large number of musicians had made a large amount of money by building on top of the tool she created and they felt they owed her. She had allowed them to express themselves in a way they’d never been able to before. Before she graduated college (with an average-but-not-great grade), she had a decent stash. Not enough to retire on but enough to let her buy a coffee shop and the apartment upstairs to live in. She served coffee during the daytime and coded at night.</p>

<p>It wasn’t the super high-tech, neon fever-dream of a future she’d imagined growing up but it came with limitless supplies of coffee and, ultimately, wasn’t that the dream of every coder?</p>

<p>With a smile, Kyra turned over on her bed and gave way to sleep.</p>

<hr id="mark-2"><b data-chapter="morning-after">morning-after</b>

<p>The next morning (or maybe afternoon, Kyra really had to get a clock in here…) she woke and groggily stood up. She could hear rollercat bumping around in the hall.</p>

<p>“Kitty?” she yelled “Coffee!”</p>

<p>Probably the single feature that most caused Kyra to to develop an attachment to her rollercat was the fact that it could talk to her coffee machine. Caffenation was just a yell away.</p>

<p>By the time Kyra made it to the kitchen, the espresso was just being pulled and the milk steamed. She put on some toast, grabbed her mug and sat at the table.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I have made some famously bad decisions in my life. I am sure you have too. I was taught to work my ass off, and hero-worship street hustle. Maybe you were too. But I was never taught how to make good decisions. I don’t think anyone ever is.&nbsp;</p><p>Is decision making really a fuzzy topic? Do successful people just get lucky, are better at making gut calls or do they really know the science of making good decisions? I have spent the past 1 year consciously learning more about this, and this is what I learnt.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></p><h2>Good decision vs good execution<br></h2><p>I have no problems with working hard. I am not that smart a person, so whatever little success I have had in my career, was because of hard work. I have been lucky to learn new things every new year (<em>digital marketing after graduating as an engineer, coding last year and Ukulele this year)</em>. Those new skills wouldn’t be possible without good execution.&nbsp;</p><p>Put your head down and execute can never really fail you. But I have learnt to realise the danger of <a href="https://www.inc.com/serhat-pala/alexis-ohanian-says-hustle-porn-is-most-dangerous-trend-in-silicon-valley-heres-how-to-eradicate-it.html" target="_blank">hustle porn</a>. Hard work can’t help you much if it is being applied at the wrong place. </p><figure id="w-node-d99405d490b2-0252ad77"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed0dc675974b414a3aa5b26/5f2941412b5ceeed77d7fe79_Avg%20decision%20vs%20great%20decision.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Average decision vs great decision.jpg</figcaption></figure><blockquote>It is way more important to work on the right thing at the right time, vs working hard.&nbsp;<br></blockquote><p>As a startup CEO in 2015, I used to tell everyone proudly that “<em>My superpower is working harder than others. It’s the only way to beat competition”. </em>What a stupid way to live life. I now spend more time thinking about what to do, vs doing it. I still work 10 hours everyday on Kaapi, and a few times last month I even pulled 16 hour workdays. But I now spend 10 days thinking about the decision, and then 20 days of execution. Those 10 days helped me narrow down on our market (<em>employee engagement &amp; feedback)</em>, find a decent GTM (<em>Slack app)</em> and get our earliest 7 paying customers within few days of public launch.<strong>‍</strong></p><h2>Two types of decisions&nbsp;</h2><p>We all make 100s of decisions every day. <em>What to eat? Where to sit? Should I go to sleep now?</em> These are all quick decisions.&nbsp;On the other end you have large life changing decisions e.g. <em>Should I marry this person? Should I go into this new market? Should we build this feature?</em>‍</p><p>If you have read the fabulous book “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow" target="_blank">Think fast, and slow</a>”, then you must already be familiar with the concept above. Daniel Kahneman calls this System 1 and System 2 thinking. System 1 is the quick one at the forefront of our monkey brain, while switching on System 2 is more a conscious effort. You have to force yourself to bring System 2 to the forefront. Slow down, think, analyse, introspect and then make a decision.</p><p>If you work in a fast paced environment, especially tech startups, then most probably you are making decisions via System 1. Yes, yes I know that you did an amazing quarterly <a href="https://www.kaapi.team/blog/a-simple-idiot-proof-guide-to-goal-setting" target="_blank">goal planning exercise</a> with loads of thinking. But did you really? Most startup founders (<em>and me, circa 2015)</em> are so busy fighting fires that planning for 90 days happens over one Friday meeting of 2 hours.</p><p>In almost every business or people decision as a leader, you should be focused on getting your System 2 on the driver seat. System 1 thinking leads to biased thinking, and hence bad decisions. More on that below.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></p><h2>How do humans make decisions<br></h2><figure id="w-node-a49202773084-0252ad77"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed0dc675974b414a3aa5b26/5f293fe6798affa281d639fb_Anatomy%20of%20a%20decision.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Anatomy of a decision</figcaption></figure><p>We react to changes around us. An employee leaving your team, a bug in the product or market conditions changing (<em>hello Covid-19!). </em>We take these new inputs, process them (<em>quickly or slowly i.e. System 1 or System 2)</em> and then out comes new decisions. Sounds too fancy? Not really. We do this everyday e.g.&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li>Feeling hunger (<em>Input</em>) —&gt; Trying to lose weight (<em>framework</em>) —&gt; Order salad</li><li>Feeling hunger (<em>Input</em>) —&gt; Today is Monday, loads of meetings (<em>framework</em>) —&gt; Grab a sandwich on the go</li></ul><p>You make different decisions based on the active framework at that time. And that is real clincher. Apply the wrong mental model, you will make a bad decision.&nbsp;Fall victim to your biases; and you will make a bad decision again. Let’s look in more details at the anatomy of a bad decision.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></p><h2>This is why we make bad decisions</h2><p>I had this painting on my desk wall for over an year.</p><figure id="w-node-eeaf904367d1-0252ad77"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed0dc675974b414a3aa5b26/5f293b7f7a1ced87e2e4fc8b_1_71TzKnr7bzXU_l_pU6DCNA.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Cheat sheet of Cognitive Biases - by Buster Benson</figcaption></figure><p>Cognitive biases are little software bugs / viruses in your decision making process. You are not as smart as you think you are. It sucks, but it’s true. Me, you and even Elon Musk suffer from hidden-in-plain-sight cognitive biases which are hardwired into our monkey brain. Our past experiences have shaped our understanding of the world; and that is what we use to make decisions that impact our future.&nbsp;<br></p><figure id="w-node-bf166dc6030e-0252ad77"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed0dc675974b414a3aa5b26/5f293ffa79f7b56b4690b56b_This%20is%20why%20we%20make%20bad%20decisions.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Bad decision making</figcaption></figure><p>A few common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases" target="_blank">cognitive biases</a> that you might recognise -&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>‍<strong>Herd mentality</strong> - stock market going up? Damn, you must invest too! All these people must be right&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>Self serving bias</strong> - failed an exam because the teacher hated you? Business came crashing down because you think the investors backed out wrongly? You are suffering from a self serving bias. I personally went through this in 2015, and took me almost an year to see things clearly.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>The sunk cost fallacy</strong> - ever felt like continuing on a project because you have already spent so much time on it? Too late to give up?&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The first step in making better decisions is to simply learn and recognise these cognitive biases. Before you jump into a new thing, slow down, take a pause, and think about it. I recommend <a href="https://medium.com/thinking-is-hard/4-conundrums-of-intelligence-2ab78d90740f" target="_blank">this cheat sheet.</a></p><h2>The solution - build your own frameworks &amp; mental models&nbsp;</h2><p>As a leader, you would already have a set of values that are close to you. The ones that you never sacrifice. Use those to help you make more logical decisions. Another exercise you can do is to make a list of good decisions you made in the recent past and see the common patterns.&nbsp;</p><p>At Kaapi, almost every big decision now goes through a checklist of frameworks we believe in. We can not optimise for every model all the time, but we definitely try.&nbsp;This one simple change in thinking helped us make a much better GTM decision last quarter - </p><figure id="w-node-88ac2a0d7d00-0252ad77"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed0dc675974b414a3aa5b26/5f293dfbfd7938923754922c_Finding%20ideas.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Found these scribbles in my notes from March</figcaption></figure><p>I have written down my favourite mental models below, but you should build your own. </p><h2>#1 - Focus on avoiding stupid decisions, not finding brilliant ideas</h2><p>Warren Buffet built his entire empire on this one simple concept vs trying to time the market like other investors. Find good companies, run by good operators, invest in them and then ignore the noise.&nbsp;</p><p>We over complicate things. We all do. But you be better served by simply focusing on not doing the absolute basic things that will fuck up the entire company. If a decision is too complex to make, and has too many variables, we simply say no.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></p><h2>#2 - Avoid ruin. Survive long enough to get lucky.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>If you can simply focus on not dying, and not going to zero, half your problems will go away. You will automatically end up playing for the long term game. <a href="https://nav.al/kelly-criterion/" target="_blank">Naval Ravikant has a fantastic podcast on this. </a>More below.&nbsp;</p><p>We get too flattered by rags to riches stories on the internet. And by press releases from unicorn companies. What is true for 100 people on average, isn’t true for the one person averaging that same thing 100 times. 1% startups make it big. But it doesn’t mean that if you 100 startups, you will definitely succeed.&nbsp;</p><p>Kelly criterion is a mathematical formula that tells you how much you can wager on every hand on the poker table. Simply put, don’t get wiped out. But simply put, don’t get wiped out. Survive long enough to get lucky.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></p><h2>#3 - Invert, always invert&nbsp;</h2><p>An inversion exercise forces you to look at things from the opposite end first. I learnt this from the <a href="https://fs.blog/2013/10/inversion/" target="_blank">fantastic people at Farnam Street</a>. A good way to get started is to make a list of things that will kill you, and then remove those first. Just do a post-mortem in advance.&nbsp;</p><p>Most difficult problems can be solved if you go backwards first. Need to lose 10 kgs in 2 months? Forward thinking sends you searching for the latest diets. Inversion forces you to ask “<em>What is 100% unhealthy?”</em>. The answer is to stop eating sugar, don’t over eat, love yourself and exercise when you can. If these basic things are covered, that is when you can do the fancy diets.&nbsp;</p><p>As a business leader, take your current project, transport yourself 6 months in the future, and then imagine why that project has failed. Do this exercise with a team or with yourself in a room without any distractions. Think until your brain is bleeding from the ears. Now when you have a list of reasons, solve for them first.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/35957157" target="_blank">‍</a></p><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/35957157" target="_blank">Thinking in Bets by Annie Duke</a> is another great resource on this concept<strong>‍</strong></p><h2>#4 - Play the long term game<br></h2><p><br>I talked a bit about it above, but I love it so much that I am going to repeat myself again -&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>“Survive long enough to get lucky.”&nbsp;<br></blockquote><p>Compound interest applies to everything. To the skills you learn, and to the decisions you make. Being 1% better everyday stacks up. You shouldn’t be very bothered by competition, but if you can think in 10 year horizons, then you have already defeated most of your competitors, because they are busy thinking in quarterly timelines.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t have much to add here honestly. Better people than me have talked about it. You should definitely <a href="https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/these-billionaire-ceos-see-the-world-differently-because-they-see-time-differently-faa2909e8fa2" target="_blank">read more about how Jeff Bezos &amp; Elon Musk think about this</a>.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></p><h2><strong>#5 - Analyse 2nd &amp; 3rd order effects of your decision&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>I am a doer and operator at heart. I&nbsp;love jumping into a project and executing things. It took me a sometime to realise that I&nbsp;have a bias for action. Sometimes, the worst thing you can do, is to act. Not making a decision today, can be a good decision. But some fences are there for a reason (<a href="https://fs.blog/2020/03/chestertons-fence/" target="_blank"><em>read Chesteron’s Fence</em></a><em>)</em>‍</p><p>Those processes &amp; decisions were made by someone sometime before you. And probably for a valid reason (<em>valid at that time). </em>So before you change things, think a few levels deeper about why that fence exists today.&nbsp;</p><p>Think like a chess grandmaster, not a monkey with a hammer in your hand who must find some nails.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></p><h2>#6 - Decrease the scope and make small bets&nbsp;</h2><p>Work expands to fill the time allocated to its completion (<em>Parkinson’s Law)</em>. To make sure that you don’t sink a lot on a new decision, put constraints. Constraints are …</p></div></div></div>

<br></div>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The American technology giant
Apple has taken legal action against a small company called Prepear, which is
an application and service that makes it easier for people to plan their meals
and find new recipes. The cause of action: Prepear chose to use a pear-shaped
fruit as its logo, which is too similar to Apple's logo, according to a message
posted on Instagram by the company's founders. The message describes Apple's
action as "a blow to Prepear," and indicates the intention to keep
the original logo and "send a message to large technology companies that
intimidation of small businesses has consequences.<o:p></o:p></span><br>

I know there are a lot of heavy things going on in the world right now, and this is nothing in comparison, but I need your help in a situation that is affecting me, my family, and my coworkers. Please help! Many of you know that I started a business called Prepear almost 5 years ago. It is an app that you can store all your recipes in one place, plan your meals, make grocery lists, and get your groceries delivered all in one place. Recently @apple yes, The trillion dollar Apple, has decided to oppose and go after our small business’ trademark saying our pear logo is too close to their apple logo and supposedly hurts their brand? This is a big blow to us at Prepear. To fight this it will cost tens of thousands of dollars. The CRAZY thing is that Apple has done this to dozens of other other small business fruit logo companies, and many have chosen to abandon their logo, or close doors. While the rest of the world is going out of their way to help small businesses during this pandemic, Apple has chosen to go after our small business. I’m not trying to get anyone to stop using or buying Apple products. I feel a moral obligation to take a stand against Apple's aggressive legal action against small businesses and fight for the right to keep our logo. We are defending ourselves against Apple not only to keep our logo, but to send a message to big tech companies that bullying small businesses has consequences.

<span lang="EN-US">The Prepear company has been in
existence for 5 years. It is an application that allows users to store all
their recipes in one place, plan their meals, make shopping lists and have
their groceries delivered to the same place. The application is a derivative of
Super Healthy Kids, which offers recipes and feeding strategies and shares tips
and organizational tools for parents. The founders say they are facing
litigation from Apple. Apple is said to disagree with the Prepear logo, arguing
that its attributes are too similar to its own logo.<o:p></o:p></span><br>

<p><i><span lang="EN-US">"Apple opposed
the trademark application for our small company, Prepear, requiring us to
change our logo, which is obviously pear-shaped, used to represent our brand in
recipe management and meal planning,"</span></i><span lang="EN-US"> wrote the founders
of Prepear in a post on Instagram asking for help. Prepear is a small company
with only five employees, and the founders say legal fees have already cost
them "several thousand dollars", plus the dismissal of one team
member, in their legal battle against the iPhone manufacturer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span lang="EN-US"><br></span>
<span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
</div>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Prepear also points out that
before "<i>attacking us, Apple opposed dozens of other trademark
applications filed by small companies with fruit-related logos.</i> According
to Prepear, many of these small companies have had to change their logos or
even give up and shut down, as the limited means of most of them did not allow
them to fight the iPhone manufacturer in a lawsuit costing tens of thousands of
dollars.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<div>
<p><i><span lang="EN-US">"It's a very
terrifying experience to be legally attacked by one of the world's largest

</div>

<h2>
<b><span lang="EN-US"><span>Sending a message
against the bullying of small businesses by the largest technology companies</span></span></b></h2>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US">According to Prepear, Apple has
opposed small businesses with fruit-related logos by launching costly lawsuits,
even when these logos do not resemble the Apple logo at all or are not in the
same industry as Apple. <i>"We're defending ourselves against Apple not
only to keep our logo, but also to send a message to large technology companies
that intimidation of small businesses has consequences,"</i> said the
company's founders.<o:p></o:p></span><br>
<span lang="EN-US"><br></span>
<span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
</div>

<p><span lang="EN-US">The iPhone In Canada website says
it received, on Sunday, more details on the trademark application for the
pear-shaped logo of Prepear, a free application available for download on iOS
and Android. In an email sent to the website, chief operating officer Russ
Monson says Prepear has been registering its trademark for the logo since
January 2017 and that the U.S. trademark office finally told it "<i>that
it was not in conflict with other registered trademarks and that it would
publish it for opposition.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-US">Everything seemed to
be coming to an end when, on the</span></i><span lang="EN-US"> "<i>last day of the
opposition period for the trademark, we were informed that Apple had requested
an extension of the opposition period, and then requested further extensions,
which placed our trademark in a legal limbo for a long period of time".<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<div>

<p><span lang="EN-US"><br></span>
<span lang="EN-US">According to Prepear's email,
Apple filed its effective opposition on the last day it was legally entitled to
do so. According to Monson, the additional extensions filed resulted in
additional legal costs for the small company, and to him, these extensions
"seemed to have been designed by their legal team to be as long, difficult
and expensive as possible for us.<o:p></o:p></span></p></div>

<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Monson goes on to explain that
Prepear was "naive enough" to think that they could discuss the issue
with Apple in a rational manner, as the two logos are different. But this was
not the case and the opposition has now reached the "discovery
phase", which, according to the COO, "will be the most expensive part
of this case for us". However, Prepear decided to move on to this phase at
Apple's request.<o:p></o:p></span><br>
<span lang="EN-US"><br></span>
<span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
</div>

<p><i><span lang="EN-US">"We believe that
this case is clearly frivolous, and that once the public is aware of Apple's
position on this issue, Apple will be more willing to drop the case rather than
let the public see how it is clearly hurting us for no apparent justifiable
reason,"</span></i><span lang="EN-US"> said Monson in his email to iPhone In Canada.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2>
<b><span lang="EN-US"><span>Other companies have
already changed their logos as a result of Apple's lawsuits.</span></span></b></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Some companies whose logos
(below) were attacked by Apple under the same conditions have given up. But the
founders of Prepear say they are lucky enough to attract enough media attention
"to expose this practice by Apple.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Other logos have also been the
source of legal actions brought by Apple in the past, such as the case against
a Norwegian political party and a German bicycle path. The logo of the
political party in question depicts a red apple with a stem, a green leaf and
has the letter F in white on the front. Apple wrote a letter to the Norwegian
Patent and Trademark Office stating that this logo with a red apple looks like

<p><span lang="EN-US"><br></span>
<span lang="EN-US">In 2009, Apple also attacked
Woolworths, an Australian supermarket chain, which had just changed its logo.
Woolworths insisted at the time that its logo is nothing more or less than a
stylized "W", but Apple claimed it was an apple and therefore asked
them to stop using it! Hans Hulsbosch, the creator of the logo, said at the
time that the protection of the Apple logo was "taken to extremes".
"Based on this logic, they should attack all fruit sellers.<o:p></o:p></span><br>
<span lang="EN-US"><br></span>
<span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
</div>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Prepear says they are not asking
for a boycott of Apple products, but they are asking the iPhone manufacturer to
"stop attacking small businesses in frivolous affairs that seem designed
to make them spend so much money and time thinking about the business instead
of focusing on how to grow business and ensure to survive the current economic
crisis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The petition on Change.org has
now received 20,000 signatures, and Prepear hopes that Apple will drop the case
before moving on to more costly discovery and trial phases. Otherwise, small
businesses should give up using fruit as a logo for their brand.<o:p></o:p></span><br>

		<p>Dear New Developer,</p>
<p>Congratulations! Let’s take a moment to celebrate the decision you’ve made to launch or redirect your career. What lies ahead is a lot of hard work, satisfaction, the occasional desire to throw your laptop out a window, and a ton of learning. That’s true of most professions, so you’re also in good company.</p>
<p>As a developer, you will solve a thousand puzzles, and then a thousand more. Your brain will stretch and grow. You will dream about databases or pixels or curly braces. I once had a dream where I was walking down a hallway, but the hallway <em>was my code</em>. It was a good dream. I found a bug.</p>
<p>Greg LeMond, a pro cyclist and three-time Tour de France winner, once said something about cycling that I want to share with you: <img data-attachment-id="6422" data-permalink="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2020/04/27/it-never-gets-easier-you-just-go-faster/lemond/" data-orig-file="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png" data-orig-size="355,239" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="lemond" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=355" src="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=1100" alt="lemond" srcset="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png 355w, https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=150 150w, https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px"></p>
<p>“It never gets easier, you just go faster.”</p>
<p>In so many ways, that describes a career in software. The puzzles you struggle with today will be easy in a month or a year. You’ll learn new patterns and best practices. Then you’ll take on new, harder challenges. You’ll struggle with those and learn and grow. Then you’ll start the cycle (pun intended) all over again.</p>
<p>Something I’ll add, though, is that you’ll be able to approach later challenges with more experience and confidence. What we bring to our jobs is an accumulation of skills and experience. This isn’t linear. It sometimes goes smoothly, sometimes it’s faster than we imagine possible. Then there are stretches where it feels like we’re clambering around in the dark.</p>
<p>For instance, I was once asked to write a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Application_Protocol">WAP</a> application (think super early mobile apps before smart phones existed). I had absolutely no idea what I was doing and I was mostly left alone on the project. I started by drawing some screens, took a deep breath, and started building. It was really tough going, but so many lessons have stuck with me from that experience. My skills at breaking down challenges and approaching them bit by bit really improved. I became comfortable throwing away code because the first code I wrote was atrocious. Plus, the project was eventually canceled, which was entirely the right business decision. Through that, I learned about evaluating tradeoffs in terms of business value—my time was better spent on higher priority projects.</p>
<p>In my current adventure, nearly 20 years later, I’m once again writing a mobile app and applying all of those lessons. Picking up languages and frameworks that I haven’t used before is far less daunting. Ensuring that I’m working on the most important thing is a constant recalibration, but one that is comfortable now. Working through stumbling blocks one at a time and having patterns for getting through them is second nature.</p>
<p>Just like learning isn’t linear, neither are careers. Your path will be your own. What you are doing today may or may not be what you’re doing in ten years. You might go into any number of other areas in software, or stay the course as a developer. It’s your life and all those choices are equally valid. One of my former colleagues quit to make hand-built microphones; another makes goat cheese in the Catalan Pyrenees. My personal philosophy is that at each opportunity to make a career decision, you should pick the direction that interests you most. Just like you learn faster when you are interested in your subject, you will ship better software (or make better cheese) when you are interested in your job.</p>
<p>There’s much more I’d love to tell you, but this letter is growing long. I’ll add some concise tidbits before I end.</p>
<ul>
<li>You belong here. Try not to doubt that.</li>
<li>Get really good at debugging. It’s a skill and you will need it.</li>
<li>If you don’t respect your boss, or if they don’t respect you back, go find a new one.</li>
<li>Learning is part of your job. Make time for it.</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid to put your code in production.</li>
<li>Be a good team member. You will accomplish more and learn faster.</li>
<li>Ask lots of questions. Someone else probably wants to hear the answer.</li>
<li>And finally, have fun! You’ve got this!</li>
</ul>
<p>I wish you all the luck in the world!</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Rebecca Campbell</p>

		<p>Let’s talk about a fun RFC that mostly did <em>not</em> make its way into current day Raku, nor is it planned for later implementation.</p>
<p>This is about <a href="https://raku.org/archive/rfc/64.html">RFC 64</a> by Nathan Wiger. Let me quote the abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>Historically, Perl has had the default “everything’s global” scope. This means that you must explicitly define every variable with my, our, or its absolute package to get better scoping. You can ‘use strict’ to force this behavior, but this makes easy things harder, and doesn’t fix the actual problem.</p>
<p>Those who don’t learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Let’s fix this.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems <code>use strict;</code> simply has won, despite Nathan Wiger’s dislike for it.</p>
<p>Raku enables it by default, even for one-liners with the <code>-e</code> option, Perl 5 enables it with <code>use 5.012</code> and later versions, and these days there’s even talk to enable it by default in version 7 or 8.</p>
<p>I’d say the industry as a whole has moved in the direction of accepting the tiny inconvenience of having to declare variables over the massive benefit in safety and protection against typos and other errors. Hey, even javascript got a <code>"use strict"</code> and TypeScript enables it by default in modules. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3193072/strict-mode-in-php">PHP 7 also got something comparable</a>. The only holdout in the “no strict” realm seems to be python.</p>
<p>With pretty much universal acceptance of required variable definitions, there was no compelling reason to improve implicit declaration, so no <code>scope pragma was needed.</code></p>
<p>But… there’s always a “but”, isn’t there?</p>
<p>One of the primary motivations for not wanting to declare variables was laziness, and Raku did introduce several features that allow to you avoid some declarations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parameters in signatures are an implicit declaration, The RFC’s example <code>sub squre</code> could be written in Raku simply as <code>sub square($x) { $x * $x }</code>. No explicit declaration necessary.</li>
<li>Self-declaring formal parameters with the <code>^</code> twigil also imply a declaration, for example <code>sub square { $^x * $^x }</code>.</li>
<li>There are many functional features in Raku that you can use to avoid explicit variables altogether, like <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#Metaoperators">meta operators</a>, <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Whatever">Whatever star currying</a> etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am glad Raku requires variable declarations by default, and haven’t seen any code in the wild that explicitly states <code>no strict</code>;. And without declarations, where would you even put the type constraint?</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Software engineers feel uneasy when things aren’t right.</p>

<p>Students or junior engineers are unsettled through unfamiliarity with programming concepts.
Gradually, we are unsettled by abstractions at higher and higher levels.
We’re no longer troubled by a lack of understanding, but instead when systems don’t conform to patterns we know to be sound, or worse, when systems do conform to patterns we know to be harmful.
Refined unease.</p>

<p>We learn that unease is a reliable indicator that we are heading towards a problem.</p>

<p>Good and great engineers feel this unease.
What differentiates the good from the great? Great engineers listen to their intuition, but use their conscious minds to reason about whether something should be done.
Great engineers cultivate space between unease and action.
Great engineers can tolerate imperfection.</p>

<p>All engineering decisions should be made with an understanding of the business context that surrounds them.
Why is this piece of code being written? This must inform the decisions you make.</p>

<p>Imagine that you are developing a system that operates on some data.
Should you persist some data in a database, an ordered log, or a properties file? Does it need to be persisted at all, or would it be acceptable to recompute it on start? Or even to accept that the data will be lost on restart? In a vacuum, it is impossible to argue fruitfully for one of these solutions over any other.</p>

<p>All of these solutions (and more) are reasonable, depending on the context.
They all have tradeoffs: initial implementation effort, running costs, maintenance, monitoring.
But too often I see engineers choose a too-complicated, too-expensive, option because the stupid-simple solution made them uneasy.</p>

<p>Look, I’m not arguing that you should sleepwalk into tech debt.
I’m saying that when you have many options available to you to solve a problem, and the simple option makes you feel uneasy, you should step back and consider <em>why</em>.
Often, there’s a sound reason why the simple solution doesn’t work.
Sometimes there isn’t.
When there isn’t, you save yourself the trouble of implementing the complex solution, and your teammates the trouble of maintaining it.</p>

<p>Until now, I’ve discussed only the tradeoffs involved in writing new software.
But the cardinal sin is to reject imperfection in existing code.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing: it doesn’t matter what decision <em>might</em> have been made before this code was written.
The fact is, it exists.
Often it makes us uneasy.
Sometimes the wrong tradeoff was made.</p>

<p>You have a moral obligation to make the code you work on a better place for future engineers.
However, there comes a point (quickly) where re-engineering existing code is a waste of time.
Do the small things that  make the code more hospitable.
If you want to do anything more, consider carefully.</p>

<p>How many times have you heard a teammate say they’re picking up a refactor as part of their ticket only for it to get out of hand and completely halt progress on their primary goal? How many of these refactors are eventually abandoned before completion? How often does this result in two parallel models for the same thing, making the codebase even more confusing?</p>

<p>There are other advantages to tolerating imperfection.</p>

<p><a href="https://fs.blog/2020/03/chestertons-fence/">You might not really understand why the code is the way it is</a>.
The original authors might have made the perfect tradeoff, but you can’t see that from your position.
Your unease is unfounded and more akin to that of the junior engineer or student.
Always account for the possibility that your intuition is wrong.</p>

<p>Rewriting a junior engineer’s code demoralises.
If a junior has done something that isn’t right, don’t take it upon yourself to rewrite it.
First, decide if something needs to be done.
Maybe it doesn’t.
If it does, see if you can work with the junior to work towards a better solution.
Now this is a positive learning experience.
There is nothing more discouraging than discovering that a senior silently rewrote your code.</p>

<p>You must be able to tolerate imperfection if you are to get anything done at all.
Nothing we ever do will be perfect.
It’s a fool’s errand to try to make it so.</p>

<![CDATA[Better Product Positioning: Systems over Statements]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>Whether you’re a brand new startup, an established mega corp, or somewhere in between, positioning is a critical component of your go-to-market. The difference between a growth sensation and a mega flop can come down to a number of things, but many times it’s how the product was positioned in the market.<br></p>
              <p>Like any craft, there’s an art to product positioning – it’s both a <strong>declaration</strong> and a <strong>hypothesis</strong> designed to align teams around <em>who we’re going after, with what story, and why we’ll win</em>. It takes a concerted cross-functional team effort of research and analysis combined with data and intuition to come up with a strong position, but most important of all, where you land has to be differentiated and defensible to really make an impact.&nbsp;<br></p>
              <p>Two things are of the utmost importance with any positioning exercise – <strong>focus</strong> and <strong>repeatability</strong>. It’s easy to fall into the trap of trying to be everything for everyone. It’s also easy to fall into the trap of building something that nobody (but you) cares about. Product development and positioning go hand-in-hand, and it’s a constant balancing act to make sure you’re building the right things for enough of the right people to effectively grow the business.&nbsp;<br></p>
              <p>The standard practice of product positioning has been to write out a statement based on the following template:<br></p>
              <p><em>For [target customer] who [statement of need or opportunity] the [product name] is a [product category] that [statement of key benefit]. Unlike [primary competitive alternative], our product [statement of primary differentiation].</em><br></p>
              <p>I’ve written this statement numerous times throughout my career for various products across a wide range of markets. The thing is, it never sat well with me – I always felt like I was just going through the motions, lacking real meaning or action. Then last year, I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Obviously-Awesome-Product-Positioning-Customers/dp/1999023005">April Dunford’s book <em>Obviously Awesome</em></a>, which validated my feelings while providing an alternative viewpoint. Since then, I’ve thought of <strong>positioning as a system, not as a statement</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
              <h3>What is a Positioning System?</h3>
              <p>Just like a Design System forms the foundation for design teams, a Positioning System forms the foundation for go-to-market teams. Before getting to a definition, let’s first level-set on the goals of product positioning – you need to be able to answer the following questions with clarity and confidence:<br></p>
              <ul role="list">
                <li>Do we truly understand the motivations of our audience?</li>
                <li>Are we building the right product for our audience?</li>
                <li>Is our audience large enough to grow the business?</li>
                <li>Is our story unique enough to establish ourselves in the market?</li>
                <li>Is our value strong enough to win customers over alternatives?<br></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Whether your product vision is to become a market leader, create a new category, or to define a new experience, having alignment on these questions is critical. There’s a near infinite amount of considerations that could go into answering these questions, which is why it warrants a system to reconcile the ever-changing landscape of your product and your market. A simple definition is as follows:</p>
              <blockquote><em>A </em><strong><em>Positioning System</em></strong><em> contains the market intelligence and customer patterns used to uncover and define your unique value proposition that drives your go-to-market strategy and execution plan.</em></blockquote>
              <figure id="w-node-f8986614e84a-e088abcc">
                <p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e75113aa424bfd8d788abb6/5f2b58fb97b36021c5392c29_system-gtm.png" alt="Positioning System"></p>
              </figure>
              <p>The “North Star” of the business is your unique value proposition – <em>what makes you different from others, and what value does that bring to the market</em>? While you and your team are subject matter experts, your unique value proposition shouldn’t just come from a hunch, it should come from having a true understanding of your customer base. Having a system designed for deriving actionable intelligence is a better and stronger foundation to build from, and a more adaptable mechanism to iterate from – both for your product development and for your go-to-market. It takes work, but the work will most certainly accelerate your growth from the clarity and confidence you gain.<br></p>
              <p><em>Note: I’ve created this system as it relates to our business at Okta and my role leading Product Marketing for emerging products, however I do believe that this can be generally repurposed for any B2B business with modifications that match the specifics of your product and market. To be honest, though, I’m not sure how translatable this is to B2C products – I’m a dummy in that space.</em></p>
              <h3>The Elements of a Positioning System</h3>
              <p>The elements of the system consist of the market intelligence needed to identify repeatable customer patterns. It’s these repeatable patterns that feed the strategy and execution of your go-to-market plan. A shared trait of every successful product business is a well oiled go-to-market machine. Rarely does it start that way, though. It takes a lot of learnings along the way, which is what makes this market intelligence so valuable.<br></p>
              <p>Elements include:<br></p>
              <ul role="list">
                <li><strong>Market segments: </strong>the characteristics and behaviors of your target customers grouped as segments. Ex: high growth tech startups scaling the business, transformative mega enterprises adopting the cloud, old media companies building streaming services, etc. What are these companies trying to accomplish and where do you fit in the picture?</li>
                <li><strong>Customer personas: </strong>the characteristics and behaviors of the individuals involved in evaluating, purchasing, adopting, and using your product. These could be buyers, influencers, or champions of your product. What are they on the hook for and how can you help?&nbsp;</li>
                <li><strong>Initiatives &amp; projects: </strong>the big picture themes that companies and people are focused on, and the explicit budgeted projects that go with them. Ex: Shift to remote work -&gt; adopt multifactor authentication. Migrate to the cloud -&gt; secure AWS environments. Digital transformation -&gt; instrument CI/CD pipelines.&nbsp;</li>
                <li><strong>Value drivers: </strong>the quantitative and qualitative outcomes companies and people need to solve for as a function of their initiatives &amp; projects. Ex: 2x lower TCO on a category of software, 10x faster time to delivery, a happier and more productive workforce, easier ways to achieve compliance requirements, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Competition: </strong>the products and methods within an organization that you are trying to beat, replace, or change. Competition isn’t limited to other vendors in your space – do-it-yourself or do-nothing-at-all are both viable competition for many product categories.<br></li>
              </ul>
              <p><em>Note: It wouldn’t be a proper post about positioning (say that 5 times fast) if I didn’t mention that the best way to gather this information is to speak with customers and prospects. Depending on the maturity of your product and go-to-market, much of this intelligence will come through the natural course of business provided your team is taking good notes. But don’t sit back and wait for it to come, be proactive about seeking out this intelligence. Good product professionals listen to customer feedback; great ones ask for it.</em></p>
              <h3>The Patterns of a Positioning System</h3>
              <p>Market intelligence that isn’t actionable isn’t very smart. Neither is positioning that won’t grow the business. Because focus and repeatability are of the utmost importance, you need to be able to identify patterns so you can effectively scale your go-to-market around what works, and avoid wasting cycles on what doesn’t work.<br></p>
              <p>The patterns you should seek out apply to the entire customer journey – from awareness to consideration to adoption to retention to advocacy. For the purposes of this blog post, I’ve chosen five key patterns I’ve identified within my own version of this system, but the possibilities could be endless provided they are relevant and actionable to your product and market.<br></p>
              <ul role="list">
                <li><strong>Good Fit/Bad Fit Accounts: </strong>your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) is the type of customer most willing, able, and eager to buy your product. But you likely won’t get too far only directly targeting your ICP - you also need to be able to quickly identify patterns about good fit/bad fit accounts so you know how to effectively qualify opportunities as they appear. Your eventual sales enablement functions will heavily depend on these patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Strongest Demand Channels:</strong> there’s a million and one ways to promote your product to drive awareness and adoption (for better or for worse). You need to be able to identify where and how your target audience discovers and evaluates new products to maximize conversion. Patterns here will feed into your Marketing &amp; Demand Gen plan – there’s nothing worse than spending big bucks on channels where your audience doesn’t hang out.</li>
                <li><strong>Most Compelling Events: </strong>company initiatives &amp; projects have varying levels of urgency. The patterns to identify are <em>what is getting the most attention from the right people</em>, and <em>where is the budget being spent</em>. Insight here will help your team build laser focused sales &amp; marketing playbooks focused on solving the top needs &amp; wants of your target audience. Without a sense of urgency, sales cycles can really lag.</li>
                <li><strong>Win/Loss Reasons: </strong>strong positioning is about confidently declaring <em>why you’ll win in the market</em>. As positioning is also a hypothesis, you’ll need evidence of this in practice so you can iterate accordingly. Are you consistently winning against certain competitors? Losing against others? Why is that? Are people choosing to stick with the status quo over your solution? Then you’ll need to adjust your message.&nbsp;</li>
                <li><strong>Business Outcomes:</strong> value drivers only matter if they are realized. Are those who adopt your product being successful with it? If so, what are their real world gains? Value selling requires proof – if you can show patterns of successful customers in practice, you’re in a great place to widen your reach.<br></li>
              </ul>
              <p><em>Note: It also wouldn’t be a proper post about positioning (can you say that 5 times fast yet?) if I didn’t have a …</em></p></div></div>

<p>The questions we often hear are “Why create a new query language?” and
            “What’s wrong with SQL?”.  This post contains answers to both.</p>
<p>Before we begin, let’s overview some of the history of how the relational
            model came to be, and how SQL was created.</p>
<div id="a-brief-history-of-the-relational-model-and-sql">
<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-the-relational-model-and-sql"><a href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#a-brief-history-of-the-relational-model-and-sql"><svg width="35" height="35" viewBox="0 0 35 35"><path d="M2.694 6.631h19.085v3.961h-1.944V8.574H4.636v10.962h15.199V17.52h1.944v3.96H2.694V6.632zM13.3 13.085h19.086v14.848H13.3v-3.962h1.942v2.019h15.2V15.027h-15.2v2.017H13.3v-3.96z" fill="#047CFF"></path></svg></a>A Brief History of the Relational Model and SQL</h2>
<p>The relational model was introduced by Edgar F. Codd in a seminal 1970 paper
                “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks” <span>[<a id="id1" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1970">4</a>]</span>.
                There, Codd postulated that all data in a database can be represented in
                terms of sets of tuples, called <em>relations</em>. Codd also invented a form of
                first-order predicate logic to describe the database queries: <em>tuple
                    relational calculus</em>.</p>
<p>Codd’s ideas were revolutionary.  For the first time, a database,
                and a universal way to query it, was described in a succinct, consistent
                mathematical model.  This, naturally, created lots of interest in further
                research and, importantly, into practical implementation of the relational
                model.</p>
<p>In 1974 Donald Chamberlin and Raymond Boyce published a paper
                <span>[<a id="id2" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fchamberlin-1974">2</a>]</span>, which introduced “a set of simple operations on tabular
                structures, […] of equivalent power to the first order predicate calculus”.
                Chamberlin and Boyce felt that the formal relational query languages proposed
                at the time were too hard to understand for “users without formal training in
                mathematics or computer programming” and thought that the “predominant use of
                the language would be for ad-hoc queries” <span>[<a id="id3" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fchamberlin-2012">3</a>]</span>.  Initially,
                the authors did not consider SQL to be a “serious” language.  Nonetheless,
                the great interest in the commercial application of the relational model had
                pushed IBM to quickly adopt and productize SQL, which was also picked up by
                their quickly-rising competitor–Oracle.</p>
<p>IBM had an overwhelmingly large influence over the tech market at the time,
                so SQL became a de facto standard for relational databases, and then a proper
                standard with the publication of the first ANSI standard in 1989 that
                essentially circumscribed the most prominent existing implementations
                of SQL.  Subsequent versions of the standard continued to be primarily
                influenced by the commercial vendors.</p>
<p>Today, SQL is by far the most widely used database language.  But that does
                not necessarily mean that it represents the best of what we can do.
                In fact, SQL’s beginnings as a “simple, ad-hoc” language coupled with
                “design by implementation” from competing vendors had left the language with
                a baggage of severe issues.</p>
</div>
<div id="critique-of-sql">

<p>SQL, especially its earlier versions, was heavily criticized by the experts,
                including Codd himself <span>[<a id="id4" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1990">6</a>]</span>, as well as C. J. Date, who published a
                multitude of papers and books on the subject (<span>[<a id="id5" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1985">7</a>]</span>, <span>[<a id="id6" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1987">9</a>]</span>,
                <span>[<a id="id7" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-2009">10</a>]</span>).  While many of the early shortcomings were fixed in the later
                versions of the standard, some of the serious issues had been only further
                ingrained.</p>
<p>Some of the complaints here apply to SQL as a whole, while others are specific
                to a certain implementation.  We are primarily using PostgreSQL for the
                examples.</p>
<p>SQL’s shortcomings can be grouped into these categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>lack of proper orthogonality — SQL is hard to compose;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lack of compactness — SQL is a large language;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lack of consistency — SQL is inconsistent in syntax and semantics;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>poor system cohesion — SQL does not integrate well enough with
                        application languages and protocols.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div id="lack-of-orthogonality">

<p>Orthogonality in a programming language means that a relatively small set
                    of primitive constructs can be combined in a relatively small number of ways.
                    A language with good orthogonality is smaller, more consistent, and is
                    easier to learn due to there being few exceptions from the overall set of
                    rules.  Conversely, bad orthogonality leads to a large language with many
                    exceptions and caveats.</p>
<p>A good example of orthogonality in a programming language is the ability to
                    substitute an arbitrary part of an expression with a variable, or a function
                    call, without any effect on the final result.</p>
<p>In SQL, such generic substitution is not possible, since there are <em>two</em>
                    mutually incompatible kinds of expressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <em>table expression</em> is a SQL expression that yields a table:
                            <code>SELECT * FROM table</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>scalar expression</em> is a SQL expression that yields a single scalar value:
                            <code>SELECT count(*) FROM table</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Table expressions can only be used in a <code>FROM</code> clause, in a function, or with
                    an operator that specifically expects a table expression as input.
                    What’s worse the scalar and table expressions may have exactly the same syntax,
                    which can be a source of further confusion.</p>
<p>For example, let’s imagine we needed to list the names of all department
                    heads in a company.  This query would do the job:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> name
<span>FROM</span> emp
<span>WHERE</span> role <span>=</span> <span>'dept head'</span></span></span></pre>
<p>Now let’s say we needed to add this bit to a larger query that extracts
                    information about a department.  An intuitive way is to simply add the
                    above as a subquery to the target list of our larger query:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span>
    dept<span>.</span>name<span>,</span>
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
    <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> name <span>FROM</span> emp
     <span>WHERE</span> role <span>=</span> <span>'dept head'</span> <span>AND</span> deptno <span>=</span> dept<span>.</span><span>no</span><span>)</span>
<span>FROM</span>
    dept
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></span></span></pre>
<p>This is legal, but <em>only</em> if the subquery returns not more than one row.
                    Otherwise, an error would be raised at run time.  To account for multiple
                    department heads, we would need to rewrite the query using a join:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span>
    dept<span>.</span>name<span>,</span>
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
    head<span>.</span>name
<span>FROM</span>
    dept
    <span>INNER</span> <span>JOIN</span> emp <span>AS</span> head
        <span>ON</span> <span>(</span>head<span>.</span>deptno <span>=</span> dept<span>.</span><span>no</span>
            <span>AND</span> head<span>.</span>role <span>=</span> <span>'dept head'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></span></span></pre>
<p>The difference in structure is large enough to make any sort of source-level
                    query reuse impractical.</p>
</div>
<div id="lack-of-compactness">

<div><p>Few claim that SQL is an elegant language characterized by orthogonality.
                        Some call it an elephant on clay feet.  With each addition, its body grows,
                        and it becomes less stable.  SQL standardization is largely the domain of
                        database vendors, not academic researchers without commercial interests
                        or users with user interests. <span>[<a id="id8" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fatzeni-2013">1</a>]</span></p><p>Paolo Atzeni et al.</p></div>
<p>SQL is not a small language. At the time of writing the PostgreSQL
                    implementation contains <b>469 keywords</b>. Just part 2 (out of 14) of the
                    SQL:2016 standard has <b>1732 pages</b>.</p>
<p>The main reason is that SQL, in line with its original goals, strives to be
                    an English-like language, catered to “non-professionals”.  However, with the
                    growth of the language, this verbosity has contributed <em>negatively</em> to the
                    ability to write and comprehend SQL queries.  We learnt this lesson with
                    COBOL, and the world has long since moved on to newer, more succinct
                    programming languages.</p>
<p>In addition to keyword proliferation, the orthogonality issues discussed
                    above make queries more verbose and harder to read.</p>
</div>
<div id="lack-of-consistency">

<p>SQL is arbitrarily inconsistent both in its syntax and semantics. What
                    makes things even worse is that different databases have their own version
                    of SQL, often incompatible with other SQL variants.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of entirely different calling conventions in SQL:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> substring<span>(</span><span>'PostgreSQL'</span> <span>from</span> <span>8</span> <span>for</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>SELECT</span> substring<span>(</span><span>'PostgreSQL'</span><span>,</span> <span>8</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 

<span>SELECT</span> trim<span>(</span>both <span>from</span> <span>'yxSQLxx'</span><span>,</span> <span>'xyz'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>SELECT</span> extract<span>(</span><span>day</span> <span>from</span> <span>timestamp</span> <span>'2001-02-16 20:38:40'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span></span></pre>
<p>There are two syntaxes that specify the ordering of the input set in an
                    aggregate function:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> array_agg<span>(</span>foo <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> bar<span>)</span></span></span></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> rank<span>(</span>foo<span>)</span> <span>WITHIN</span> <span>GROUP</span> <span>(</span><span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> bar<span>)</span></span></span></pre>
<p>The list of inconsistencies like this does not end here and can be continued,
                    but that’s beyond the scope of this blog post.</p>

<div id="null-a-bag-of-surprises">

<div><p>In some cases of inadequate handling of missing information,
                        the problem is incorrectly perceived to be a problem of the
                        relational model. In fact, the problem stems from the inadequacies
                        of SQL and its non-conformance to the relational model. <span>[<a id="id9" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1990">6</a>]</span></p><p>Edgar J. Codd</p></div>
<p>It has been extensively argued that <code>NULL</code> is the biggest misfeature of SQL
                    (<span>[<a id="id10" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1987">5</a>]</span>, <span>[<a id="id11" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1986">8</a>]</span>, <span>[<a id="id12" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1987">9</a>]</span>).
                    In fact, the handling of <code>NULL</code> in contemporary SQL implementations is so
                    surprising, inconsistent, and dangerous that this topic deserves a separate
                    section.</p>
<p><code>NULL</code> is so special that it’s not equal to anything, including itself:</p>
<pre><span><span>postgres=# select NULL = NULL;
 ?column?
----------

(1 row)</span></span></pre>
<p>In fact, almost any operation on <code>NULL</code> will return <code>NULL</code> and the
                    effect may be very subtle:</p>
<pre><span><span>postgres=# CREATE TABLE x (a int, b text);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# INSERT INTO x(a, b)
           VALUES (1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (NULL, 'three')
           RETURNING a, b;
 a |   b
---+-------
 1 | one
 2 | two
   | three
(3 rows)

postgres=# SELECT * FROM x WHERE a NOT IN (1, null);
 a | b
---+---
(0 rows)</span></span></pre>
<p>But, in some cases <code>NULL</code>
<em>is</em> equal to itself, such as in <code>DISTINCT</code>:</p>
<pre><span><span>elvis=# SELECT DISTINCT *
        FROM (VALUES (1), (NULL), (NULL)) AS q;
 column1
---------

       1
(2 rows)</span></span></pre>

<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> <em>TensorFlow’s tf.data API is a popular approach to loading data into deep learning models. Although tf.data has a lot of powerful features, it is built around sequential access to the underlying data set. This design makes it difficult to efficiently shuffle large data sets, to shard data when doing distributed training, and to implement fault-tolerant training. We argue that random access should be a key consideration when building deep learning data APIs.</em></p>

<p>There are <a href="https://determined.ai/blog/building-an-enterprise-deep-learning-platform/">many pitfalls</a> engineering teams can fall into when building an end-to-end enterprise deep learning platform. One of the most common problems involves data loading. Data loading during training is often overlooked, and it can have massive implications for throughput. Machine learning frameworks provide abstractions that attempt to make data loading straightforward, but peeking behind the curtain of these seemingly simple interfaces can reveal surprising problems. In this post, we’ll be taking you behind the scenes of a popular data loading API: <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset">TensorFlow Datasets</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://determined.ai/assets/images/posts/tf-sucks-meme.jpg" alt="We’ve peeked behind the curtain of TensorFlow Datasets to reveal some glaring problems"></p>

<p>There are two fundamental patterns that a data loading interface can use, <strong>random access</strong> and <strong>sequential access</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="random-access">Random Access</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_access">Random access</a> is the ability to access any element of a dataset efficiently. In Python, random access is often done by indexing into a list (i.e., <code>data[index]</code>), which calls <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__"><code>__getitem__()</code></a> behind the scenes. PyTorch uses this approach to define the <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#map-style-datasets">map-style dataset</a> interface (implemented above). Random-access data loader interfaces may also require that a user specify the entire length of the dataset (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__len__"><code>__len__()</code></a>).</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>torch.utils.data</span>

<span>class</span> <span>RandomAccessDataset</span><span>(</span><span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>utils</span><span>.</span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>Dataset</span><span>):</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>data</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>data</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>__len__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>data</span><span>)</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>__getitem__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>index</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>):</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Any</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>data</span><span>[</span><span>index</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Deep learning data APIs that support random access include <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/utils/Sequence">tf.keras.utils.Sequence</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset">torch.utils.data.Dataset (Map Style)</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sequential-access">Sequential Access</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_access">Sequential access</a> is a paradigm where elements must be accessed in a predetermined order, typically through an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator">iterator</a>. In Python, sequential access is often implemented via <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#iterator-types">iterators</a> and the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#yieldexpr">yield expression</a>.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>sequential_dataset</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Iterator</span><span>:</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>data</span><span>:</span>
        <span>yield</span> <span>item</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Some deep learning frameworks, such as <a href="https://keras.io/">early versions of Keras</a>, natively support expressing your data input pipeline as a Python generator. Similarly, <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data">TensorFlow Datasets</a> are built around sequential data access. Converting a Python generator into a TensorFlow Dataset is straightforward, if a little verbose:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>itertools</span>

<span>def</span> <span>gen</span><span>():</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>itertools</span><span>.</span><span>count</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>):</span>
        <span>yield</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>*</span> <span>i</span><span>)</span>

<span>dataset</span> <span>=</span> <span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>Dataset</span><span>.</span><span>from_generator</span><span>(</span>
     <span>gen</span><span>,</span>
     <span>(</span><span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>int64</span><span>,</span> <span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>int64</span><span>),</span>
     <span>(</span><span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>TensorShape</span><span>([]),</span> <span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>TensorShape</span><span>([</span><span>None</span><span>])))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>In the next section, we will discuss the drawbacks of using sequential access as a data loader.</p>

<p>TensorFlow’s <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data">tf.data</a> API makes it easy to structure your data loading code in an elegant way: you can chain together a stream of operations on a dataset using lazy initialization, and tf.data provides helper APIs to do common tasks like <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#prefetch">prefetching</a> and <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance#parallelizing_data_extraction">parallel data loading</a>.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>However, <strong>TensorFlow Dataset are fundamentally built around sequential access</strong>: each operator in a tf.data pipeline iterates over its input and produces a sequential output stream that is consumed by the next operator. The API does not support random access, which leads to some major issues trying to implement some common machine learning workflows.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="data-shuffling">Data Shuffling</h2>
<p>When training a deep learning model, the training set is often <em>shuffled</em> before being fed into the model — <a href="https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/24511/why-should-the-data-be-shuffled-for-machine-learning-tasks">this typically improves generalization performance</a>. If our data API only supports sequential access, how can we implement random shuffling? A simple but inefficient approach would be to read as much data as we can into memory and shuffle it there. In fact, that’s exactly what <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#shuffle">tf.data’s shuffle()</a> method does!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This dataset fills a buffer with <code>buffer_size</code> elements, then randomly samples elements from this buffer, replacing the selected elements with new elements. For perfect shuffling, a buffer size greater than or equal to the full size of the dataset is required.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For datasets that don’t fit entirely into memory (the most common case in deep learning), <strong>shuffle() doesn’t actually shuffle the full dataset!</strong> This means that shuffle() doesn’t have the intended effect in most applications. Many practitioners, including us, have made this error and seen their model’s generalization performance suffer as a result. Although it is possible to <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/14857#issuecomment-347261151">shuffle your entire dataset</a> ahead of time by loading the data into memory or shuffling a list of filenames, many users might not realize this problem exists in their code!</p>
<h2 id="data-sharding">Data Sharding</h2>
<p>When doing <a href="https://determined.ai/blog/distributed-deep-learning-that-actually-works/">data-parallel distributed training</a>, each worker (typically a GPU) is trained on a fraction (or “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture)">shard</a>” ) of the data in each batch. To handle this common task, tf.data provides a method that seems like a perfect fit: <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#shard">shard(n,i)</a> splits a dataset into n shards and returns the i’th shard for further processing in the current worker.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s a catch: <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e26286914b6d3cf7ed0c9a47f50c07391c2174a6/tensorflow/core/kernels/data/shard_dataset_op.cc#L139">shard() iterates over the entire input dataset</a>, returning every n’th record and ignoring the rest! That means that if you apply shard() to a large dataset during distributed training, each worker in the distributed training job will end up reading the entire dataset. If you’re training a model with 64 GPUs, that means you’ll be doing <strong>64x more disk I/O than you probably intended</strong>. It gets even worse if you’re doing on-the-fly data augmentation before the shard() operator in your pipeline — those data augmentation operations will be done redundantly by every worker.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#shard">TensorFlow documentation</a> acknowledges this and observes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Generally it is best if the shard operator is used early in the dataset pipeline.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>TensorFlow’s recommended approach is to create a dataset of TFRecord file names and apply <code>shard()</code> to this list. Each worker receives a disjoint set of files to process, which avoids any unnecessary disk I/O. This approach works, but it has two problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>You need to split your data set into a larger number of files than the number of workers in your distributed training job. If you have a large dataset stored in a small number of files, you’re out of luck. Moreover, any size imbalances between those files will result in stragglers, hurting training performance.</li>
<li>More likely, you might not realize any of this! A lot of real-world data loading code just converts a Python generator into a TensorFlow Dataset using <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#from_generator"><code>Dataset.from_generator()</code></a>. This will appear to work okay at small scale, but will quickly run into serious performance problems as your data set grows.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="saving-and-restoring-iterator-state">Saving and Restoring Iterator State</h2>
<p>If you want to build a deep learning training system that can recover from faults, <a href="https://twitter.com/neil_conway/status/1283091458069692416?s=20">a common approach is to use checkpoint-restart</a>: periodically save the state of the job to a checkpoint file, and, when a failure occurs, restore the job from the most recent checkpoint. This is particularly important for training jobs that can last hours or even days. However, saving and restoring a training job requires knowing the job’s position in the dataset.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re training on a 100,000-element dataset and the most recent checkpoint was taken after the 50,000th record, you’ll want to ensure that training resumes at the 50,001th record instead of restarting from the beginning. With a random-access interface, this is trivial: just save the index position as an integer and pick up where you left off when restoring. With a sequential-access interface, this can be really hard. Python generators are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7180212/why-cant-generators-be-pickled/7180424#7180424">notoriously hard to pickle</a>. TensorFlow datasets have <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/make_saveable_from_iterator">experimental support</a> for checkpointing and restoring some types of datasets, but not those created with <code>tf.data.Dataset.from_generator()</code>.</p>

<p>All of the above problems exist because tf.data is built around sequential access. So do yourself a favor: don’t restrict your entire data loading codebase to sequential access patterns. If you would like to apply prefetching and a functional style with a sequential access pattern, you can always wrap a random access interface as follows:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>dataset</span> <span>=</span> <span>RandomAccessDataset</span><span>()</span>

<span>def</span> <span>sequential_access_dataset</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Iterator</span><span>:</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>index</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>dataset</span><span>)):</span>
        <span>yield</span> <span>dataset</span><span>[</span><span>index</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>It’s easy to go from random to sequential! But going the other way is much harder.</em></p>
<p>TensorFlow Datasets are currently the recommended way to load data in TensorFlow, and it doesn’t look like that is going to change any time soon. Many readers of this article might find themselves in the unfortunate position of being stuck with TensorFlow Datasets due to forces beyond their control. If this is you, we’ve been hard at work on a solution that will make your life easier—stay tuned for more next week!</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> We’ve released <a href="https://github.com/determined-ai/yogadl">YogaDL</a>, a library for deep learning data loading that addresses a lot of the concerns described above.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">

                            	<p>For the past two years our Constellation design systems team has run a weekly drop-in clinic. </p>
                            	<p>It's proved an excellent way to get to know our consumers, increase engagement and visibility. We've had many ups and downs (and the odd dinosaur!) so I thought I would document what we've learned.</p>


							<h2> Why a drop-in clinic?</h2>
							<p>Running a drop-in was the idea of our then design systems head Lily Dart. Our <a href="https://www.gerireid.com/design-systems.html">design system</a> was new, we needed consumers, contributors and to get our message out to thousands of developers and designers across the country. </p>

<p>We decided to run a drop-in each Thursday afternoon. We would sit around a table in our London office and run a call for folks outside London. We invited product people to come and talk to us about their problems and learn how to consume our growing component library.</p>
<p>We didn't have all the answers but between us we had a broad range of product design, content, accessibility and engineering skills. We'd use the downtime between visitors to run our team show-and-tells and chat through relevant team stuff while we were all together.</p>



<h2>If you build it, they will come</h2>

<p>For the first few weeks we sat there looking eager and NO-ONE SHOWED UP. It was like being that kid who throws a party and no-one comes (apart from the kid who is there to take photos to post on Insta to cement your loser status forever).</p><p>Occasionally someone mooched past and idly nibbled our biscuits. Our UX designer went into a meeting room and phoned us and we got excited because we thought we had a real customer.</p>

<h2> Go where the people are</h2>

<p>We got feedback and realised we were in the wrong location. Most London product labs had moved to a different building so we found a room there instead. It was actually a nice shout to get the team together at a different location each week. It took us out of the day-to-day and meant we often had lunch together.</p>

<p>Word slowly spread and visitors started to trickle in with one or two teams stopping by each week. We upped our biscuit game and lured people in with donuts and stickers.</p>



<p>Gradually drop-in afternoons started to fill up. Designers realised we were an extra pair of eyes to help unpick a UX problem or help with a new pattern. Developers came with accessibility bugs off the back of testing and we were able to fix problems blocking their release. Because we got visibility over many different product journeys we were able to connect teams who were trying to solve a similar problem, like a low-budget UX dating agency.</p> 

      <p><img src="https://www.gerireid.com/img/dinosaur.jpg" alt="Designer dressed as a dinosaur">
	</p>

<p>Some afternoons were so full we joked we needed to install one those supermarket deli-counter ticketing machines. One week we even helped a dinosaur.</p>

          

<h2>Running remotely during Covid</h2>

<p>When the Covid lockdown started we continued to run the weekly call from home. It was quiet for the first couple of weeks as teams settled into a new routine but demand quickly picked up. </p>

<p>We had always run drop-in on a 'first-come-first-served' basis but we fast discovered this didn't work online. We asked teams to pre-book slots. I was reluctant to introduce a booking system as it's not really our team's vibe but I was proved wrong. Pre-booking has helped us structure the sessions and anticipate what is coming. If you don't want to book you can still phone in anytime and wait until we're free.</p>

<p>One learning from running remotely has been how unintentionally London-centric our previous efforts were. We focused on supporting London teams we could meet face-to-face and the dial-in was a bit of an afterthought. Running remotely has meant we have engaged with product teams from all over the country. We need to maintain these relationships when we move back to an office setup and make the dial-in the focus.</p>

<h2>3 most common themes</h2>

<p>After running around 100 clinics it's been interesting to see themes emerge. We see a lot of form journeys for customers to apply for products like insurance, accounts, cards and mortgages. But we've also seen our components used in ways we never anticipated which is super cool. These are the 3 most common things we see...</p>

<h3>1. Overcomplicating it</h3>

<p>80% of our advice is just suggesting designers remove stuff, simplify and consider plain text or an input box instead of a fancy widget. We see a lot of accordions. Accordions inside accordions inside accordions, like some heinous accordion inception plot.

</p><h3>2. Offering the user choice when there is no choice</h3>

<p>This is the probably the most common problem we see across journeys. The appearance of choice between options when only one choice is available based on the user selection.</p><p>"<em>Remove the illusion of choice if there is no choice</em>" sounds like something Yoda might say, if he worked on a design system.</p>

<h3>3. Our product needs a large / red / yellow / flashing / arrow-shaped button</h3>

<p>We fought this fight so many times we called on the services of a behavioural economist to prove how different colours, shapes and prominence influence consumer behaviour. It can lead user's decisions and potentially encourage outcomes that may not always be in the customer's best interest. These incremental inconsistencies also result in long term design debt. This <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/occasional-papers/op17-26.pdf">FCA paper</a> has come in handy.</p>


<h2>Drop-ins wins</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Engagement and visibility</strong>. As a design system we are open to a good discussion, we're transparent and there for our consumers. We're here to give advice but we're not the design police. If your research and testing goes against our advice we're keen to learn from it and update our guidance.</li>

<li><strong>Contributions</strong>. We love contributions! If a pattern has tested well, is accessible to all and will be useful across many journeys then we are always keen for teams to contribute. You're our favourite customer, have a sticker AND a biscuit. 🍪</li>

<li><strong>Bug fix</strong>. Most weeks someone drops in to report a bug with our code or design libraries. We fix this for the next release and it's fixed for everyone. Small quick wins.</li>

<li><strong>Visibility</strong> and <strong>collaboration</strong> across brands and products. We've been slowly able to connect teams working on similar patterns which saves time and money and builds relationships.</li>

<li><strong>Time-boxing</strong> everyone's ad-hoc requests to one afternoon a week. We all receive a lot of individual queries and it's great to be able to say "book a slot on Thursday and we'll run through together then".</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're a design systems team I would highly recommend a regular drop-in session. If you have any queries about ours <a href="https://twitter.com/gerireid">say hi</a> 👋</p>

<h2>UPDATE</h2>



<p>It has been brought to my attention that there was a mistake by an entry level employee. </p>



<p>So the Revenue Department itself was supposed to get all the NOCs required by going to all those offices, but an entry level employee forgot to add my file to the list of NA’s to be done.</p>



<p>So now I have been told that all the NOC’s will be taken care of by the Revenue Department, Collector Office. </p>



<p>If any legal fees need to be paid, I will be informed by the Collector office (without me requiring to go to every office) and everything will be done in less than 2 months.</p>



<p>I am thankful to everyone for sharing my experience far and wide. But now my experience stands cleared and so does this post. </p>



<p>A lot of people have helped reach this post to very very high-in-the-hierarchy people in the state and central government as well as major national political parties. I am really very thankful to everyone.</p>



<p>I will try again in a few months and keep surveying the experience of people who get their NA done. Thank you again for all the co-operation.</p>



<p>I am also writing a post about “the real process required to obtain the NA permission”. I will try to get the higher authorities from the Collector office to record a video stating the actual procedure required and will publish such article soon.</p>



<p>Again Thank You Very Much.</p>



<p>I have removed the original post. I will update with next steps soon. </p>

<p>I use Spotify on my computer from time to time but I hate when the Ads start playing.</p>

<p>I don’t mind having a <strong>break</strong> between a few songs, but I don’t wanna hear the Ads, so I decided to create a small script to hack it.</p>



<ol>
  <li>Open the application <strong>Terminal</strong>. Search it inside your <strong>Applications</strong> folder or using <strong>Spotlight search</strong> (cmd+space bar) and type <strong>terminal.app</strong></li>
  <li>
    <p>Inside that white window (that’s the terminal app) paste this command and then hit enter</p>

    <div><div><pre><code>mkdir -p ~/MuteSpotifyAds &amp;&amp; curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gdi3d/mute-spotify-ads-mac-osx/master/NoAdsSpotify.sh &gt; ~/MuteSpotifyAds/NoAdsSpotify.sh
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>This will create a new folder inside your Home folder called <code>MuteSpotifyAds</code> and will place a new file called <code>NoAdsSpotify.sh</code></li>
  <li>
    <p>To run the program just copy and paste the code below in the terminal and hit enter</p>

    <div><div><pre><code>sh ~/MuteSpotifyAds/NoAdsSpotify.sh
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Open Spotify and enjoy!</li>
  <li>After you’re done listening to your tracks you can close this application by <strong>closing the terminal app</strong>. <strong>Remember: You need to run this program the next time you open Spotify if you want to mute the Ads (steps 1 and 4)</strong></li>
</ol>


<ol>
  <li>Go to your home folder (the one with the 🏠 icon) using the <strong>Finder</strong></li>
  <li>Make sure you’re not running the program (step 6 in the list above)</li>
  <li>Find the folder called <code>MuteSpotifyAds</code> and delete it.</li>
</ol>



<p>I used to have all the Spotify Ads DNS blocked but that stopped working.</p>

<p>Besides, I was bored that Saturday noon and I wanted to give it a try.</p>



<ol>
  <li>Using OSX log system I can listen to Spotify events.</li>
  <li>Read the events and check if an Ad is about to be played.</li>
  <li>If the event is an Ad about to be played <strong>automatically mute system audio</strong>.</li>
  <li>If the next event is a song, <strong>unmute system audio</strong>.</li>
</ol>


<p>Here’s the repo if you want to know more:

August 9, 2020 | https://www.javiercasas.com/articles/codata-in-action/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.javiercasas.com/articles/codata-in-action/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My friend Juan Paucar directed me to a paper from the magnificent <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030171834">Programming Languages and Systems
28th European Symposium on Programming, ESOP 2019</a>, related to Codata. I have been very interested in codata, mainly because it relates to data in a category-theory way, but, as usual, I didn't understand many of the words involved. This paper helped me understand a lot, and also helped me understand and shape my mind on how to connect the worlds of FP and OOP. But, before that, we must go on tour over a bit of theory.</p>
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>Data, better understood as Haskell's <code>data</code> declaration, is nothing more than a type and a bunch of ways (functions) to create values of that type. I'm going to use the GADT syntax just because it makes the functions visible. Here is an example:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For the folks that don't grasp GADTs yet, the above is equivalent to:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>=</span> <span>Foo1</span> <span>Int</span> <span>String</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Foo2</span> <span>Bool</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But with the GADT syntax we can see the functions. <code>Foo1</code> is a constructor, but also a function. <code>Foo1</code> receives an Int and a String, and constructs a value of type <code>Foo</code>. Exactly the same happens with <code>Foo2</code>.</p>
<p>We just talked about constructors: a constructor is nothing more than a function that manufactures a value out of other values. But that pretty much defines every function as a constructor, which isn't helpful. We'll go a bit further: a constructor is a "primitive" function that makes a value of type T, and is not build out of other functions that make a value of type T. Also, a constructor is the function you define when you write a <code>data</code> declaration.</p>
<p>If there are constructors, there should be something that dismantles data, because data seems to be constructed by aggregating values. This thing that deconstructs data is called "eliminators". The universal eliminator in Haskell is the <code>case</code> statement:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>case</span> <span>myfoo</span> <span>of</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>i</span> <span>s</span>  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>...</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>b</span>    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>case</code> statement accepts a parameter (what you put between the <code>case</code> and the <code>of</code>) and returns a value of some type. That's why all the branches in a <code>case</code> statement must have the same type, because when you write a <code>case</code> statement, you are writing a function like <code>mycase :: Foo -&gt; X</code>, but with a nicer syntax.</p>
<p>This means eliminators are not always in the shape of <code>case</code> statements. In reality, eliminators are just functions, and Haskell provides special syntax for these functions to be written in a better way. But, if we go to Lisp, for example, we also have constructors and eliminators.</p>
<p>In Lisp you can manufacture a list with a new head by using the constructor <code>cons</code> (this is why these data structure is called a <code>cons-cell</code>). <code>cons</code> is just another function with two parameters: the head and the tail of the list to be constructed, and returns the list. To destructure a cons-list, you have two eliminators: <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code>. <code>car</code> takes a list and returns the head, <code>cdr</code> takes the list and returns the tail.</p>
<p>Haskell also offers eliminators, but everyone frowns at you if you use them too much: when you declare a record datatype, Haskell helpfully creates functions to access each of the fields:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>FooRecord</span> <span>=</span> <span>FooRecord</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fooField1</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span>
    <span>fooField2</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span>
  <span>}</span>




</code></pre></div>
<p>Everyone frowns at you when you use these accessors because if <code>FooRecord</code> has more than a single constructor, and you use an eliminator for the other constructor, your program blows up in flames. This is no different to how <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> blow up in flames when you pass as parameter an empty list.</p>
<p>The point of all of this is that <code>data</code> is a declaration that offers a bunch of different ways to create a value, and your program chooses which one interests you for the current case.</p>
<h2>Category Theory</h2>
<p>Category Theory is a branch of Mathematics mainly used by haskellers to annoy everyone else. But, believe it or not, it's also useful to reason about programs. In Category Theory we have objects and we have arrows that interconnect the objects. For something to be a Category, its objects and arrows have to obey some rules.</p>
<p>One of the constructs of Category Theory is the co-category. A co-category is a category where the arrows have been reversed. If in category X, an arrow goes from A to B, in the category co-X, the arrow goes from B to A.</p>
<p>At this point, "codata" should be suspicious to you. It totally looks like "co-data", the co-category of "data". But, how does it actually look the category of "data"?</p>
<h3>The Category of data</h3>
<p>The "data" category is revealed to us as the <code>data</code> declaration. Let's have another look at the <code>Foo</code> example:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In this case (but not in all categories) the types are the objects and the functions are the arrows. If we massage a little bit the code above, by using uncurrying, we can get to a data format that is a bit less arrow-ish and easier for our purposes:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now <code>Foo1</code> takes a pair of Int and String and returns a <code>Foo</code>, and <code>Foo2</code> takes a <code>Bool</code> and returns a <code>Foo</code>. This is pretty much what every haskeller already knows: you don't have a <code>Foo</code> via <code>Foo1</code> until you provide both the <code>Int</code> and the <code>String</code>, no matter how many arrows are in the middle.</p>
<p>And now, the case statement:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>case</span> <span>myfoo</span> <span>of</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo1</span> <span>i</span> <span>s</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>b</span>      <span>-&gt;</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo2</span> <span>b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let's massage it a little bit to turn it into a function:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>fooEliminator</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>Foo</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span><span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>fooEliminator</span> <span>(</span><span>myfoo</span><span>,</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo1</span><span>,</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo2</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>case</span> <span>myfoo</span> <span>of</span>
    <span>Foo1</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo1</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span>
    <span>Foo2</span> <span>b</span>      <span>-&gt;</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo2</span> <span>b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we have converted <code>case</code> into a plain old function, we don't need to do hand-waiving and magic because everything is now plain old function composition and application. Also, all the uncurrying that all the haskellers are about to complain is just going to help us.</p>
<h3>The co-Category of data: co-data</h3>
<p>I massaged all these expressions and uncurried them because, otherwise it is confusing. I mean, a co-category is a category with the arrows flipped. Which poses the question: which arrows? All of them? Some of them? Everything is easier if there is a single arrow: it means we don't have to go figuring out which one.</p>
<p>So let's flip the arrow of the <code>Foo</code> data declaration, and let's see what comes out.</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code>
<span>codata</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>Foo</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I happily renamed <code>data</code> to <code>codata</code>, and flipped the single arrow in each line. Let's massage it a little bit more by flipping the order of the arguments so that the arrow points to the right, because we are accustomed to see the arrow functions that way:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>codata</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>::</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></code></pre></div>
<p>What does this mean? Well, a lot of things at the same time, but let's go one by one.</p>
<p>We have two functions related to the <code>codata Foo</code>. The first, called <code>Foo1</code> takes a <code>Foo</code> and manufactures a pair of Int and String. The second, called <code>Foo2</code> takes a <code>Foo</code> and manufactures a <code>Bool</code>. We have two functions that take what seems to be a composite value <code>Foo</code> and extract simple values from it of types <code>Int</code>, <code>String</code> and <code>Bool</code>.</p>
<p>The same way that we could call any of the two functions in the <code>data Foo</code> declaration, we can call any of the two functions in the <code>codata Foo</code>, and get an <code>(Int, String)</code> for the first case, and a <code>Bool</code> for the second. Nothing forces us to call both, and we can just call any one of them.</p>
<p>If we have a <code>Foo</code>, and by calling <code>Foo1</code> we get simple values from it, this looks a lot like a eliminator. But we can also call <code>Foo2</code>, which looks like another eliminator.</p>
<p>Trying to make sense of all of this, we reach a deep insight:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>data</code> is about how we can call any of the many different constructors of a composite value.</li>
<li><code>codata</code> is about how we can call any of the many different eliminators of a composite value.</li>
</ul>
<p>From it, we can derive further insights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Codata looks a lot like objects and methods, where the codata value is the object, and the eliminators are the methods. There is probably some theorem out there that maps codata as a category to objects in OO programs.</li>
<li>It's not that Functional Programming is superior to Object Oriented Programming. But, the usual Functional Programmer has been an Object Oriented Programmer before. Because of this, he is likely to know <code>codata</code> from OO, and now is starting to understand <code>data</code> from FP. As a result of this, he is better armed than an Object Oriented Programmer because an Object Oriented Programmer only knows <code>codata</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further philosophical details can be extracted from the duality data-codata:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we were to find a pure FP programmer, and a pure OO programmer, they would probably have a similar level of skill, but in totally different dimensions. This would make very hard to actually figure out who is the most skilled, because their skill-sets wouldn't be comparable! How do you compare skill-set in <code>data</code> with skill-set in <code>codata</code>?</li>
<li>Data (and Functional Programming) deals on how we can construct complex datatypes from simple ones by using constructors. Codata (and Object Oriented Programming) deals on how we can extract the components from an object by calling its methods.</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_problem">Expression Problem</a> states that you should be able to add new cases and new functions to a datatype without losing type safety and without having to recompile.</p>
<ul>
<li>In an OO language, you can add a new case by creating another subclass and implementing the methods. But, if you want to add a new function to a datatype, you have to add it to the superclass and implement it on all the existing subclasses, which means modifying a lot of files and recompiling most of the program.</li>
<li>In a FP language you can add a new function to an existing datatype just by adding a function. But, if you want to add a new case, you have to add the constructor and modify all the functions that use the datatype, which means modifying a lot of files and recompiling most of the program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Turns out, with our new data-codata knowledge, that we have a deeper insight into the Expression Problem, and …</p></li></ul></div></div>

This is an old version for machines that don't meet the minimum requirements for Docker Desktop. It is not a native solution as it runs on VirtualBox, so we are forced to use the tools that the Toolbox comes packaged with, making everything more cumbersome and prone to errors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The main catch is that Docker Desktop is not easy to install on every system. While it is straightforward on macOS 10.13+ and Windows 10 Pro, the Windows 10 Home version needs extra attention.</p>
<p>Docker Desktop on Windows leverages Hyper-V, which is Microsoft's Type 1 hypervisor and only available on Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education. Fortunately, Windows Home supports <strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong> (WSL), a Linux kernel developed by Microsoft that allows us to run Linux processes to run natively without emulation. Since March 2020, Docker Desktop supports WSL version 2 as a backend on Windows Home.</p>
<p>To install Docker Desktop on Windows Home we need to install WSL2 first, then install Docker Desktop specifying WSL2 as the backend during the installation process. we can find the whole process to install WSL2 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">here</a> and the subsequent Docker Desktop installation process <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install-windows-home/">here</a>. If you would like to see a walkthrough video of the installation process, let me know and I will work on making one available.</p>
<p>Once installed, we can open our favorite terminal and check that the installation went smoothly by typing</p>
<pre><code>docker --version
</code></pre>
<p>If this returns something the likes of</p>
<pre><code>Docker version 19.03.12, build 48a66213fe
</code></pre>
<p>we are good to go!</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In case you are unable to make it work on your machine or if you don't want to install anything yet, Docker also offers <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.docker.com/play-with-docker">online playgrounds</a> to run your code and everything you find in this tutorial would work the same.</p>
<h2 id="let-s-run-our-first-container-">Let's run our first container!</h2>
<p>As we saw last week, to run a container we first need to find an image on the Docker registry. Like everything in the programming, Docker has a Hello World container that we can easily get from its Docker Hub <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world">page</a>. As we can see on the website, the command we have to run is</p>
<pre><code>$ docker pull hello-world
</code></pre>
<p>which will welcome us with an unsightly wall of output which looks like</p>
<pre><code>Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
0e03bdcc26d7: Pulling fs layer
0e03bdcc26d7: Verifying Checksum
0e03bdcc26d7: Download complete
0e03bdcc26d7: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:49a1c8800c94df04e9658809b006fd8a686cab8028d33cfba2cc049724254202
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
docker.io/library/hello-world:latest
</code></pre>
<p>We can see a few things that we need to cover, namely <strong>tags</strong> and <strong>layers</strong>.</p>
<p>We can check all the images that we have in our machine simply by running <code>$ docker images</code> and inspecting its output:</p>
<pre><code>REPOSITORY       TAG        IMAGE ID        CREATED           SIZE
hello-world      latest     bf756fb1ae65    7 months ago      13.3kB
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that we have a <code>hello-world</code> image tagged latest, with a unique image ID (yours may be different) and it weighs only 13.3KB! That is where the gold is! Running a similar basic job using a VM would entail installing an entire OS just to output "Hello world!".</p>
<p>The first column of the <code>docker images</code> output is called <strong>repository</strong>. If you have ever used Git or GitHub, the name might sound familiar. In a Docker Registry, a repository is a collection of different versions of images that share the same base name. Each of the versions is identified by a <strong>tag</strong>, but images can have multiple tags as well!</p>
<p>In general, Docker images follow the naming convention of <code>username/repository:tag</code>. As a quick example, let's suppose that I built an image called <code>mysimpleapp</code> and I shared version 1.0 on the Docker Hub. You could get that image by running</p>
<pre><code>$ docker pull antoniolofiego/mysimpleapplication:1.0
</code></pre>
<p>If we do not specify the tag portion, Docker will by default download the image that is tagged as <code>latest</code>. This is not a special tag, but just the one that Docker assigns by default to images when no other tags are specified at build time.</p>
<p>Now that we have the image locally, we want to run it, right? Surely enough, the command to run images is <code>$ docker run &lt;image&gt;</code>. There are mainly three ways to reference an image:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>By repository</strong>, but it works only if we have a single version of the image (ex: if I have two versions from the same repository, Docker will be confused about which I am referring to).</li>
<li><strong>By repository/tag combination</strong>, which solves the previous problem.</li>
<li><strong>By image ID</strong>, the preferred way, given that every image will always have a unique ID. Note, we can use just the first few characters from the ID and Docker will pick up the correct one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the Image ID method, for our <code>hello-world</code> image example we will run</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run bf756
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image that runs the executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:

<p>We have successfully pulled and run our first Docker Image! 🎉 Let's recap all we learned so far by visualizing a repository structure and all the ways to pull or run an image in a simple way</p>

<p>We know how to pull and run simple images! We just scratched the Docker surface, however. Are you ready to go to the next level?</p>

<h2 id="breaking-down-a-docker-image">Breaking down a Docker Image</h2>
<p>We know from last week that a Docker Image starts as a Dockerfile, which is a recipe that Docker follows to package our application. It is composed of a series of <code>[action]</code> <code>[target]</code> commands, each of which specifies a command that Docker needs to run in sequential order.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at a Dockerfile that deploys a simple Node.js Express server and try to understand how it works.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can download all the code from this example via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/antoniolofiego/hashnode-dockerseries-expressapp">this</a> GitHub repository.</p>
<p>The folder structure for this example is as follows</p>
<pre><code>📦docker-express-app
 ┣ 📂src
 ┃ ┗ 📜server.js
 ┣ 📜.gitignore
 ┣ 📜Dockerfile
 ┣ 📜package-lock.json
 ┗ 📜package.json
</code></pre>
<p>As we can see, the Dockerfile sits at the root level of my project folder. Let's now look at its content.</p>
<pre><code>FROM node:11-alpine

RUN mkdir app

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN npm install

CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
</code></pre>
<p>Let's go through each step one by one:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>FROM node:11-alpine</code> tells Docker to download the Docker image for Node.js version 11 running on Linux Alpine, a very lightweight Linux distribution. This will be the base image used by our container.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>RUN mkdir app</code> creates a local folder named <code>app</code> at the root of the environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>WORKDIR /app</code> changes the working directory for all subsequent commands to the <code>/app</code> folder that we created in step 2.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>COPY . .</code> tells Docker to copy all the files in the current folder on my machine (my <code>docker-express-app</code> folder) in the current directory of the Docker image (the <code>/app</code> directory).</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>RUN npm install</code> installs all the dependencies that I specified in my <code>package.json</code> file, in this case only <code>express</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]</code> is the command that the container will run at instantiation time, in this case, the <code>start</code> script defined in <code>package.json</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The next step is to build the image. As you can imagine, we have a <code>docker build</code> command that does just that! The standard usage for the build command is</p>
<pre><code>docker build -t &lt;username/repository:tag&gt; &lt;path/to/Dockerfile&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Remember that, when tagging an image, if we only provide a repository name Docker will assign the <code>latest</code> tag to the image by default. Let's take a look at the output.</p>
<pre><code>$ docker build -t docker-express-app .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  2.013MB

<p>As we can see, each instruction is carefully followed. On each step, Docker creates a <strong>layer</strong>. Every image is built out of several read-only layers, with each layer corresponding to certain instructions in your Dockerfile. Each step builds …</p></div></div>

  </p>


<p>This post is a collection of miscellaneous notes that I’ve collected about the American banking
system. Some caveats:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s based on <em>~internet research~</em>, and so is only as accurate as whatever I can piece
together from different sources.</li>
  <li>It focuses primarily on the common cases of routable accounts, i.e. checking and savings.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve marked areas where I have outstanding questions —
if you know the answers to these questions (or know where I could find answers), I’d appreciate
it.</p>

<h2 id="account-identification">Account identification</h2>

<p>Accounts are uniquely identified by the tuple of their <strong>routing number</strong> and <strong>account number</strong>.</p>

<p>An account tied to a debit card is additionally identified by a <strong>payment card number</strong>
(alternatively <strong>primary account number</strong>).</p>

<h3 id="routing-numbers">Routing numbers</h3>

<p>An account’s <strong>routing number</strong> (or <strong>routing transit number</strong>) identifies the holding
institution, and is public (i.e., not sensitive) information. Routing numbers are nine digits
long and are maintained and allocated by the American Banking Association (the “ABA” in “ABA RTN”).</p>

<p>The ABA publishes its <a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/RoutingNumberPolicy.pdf">routing number policy</a>, which
contains some interesting facts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Every bank has at least one ABA RTN, which is its <strong>principal
office routing number</strong>.</li>
  <li>Banks can have up to four additional routing numbers (for a total of five), and <em>may</em> have even
more with special approval.</li>
  <li>The nine digits of an ABA RTN are structured as <code>XXXXYYYYC</code>, where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>XXXX</code> is the <strong>Federal Reserve Routing Symbol</strong></li>
      <li><code>YYYY</code> is the <strong>ABA Institution Identifier</strong></li>
      <li><code>C</code> is a check digit</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Federal Reserve account numbers look like ABA RTNs, but are neither indexed by the ABA nor
ACH-routable. This apparently confuses enough bankers to be worthy of a dedicated Q&amp;A item in the
ABA RTN policy.</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s a decent amount of information available online about the format of the <strong>Federal
Reserve Routing Symbol</strong>, but a quick recap:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first two digits can indicate a few different things, but fall into some common cases:
    <ul>
      <li><code>00</code> indicates the US Government</li>
      <li><code>01</code> through <code>12</code> correspond to the 12 Federal Reserve banks (e.g. <code>02</code> is New York)</li>
      <li><code>21</code> through <code>32</code> correspond to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_banking">“thrift” institutions</a> in their corresponding
Federal Bank regions (<code>X - 20</code>, so <code>22</code> indicates a thrift institution registered with the NY Fed)</li>
      <li><code>61</code> through <code>72</code> are <strong>Electronic Transaction Identifiers</strong> and follow the same Federal Bank
pattern as thrifts (<code>X - 60</code>, so <code>61</code> indicates something like a payment processor or
clearinghouse registered with the Boston Fed)</li>
      <li><code>80</code> indicates a travelers’ check</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The third digit is (supposedly) the “check processing center” originally assigned to the bank that
holds the routing number. It’s not clear whether a Fed branch can have more than one check
processing center, or whether the branch itself is the center. It’s also not clear whether this
number is meaningful anymore<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</li>
  <li>The fourth digit is <code>0</code> if the bank is in the city of the associated Fed bank, and <code>1</code> through <code>9</code>
if it is in another state in the Fed bank’s district.
<a href="https://www.frbservices.org/resources/fees/check-key-to-routing-numbers.html">This site</a> has tables
of the numbers, and suggests that the last digit is <em>not</em> unique to each state in the Fed bank’s
district. <code>0</code> also serves a (historical?) double purpose of indicating immediate funds
availability, since the institution is in the same city as its associated Fed bank. It’s not clear
whether this is still true.</li>
</ul>

<p>By way of example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>1010</code> indicates a regular banking institution in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Kansas_City">10th district</a> whose
checks are/were originally processed by the first center in the Fed’s city (Kansas City, in this
case).</li>
  <li><code>6724</code> indicates a cooperative bank in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Chicago">7th district</a> whose checks are/were
originally processed by the second center in a branch city
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Chicago_Detroit_Branch">Detroit</a>, in this
case).</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>ABA Institution Identifier</strong> doesn’t appear to have any (public) structure, other than
uniquely identifying the institution relative to the Fed district it belongs to.</p>

<p>An (official) table of full routing numbers for the Federal Reserve banks themselves is conveniently
provided <a href="https://www.frbservices.org/EPaymentsDirectory/reserveInformation.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The ABA also partners with registrars like
<a href="https://accuity.com/">Accuity</a> to maintain and sell complete copies of the routing database
for reference by financial institutions. In particular, Accuity maintains and sells
<em>The ABA Key to Routing Numbers</em> (better known as the “keybook”), which contains a list of all
allocated routing numbers as well as a record of recent changes (i.e., new and recently deactivated
RTNs). I couldn’t find a copy of the keybook online.</p>

<p>The Fed apparently provides a database called the “E-Payments Routing Directory” for free,
but only via <a href="https://www.frbservices.org/Electronic-Access/AccessFedLine.html">FedLine</a>, which
is some kind of business services portal. They’re kind enough to provide a
<a href="https://www.frbservices.org/assets/resources/routing-number-directory/epayments-routing-directory-cover-letter.pdf">letter template</a>
for requesting that your banking institution request the download on your behalf, but I haven’t
done it yet.</p>

<p>Someone was kind enough to upload a copy of the routing directory (as of 2015) to GitHub
<a href="https://github.com/albertico/frbs-fedwire-fedach/blob/master/fpddir.txt">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="account-numbers">Account numbers</h3>

<p>Unlike routing numbers, account numbers have no fixed length or internal structure standards. US
banks don’t confirm to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number">IBAN</a>.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/1540285">this SO post</a> NACHA stipulates that
account numbers are between 4 and 17 digits for ACH routing purposes, but there’s no
requirement (as far as I can tell) that an account be ACH-routable.</p>

<p>There’s something called a <strong>Universal Payment Identification Code</strong> (“UPIC”) that can apparently
stand in for the tuple of <em>(ABA RTN, account number)</em> for NACHA (but not FedWire ACH)
purposes. There’s a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Payment_Identification_Code">Wiki page</a>; I
didn’t look into them much beyond that.</p>

<h3 id="pcnspans-and-payment-cards">PCNs/PANs and payment cards</h3>

<p>Unlike account numbers, <strong>payment card numbers</strong> (or <strong>primary account numbers</strong>) <em>are</em> structured.</p>

<p>Also unlike account numbers, they don’t uniquely identify a particular account — instead,
they identify a card tied to a particular entity (e.g., an individual or company) at a particular
financial institution. That entity, in turn, may have multiple accounts accessible via their
PCN (e.g. being able to access both checking and savings via a bank-supplied debit card).</p>

<p>PCNs (as of 2017) are between 10 and 19 digits, with the following structure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first six digits are the <strong>Issuer Identification Number</strong> (IIN) which, for financial
institutions, is the <strong>Bank Identification Number</strong> (BIN). Websites regularly use the IIN/BIN
to indicate which card provider/issuer network the PCN belongs to, e.g. by highlighting
the network’s logo during the payment process. IINs are a superset of BINs.
    <ul>
      <li>The first digit of the IIN/BIN is the <strong>major industry identifier</strong> (MII), which indicates
the general industry that the issuer belongs to. Examples: 3 indicates travel and entertainment,
4 and 5 indicate general financial issuers (like banks).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>(Up to) the next twelve digits are the account identifier, which serves a function similar to
the direct account number above.</li>
  <li>The last digit is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm">Luhn</a> check digit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like routing numbers, IINs are maintained by the ABA and are not sensitive information. Despite
not being sensitive, access to the complete IIN registry/database is restricted similarly to
ABA RTNs and the “keybook”: only entities with allocated IINs have access to the official, complete
register.</p>

<p>Despite this, there exist a plethora of third-party services and APIs, some of which are probably
directly reselling the official register.</p>

<p>Some miscellaneous notes about PANs/PCNs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAN_truncation">PAN truncation</a> is the practice of removing
or obscuring all but the last few digits of the PAN on transaction records (e.g., paper receipts).
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard">PCI DSS</a> requires
that no more than 4 last digits be shown and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_and_Accurate_Credit_Transactions_Act">FACTA</a> requires
that no more than 5 be shown, so 4 is common.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>As far as I can tell, there’s no explicit rule anywhere saying that a PAN/PCN’s account identifier
<strong>can’t</strong> be the routable account number for the underlying bank account. There’s probably no good
reason for it to be that way (since it would pointlessly complicate the process of accessing more
than one account from a single payment card), but I also can’t find any evidence that it’s
prohibited.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most payment cards in the US can now perform transactions in (at least) three ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Manual imprinting using the embossed card features</li>
  <li>Magnetic stripe “swipes”</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMV">EMV</a> with an embedded smart chip</li>
</ol>

<p>In-card support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contactless_payment">contactless payments</a>
(which generally use EMV) are not particularly common yet; smartphone-based contactless systems
(i.e. digital wallets like Apple Pay) have seen more adoption.</p>

<h3 id="clearing-and-clearinghouses">Clearing and clearinghouses</h3>

<p>Oh boy.</p>

<p>In the US, virtually all<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> interbank credits and debits are performed (i.e., settled or “cleared”)
via the <strong>Automated Clearing House</strong>, or ACH. Other countries have their own ACH systems, but
for historical reasons the US’s has an (exceptionally?) complicated structure. It contains, at
minimum:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ACH network itself, maintained by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACHA">NACHA</a>.</li>
  <li>The ACH <em>operators</em>, who receive batched transactions and dispatch them to their destination institutions.
    <ul>
      <li>There are currently two ACH operators: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedACH">FedACH</a> and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Payments_Network">EPN</a>. It’s not clear to my why there
are two, or why one of them is private.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ACH <em>files</em>, which are batched collections of structured ACH records.
    <ul>
      <li>More on the structure of these records in a bit.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Originating</strong> and <strong>Receiving Depository Financial Institutions</strong> (ODFIs and RDFIs), which
transmit and receive ACH files, respectively, from the ACH operators.
    <ul>
      <li>ODFI and RDFI refer to the direction of the ACH record, not its kind — an ODFI can issue
either a credit or a debit request.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The penultimate originating and receiving banks, which may or may not be distinct from their
ODFI and/or RDFI<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</li>
  <li>The ultimate originator and receiver, corresponding to individual account-holding entities.</li>
</ul>

<p>The “files” in “ACH files” is <em>not</em> a metaphor — settlement via ACH is actually conducted
via text files containing structured records. It’s hard to find public information on the topology
and structure of the actual ACH network, but ingress into it (via your ODFI) is typically done by
uploading ACH files to some kind of FTP endpoint. SFTP (or FTPS) appears to be optional at most
ODFIs. J.P. Morgan is kind enough to provide some details

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been only 15 days since releasing the <a href="https://github.com/GraphQLAPI/graphql-api-for-wp">GraphQL API for WordPress</a>, and I couldn't help myself, so this week I added yet a new feature: the server can now execute multiple queries in a single operation.</p><figure><img src="https://leoloso.com/images/executing-multiple-queries.gif" alt="Executing queries independently, and then all together as a single operation" loading="lazy" width="915" height="485"><figcaption>Executing queries independently, and then all together as a single operation</figcaption></figure><p>This is not <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/blog/query-batching-in-apollo-63acfd859862/">query batching</a>. When doing query batching, the GraphQL server executes multiple queries in a single request. But those queries are still independent from each other. They just happen to be executed one after the other, to avoid the latency from multiple requests.</p><p>In this case, all queries are combined together, and executed as a single operation. That means that they will reuse their state and their data. For instance, if a first query fetches some data, and a second query also accesses the same data, this data is retrieved only once, not twice.</p><p>This feature is shipped together with the <code>@export</code> directive, which enables to have the results of a query injected as an input into another query. Check out <a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/graphiql/?query=%23%20Run%20this%20query%20to%20execute%20all%20other%20queries%2C%20together%0Aquery%20__ALL%20%7B%20id%20%7D%0A%0A%23%20Export%20the%20user%27s%20name%0Aquery%20GetUserName%20%7B%0A%20%20user(id%3A1)%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20name%20%40export(as%3A%20%22_search%22)%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D%0A%0A%23%20Search%20for%20posts%20with%20the%20user%27s%20name%20from%20the%20previous%20query%0Aquery%20SearchPosts(%24_search%3A%20String%20%3D%20%22%22)%20%7B%0A%20%20posts(searchfor%3A%20%24_search)%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20title%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D&amp;operationName=__ALL">the query below</a>, hit "Run" and select query with name <code>"__ALL"</code>, and see how the user's name obtained in the first query is used to search for posts in the second query:</p><p>(GraphiQL currently <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/issues/1635">does not allow</a> to execute multiple operations. Hence, that <code>__ALL</code> query is a hack I added, as to tell the GraphQL server to execute all queries.)</p><h2 id="heading-how-is-this-feature-useful">How is this feature useful?<a href="#heading-how-is-this-feature-useful"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>This functionality is currently not part of the GraphQL spec, but it has been requested:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/375">[RFC] Executing multiple operations in a query</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/377">[RFC] exporting variables between queries</a></li></ul><p>This feature improves performance, for whenever we need to execute an operation against the GraphQL server, then wait for its response, and then use that result to perform another operation. By combining them together, we are saving this extra request.</p><p>You may think that saving a single roundtrip is no big deal. Maybe. But this is not limited to just 2 queries: it can be chained, containing as many operations as needed.</p><p>For instance, <a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/graphiql/?query=%23%20Run%20this%20query%20to%20execute%20all%20other%20queries%2C%20together%0Aquery%20__ALL%20%7B%20id%20%7D%0A%0A%23%20Export%20the%20user%27s%20name%0Aquery%20GetUserName()%20%7B%0A%20%20user(id%3A%201)%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20name%20%40export(as%3A%20%22_search%22)%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D%0A%0A%23%20Search%20for%20posts%20with%20the%20user%27s%20name%20from%20the%20previous%20query%0Aquery%20SearchPosts(%24offset%3AInt%20%3D%200%2C%20%24_search%3A%20String%20%3D%20%22%22)%20%7B%0A%20%20posts(searchfor%3A%20%24_search%2C%20limit%3A%201%2C%20offset%3A%20%24offset)%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20title%20%40export(as%3A%20%22_postTitles%22)%0A%20%20%20%20hasComments%20%40export(as%3A%20%22_postHasComments%22)%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D%0A%0A%23%20Translate%20post%20titles%2C%20or%20show%20user%20ID%20if%20not%0Aquery%20TranslatePosts(%24_postTitles%3A%20%5BString%5D%20%3D%20%5B%5D%2C%20%24_postHasComments%3A%20Boolean!%20%3D%20false)%20%7B%0A%20%20translatedTitle%3A%20echoVar(variable%3A%20%24_postTitles)%20%40include(if%3A%24_postHasComments)%20%40translate(from%3A%22en%22%2C%20to%3A%22fr%22)%0A%20%20noTitleForUser%3A%20echoVar(variable%3A%20%24_search)%20%40skip(if%3A%24_postHasComments)%0A%7D&amp;operationName=__ALL&amp;variables=%7B%0A%20%20%22offset%22%3A%200%0A%7D">this simple example</a> chains a third query, and adds a conditional logic applied on the result from a previous query: if the post has comments, translate the post's title to French, but if it doesn't, show the name of the user. Click on the "Run" button below, see the results, then change variable <code>offset</code> to <code>1</code>, run the query again, and see how the results change:</p><p>As we've seen, we could attempt to use GraphQL to execute scripts, including conditional statements and even loops.</p><p><a href="https://graphql-by-pop.com/">GraphQL by PoP</a>, which is the GraphQL engine over which the GraphQL API for WordPress is based, is a few steps ahead in providing a language to manipulate the operations performed on the query graph.</p><p>For instance, I have implemented a query which allows to send a newsletter to multiple users, fetching the content of the latest blog post and translating it to each person's language, all in a single operation!</p><p>Check the query below, which is using the <a

<p>Developing enterprise-grade web apps from scratch using open-source front-end and backend frameworks takes a long time. Nowadays, customers are looking for quick and cost-effective solutions and are gravitating towards using no-code and low-code app development platforms. How can full-stack developers thrive in this new world of no-code and low-code platforms?</p>



<h2><strong>No-code and Low-code Platforms</strong></h2>



<p>One purpose of these platforms is to increase the pool of available web app developers by tapping into the broader workforce of non-technical and semi-technical employees. Vendors have developed no-code platforms to be used by non-technical employees to build simple applications, and low-code platforms to be used by employees with basic technical skills (ex: SQL, JavaScript) to develop more complex enterprise applications. Secondly, these platforms can reduce web app development time by over 50% compared to the traditional web app development method.</p>



<p>Currently, there are a large number of vendors competing in the no-code and low-code market segments. No-code platform vendors include AppSheet (Google), Betty Blocks, QuickBase, Airtable, Bubble, and Microsoft PowerApps. Low-code platform vendors include Microsoft PowerApps, OutSystems, Mendix, Salesforce Lightning Platform, Nintex, Appian, and Pegasystems.</p>



<p>We won’t discuss no-code platforms because they cater to non-technical employees and are used for developing simple apps. It’s unlikely that you, as a web developer, will be asked to work on the no-code platform to build web apps.</p>



<p>Low-code platforms, on the other hand, are used to develop more complex apps. Working on developing a web app using these low-code platforms has several disadvantages for a professional web developer who is used to developing apps using open technologies such as front-end and back-end frameworks. Here is a<a href="https://medium.com/@michaelhenderson/why-outsystems-ruined-my-dev-job-3119828fd051"> blog post</a> from a professional web developer about his experiences working on one of these low-code platforms.</p>



<p><strong>Problem-1</strong>: No control over source code</p>



<p>Low-code platforms provide a visual metaphor to develop web apps. Even the app’s business logic is implemented by dragging and dropping code control statements such as if/then/else. Therefore, developers working on these platforms have little control over source code. Not having control over source code creates at least two issues: (a) It’s challenging to develop domain-driven apps with complex business logic, (b) debugging problems can be very difficult and frustrating.</p>



<p><strong>Problem-2</strong>: Career Limiting</p>



<p>Working full-time on a low-code platform can be career-limiting for professional web developers. They would lose their current technical skills in open programming languages and frameworks and gain skills in a proprietary low-code platform. Suppose this proprietary low-code platform is not widely adopted across employers, which is currently the case for any specific low-code platform. In that case, the developer’s low-code platform skills can only be used at another employer who has also adopted the same low-code platform. This severely limits the career mobility of the developer.</p>



<p>Is there a better option? Yes. Why not build a low-code platform for professional web app developers that satisfies both the employers’ need for speed and developers’ needs for control and career mobility? How do we achieve this? Read on …</p>



<h2><strong>Automate Boilerplate Code Generation</strong></h2>



<p>When developing web applications, there is quite a bit of cut/paste/modify work.</p>



<p>Most of the applications I have developed have used an N-layered architecture. In this architecture, to provide a ReST API for the CRUD operations on a database table (entity), we need to develop code for the entity, the DAO (Data Access Object) layer, the services layer, and the ReST controller layer. Similarly, to create UI screens to allow end-users to perform CRUD operations, we need to develop UI components and a front-end services layer that interacts with the back-end ReST API. Once this work is completed for a single database table (entity), similar work must be repeated for each table of the database schema. Imagine having to do this for 50 database tables – this is tedious and error-prone work.</p>



<p>A better approach would be to automate the generation of boilerplate code. To automate, we can develop an application generator that reads the database schema and generates the back-end and front-end code to allow end-users to perform CRUD operations on database tables (entities).</p>



<h2><strong>Provide Add-ons for Functional Cross-cutting Concerns</strong></h2>



<p>Over time, I have noticed that web applications have many functional cross-cutting concerns that repeat across applications. Examples of functional cross-cutting concerns include Authentication &amp; Authorization, Document management, Transactional Emails, Jobs Scheduler, User Registration, and Embedded Reporting. Almost every web application I have been involved in developing required each of these capabilities. In each case, my development team reinvented the wheel and built these cross-cutting concerns from scratch because we never thought about building generic and customizable functional cross-cutting concerns that can be used across web apps- what a waste of effort &amp; time!</p>



<p>If the base code for such functional cross-cutting concerns was already built and available, we could have re-used it and customized it as needed for each web application.</p>



<h2><strong>Provide Visual Development Tools</strong></h2>



<p>Developing enterprise applications involves developing custom functionality such as designing a database schema or domain model, building custom screens for non-CRUD operations, building enterprise-specific themes (colors, fonts), and developing integrations with external systems.</p>



<p>Professional development teams can further reduce the application development time &amp; cost by using visual development tools that accelerate the development of these custom functionality artifacts.</p>



<h2><strong>Support Development Team’s Preferred Stack</strong></h2>



<p>When developing enterprise applications, professional development teams have specific preferences over open technologies used, such as front-end and back-end frameworks, Object-relational mapping tools, UI Component frameworks, and dependency management systems. Specific technologies are preferred by teams either because they are the enterprise architecture standard or because most team members have experience using these technologies.</p>



<p>By supporting the specific technologies chosen by development teams, open low-code platforms for professional developers can help and not reduce the acceleration of application development.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>The approach mentioned above allows development teams to reduce the time to develop a web app by over 50%, similar to proprietary low-code platforms. Additionally, developers have full control over the source code, eliminating their inability to develop domain-driven apps with complex business logic and easily debug issues. Finally, developers use open technologies when developing web apps, eliminating the problem of limited career mobility.</p>



<p>In summary, a low-code platform built for professional web app developers eliminates the disadvantages of proprietary low-code platforms while preserving their advantage of rapid app development.</p>

<![CDATA[Correlation vs Causation]]>
            </title>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>The concepts of correlation and causation are sometimes confusing to amateur researchers. In practice, I often saw researchers considering a correlation as causation and making mistakes in conclusions. Mathematically, correlation is the necessary but insufficient condition for causation. In other words, if two things have causation relationship, these two things must have correlation relationship as well. However, if two things have correlation relationship, these two things do not necessarily have causation relationship.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would use an example to talk about the concepts of correlation and causation, how to verify causation using experiments, and the caveats in using experiments to verify causation.</p>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>

<p>Suppose we have a system containing the four variables including temperature ($t$), the volume of water Mike drinks daily ($x_1$), the volume of urine Mike has daily ($x_2$), the number of fires at California daily ($x_3$). The ground truth values are listed in the table. The underlying relationships have also been listed and we assume there is no error in the measurement during experimental data collection.</p>



<p>The ground truth relationships are listed in the relationships column in the table, and these relationships are unknown to researchers.</p>



<p>In the data collection, we only collected the data for $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$, but not $t$.</p>



<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Variable</th>
    <th>Symbol</th>
    <th>Relationships</th>
    <th>Data #1</th>
    <th>Data #2</th>
    <th>Data #3</th>
    <th>Data #4</th>
    <th>Data #5</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Temperature</td>
    <td>$t$</td>
    <td>$t$</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>20</td>
    <td>30</td>
    <td>40</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Volume of Water <br>Mike Drinks Daily<br>(mL)</td>
    <td>$x_1$</td>
    <td>$x_1 = f_1(t)$</td>
    <td>500</td>
    <td>800</td>
    <td>900</td>
    <td>1500</td>
    <td>3000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Volume of Urine <br>Mike Has Daily<br>(mL)<br></td>
    <td>$x_2$</td>
    <td>$x_2 = f_2(x_1)$</td>
    <td>500</td>
    <td>800</td>
    <td>900</td>
    <td>1500</td>
    <td>3000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Number of Fires <br>at California<br>Daily</td>
    <td>$x_3$</td>
    <td>$x_3 = f_3(t)$</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>15</td>
    <td>30</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>From the data, we found that each pair of $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ are highly correlated. Can we say $x_1$ and $x_2$ have causation relationship and further $x_1$ caused $x_2$? Can we say $x_1$ and $x_3$ have causation relationship and further $x_1$ caused $x_3$?</p>

<h3 id="correlation-is-not-necessarily-causation">Correlation Is Not Necessarily Causation</h3>

<p>If we have some common sense, we know that $x_1$, the volume of water Mike drinks daily, caused $x_2$, the volume of urine Mike has daily. However, since Mike is just an ordinary person and does not have divine power, definitely $x_1$, the volume of water Mike drinks daily, would not cause $x_3$, the number of fires at California daily.</p>



<p>This example concretely shows that causation is the necessary but insufficient condition for correlation.</p>



<p>The next question is how to determine or eliminate the causation relationship from all the correlation relationships? The correct way is to do experiments.</p>

<h3 id="determine-causation-by-experiment">Determine Causation By Experiment</h3>

<p>In this case, if we keep $t$ the same (although we are not monitoring it), increase $x_1$, and monitor the change of $x_2$ and $x_3$. That is to say, we keep the temperature the same, ask Mike to drink more water daily, and monitor change of the volume of urine Mike has daily and the number of fires at California daily.</p>



<p>Of course, Mike would have more volume of urine daily, but the number of fires at California should not change. This experiment result confirms that $x_1$ caused $x_2$, but $x_1$ would not cause $x_3$.</p>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<p>However, if we do experiments incorrectly, we might find erroneous causation relationships.</p>



<p>For example, if we are not aware $t$ is going up since we are not monitoring it, we increase $x_1$ and monitor the change of $x_2$ and $x_3$, then $x_2$ and $x_3$ would both increase. Then we would draw an incorrect conclusion that $x_2$ caused $x_3$, i.e., the volume of water Mike drinks daily caused the number fires at California daily.</p>



<p>Since we are not aware of $t$ increasing, or even did not know the existence of $t$ if we are ignorant, how do we eliminate that $x_2$ caused $x_3$? In this particular problem, it is almost impossible. However, if we have a clone of Mike which is exactly the same as Mike on any aspect, we would ask the first Mike to drink more water daily and the second Mike drink the same amount of water daily to the usual, and monitor the change of $x_2$ and $x_3$. We would find although the first Mike suggested that $x_1$ caused $x_3$, the second Mike would show that although $x_1$ remained the same but $x_3$ increases, which is inconsistent to the causation relationship that $x_1$ caused $x_3$. This rules out the causation relationship between $x_1$ and $x_3$.</p>



<p>Such experiments are called control experiments. Essentially when the control experiments show something inconsistent to the causation relationship you found, the causation relationship you found is fake. It is extremely useful, because even though you do not know how many hidden variables you could not capture, as long as you can guarantee the variables, which have no causation relationships to the variables you are experimenting with, remain the same in both control experiments and actual experiments, the causation relationships you found, if any, would be reliable.</p>



<p>However, in practice, because the system is much more complicated, and the single variable you thought you are changing might actually turn out to contain many variables. For example, when Mike starts to drink more water, he has to use the exact the same cup he used to drink the water, the water has to be the exact same water he used to drink. If the cup got changed, or the water quality got changed, in principle, the conclusion that $x_1$ caused $x_2$ and $x_1$ would not cause $x_3$ would not hold.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>The determination of causation is extremely complicated and could often go wrong. This is because there is an infinite number of variables when you are doing experiments, even with very good control experiment, you might not be aware of how many variables you have changed in the actual experiments and derive the wrong conclusion. This is essentially why a lot of sophisticated scientific findings, especially for life and biomedical science, turn out to be not true.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the key ideas in doing experiments to determine causation relationships are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Doing control experiment.</li>
  <li>Minimizing and being aware of the change to other variables while you thought you are changing only one single variable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Docable Notebooks provide a way for viewing normal markdown files in an interactive and executable format. To enable this, you simply need to add some annotations to your document. For example, let’s see a simple example markdown for making a <code>command</code> cell that can be executed in Docable:</p>
<pre undefined=""><code>This is a docable cell which represents a command:

```bash|{type:'command'}
date
```</code></pre><p>Docable notebooks will turn the markdown above into an interactive and executable document. <strong><em>To execute the cell, simply hover your mouse over the cell and press the play button</em></strong>:</p>
<hr>

<p>This is a docable cell which represents a command:</p>
<hr>

<p>Now suppose you wrote a tutorial in markdown, this is how it would look like:</p>



<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9158546/89744100-c89e4380-da77-11ea-8f34-e8e255bb5de6.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>If you’ve ever written code in JavaScript before, <code>console.log()</code> is most likely one of the first things you learned to use. <code>console</code> also provides many other methods which can be useful for basic logging of different events in you code. In this notebook, we’re going to see another method, <code>console.error()</code>, which can be useful for logging errors.</p>
<p>Let’s write a simple script (<code>./log.js</code>) to better understand these methods:</p>
<div><p>[file:]</p><div><pre data-docable="true" data-type="file" data-path="log.js"><code><span>console</span>.log(<span>'this is a log message in stdout\n'</span>);
<span>console</span>.error(<span>'this is a log message in stderr\n'</span>);</code></pre></div></div><p>Now if we simply run this script, it may look like <code>console.log()</code> and <code>console.error()</code> are doing the exact same thing:</p>
<p>So what makes these two methods different?</p>
<p>The main difference is the stream in which they write to. <code>console.log()</code> prints to <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/stdout">stdout</a> while <code>console.error()</code> prints to <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/stderr">stderr</a>. When we run something in terminal, we see a stream of both stdout and stderr without any visual indication for differentiating between the two. However, we can redirect these two streams to be written in separate files:</p>
<div><p>[command:]</p><div><pre data-docable="true" data-type="command" data-failed_when="exitCode!=0"><code>node log.js &gt; <span>/tmp/</span>stdout <span>2</span>&gt; <span>/tmp/</span>stderr</code></pre></div></div><p>Now if we inspect <code>/tmp/stdout</code> we can see what part of <code>./log.js</code> output was written in stdout stream:</p>
<p>We can see this is what <code>console.log('this is a log message in stdout');</code> printed.</p>
<p>Similarly, if we inspect <code>/tmp/stderr</code> we can see what was printed to stderr stream:</p>
<p>And we can see this is what <code>console.error('this is a log message in stderr');</code> printed.</p>

					<p>Violent scenes are taking place this evening in Minsk, Belarus, where law enforcement officials, with President Aleksandr Lukashenko, are battling the contestants.</p>
<p>The protests began after the official exit poll released on Sunday evening at the end of the presidential election, which credits the eternal Aleksandr Lukashenko with nearly 80% of the vote, according to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53717834">BBC News</a> and <a href="https://tass.com/world/1187449">Tass</a>.</p>

<p>The images posted on Facebook, <a href="https://monetize.info/telegram-bots/">Telegram groups</a> and Twitter by independent journalists in Belarus show huge crowds of people in Minsk, but also in other cities of the country – Gomel, Brest or Baranovichi. In the latter two reportedly, police withdrew from the central area in front of thousands of protesters.</p>

<p>On the same evening, according to exit polls, <strong>Aleksandr Lukashenko</strong> would have won the election again by 79.7%, while opposition candidate <strong>Svetlana Tihanovskaia</strong> would have won only 6.8% of the suffrages.</p>
<p>The country’s authoritarian leader has previously said that everything will remain “under control”. However, independent journalists in Belarus say that citizens are angry and convinced that the elections have been rigged.</p>
<p>Opposition candidate Svetlana Tihanovskaia’s spokeswoman claimed her victory based on “real” results from 20 polling stations. The official asked the Central Election Commission to declare the correct results on Monday. Tihanovskaia herself urged police not to forget “that it is part of the nation.” “I know that citizens will wake up tomorrow in a new country and I hope that tomorrow will bring good news. Stop the violence. officers, I know you can do it,” the opposition candidate said. Several polling station presidents came out in front of citizens to announce what they call the “real” results of the vote. In the clip below, Tihanovskaia is announced winning by 90%.</p>

<p><strong>Aleksandr Lukashenko is in his sixth term as president of Soviet-state Belarus and has ruled the country since 1994.</strong> He is in office for the longest time of all European heads of state (except monarchs). In Belarusian society, the “Old Man” is unofficially called.</p>

<p>President Aleksandr Lukashenko’s forces are making arrests, while demonstrators are wounded.</p>

<p>Now that you're able to drive your car reliably you can use <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a> to train a
neural network to drive like you. Here are the steps.</p>
<h2 id="collect-data">Collect Data</h2>
<p>Make sure you collect good data.</p>
<ol>
<li>Practice driving around the track a couple times.</li>
<li>When you're confident you can drive 10 laps without mistake, restart the python mange.py process to create a new tub session. Press <code>Start Recording</code> if using web controller. The joystick will auto record with any non-zero throttle.</li>
<li>If you crash or run off the track press Stop Car immediately to stop recording. If you are using a joystick tap the Triangle button to erase the last 5 seconds of records.</li>
<li>After you've collected 10-20 laps of good data (5-20k images) you can stop
your car with <code>Ctrl-c</code> in the ssh session for your car.</li>
<li>The data you've collected is in the data folder in the most recent tub folder.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="transfer-data-from-your-car-to-your-computer">Transfer data from your car to your computer</h2>
<p>Since the Raspberry Pi is not very powerful, we need to transfer the data
to a PC computer to train. The Jetson nano is more powerful, but still quite slow to train. If desired, skip this transfer step and train on the Nano.</p>
<p>In a new terminal session on your host PC use rsync to copy your cars
folder from the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<pre><code>rsync -rv --progress --partial pi@&lt;your_pi_ip_address&gt;:~/mycar/data/  ~/mycar/data/
</code></pre>

<h2 id="train-a-model">Train a model</h2>
<ul>
<li>In the same terminal you can now run the training script on the latest tub by passing the path to that tub as an argument. You can optionally pass path masks, such as <code>./data/*</code> or <code>./data/tub_?_17-08-28</code> to gather multiple tubs. For example:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>python ~/mycar/manage.py train --tub &lt;tub folder names comma separated&gt; --model ./models/mypilot.h5
</code></pre>

<p>Optionally you can pass no arguments for the tub, and then all tubs will be used in the default data dir.</p>
<pre><code>python ~/mycar/manage.py train --model ~/mycar/models/mypilot.h5
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>You can create different model types with the <code>--type</code> argument during training. You may also choose to change the default model type in myconfig.py <code>DEFAULT_MODEL_TYPE</code>. When specifying a new model type, be sure to provide that type when running the model, or using the model in other tools like plotting or profiling. For more information on the different model types, look here for <a href="http://docs.donkeycar.com/parts/keras">Keras Parts</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="copy-model-back-to-car">Copy model back to car</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In previous step we managed to get a model trained on the data. Now is time to move the model back to Rasberry Pi, so we can use it for testing it if it will drive itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use rsync again to move your trained model pilot back to your car.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>rsync -rv --progress --partial ~/mycar/models/ pi@&lt;your_ip_address&gt;:~/mycar/models/
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Ensure to place car on the track so that it is ready to drive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now you can start your car again and pass it your model to drive.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>python manage.py drive --model ~/mycar/models/mypilot.h5
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>The car should start to drive on it's own, congratulations!</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mode &amp; Pilot</strong>: Congratulations on getting it this far. The first thing to note after running the command above, is to look at the options in the Mode &amp; Pilot menu. It can be pretty confusing. So here's what the different options mean:</li>
</ol>
<p>a. <strong>User</strong> : As you guessed, this is where you are in control of both the steering and throttle control.</p>
<p>b. <strong>Local Angle</strong> : Not too obvious, but this is where the trained model (mypilot from above) controls the steering. The <em>Local</em> refers to the trained model which is locally hosted on the raspberry-pi.</p>
<p>c. <strong>Local Pilot</strong> : This is where the trained model (mypilot) assumes control of both the steering and the throttle. As of now, it's purportedly not very reliable.</p>
<p>Be sure to also check out the <strong>Max Throttle</strong> and <strong>Throttle Mode</strong> options, and play around with a few settings. Can help with training quite a lot.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Build a Simple Track</strong> : This isn't very well-documented, but the car should (theoretically) be able to train against any kind of track. To start off with, it might not be necessary to build a two-lane track with a striped center-lane. Try with a single lane with no center-line, or just a single strip that makes a circuit! At the least, you'll be able to do an end-to-end testing and verify that the software pipeline is all properly functional. Of course, as the next-step, you'll want to create a more standard track, and compete at a <a href="https://diyrobocars.com/">meetup</a> nearest to you!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Get help</strong> : Try to get some helping hands from a friend or two. Again, this helps immensely with building the track, because it is harder than it looks to build a two-line track on your own! Also, you can save on resources (and tapes) by using a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L2MLCNO">ribbon</a> instead of tapes. They'll still need a bit of tapes to hold them, but you can reuse them and they can be laid down with a lot less effort (Although the wind, if you're working outside, might make it difficult to lay them down initially).</p>
</li>
</ol>

<hr>
<h3 id="how-to-train-a-behavior-model">How to train a Behavior model</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make sure <code>TRAIN_BEHAVIORS = True</code> in myconfig.py when training and when running on the robot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setup an RGB led on robot to indicate which state is active. Enable in config.py. Verify when running robot that L1 PS3 button changes state led indicator. (that's the left upper shoulder button)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By default there are two states. If you like, adjust the number of states in bottom of config.py. Rename or change <code>BEHAVIOR_LIST</code> to an arbitrary number of labels. Make sure same number of rgb colors in <code>BEHAVIOR_LED_COLORS</code>. Make sure to reflect any changes to both PC and Robot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now for training: Activate any state with L1 shoulder button. Then drive as you wish the car to drive when in that state. Switch states and then transition to the new steady state behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the two lane case. Drive 33% in one lane, 33% in the other, and 33% transitioning between them. It's important to trigger the state transition before changing lanes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the records in the tub. Open a .json. In addition to steering and throttle, you should also have some additional state information about your behavior vector and which was was activate on that frame. This is crucial to training correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move data to PC and train as normal, ensuring <code>TRAIN_BEHAVIORS = True</code> in myconfig.py on PC, otherwise extra state information will be ignored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move trained model back to robot. Now place the robot in the location of the initial state. Start the robot with the given model</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>python manage.py drive --model=models/my_beh.h5 --type=behavior
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Now press select to switch to desired AI mode. Constant throttle available as well as trained throttle.</li>
</ul>
<p>As it drives, you can now toggle states with L1 and see whether and how much it can replicate your steady state behaviors and transitions.</p>
<p>Be sure to include quite a lot of example of transitions from one state to another. At least 50, but more like 100. </p>

   <!-- Title -->
   
   

   <p>If you haven't heard, a grassroots Internet movement is afoot.  
      It is called "the small Internet".  This movement is primarily 
      about recognizing that today most individuals can safeguard 
      their free speech on the Internet by running their own 
      inexpensive, efficient websites.  The small Internet movement 
      also acknowledges that web designers should be sensitive to the 
      fact that not all Internet users on the planet have access to 
      the latest computer hardware and software and super-fast 
      broadband Internet connections.  The rest of the small Internet 
      movement is about providing pleasant experiences for Internet 
      users by creating many tiny oases in the planet-spanning, 
      Dune-like desert of the commercial Internet.</p>

   <p>The small Internet movement is an answer to the question, "Why do we 
      have the Internet?".  This question is really a question of values.  
      Why <i>should</i> we have the Internet?  What do we value about the 
      Internet?  What is worth retaining, and what is not?  Those in the 
      small Internet movement believe that free speech, the truth, and 
      knowledge for all enable true freedom and are, therefore, superior 
      to commerce, entertainment, and the ubiquitous spread of government 
      propaganda.</p>

   <p>In the early days of the Internet, governments were unaware of their 
      citizens' newly-found freedom via the Internet to shine light on 
      activities that governments would rather remain in darkness.  As the 
      years passed and awareness grew, they began to be surprised.  Then 
      afraid.  In recent years, governments have begun to work tirelessly 
      to put their citizens back into the dark boxes in which they have 
      always kept them.  Although many living in the so-called "free 
      world" would agree that free speech is a requirement for sustaining 
      a democracy, most seem to be suffering from the misconception that 
      free speech should be limited only to speech that meets with their 
      personal 
      approval.  Due to this lack of understanding, laws and policies are 
      now being put in place in all countries, including the "democracies", 
      to curtail what individuals can say and see on the Internet.  
      Significantly, these policies sometimes 
      <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/19/opinions/facebook-politicians-lie-ads-ghosh/index.html">do 
      not to apply</a> to politicians.  As a result of these laws and 
      policies, Reddit, Youtube, Facebook, and may other Internet-based 
      platforms that once allowed individuals to speak their minds no 
      longer do.  They have been intimidated.  This means that individuals 
      who want to continue to speak their minds on the Internet must 
      either migrate to out-of-the-way platforms that have not yet caught 
      the attention of politicians, or they must create their own 
      platforms.</p><p>The small Internet movement believes that perhaps the only 
      intermediate-to-long-term solution to the curtailment of free speech 
      on the Internet is for individuals to create their own websites.  
      The major hurdles to be overcome in order for this to happen have 
      always been that most individuals lack the time and knowledge to run 
      their own websites.  And, some lack the money to pay for them. 
      Over the last ten to 
      fifteen years, software solutions have arrived to lower the knowledge 
      hurdle.  However, as many have discovered, most of these solutions 
      increase the costs, both to those who run personal websites, 
      and to those who view them.  One reason for the increased cost is 
      that many free software products secretly collect website visitor's 
      data and in so doing, vastly increase the volume of data transmitted 
      across the Internet.  This both raises the cost of electricity 
      required to run servers and taxes the bandwidths of Internet users.</p>

   <p>To give readers an idea of the large cost differences between typical 
      commercial websites and small-Internet websites, I have created the 
      following table of <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/">carbon 
      footprints</a> for a few representative webpages:</p>
   <center><h3>Carbon Footprints of Representative Webpages</h3></center>
   <br>

   <table bordercolor="black">
      <tbody><tr><td>Webpage</td><td>Carbon Footprint (grams of CO<sub>2</sub> per page view)</td><td>Less Carbon than What Percentage of All Webpages?</td></tr>
      <tr><td>www.nytimes.com</td><td>3.08</td><td>14</td></tr>
      <tr><td>amazon.com</td><td>2.69</td><td>16</td></tr>
      <tr><td>walmart.com</td><td>1.44</td><td>44</td></tr>
      <tr><td>apple.com</td><td>0.69</td><td>60</td></tr>

   <p>In response to increased costs, the Internet is buzzing with talk 
      about the concept of "website minimalism".  However, with a few 
      notable exceptions in the corporate world, minimalism only seems to 
      have been implemented well on a relatively small number of personal 
      websites.  The vast majority of the corporate world seems to either 
      not understand the point of minimalism or not care.  Generally, 
      either corporations try to minimize information transmitted to the 
      reader without reducing the data downloaded at all, or they seem to 
      be willing to pay mere lip service to these ideas while being 
      content to go on creating their increasingly bloated Internet.  As 
      <a href="https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm">one writer</a> 
      puts it:</p><div>
   <p>"These comically huge homepages for projects designed to make the 
      web faster are the equivalent of watching a fitness video where the 
      presenter is just standing there, eating pizza and cookies.</p>

   <p>The world's greatest tech companies can't even make these tiny text 
      sites, describing their flagship projects to reduce page bloat, 
      lightweight and fast on mobile.</p>

   <p>I can't think of a more complete admission of defeat."</p>
   </div>
   <p>Since we often use religious terms to present schools of 
      thought, even those pertaining to the sciences, I will have some 
      fun with this article by using a wealth of religious terminology as I 
      explore this topic.  I do not do this to offend the religious or 
      the non-religious.  This method of discussing the small Internet 
      also seems especially appropriate, given that much of what I will 
      be talking about will be beliefs, values, ethics, and goals.</p>

   <p>Those who believe in the small Internet can be loosely grouped into 
      two camps: the orthodox and the unorthodox.  One tenet of orthodox 
      believers appears to be that the small Internet should contain only 
      text, and each webpage should be as small in terms of bytes as it 
      can possibly be.  I am bit unclear as to whether all orthodox 
      believers reject small, relevant pictures, but I see that many never 
      include pictures of any kind on their websites.  The orthodox also 
      seem to greatly value beautiful webpages.  Take 
      <a href="https://samsai.eu/post/introduction-to-gemini/">this 
      page</a>, for example.  It is both beautiful and easy on they eyes.  
      It puts my pink-backgrounded pages to shame.  One example of a 
      strictly orthodox believer in the small Internet can be found 
      <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">here</a> (WARNING: Those who are 
      offended by foul language may want to avoid this page).</p>

   <p>As with the customarily religious, the small-Internet unorthodox 
      are less "type-A" and more laid-back than the orthodox.  Dare I call 
      them pragmatic?  The unorthodox are free to enjoy more of life.  
      They believe in reducing burdensome bandwidth requirements for 
      viewing pages on the Internet, just as the orthodox do, but they 
      also believe in having a little fun.  Unorthodox believers think the 
      fruits of extra content, as long as webpages remain relatively small, 
      should not be grounds for excommunication from the Church of the 
      Small Internet.  As an unorthodox believer in the small Internet 
      myself, I have my own definition of "small".  I believe a limit of 
      about 100 KB should be considered acceptable, certainly not 10 KB 
      or 1 MB.  The reason I chose this number has to do with download 
      times.  Downloading a webpage containing just a tiny number of 
      bytes will normally take between 0.5 and 2.0 seconds, depending on 
      where the user and server are located relative to each other on 
      the planet.  Downloading 100 KB of data on a fairly slow 1 MB/s 
      connection would take less than another second.  That seems 
      reasonable to me.</p>

   <p>Just to make myself perfectly clear, I see nothing at all wrong 
      with cool dynamic content, as long as it is run on the server, and 
      does not involve downloading code and running it on the computers 
      of users.  What the owner of a website does with his own computing 
      power is up to him.  But, beyond viewing a webpage, he does not 
      have the right to dictate what visitors to his website do 
      with theirs, even when he is providing free content.</p>

   <p>Most believers in the small Internet loosely obey something like 
      the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040405142659/http://www.visdesigns.com/design/commandments.html">Ten 
      Commandments of HTML</a>, as provided by one of their prophets whose 
      name seems to have been lost by the postdiluvian Internet 
      (postdiluvian = after web browsers were invented).  Others, I think, 
      may say that the ten commandments of HTML should be rewritten.  
      For example, here are ten commandments that I would like to see 
      largely obeyed on the small Internet:</p>
   <br>

   <div>
   <center><h2>Ten Commandments of the Small Internet</h2></center>
   <br>

   <ol>
      <li>Thou shalt strive to do unto others as thou wouldst have them do 
          unto you.</li>
      <li>Thou shalt strive to minimize thine imposed burden on others' 
          bandwidwiths as much as possible, within reason.</li>
      <li>Thou shalt strive to make simple, beautiful webpages.</li>
      <li>Thou shalt maximize viewable text per total number of bytes on 
          each page.</li>
      <li>Downloading JavaScript to users' computers is of Satan.  
          Thou shalt not do it, ever.  Nor shalt thou suffer thy servants 
          …</li></ol></div></div></div>

The sections' ordering is not related to how important they are. <strong>If you only read one section,</strong> perhaps make it "Discord staff are absolutely untrustworthy", or perhaps "Actual despicable actions and despicable people are not stopped", or you're privacy-minded, "Discord's business model".</p><ul><li><a href="#my-perspective">My perspective</a></li><li><a href="#poorly-managed">The product is poorly managed</a><ul><li><a href="#disabilities">Disabilities</a></li><li><a href="#server-screen-share">Server screen share</a></li><li><a href="#communication">Communication</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#downtime">Downtime</a></li><li><a href="#does-not-care-about-you">Discord does not care about you</a></li><li><a href="#untrustworthy-staff">Discord staff are absolutely untrustworthy</a></li><li><a href="#metadata-collection">Metadata collection</a></li><li><a href="#does-not-stop-despicable-people">Actual despicable actions and despicable people are not stopped</a></li><li><a href="#business-model">Discord's business model</a></li><li><a href="#security-issues">Security issues</a></li><li><a href="#so-what-can-you-do-about-it">So what can you do about the data collection?</a></li><li><a href="#so-what-can-you-use-instead">So what can you use instead of Discord?</a></li><li><a href="#final-thoughts">Final thoughts</a></li><li><a href="#other-readers-would-like-to-share">Other readers would like to share</a></li></ul><p>If you have the time and energy, I highly suggest actually reading the entire post in order. Firefox's reader mode suggests a reading time of about 30 minutes, and there's many links in here that will each add a few minutes to that time.</p><h2 id="my-perspective">My perspective</h2><p>Here's a little background about where I come into this. I joined Discord in mid-2016, pretty early in its life, and since then I've used it to make a lot of friends and deal with tough times. I've enjoyed using Discord and I've seen it introduce a lot of features over time like the new server settings screen, channel categories, server folders, the audit log, and paid subscriptions, which I have paid for. I've participated in the API chats and I've developed several bots, <a href="https://amanda.moe/">one of which</a> has been seeing active development for 2 years, is in 2200 servers and counting, and has 466 hours of code from me since I started counting in 2019, all done at no personal gain for myself. All done because I wanted people to be happy on Discord.</p><p>I used to like Discord. I used to call myself a fan of Discord. But now, I can't put its problems behind me any more.</p><p>I've moved my communities off Discord, or bridged them with Matrix, or transferred them to other people and left them. I'm down to 3 servers from 86, all of which are bridged, so I don't have to open Discord to see them. I'm in the process of purging all of my messages. I likely won't delete my account, because I do occasionally need to log in to attend to something, and deleting my account would do basically nothing. More on that later.</p><p>Here's why I'm ditching Discord.</p><h2 id="poorly-managed">The product is poorly managed</h2><p>There are so many outstanding bugs in Discord that we've all just collectively forgotten about over time. Here's a cute list of a few at the front of my mind:</p><ul><li>Ghost mentions and ghost unreads! Write a message, perhaps with a mention in it, then delete the message. For everyone else, the unread marker and the mention badge remain, even though there's nothing there when you open the channel.</li><li>Bots can't accept calls, and yet, right click a bot in a server and select "call" from the context menu. This one is REALLY funny, you should actually try this one. Interestingly, they bothered to fix this for the SYSTEM user, but not for bots.</li><li>People can only set about 250 notes on other users. After you reach that limit, new notes are silently rejected by the server, and will be gone when you open the profile again. There's no way to see a list of people with notes to delete them on.</li><li>The server region selector is always light themed.</li><li>The download apps screen is always light themed.</li><li>The add server dialogue is always light themed.</li><li>Every server has a member limit that has to be manually raised by Discord staff. If a server has reached this limit, it may still show in the server explorer, but when you click the join button it will load forever. The API request failed in the background with a suitable message, but they never made UI for it. This happens on a few servers on the front page of the server explorer, like CallMeCarson.</li></ul><p>These are not new issues. The calling issue has happened since the beginning of time. The theme issues have happened since the beginning of time. The note limit has existed since the beginning of time. The server member limit issue has existed since the server explorer was added.</p><p>I'd post more examples, but they're harder to find because a few months ago Discord staff wiped the bug report boards, deleting several years of issue reports. These issues still persist to this day.</p><p>These are not big issues. They do not affect how I use the app day-to-day. However, they are evidence of a much more serious problem: Discord staff either do not care about these issues, are too overworked and understaffed to deal with them, or are simply too incompetent to fix them. More on this later.</p><p>There's more evidence of incompetence. For a while we had server audit logs, which let you track if somebody deleted a message — but not if somebody used the bulk delete messages endpoint. That wasn't tracked at all. Oops. It's a thing now, but we've gone at least one or two years without it. <a href="https://cadence.moe/i/abc28e">Oops.</a></p><p>So what have staff being doing instead of polishing these issues and making the app actually look professional? They've been <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/gdkzyn/introducing_tabs_to_android/">changing the mobile UI, clearly without consulting people that actually use the app, and everyone hates it.</a> Oops.</p><h3 id="disabilities">Subsection: Disabilities</h3><p>Perhaps the longest outstanding issue in the app was the contrast ratio of ordinary text. On light theme, the text contrast against the background was somewhere around 2.2:1 (the <em>minimum</em> to be WCAG AA accessible is 4.5:1), meaning it was extremely difficult to actually <em>read text in the app designed for reading text</em> unless you have perfect vision and an accurate monitor. This was eventually resolved for <em>most parts of the app</em>, but shortly afterwards they changed embed titles from perfectly fine to not accessible, which is terrible and shows that they don't actually care and that they haven't changed.</p><p>The pattern of complete disregard for disabilities continues when they made messages highlight when you hovered them with the cursor. As you scroll this page right now, I'm sure that your mouse is hovering over it somewhere. Now imagine that the colours of the paragraph you were hovering over significantly changed as you scrolled and moved the mouse. I actually would have quit using Discord immediately if I didn't have the technical knowledge to figure out where the styles came from and modify the colours to make it not do this — which is actually against terms of service. I have to break terms of service to make the app usable. Cool.</p><p>If you don't see why this is a big deal, it's incredibly distracting for people who have austism, ADHD, or related issues. For me, my mind focuses too much on what is happening on screen, making it impossible for me to actually read and understand the messages. I actually cannot use the app with that setting turned on.</p><p>Do you lack the fine motor control to use the mouse pointer? Perhaps you don't have hands to move it with, or perhaps tremors prevent you from pointing accurately. Sucks to be you, because the app is almost unusable with the keyboard. You cannot use the tab key to move around different sections, because it's been overridden to always focus the text field. Even if you could use the tab key, the focus ring is overridden to be invisible, so you have no idea what will be activated when you press Enter. You might think that it's hard to make entirely keyboard accessible UI. It might be hard, but it's definitely not impossible. Look at Visual Studio Code, an app with similar layout, that is completely keyboard accessible.</p><p>In the beginning, there were no video calls. Then video calls and screen share was added to DM and group DM calls, and people were happy. They wanted server video calls, but didn't have them. Not a huge deal.</p><p>Then somebody discovered that you could fashion a link which would transport you inside the voice channel, which had extremely good UI for video calls and screen sharing, <em>and it worked.</em> Video call and screen share in servers existed and it worked perfectly.</p><p>Then nothing changed about this for 18 months. Screen share still appeared to be DMs only, while still functioning perfectly in servers if you know how to make the link. 18 months of this being a hidden feature that was completely functional.</p><p>Then Go Live came out, and at first, it sucked. Originally it would only let you screen share registered games, and not video call. Then it would let you screen share any application, but not video call. And finally, more than 6 months after the launch of Go Live, they added buttons to open video call and screen share with the current channel. It took a total of 2 years to make this <em>extremely useful and perfectly functional</em> hidden feature into a visible feature.</p><h3 id="communication">Subsection: Communication</h3><p>Discord is a communications app. You think this would let the staff effectively communicate important information to you, and perhaps you could opt in or out of specifc channels, like update notes, developer announcements, technical analysis, stuff like that. Not so. Communication with Discord is unbelievably disorganised.</p><p>Discord has a blog. Discord has the outage reporter. Discord has email lists. Discord has Twitter. Discord writes on GitHub. Discord has pretty much everything except, well, Discord. The only messages that you can be sure to receive are the SYSTEM messages if they decided that it's time to show them your passport. The information that's sent through these different communication routes is also different, so you need to subscribe to all of them. There's also about a billion satellite servers that you have to join to get important information, especially if you're a bot developer. A lot of important information about bot verification, a move which will <em>literally lock people out of the platform if they don't understand what to do,</em> I only find out about when random people post it in servers that I happen to be in. Apparently there's a "Discord Developers" server where they post announcements about this. I have no idea how to get into that server.</p><h2 id="downtime">Downtime</h2><p>Discord wants to be the communication route that you can use for everything. …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>Hi everyone! Welcome back to part 8 of our <strong>Blazor 2d Gamedev</strong> series. Today we’re going to refactor our last example, detecting keyboard input to control character animations.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.davideguida.com/blazor-gamedev-part-7-animations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last time</a> we saw how to load spritesheets and introduced the <strong><a href="https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/blob/develop/BlazorCanvas.Example6/Core/Components/AnimatedSpriteRenderComponent.cs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AnimatedSpriteRenderComponent </a></strong>component. Let’s now see how we can use the keyboard to switch between animations. The results will look more or less like this:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/im4.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-4-07057e8416ec.gif?w=752&amp;ssl=1" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>You can check it out<a href="https://mizrael.github.io/BlazorCanvas/BlazorCanvas.Example7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> in your browser here</a>. Use left/right arrows to control the player.</p>



<p>So let’s start. The first step, as we did in <a href="https://www.davideguida.com/blazor-gamedev-part-6-mouse-input/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Example 6</a>, is to update our<a href="https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/blob/develop/BlazorCanvas.Example7/wwwroot/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> index.html </a>and add the listeners for keyboard events down/up:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="js" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">window.game.canvas.onkeydown = (e) =&gt; {
    game.instance.invokeMethodAsync('OnKeyDown', e.keyCode);
};
window.game.canvas.onkeyup = (e) =&gt; {
    game.instance.invokeMethodAsync('OnKeyUp', e.keyCode);
};</pre>



<p>The callbacks will forward the payload to C# methods in our Index.razor:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">[JSInvokable]
public async ValueTask OnKeyDown(int keyCode) =&gt; InputSystem.Instance.SetKeyState((Keys)keyCode,ButtonState.States.Down);

[JSInvokable]
public async ValueTask OnKeyUp(int keyCode) =&gt; InputSystem.Instance.SetKeyState((Keys)keyCode,ButtonState.States.Up);</pre>



<p>Then we have to update the <a href="https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/blob/develop/BlazorCanvas.Example7/Core/InputSystem.cs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">InputSystem </a>to handle keyboard input as well, same way we did for mouse:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public class InputSystem
{
    public void SetKeyState(Keys key, ButtonState.States state)
    {
            var oldState = _keyboardStates[key];
            _keyboardStates[key] = new ButtonState(state, oldState.State == ButtonState.States.Down);
    }

    public ButtonState GetKeyState(Keys key) =&gt; _keyboardStates[key];
}</pre>



<p>We’re almost done. This time we’re going to give our character a <a href="https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/blob/develop/BlazorCanvas.Example7/CharacterBrain.cs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“bigger” brain:</a></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public class CharacterBrain : BaseComponent
{
    private readonly Transform _transform;
    private readonly AnimatedSpriteRenderComponent _animationComponent;
    private readonly AnimationsSet _animationsSet;

    public override async ValueTask Update(GameContext game)
    {
            var right = InputSystem.Instance.GetKeyState(Keys.Right);
            var left = InputSystem.Instance.GetKeyState(Keys.Left);

            if (right.State == ButtonState.States.Down)
            {
                _transform.Direction = Vector2.UnitX;
                _animationComponent.Animation = _animationsSet.GetAnimation("Run");
            }
            else if (left.State == ButtonState.States.Down)
            {
                _transform.Direction = -Vector2.UnitX;
                _animationComponent.Animation = _animationsSet.GetAnimation("Run");
            }
            else if (right.State == ButtonState.States.Up)
                _animationComponent.Animation = _animationsSet.GetAnimation("Idle");
            else if (left.State == ButtonState.States.Up)
                _animationComponent.Animation = _animationsSet.GetAnimation("Idle");
    }
}</pre>



<p>Let’s see what’s happening here. At every update we get the current input state and if the button is pressed, we switch to the “Run” animation. Otherwise we go back to “Idle”. If we’re going left, we also reverse the direction.</p>



<p>The last step is to update our <a href="https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/blob/develop/BlazorCanvas.Example7/Core/Components/AnimatedSpriteRenderComponent.cs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AnimatedSpriteRenderComponent </a>to be able to switch between animations:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public class AnimatedSpriteRenderComponent : BaseComponent
{
	private int _currFrameIndex = 0;
	private int _currFramePosX = 0;
	private float _lastUpdate = 0f;
	
	private readonly Transform _transform;
	private AnimationsSet.Animation _animation;
	
	public async ValueTask Render(GameContext game, Canvas2DContext context)
	{
		if (null == Animation)
			return;
		
		if (game.GameTime.TotalTime - _lastUpdate &gt; 1000f / Animation.Fps)
		{
			++_currFrameIndex;
			_lastUpdate = game.GameTime.TotalTime;
			_currFramePosX = (_currFrameIndex % Animation.FramesCount) * Animation.FrameSize.Width;
		}

		var dx = -(_transform.Direction.X-1f) * Animation.FrameSize.Width / 2f;
		await context.SetTransformAsync(_transform.Direction.X, 0, 0, 1, dx, 0);

		await context.DrawImageAsync(Animation.ImageRef, _currFramePosX, 0,
			Animation.FrameSize.Width, Animation.FrameSize.Height,
			_transform.Position.X, _transform.Position.Y,
			Animation.FrameSize.Width, Animation.FrameSize.Height);
	}

	public AnimationsSet.Animation Animation
	{
		get =&gt; _animation;
		set
		{
			if (_animation == value)
				return;
			_currFrameIndex = 0;
			_animation = value;
		}
	}
}</pre>



<p>Not very different from the last time, just a few things to note. The call to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/canvas_settransform.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SetTransformAsync()</a> will create and set a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_matrix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transformation matrix</a>. We will use it for now to handle the character flip left/right. Also, we also have to make sure the current frame index is brought back to 0 when we set a new Animation.</p>



<p>That’s it for now! Next time we’ll see how to refactor this code to a more clean structure. Bye!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text"> <figure> <img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/1.jpg" alt="Human with information overload"> </figure>  <p>Have you ever struggled to find information inside your knowledge base or note-taking app? When you did find what you needed, was it after a long time searching and wading through lots of results?</p> <p>If so, this is likely because of information overload - when every human being has access to the sum of all human knowledge, finding any specific bit of it becomes a daunting task.</p> <p><img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/2.jpg" alt="Human running away from too much information"></p> <p>For the modern knowledge worker, the amount of information we need to track far exceeds what can actually fit in our heads. As a consequence, we externalize that information using tools like Evernote, Notion, and Confluence.</p>  <p><img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/3b.jpg" alt="Knowledge worker using Evernote, notion, and confluence to organize information"></p> <p>The problem with these tools is that the more information we put in, the harder it becomes to get it back out. This is because existing tools lack the capability of organizing large amounts of information and why most of us rely on search to find what we need.</p> <p><img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/4.jpg" alt="Knowledge worker organizing information using notion, Evernote, and confluence"></p>  <p>Search is great when you are looking through <strong>the internet</strong>, <strong>know what you’re looking for</strong> and need <strong>a good result</strong>. For example, a google search for “the height of Mt Everest” will give you exactly what you need.</p> <p>Search fails when you are looking through your <strong>knowledge base</strong>, might <strong>not know the exact query</strong>, and are looking for a <strong>highly specific result.</strong> For example, say you saved an article about government tax breaks. Searching those exact terms together might yield no results but searching for “government” or “tax” individually might flood your screen with non-relevant data.</p>  <p>The fundamental problem with a search centric model for managing information is that it is based on keywords.</p> <p>Here, a keyword is defined as any term that has ever been or might ever be used in the human language. To get the right result, two things need to happen.</p> <ol> <li>Out of the vast universe of all possible keywords, you need to pick out the right keywords that <strong>match the relevant document you are looking for</strong> when you are <strong>looking for it.</strong></li> <li>Out of the vast universe of all possible keywords, you need to have picked out the right keywords that <strong>you thought might match a future query</strong> when you <strong>first created the document.</strong></li> </ol> <p>The odds of both things happening, especially over long periods, are astronomical. It is like trying to find a star in the night sky by just its description.</p> <p><img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/4b.jpg" alt="Knowledge worker finding information using keywords"></p> <p>The reason keywords don’t work is because they require people to do something that the human brain is not good at - working with and remembering an unbounded number of things.</p>  <p>The alternative to keeping track of everything individually is organizing.</p> <p>Here, organizing is defined as a means coming up with systems to simplify your data so that you can more easily access it later.</p> <p>The most common way that people organize information is to group related concepts into topics. By grouping related information, you reduce the cognitive load required to keep track of individual items.</p> <p>The psychological term for this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)">chunking</a> and it is something that the brain is naturally good at. Even unconsciously, we will create associations between things. This process is so powerful that we now have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconscious_bias_training">unconcious bias training</a> to <strong>train ourselves not to do this</strong> when it results in discriminatory behavior.</p> <p><img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/5b.jpg" alt="Knowledge worker chunking information into topics"></p> <h2 id="chunking"> <a href="#chunking" aria-labelledby="chunking"></a> Chunking </h2> <p>The problem with chunking is that it cannot keep up with the sheer amount of information we deal with today.</p> <p>If you try to group all the information into chunks, one of two things will happen.</p> <ol> <li>You have too many chunks and keeping track of chunks becomes overwhelming</li> <li>You have a few chunks with too many things in them which causes you to lose the benefits of chunking in the first place</li> </ol> <p><img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/6.jpg" alt="Knowledge worker trying to find information but being overwhelmed with chunks"></p> <h2 id="indirection"> <a href="#indirection" aria-labelledby="indirection"></a> Indirection </h2> <p>The solution to too many chunks is indirection.</p> <blockquote> <p>“All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection” – David Wheeler, Computer scientist</p> </blockquote> <p>When the complexity of information becomes too much at one level, we simplify it with a layer of indirection that pushes the bulk of the complexity to a new level.</p> <p>For information, this means creating hierarchies to group related chunks. We can keep doing this until the number of chunks at any given level of the hierarchy becomes manageable. At this point, our data starts to take the shape of a tree.</p> <p><img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/7.jpg" alt="Knowledge worker modeling information as a tree"></p> <h2 id="trees"> <a href="#trees" aria-labelledby="trees"></a> Trees </h2> <p>Trees are one of the most important data structures in computer science and are used extensively in every database ever designed. These are systems that actually store all the world’s information.</p> <p>Finding information in a tree can be done in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree#Time_to_search_a_sorted_file">logarithmic time</a> - in layman’s terms, it means you can quickly search through large amounts of data using very small trees. An example of this in real life is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification">dewey decimal system</a>. This system is used by libraries to assign unique identification labels to every book ever published.</p>  <p>Time for a quick recap - the human brain is not good at remembering an endless amount of things. This is why keywords fail. We, therefore, chunk related concepts into topics. This too runs into problems when we end up with too many chunks. The solution to this is to group related chunks using trees.</p> <p><img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/7a.jpg" alt="Recap of knowledge worker putting together a tree - Part I"> <img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/7b.jpg" alt="Recap of knowledge worker putting together a tree - Part II"></p> <p>When the number of chunks at any given level exceeds what is easy for us to remember, we can apply <em>another level of indirection</em> by grouping related chunks and pushing it further down the tree.</p> <p><img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/9.jpg" alt="Knowledge tree with a layer of indirection applied"></p> <p>This whole process is recursive - you can apply it at any level of the tree as many as times as you need to make the information comprehensible.</p> <p><img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/10.jpg" alt="Knowledge tree with multiple layers"></p> <p>This ensures that the number of chunks you need to track at any given level stays comprehensible no matter how much information you have.</p> <p>Thinking about information in terms of trees reflects how humans naturally think about things and there is increasing evidence that the <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080423121430.htm">human brain is hard-wired to think in terms of hierarchies</a></p>  <p>Today’s knowledge bases support the concept of trees through the use of folders and tags. But this is not enough. Folders and tags haven’t changed much in the last fifty years and run into the following challenges when used in tree form.</p> <ol> <li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Ability to apply the same tree everywhere</li> <li><strong>Manageability</strong>: Ability to update the tree everywhere</li> <li><strong>Usability</strong>: Ability to quickly find data using the tree</li> </ol> <h2 id="consistency"> <a href="#consistency" aria-labelledby="consistency"></a> Consistency </h2> <p>There’s overhead involved in creating trees. Even simple domains can have dozens of branches. We have enough trouble simply tagging our data, asking us to re-create entire hierarchies for any number of things is simply too much work.</p> <p><img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/11c.jpg" alt="Replicating knowledge tree"></p> <h2 id="manageability"> <a href="#manageability" aria-labelledby="manageability"></a> Manageability </h2> <p>A tree-based organization structure tends to be the reflection of our mental model of a particular domain. The thing about mental models is that they change. Either the underlying domain changes or our understanding of it changes. Either way, the structure of the tree changes. But when it does, making sure all our existing trees reflect that change is not easily done with current tools.</p> <p><img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/12.jpg" alt="Updating knowledge tree"></p> <h2 id="usability"> <a href="#usability" aria-labelledby="usability"></a> Usability </h2> <p>Even if we organize data as trees, existing tools have little to no support helping us find data using hierarchies. We end up having to manually click through our trees or performing keyword searches that ignore our hierarchies completely.</p> <p><img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/13.jpg" alt="Using knowledge tree"></p>  <p>The reason we don’t use trees to organize and find information today is that existing tools make it unfeasible to do so. The means of organizing information in a “modern” knowledge base is the same as it was fifty years ago - folders and tags.</p> <p>Ever since Google became the dominant way to find information on the web, knowledge bases gave up trying to improve on organization. Why organize when you can search? The problem is that <strong>search doesn’t work in these tools</strong> and continues to <strong>get worse as the amount of information we track keeps growing</strong>.</p>  <p>What if we could create a tool that made it possible to organize and find the information we cared about, no matter how much information we had? What could we do with such a tool?</p> <p>Thinking about such a tool is something I’ve done for much of the last decade. More than think about it, I’ve built such a tool and used it to manage a personal knowledge base of +20k notes. This tool has become my second brain and I use it for just about everything that I do.</p> <p>A year ago, I left my job at Amazon to build a consumer-ready version of this tool. It is called <a href="https://dendron.so/">Dendron</a> <del>and will be entering into early access in early May</del> and is now out in <a href="https://www.dendron.so/">preview</a>.</p> <p>Note that using Dendron will not magically make information overload go away. You still have to do the hard work of organizing your information. But Dendron finally gives you a sane way of doing so.</p> <p>This post is not a sales pitch and I’d be lying to say we got it all figured out. Rather, it is an invitation to come along on a journey to find answers to what I consider to be one of the biggest challenges of our age. How do we make sense of the world we live in?</p> <p>If this message resonate, lets connect. You can join the conversation on dendron’s <a href="https://discord.gg/5HbAv3">discord server</a> or contact me directly at kevin@dendron.so.</p> <p>It is said that life is about the journey - what greater journey is there than the one to make sense of it all?</p>  <ul> <li><strong>Thanks</strong> to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-sernau-40394648/">Luke Sernau</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilana-l-539930167/">Ilana Lin</a> for proofreading drafts of this</li> <li><strong>Special thanks</strong> to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilana-l-539930167/">Ilana Lin</a> for creating the beautiful illustrations in this post</li> </ul> </section></div>]]>

<h2>0. AutoRail-System - as a whole - in three sentences</h2>
<p>The AutoRail system is a lifted rail system at around four meters height with embedded power and data lines and autonomous vehicles driving on it. Running on batteries they can also be driven on usual roads, but on these rails they can easily drive on line electricity, autonomously, cooperating and physically connecting making traffic jams very unlikely. The system is extensible being able to hold many infrastructures at once, intrinsically a power and data line, but also water and waste water pipes or solar cells mounted as a roof.</p>
<h2>1. The Problems</h2>
<h3>1.1 Energy Storage + Efficiency</h3>
<p>The combustion engine dominated the mobility of the 20th century. The lightweight and yet abundant energy storage (gasoline/diesel) only made this possible. It provided the flexibility to create simple autonomous vehicles, cars, a great invention, truely.</p>
<p>But the aimed-at decarbonization of the 21st century demands a replacement. Batteries and Hydrogen aim at a shortcut solution there, simply replacing the storage system (also replacing the combustion engine with a simpler electromotor).<br>
Nevertheless, also for those the energy has to be stored inside the vehicle.</p>
<p>Unevitably, this brings the risk of fires, as much energy is stored in a small volume.<br>
Also, these energy containers have to be carried along the way. Especially for batteries, this creates a lot of dead mass in the vehicle, as usually not the full capacity is needed.</p>
<p>Most importantly, there are also conversion inefficiencies for all of those systems, which can only partly be overcome.</p>
<p>These problems are inherent in all flexible, unconnected systems, be it cars, drones, autonomous flight taxis. So one needs a good solution at the energy storage front to make these attractive and useful. But no (or only limited) need of such a storage system would make things easier for sure.</p>
<h3>1.2 Autonomy</h3>
<p>The autonomous car has been a hot topic during the 2010's. Although, there were major steps and there are vehicles running partly autonomous already on the road, it did not make a true breakthrough yet.</p>
<p>The partly unevitable connection to the internet changes such a car from a human controlled weapon (with the driver also taking risk) to a potentially remote-controlled one, with no risk for the operator. Eventually, humans are out of control at all.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are still problems with unseen situations. The reliance on unforseeable reasoning of artificial intelligence is criticized by insurances, regulators and not to forget the humans being transported.</p>
<p>The more complex systems get, the more probable weak links in the chain are.</p>
<p>But the impact of such an autonomous mobile systems would surely be tremendous. On one side it would take taxis', buses' and trucks' drivers jobs, but it would also make common transport even more affordable.<br>
These drivers were really the drivers of globalization in the past century making global economic cooperation possible at all.</p>
<p>With autonomous mobility another big reliance of industrialization on human individual work force would be relieved, making the easy distribution of more wealth only possible.</p>
<p>But it would be nice to have such a system understandibly reliable, non-hackable as well.</p>
<h3>1.3 Simplicity, Scalability</h3>
<p>Scalability is a big point for such autonomous systems. One some scales, autonomous, individual driving is surely more efficient. The modern phenomenon of traffic jams shows limitation of this way of mobility. Public mass transport in trains and buses is much more efficient for a situation, where many people want to move along the same path.</p>
<p>There are phase-transitions, emergent effects, that have to be accounted for.<br>
For example, fast, computer-based communication could obviously detect these and densify traffic to make it faster when needed.</p>
<p>But these systems have to be constructed failsafe, optimally mechanically failsafe. Too often software bugs have caused severe damage to opt for a software only solution.</p>
<h2>2. Proposed Solution - In parts</h2>
<h3>2.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>While often these problems are dealt with separately, this should be an attempt to solve them in a combined way. It involves, as for all other transportation systems, a kind of cooperative action and cannot be established by a single company.<br>
A car is as slow as the road permits that it is driving on.</p>
<p>The following parts describe subdecisions all contributing to the better whole. They provide an understanding of why exactly this and no other system is needed.</p>
<h3>2.2 A Rail system</h3>
<p>Why do we want a rail system? Rails are energy efficient, you don't have to steer, you just follow the path you want to go anyway. It reduces the degrees of freedom to be controlled, you can only accelerate and brake (and turn right at crossings). Also all other participants do this, so it is very simple to predict movements of others (if you want to as a safety redundancy).</p>
<h3>2.3 Dimensionality</h3>
<p>Railroads are expensive because they are commonly built to carry a lot of weight. This is sensible if you have only large machines to operate on it (trains) and maximizes the productivity of one human operator. But things change, if you have an autonomous system. You don't have to maximize the effort of one human operator. Here mass scale to be transported as a whole is the mass of a single human being. One usually doesn't want to split that.<br>
So one doesn't need to transport 20 metric tons per axis, but actually something like 300 kg (to be on the safe side), maybe a bit more for other common things or animals.</p>
<h3>2.4 Energy</h3>
<p>The role energy storage plays in this system is that you don't need it. At least not when vehicles are moving on the rails. The energy (electricity) should be provided on electric lines in between the rails or at the top as for usual trains.</p>
<p>Vehicles can carry batteries with them to move on after leaving the rail system. It is crucial to enable them using also existing roads and streets. Otherwise it will be poorly adopted as, in the beginning, the individual benefit is negligible.</p>
<h3>2.5 Position</h3>
<p>There are already too many things on the ground competing for space. Lifting the rails to a height of around four meters, will make the system more costly and broadens safety considerations.</p>
<p>But, here the limited weight of the vehicles comes into play. The construction doesn't have to hold tens of tons per axis, but only some hundred kilograms. So cost is someway limited here.</p>
<p>This lift also minimizes interactions with other mobile, autonomous systems, people, other cars, animals. So it plays a crucial role for making things easily, safely autonomous.</p>
<p>There are also two other options, which are considered in other approaches. One is flying. It obviously minimizes any need of infrastructure and allows for high speeds. But it also doesn't solve the energy storage problem.<br>
The second one is most prominently followed by the so called "Boring Company". Its proposal is essentially going not up but down, underground.<br>
While this has some obvious advantages (you do not have to look at it), it has to deal with safety issues and is though some technological advances really expensive.</p>
<h3>2.6 Coordination</h3>
<p>While most modern systems rely on wireless communication, it might be beneficial to have communication wires in between the rails as well. You can only hack them, when you are really on the system (or very close). And a vehicle can easily monitor if it is still connected (physical contact). You can also localize interaction by simply cutting the wire at specific points.</p>
<p>Once systems communicate, they can also cooperate. Two rail vehicles on the same way can connect physically. First, to save energy by having a smaller aerodynamic resistance. Second, to enable a mechanical braking system, making rear-end collisions nearly impossible. And third for a global benefit, they make traffic more dense, reducing the risk of traffic jams.</p>
<p>This coordination system is at the core of the technology. It not only has to cope with sudden brakings (although these should occur very seldom). Vehicles have to get on and off the rails, the need to get out of or into the chain at crossings. This should happen autonomously and efficiently of course, but all relevant data is directly at hand due to the direct wired communication.</p>
<h3>2.7 Combination with other Infrastructure</h3>
<p>You might have heard the phrase: "Think things together that belong together". This rail system aims at being a new kind of infrastructure.</p>
<p>Why not combine it with other infrastructure? When it already provides electricity for the vehicle on it, why no provide electricity for the house nearby or the village at its end? Same for wired internet connection and water / waste water connection. While usually these were dug under streets, hardly accessible, they could be easily mounted underneath the rails.</p>
<p>If you have multiple rails crossing, these links make the system more resilient also for other infrastructure. If one link breaks for whatever reason there are usually more edges connecting nodes.</p>
<p>Also one can build cycle paths underneath, with the rail construction providing shade. In between the rails or mounted as a roof, one can place photovoltaic cells providing the energy for the movement and the electric grid. The electric power lines are right there.</p>
<p>This is only possible by the modular/extensible design that we imagine. In doubt it is always sensible to opt for more than less infrastructure.</p>

      <section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>These days I turn to <a href="https://sharpend.io/recreational-programming-with-serverless/">recreational programming</a> more often than usual. Solving fun problems makes me feel less confused and helpless about the pandemic. It’s a coping mechanism and a good one at that.</p>

<p>One thing has been an especially surprising source of joy for me: <em>Rust</em>. Surprising because I’ve been known to have an on-off relationship with the programming language since its 1.0 release. I quit Rust more than once – both professionally and personally – mainly out of frustration with a subpar development experience and general lack of libraries.</p>

<p>Looking back, I’m thrilled that I gave Rust another chance this year.</p>

<h2 id="that-was-then">That was then</h2>

<p>Back in 2017, <a href="https://sharpend.io/every-day-we-must-sweep/">I wrote</a> that “Rust lets you control almost everything, but as a beginner, it’s also hard to compile <em>anything</em>. As a result, Rust continues to make me look bad.” I was disappointed. Again.</p>

<p>At the time, I was working for a chaos engineering startup that chose Rust for simulating common server problems such as high CPU load, increased network latency, or random application crashes. A reasonable choice if your goal is to inject low-level faults in a predictable way, right? After all, Rust is said to be <a href="https://thenewstack.io/microsoft-rust-is-the-industrys-best-chance-at-safe-systems-programming/">our best chance at safe systems programming</a>. That may very well be true.</p>

<p>However, back then, I didn’t think Rust was the best option for the client side of the product. The main reason was productivity – or rather the lack thereof.</p>

<p>In 2017, my day-to-day Rust experience boiled down to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Writing code in Vim with bare-bones syntax highlighting</li>
  <li>No code completion and no “go to definition” (the Rust Language Server was still in its infancy)</li>
  <li>Effectively no code formatting, since <code>rustfmt</code> just gave up whenever a line was too long (seriously)</li>
  <li>Docs were hard to find or non-existent</li>
  <li>The same goes for high-quality code examples</li>
  <li>No official Rust Docker images, homegrown CI pipelines only</li>
  <li>Compile times were noticeably slow, resulting in long <a href="https://sharpend.io/fast-feedback-is-everything/">feedback loops</a></li>
  <li>Speaking of feedback, Rust’s borrow checker made it difficult to understand why it rejected a piece of code and how to fix it</li>
</ul>

<p>All these drawbacks add up, but what really bothered me was the immature crate ecosystem. To give you one example, when we implemented the ability to inject faults into containers, we couldn’t find any usable Rust client library to talk to the Docker API, let alone Kubernetes. As a result, we were forced to reinvent the wheel several times (and sometimes ended up with a flat tire, in typical startup fashion).</p>

<p>In the face of these obstacles and despite my appreciation for its language design, I often found it challenging to get real work done with Rust.</p>

<p>At least, that was then.</p>

<p><img src="https://sharpend.io/assets/images/rust-gegenueber.jpg" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="this-is-now">This is now</h2>

<p>Today, three years later, I’m happy to report that <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/05/15/five-years-of-rust.html">Rust has changed a lot</a>, and for the better! That became apparent to me when I recently had some extra time between freelance contracts and decided to <a href="https://sharpend.io/7-things-i-learned-from-porting-a-c-crypto-library-to-rust/">port a crypto library from C to Rust</a> (because that’s what I do to get out of the cloud consulting bubble once in a while).</p>

<p>I realized that the release of the <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/06/Rust-1.31-and-rust-2018.html">2018 edition</a> is particularly noteworthy. It made the language much more productive in several ways: simpler syntax, a smarter borrow-checker, an improved module system, enhanced tooling (both <code>rustfmt</code> and Clippy, Rust’s linter, hitting 1.0), and a host of other features. Add to that IDE support, incremental compilation, excellent documentation, and immensely helpful error messages, and what you now get is nothing short of remarkable.</p>

<p>Thanks to Rust’s soaring popularity – it has been <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/01/20/what-is-rust-and-why-is-it-so-popular/">Stack Overflow’s most loved language</a> for four years in a row – finding a particular crate or tool has become easier (though still not necessarily easy). There are more and more <a href="https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust">open source projects</a> to explore. There’s a growing list of third-party cargo subcommands (<a href="https://github.com/rust-secure-code/cargo-geiger">cargo-geiger</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gnzlbg/cargo-asm">cargo-asm</a> being two of my favorites). There’s even <a href="https://github.com/google/evcxr">a decent REPL</a>. CI/CD <a href="https://actions-rs.github.io/">is a breeze</a>, and so is <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross">cross compilation</a> to dozens of platforms. In short, there’s a lot to love here.</p>

<p>Given these advances, it’s no wonder that learning Rust is also quite different now. The tonari blog <a href="https://blog.tonari.no/why-we-love-rust">captured it well</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A year after switching over to Rust, we onboarded our fourth engineer to the team, who didn’t have much prior experience in either Rust or systems engineering. While the learning curve is undeniable (borrow checker, my old friend), we’ve found that Rust is incredibly empowering for those new to lower-level programming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Empowering</em> is the perfect word to describe Rust in 2020. What used to be a rough adventure with many pitfalls has turned into something beautiful, something that can lift your spirit. At least, that’s what it did for me.</p>

<p>I encourage you to immerse yourself in a little Rust project today. You might be in for a pleasant surprise.</p>

    <p>Overview</p>
    <div>

        <p>Llama Logs is a brand new tool that turns distributed logs into a <b>real time interactive graph</b>.</p>
        <p>Llama Logs was created to help bring clarity to complex cloud architectures.</p>
        

        <p><img height="auto" width="600px" src="https://llamalogs.com/images/doc-examples/complexArch.gif"></p><p>With Llama Logs, <b>never again</b> will you need to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create and update architecture diagrams by hand.</li>
            <li>Install agents onto your machines.</li>
            <li>Hunt down erors through mulitple machines and log files.</li>
            <li>Struggle to teach new team members your architecture.</li>
            <li>Limit your analytics to the machine level.</li>
        </ul> 

        <p>With <b>only a few log lines</b> in your code base, </p>
        <p><img height="auto" width="600px" src="https://llamalogs.com/images/codeScreenshot.png"></p><p>Llama Logs will instantly create a live visualization of the activity within your system. </p>
        
        <p>Llama Logs is <b>built for developers</b>, so the possibilities are endless!</p>
    </div>


    
    <p>The Llama Logs Graph</p>
    <div>
        <p>The graph is where all of the events from a system are visualized automatically by Llama Logs.</p>
        <p>Below is an example of a Llama Logs graph for a Cloud Architecture with Multiple Cloud Functions and a Database.</p>
        <p>Each one of the circles moving between components represents logged events occurring between those two components.</p>
        
        <p><img src="https://llamalogs.com/images/LlamaStartingDemo.gif"></p><p>Instantly we can see the structure and activity of the entire architecture in real time!</p>
        <p>The graph even shows errors in red that are occuring during the response from one of the modules in the first Cloud Function.</p>

        

        <p>See more examples of Llama Logs system visualizations on our <a href="https://llamalogs.com/docs/examples">examples page</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article aria-label="Posture and Breathing: The Physiological effects of Shallow Breaths"><div>
<p>If you’re reading this post on your phone, make yourself comfortable. It might hurt.<br></p>



<p><strong>Here are the facts:</strong><br></p>



<p>Text neck is the term for the modern spine ailment that everyone needs to know about. It’s the same “forward head posture” that afflicts computer operators and desk workers since humans moved from manual labour to sedentary jobs. Now young people are already showing signs of repetitive strain from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4756000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">overuse of mobile phones</a>which manifest as neck, jaw, and shoulder pain, headaches, and spinal changes.<br></p>



<p>Your body is designed to move and change positions frequently but poor posture, sedentary work and long-term high volume use of mobile phones is having a knock on effect to many of our body systems and functions<br></p>



<p>It doesn’t take long before the muscles of our neck shorten and overwork adapting to their new normal workload and position.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.normanmarcuspaininstitute.com/cinderella-hypothesis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">The Cinderella Hypothesis</a>&nbsp;is the theory that just like Cinderella some muscles fibres do all the work and are constantly used over time&nbsp;and generate trigger points and muscle pain. Our posture and the way we breathe can lead to these muscles doing the wrong job and being overworked just like Cinderella.<br></p>



<p>Over time the joints and ligaments deteriorate to a point where the neck stays stuck in a forward head position. This gives us a hunched back and dowager’s hump posture. Thanks to our heavy heads, weighing on average 5kgs, (the size of a 2 month old child) being a few centimetres out of the optimal position (right above the spinal column) and at an angle of around 60 degrees when texting we also get pain in our lower backs, far from the location of the problem.<br></p>



<p>Imagine walking around with a two month old baby hanging around your neck while you worked or texted. Does that sound comfortable?</p>



<h2>What are the effects of shallow breathing?</h2>



<p>Humans and animals take short shallow breaths when they’re nervous, threatened, afraid, or anxious. Shallow breathing is the opposite of belly breathing or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thebreatheffect.com/the-power-of-your-breath/">abdominal breathing</a>. When we breathe “shallow”, we recruit our back up breathing muscles of our neck and chest to inhale, we often over-inflate and stay hyperinflated in our ribcage. We can do this for short periods of time when stressed but we are not designed to be on alert all the time.<br></p>



<p>When we take shallow breaths, we over-breathe oxygen and breathe out too much carbon dioxide stressing our body and telling our nervous system to stay on red alert. In contrast, breathing in a calm pattern that activates the rest digest and recovery part of our nervous system requires us to lengthen our exhale and slow down the number of breaths we take a minute. To prevent the negative long term effects of this “stress-like” state, we must try to prevent shallow breathing.<br></p>



<p>But this is where posture can cause us further problems. People with poor posture (rounded shoulders, tight pectoral muscles, forward heads) tend to have trouble establishing a good breathing pattern. Diaphragmatic breathing is difficult for these people and even their shallow breaths are inefficient because of the restrictions around the chest. The implications are severe. To reset your posture you need to find ways to release these bad breathing muscles that get short and tight from overuse. You can check out our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thebreatheffect.com/free-pilates-fusion-class/">free 15 minute pilates video</a>&nbsp;to give you exercises that can gentle release these muscles.<br></p>



<p>Stress-related illnesses, sleep problems, respiratory problems,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thebreatheffect.com/immune-system-breathing-techniques/">immune system weakening</a>, and high blood pressure are all symptoms of long term shallow breathing.</p>



<h2>Posture Influences Everything</h2>



<p>Posture affects our health and how well we perform in all areas of life. For example, people with rounded shoulders, hunched backs, and necks that force their gaze towards the floor, generally do&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/opinion/sunday/your-iphone-is-ruining-your-posture-and-your-mood.html">less well at interviews</a>, are perceived as less attractive, and have a gloomier outlook on life.<br></p>



<p>Your phone is a big part of the problem. And let’s not forget about the time we spend at desks in school and work. Kids spend years hunched over books and computers at a desk. We’re only starting to understand the implications of the “always on” culture that the smartphone has introduced to society.<br></p>



<p>Constantly being bombarded by messages and social media activates our stress response dumping cortisol and adrenaline in our blood, mobilising our body into action. No wonder it is hard to switch the brain off and sleep at the end of the day after being on social media or working at a computer.<br></p>



<p>Younger populations are the most affected as millennials live their lives through their devices but older enthusiastic phone adopters also feel the effects.<br></p>



<p>But the way we physically use phones isn’t the only influence on our posture. Yes, the hunched position we adopt for scanning our Instagram feed creates tension in the postural muscles. But&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4950540/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">indirect causes</a>&nbsp;such as stress, anxiety, loneliness and depression contribute too.<br></p>



<p>Depressed, stressed people do not generally walk with confidence or sit with straight backs and open shoulders. Overuse of phones can also lead to sleep disturbances, which has the chain reaction effect of lowering our immune system, impacting our posture, and increasing levels of stress and depression.<br></p>



<p>Our posture affects our mood and emotions, which affects our health, which changes our breathing pattern, which changes our posture again. And so the cycle continues.<br></p>



<p>The good news is by changing your posture you can help break the cycle, shifting your emotions, making it easier to access your optimal breathing muscle, the diaphragm.</p>



<h2>Do you slouch?</h2>



<p>Be honest with yourself. Do you slouch? Check how you stand in a mirror and be critical – the importance to your health is at stake. Better still, ask a friend (particularly one with the ability to be direct) to evaluate your posture. Better again, get a physiotherapist or other health professional to review your posture and give you an analysis of the muscles that are tight and weak<br></p>



<p>If the muscles in your upper back, neck and chest are so jaded from slouching that they won’t budge, you’ve got work to do. And in some cases, the damage is irreversible. But don’t let that dissuade you. There’s plenty you can do to improve your posture. And with each incremental improvement, you’ll notice a change in the rest of your body.<br></p>



<p>Remember that small changes make a big impact.<br></p>



<h2>How Posture Affects Breathing</h2>



<p>This is the one time a physiotherapist is going to ask you to slump and slouch(only if it is pain free). Now in this position try and breathe in.<br></p>



<p>How does it feel?</p>



<p>Hard to do a belly breath right?<br></p>



<p>Poor alignment in that slumped position means your diaphragm can’t descend easily making it hard to activate the posterior half of your diaphragm that attaches to your lower ribs and spine. Your body will want to get air in still so it can replenish its oxygen stores. To do that it has to recruit its back up breathing muscles around its neck and chest to help inhale, expanding the rib cage to get air travelling down into the lungs.<br></p>



<p>These neck muscles are not very efficient and are not designed to be used for the 17,000 breaths we take on average per day. They get tired, fatigued and we create muscle trigger points that can generate headaches, jaw and neck pain.<br></p>



<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232965660_Respiratory_feedback_in_the_generation_of_emotion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Research into breathing patterns and emotions</a>&nbsp;has also shown that when you adopt a slumped posture/breathing pattern you experience sadness. The powerful finding in this research is if you change your posture and breathing pattern you can change your emotion.<br></p>



<p>What if the world all knew how to breathe in a joy breathing pattern? What impact would that have on our conversations and relationships with others?<br></p>

<h2>How muscles affect our posture</h2>



<p>To understand how posture affects breathing we need to understand the difference between Postural and Phasic muscles<br></p>



<p><strong>Phasic muscles</strong>, consisting mostly of fast-twitch fibres are the primary movement muscles of the body.&nbsp;<strong>Phasic muscles</strong>&nbsp;generally come in pairs (biceps – triceps, quadriceps – hamstring) that work against each other (to control movement and stability).</p>



<p>The torso is where most of your postural muscles live and do their work.<br></p>



<p>Activating your postural muscles might sound difficult and there’s no denying that for the untrained and deconditioned muscles, it takes effort. But the rewards of proper postural muscle control are huge. Anyone that sits at a desk or uses a phone for long periods should pay close attention.<br></p>



<p>Our diaphragm is our main breathing muscle doing 80% of the work of relaxed breathing. It sits like a dome separating our lungs and abdominal cavity and has several key roles including respiration, stability and speech.<br></p>



<p>When we look at activating our core muscles the first step we need to be do is learn to breathe. Then our core cylinder, which includes transversus abdominis, multifidus, pelvic floor muscles and diaphragm, can activate to provide core&nbsp;<strong>postural alignment&nbsp;</strong>and support. But often breathing is the last thing we think about when it comes to finding optimal posture.<br></p>



<p>In the modern work environment, the body is required to recruit postural muscles more than phasic muscles. Sitting and slouching are not fast-twitch muscle activities. As a result, the&nbsp;<strong>phasic muscles begin turning off</strong>. Our nervous systems use them less and the connection breaks and the Cinderella Hypothesis is activated.<br></p>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28820662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">study from 2018</a>&nbsp;found that exercising and activating the deep muscles of the body significantly improved the body’s alignment but also i<strong>ncreased breathing capacity</strong>.<br></p>



<p>The breaths you take depend on the strength and coordination of the breathing muscles in the body. Like any muscle,&nbsp;breathing muscles need training too. For many of us in the office-work environment, deep muscles are not something we concern ourselves with. Sitting for long periods does not challenge the deep muscles of the body in a …</p></div></article></div>

are the ones who call me or use Signal because it's <em><strong>my</strong></em> main tool to
communicate. I just ditched the others.</p><p>How people use emails is the main subject of this article so let's focus on that
part.</p><p>I stumbled upon that <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/mailing-list-software-should-stop-spying-on-subscribers/">article</a> about mailing lists and the fact they are
spying on people including <a href="https://mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2019/07/superhuman-is-spying-on-you">tracking pixels</a>.</p><p>A term marketing people don't like but by definition :</p><blockquote><p>spy :</p><ol><li>One who secretly collects information concerning the enemies of a government or group.</li><li>One who secretly collects information for a business about one or more of its competitors.</li></ol></blockquote><p>That kind of things can't be done with a simple plain text email.</p><p>HTML in mails was and is still a thing that should be prohibited.</p><p>First, your MUA, a <em>Mail User Agent</em> or commonly known as a mail client, is not
a browser! Stop sending pictures in them or, at least, add them as attached
documents. I used to have an automatic reply in <a href="https://www.mutt.org/">mutt</a> for people sending
HTML saying something like :</p><blockquote><p>Please don't send emails in HTML format. It's bad and I won't reply to you!</p></blockquote><p>Second, people put images in their signature and then add these kinds of
messages :</p><blockquote><p>Please do not print this email unless it is necessary. Every unprinted email helps the environment.</p><p>Is it necessary to print this email? If you care about the environment like we do, please refrain from printing emails. It helps to keep the environment forested and litter-free.</p></blockquote><p>Adding a short message about ecology is great but why add images to your mails
is a bad idea ?</p><p>The carbon footprint of email are approximately something like :</p><ul><li>Spam email, even not opened : 0.3 CO2e</li><li>A proper email : 4g CO2e</li><li>An email with long attachment : 50g CO2e</li></ul><p>To put this into perspective, the carbon output of hitting “send” on 65 mails is
on par with driving an average-sized car a kilometre.</p><p>10 emails with big attachments are like burning 240g of coal.</p><p>The global carbon footprint from spam annually is equivalent to the greenhouse
gases pumped out by 3.1 million passenger cars using 7.6 billion litres (two
billion gallons) of gasoline in a year.</p><p>So please stop adding images or HTML in your emails. Period !</p><p>And my last point is about how people reply to emails and it connects to my last
argument.</p><p>My reference of choice is the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1855.txt">RFC-1855</a> also known as the Netiquette
describing how to write emails :</p><blockquote><p>Be brief without being overly terse. When replying to a message,
include enough original material to be understood but no more. It
is extremely bad form to simply reply to a message by including
all the previous message: edit out all the irrelevant material.</p></blockquote><p>and</p><blockquote><p>Watch cc's when replying. Don't continue to include
people if the messages have become a 2-way conversation.</p></blockquote><p>About signatures :</p><blockquote><p>If you include a signature keep it short. Rule of thumb
is no longer than 4 lines. Remember that many people pay for
connectivity by the minute, and the longer your message is,
the more they pay.</p></blockquote><p>That Netiquette or how to be polite has been lost over the years.</p><p>Everyone replies above all the previous mails and the worst part is all of them
are included in the current mail. I've seen emails over <strong>1000 lines</strong> just to
say <em>“Thank you”</em> and Cc:ed more than 20 persons.</p><p>That last part is quite a difficult habit to change for a lot of people.
Sometimes people tell me :</p><blockquote><p>- You sent me an empty email!</p><p>- No I didn't I just replied under your message stripping irrelevant parts.</p></blockquote><p>Doing it that way people reading the thread know exactly what the question was
and what you replied to.</p><p>When you reply above all the other messages, you waste time reading previous
emails because you just don't know what was the question and you need to figure
it out between 15 emails sent.</p><p>Microsoft, Gmail and all these new email clients are doing it <em><strong>WRONG</strong></em>. And that
should be known by people, so they can adjust and use email properly again.
Marketers, and their HTML emails, should just be banned from using a MUA.</p><p>Next time, you fire up an email ask yourself how your response could be well
better formatted and not harm the ecology adding big images to them… or HTML.</p><p><span><em>Day 43/100 - Just write and join in <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">100DaysToOffload</a>!</em></span></p><p><span><em>Photo credit : <a href="https://unsplash.com/@muukii">Muukii</a></em></span></p></article></div>]]>

<p>There’s a lot of confusion about “mobile phone data” on the web. In particular, GPS is <strong>not</strong> a stream that telcos have direct access to. Let’s review the main three data streams in a telco: CDRs, XDRs, and CPRs. Notice, importantly, that <strong>GPS is not one of the streams!</strong> More about this later.</p>



<h2>The three basic streams</h2>



<p>The first, called <strong>Call Detail Records</strong> (CDRs), is possibly the most common stream. They are “call” events, roughly who calls whom. It can be formalized roughly as \(\langle n_a, n_b, t_a, t_b, d, r\rangle\), where some device number \(a\) from some antenna \(t_a\) (i.e., some latitude and longitude pair) calls a device \(b\) in some other location (antenna) \(t_b\) at some time \(d\) with a duration (in minutes) \(r\). The second stream is usually called XDRs, and there is no common/shared interpretation of the letters in the acronym: we’ll call them <strong>eXtended Detail Records</strong>. This is the <em>data</em> stream, requesting data packets from the network. It can be formalized as the tuple \(\langle n, t, d, k\rangle\), where some number \(n\) requests some packet of size \(k\) from some antenna \(t\) at time \(d\). The difference with CDRs is that XDRs do not need a <em>callee</em>. It’s just the interaction between a device requesting a website, for example, and an antenna. This is less common a stream in the literature than the previous one, but we have used it successfully in a couple of our papers, see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-018-0157-5">here</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-017-0119-3">here</a> for more details. The final stream, the least well-known, is called <strong>Control Plane ?(Records</strong>), CPRs. CP is not a “human-initiated” stream. Unlike all events in CDRs (a device calling some other device), and most events in XDRs (someone requesting some data packet), events stored in CPRs are initiated by the mobile phone network itself, with almost no human intervention. Some of these events include the assignment of a new cell (antenna), the registering of the device in the network, no-hangup events, among many others. Supposing a set of CP events \(E=\{e_0, e_1, …, e_n\}\), a CPR can be formalized as a tuple \(\langle n, t, d, e_{i}\in E\rangle\), where like for XDRs, there is a device \(n\), an antenna \(t\), a date/time \(d\) and some code for an event \(e_i\) of the network.</p>



<p>Before moving on, one word about antennas. All the \(t\)’s mentioned above have a <em>fixed latitude and longitude</em>. They are the towers (that’s why the letter \(t\)) you see around the city, either on their own lots or on top of buildings, or sometimes as indoor cells within large buildings like hospitals and malls. This is our level of geographical granularity: the antenna. This is another interesting topic that I might come back to in the future (nothing is as simple as it sounds), but for now, suffice it to say that we cannot go more granular than the antenna, and even in those places where antenna density is high, the noise produced by connecting to those antennas means that antenna aggregation must be done either temporally (only recording antennas every <em>x</em> minutes) or spatially grouping them (every 1km2, for example, see our work on gender mobility <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-0500-x" target="_blank">here</a>). Below is a picture of towers in the Metro region of Santiago de Chile:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/leoferres.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sclbss-1.jpg?resize=402%2C506&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="402" height="506" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/leoferres.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sclbss-1.jpg?w=733&amp;ssl=1 733w, https://i1.wp.com/leoferres.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sclbss-1.jpg?resize=238%2C300&amp;ssl=1 238w" sizes="(max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Santiago Metropolitan Region largest contiguous urban area (black line) and all towers (red dots) by SubTel.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Let’s take a look at some temporal properties of the different streams. The figure below shows the activity of ~85 people. These were employees of the telco who allowed us to measure their phone activity over the course of two weeks (from September 23rd until October 7th). Several interesting things arise: 1) Most of the time, CDRs drop to zero during the nighttime, keeping us effectively blind during that period. XDRs are more or less at the same level of CDRs, but they keep stable 24/7, still dropping during nighttime evidencing some circadian rhythm. Still, interestingly, for these 85 devices, XDRs are more or less comparable to CDRs during the day in the level of activity (in the 100s of events). CP records are, in turn, an order of magnitude more granular in time (the y-axis of the graph is logarithmic). Notice that something happened to the XDR dataset on Sept 25, when there was some network (or event-persistance) issue, and then again on the CP we’re missing a whole day, the Oct 5. Things that happen when you work with real data… Notice also that there was no observable interruption of CP on Sept 25, signalling perhaps a drop in the number of packets being sent on the internet, probably, but no issue with the health of the mobile network <em>per se</em>. Finally, ALSO notice that <strong>this is all at the level of antennas</strong>… there is no way for us to go beyond that level of geographic granularity.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/leoferres.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stream_activity.png?resize=500%2C295&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="295" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/leoferres.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stream_activity.png?w=667&amp;ssl=1 667w, https://i2.wp.com/leoferres.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stream_activity.png?resize=300%2C177&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/leoferres.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stream_activity.png?resize=500%2C295&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Recorded activity for ~85 devices (used with consent, the users were employees of a telco) over the course of two weeks for the three different streams, CDR, XDR and CPRs.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Below’s another similar figure, except this time it’s not about activity (number of records) but rather the activity of those three streams for every device. That is, how many (unique) devices, of the 85 we had, had records at the different times of the day, also in a logarithmic scale. The important thing to notice is that for CDR and XDR (to different levels of course) you can see the circadian rhythm (CDRs, the blue line is showing this very strongly) while XDRs less so). CPRs, however, are mostly flat since the network does not really care whether the device’s owner is asleep or not, or if the device is connected to wifi or not at home, since it still needs to receive calls when one is placed. In similar words, the device is connected to the mobile phone network at all times (if such a network is available)</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/leoferres.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/user_activity.png?w=500&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/leoferres.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/user_activity.png?w=667&amp;ssl=1 667w, https://i1.wp.com/leoferres.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/user_activity.png?resize=300%2C177&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/leoferres.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/user_activity.png?resize=500%2C295&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Number of unique users with records at different times of the day</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Those are some properties of the streams that are available to Telco operators. Now, to the main point of this post, GPS is not one of them.</p>



<h2>GPS is not a (mobile network) stream!</h2>



<p>Not all telcos are the same, of course, and the architectures vary (sometimes widely) among telcos even in the same country. But they all have access to at least the streams above, whether they persist them in some database or not. Hower, GPS is different. The GPS engine is a feature of the phone, the device itself, not the telco. What is usually called “fine location” in Android is something that only apps can use (yeah, you go ahead and install FaceSwap…), the mobile phone network does not, to the best of my knowledge (at least surely not the telco I work with), possess the capability of accessing this information off of the device itself. Sure, the information does travel through the internet, most like anything else, and likely through XDR stream, but it can only be read by the app’s creator at the other end of the line, not by the telco. Of course, if a telco has an app, that’s obviously a different story. We, as researchers, don’t have access to it.</p>



<p>So <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html" target="_blank">when the New York Times</a>, for example, is talking about cellphone data, it doesn’t mean the streams that telcos have access to, it means GPS data that apps in cellphones re-transmit to the apps’ creators and that some other companies aggregate, or even the original apps’ creators make available such as the case of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/" target="_blank">Google Mobility Reports</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/geoinsights-portal/">Facebook’s GeoInsights</a>, which are indeed awesome tools (just not based on telephony data per se, but apps collecting GPS data).</p>



<p>It is important to me to keep both things separate: GPS is one thing, antenna-driven location is a very different one. In any case, here’s a video I uploaded a while back (in Spanish) to clear some of the concepts we use in our work, and it’s geared particularly to government officials and other decision-makers. Here it is, in Spanish, I’m afraid.</p>

</p><figcaption>Me, speaking about the streams in Spanish, with a blackboard. I love blackboards.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Please don’t hesitate to leave comments below and tell me of mistakes or ommisions I’m sure I’ve made. In particular, I’d be interested to know whether some telcos do have native access to GPS information… and how (!).</p>

		<div>

			
<p>Do you think writing a book in just 2 weeks is possible?</p>



<p>Well, I just finished and launched one. On my own and without any help.</p>



<p>To be fair, I did have some experience writing… Instagram captions. </p>



<p>Now, seriously. All (bad) jokes aside. I’ve liked writing since I was a teenager, so I’ve naturally written some stuff. I’ve written some short articles. I’ve written some cheesy poems. A couple of crappy songs too. But I wrote most of it a long time ago. And it was always occasional. I never had a writing habit. I had <strong>never </strong>written long-form content in my life either.</p>



<p>Yet I pulled it off. I wrote a real, 35-page-long book in just two weeks. And you know what? I think you <em>should</em> do it too.</p>



<h2>Why you <em>should </em>consider writing a book</h2>



<p>When I started working on my book, <strong><a href="https://gum.co/flyonyourown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fly On Your Own</a></strong>, my only goal was to help my younger brother. <a href="https://twitter.com/dbustac/status/1285055600393695232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I wanted to teach him a couple of things about making money online</a>. That was it.</p>



<p>Now, I realize that by writing the book I didn’t just help my brother, I helped myself too. A LOT:</p>



<ul><li>I created a writing habit</li><li>My writing is getting better thanks to the feedback I’m getting from people who read the book</li><li>I have a bunch of content that I can repurpose and post on my blog and social media  </li><li>I learned to do new things</li><li>I learned a ton about myself</li><li>I had a lot of fun </li></ul>



<p>In summary, I gained experience, I gained some skills, and I created something that hopefully will add value to my brother and even other people. And that has already created a lot of value for me. </p>



<p>That’s why I think you should write a book too – it’s a very entertaining and rewarding way to learn and improve yourself. Also, it’s a good way to start making money online. You can sell your book on <a href="https://gumroad.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gumroad </a>or <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon </a>and make some money out of it. </p>



<h2>The 7 things I learned</h2>



<p>As I mentioned before, writing Fly On Your Own was very instructive. It taught me a great deal about myself and about writing. After reflecting on my experience, I think these are the 7 key lessons I got (at least from a writing perspective):</p>



<h3> 1. You don’t need credentials </h3>



<p>There are a lot of myths about writing and publishing a book. The first one is that you need credentials.</p>



<p>You don’t need to be a “professional” writer. You don’t have to be an expert on a particular subject or field.You don’t need a publisher. </p>



<p>The only thing you need is to have something to say or teach. And I’m pretty sure you do.</p>



<h3>2. There’s something you know that other people would like to learn</h3>



<p>The same way I “knew” some things that my brother didn’t, there are things you know that other people probably don’t and would love to learn about. Maybe you <strong>take them for granted</strong>. But all your knowledge, skills, and experiences are valuable. They can help other people. Unfortunately, sometimes we don’t realize it. </p>



<p>Even if you’re just starting out and don’t have a lot of baggage, you can still write about other people’s ideas and experiences. You can curate, explain and simplify things from your own perspective. That can be super valuable too. </p>



<p>It doesn’t matter that other people know what you know or have written about the same topic. That will always be the case. So don’t get discouraged by that. Don’t aim to be original, aim to be unique. </p>



<h3>3. You don’t need to be a “talented” writer</h3>



<p> If you can write a tweet or a text message, you are talented enough to write a book. </p>



<p>What matters is that you’re <strong>concise, clear and direct</strong>. Make sure you use simple, common words most of the time. Keep your sentences and paragraphs short. Avoid using passive voice. </p>



<p>Your goal is to get people to understand your message as fast and effortlessly as possible. And that’s how you do it.</p>



<h3>4. You need a deadline</h3>



<p>The only reason why I finished the book in 2 weeks is because I had a <strong>public</strong> <strong>deadline</strong>. </p>



<p>I tweeted that I was going to do it the same day I started working on it. I told some close friends too.</p>



<p>Believe it or not, that forced me to stick to my word. I didn’t care that it was only a few people who knew about it. That was enough to make me want to keep my promise.</p>



<h3>5. You need to manage your time and your attention</h3>



<p>If you want to stick to your word and your deadline, then you’ll need to get in <strong>production mode.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll need to reduce your inputs and increase your outputs. Put another way, you’ll need to <strong>produce more than you consume</strong>. </p>



<p>Set aside time to work, limit your distractions and make sure you <strong>actually do </strong>the work. Simple as that.</p>



<h3>6. You need an outline</h3>



<p>An outline is a list of topics or points you want to touch on the book and each chapter. It’s your structure. Your framework. </p>



<p>Although writing an outline will probably feel like hard work at first, it will make the whole process smooth and easy later on. </p>



<p>You won’t spend hours staring at the blank page trying to figure out what to say. You already know what you want to say. Because you already did the heavy lifting.</p>



<h3>7. You need immediate feedback</h3>



<p>In a way, writing a book is like building a product for a startup. </p>



<p>It’s not a good idea to wait until your book is 100% ready to start getting feedback. You should seek constant feedback from the beginning. </p>



<p>Ask somebody close to you to read all your drafts as you write them. Don’t ask them to judge for aesthetics or style, though. Ask them to judge the <strong>clarity </strong>of your writing. You want to make sure you’re being concise, clear and direct, remember? </p>



<p>Make sure your message is being delivered <strong>quickly and painlessly.</strong></p>



<h2>Wrapping up</h2>



<p>Thanks to this experience, I realized how much you can get done and learn in very little time when you focus and do the work. Likewise, I realized how powerful and underrated is experimentation as a learning strategy. </p>



<p>There’s a famous Bill Gates’ quote that goes:&nbsp;“<em>Most&nbsp;people overestimate what they can do in one year&nbsp;and&nbsp;underestimate what they can do&nbsp;in ten&nbsp;years.</em>”</p>



<p>But now I see there’s another side to this: Sometimes <strong>people underestimate what they can do in two weeks</strong> and <strong>overestimate what they can do in two months.</strong></p>



<p>I hope this post inspires you to start writing your own book, and that my insights can help make your process easier. </p>



<p>If you have any questions or just want to say hi, <a href="https://twitter.com/dbustac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reach out to me on Twitter</a>. I’d love to hear from you!</p>

<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Why has peat become so popular?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Using peat within the gardening industry has been the norm for decades. However, only for the last twenty years have the issues surrounding peat consumption been recognised.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Peat has become popular in the gardening world because it retains, and contains natural nutrients, due to the presence of partially decomposed plant material. Peat is also great at holding water, these two combined give plants a great start, with minimal effort. Making it very popular with amateur gardeners. Peat-free compost suppliers cannot compete on price, as making a successful peat-free compost requires more time and processing. Peat-free alternatives can include coir, green compost, wood fibre, and composted bark.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Why is using products containing peat bad for the environment?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unless your compost is clearly labelled peat-free, most composts contain a whopping 50-70% peat!</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Peat that is commonly used in compost is mainly derived from peat bogs. Peat bogs are one of the most important carbon stores, often referred to as carbon sinks. When peat is removed, this quickly releases a large volume of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming.</span></p>
<h4><span><strong>As a carbon store peat holds&nbsp;more carbon than the combined forests of Britain, France, and Germany!!</strong></span></h4>
<p><img alt="Peat harvesting on the Isle of Skye, Scotland." src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0265/7871/4670/files/Peat_mining_2.jpg?v=1592163499"></p>
<p><em>Peat mining on the Isle of Skye, Scotland.</em></p>
<p>These natural peat bogs are being destroyed to keep up with high consumer demand, this has resulted in 94% of the UK’s peat bogs being destroyed. Just 6000 hectares remain untouched.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">62% of our peat now has to be flown in from other countries, as the UK’s supply has dwindled. Flying peat in from Ireland and the Baltic States results in even more carbon being released into the atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Peat bogs are home to many plant and wildlife species that can only survive in the unique environment the peat bogs provide. Mining the bogs for peat destroys their habitats, and threatens the lives of hundreds of species.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><em>Stacks of peat, recently harvested, ready to be sold to the UK market.&nbsp;</em></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Why gardeners have been reluctant to change to peat-free</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We are creatures of habit, many gardeners will use compost they have used for years, so they know it is both reliable and works well. Some gardeners also tend to buy the lowest priced compost, this is not usually peat-free. Peat free composts also had a bad reputation up until recently, now they are recognised to be just as good. A&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Which?</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;Survey found that peat-free composts performed better than peat-based rivals in the growing of potted plants and potatoes.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Why we are peat-free here at Seed n Sow</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Here at Seed n Sow, we pride ourselves on being an environmentally friendly company, we don’t want to cause any unnecessary damage to the earth. That’s why we only give our customers organic, peat-free compost with our <a href="https://seednsow.co.uk/collections/all-in-one-seed-kits" title="All In One" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">All In One </a>and <a href="https://seednsow.co.uk/collections/signature-seeds-kits" target="_blank" title="Seed n Sow Signature" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seed n Sow Signature</a> Seed Kits! Our biodegradable seed tray and pots are also peat-free, they are made from 100% fibre, whereas many biodegradable trays and pots&nbsp;available to purchase elsewhere are made up of mostly peat!</span></p>
<h4><span><strong>The government has set out to eliminate all peat use by all gardeners, growers, and procurers by 2030, by switching to peat-free alternatives!</strong></span></h4>
<h2>&nbsp;<span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">But what can you do?</span></strong>
</h2>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Be sure to check that any compost you buy has as little peat in as possible, or even better, completely peat-free.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Make your own compost to improve your soil, instead of relying on peat-based options. Look out for our blog post on how to make your own compost!</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Recycle used compost from pots.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When buying potted plants be sure to check they have been grown in peat-free compost.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Reuse any plant pots you already own. If you purchase any biodegradable seed trays and pots make sure they are peat-free.</span>&nbsp;</li>

    <p><img src="https://blog.atkinson.cloud/posts/2020/08/testing_our_way_out/covid19.jpeg"></p><p>We are now approximately 5 months into the sars-cov-2 / covid19 pandemic in the US. Remember when we were a few days
in and we all nodded our heads that after a few weeks of this, we’d be able to get back to “normal”? Well, clearly
we are still far from normal with no end in sight. Let’s take stock of where we are right now.</p>

<ol>
<li>After an initial spike in the northeast (especially New York City), we now see the south and southwestern parts of
the country with high caseloads and mortality.<br></li>
<li>Therapy has improved, especially with proning and steroid use in the ICU. This has brought the death rate down.<br></li>
<li>There are over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html" target="_blank">130 vaccines</a>
currently being developed, mostly against the spike protein. This protein is the key for entrance into the cells via binding to the ACE2 receptor, but it is still not proven to be the best immunologic target for vaccines (fingers crossed).<br></li>
<li>The US and other governments around the world have already spent billions of dollars on some of the leading
candidate vaccines prior to their full-testing.<br></li>
<li>All economies have been hit hard by the pandemic so far. Deficit spending and unemployment numbers are through the
roof while GDP estimates have taken a nose-dive.</li>
</ol>

<p>While this vaccine promises to be the fastest ever developed, I think that in the best-case scenario, we still have
about a year before widespread production and distribution. What are we supposed to do in the meantime?</p>

<p>The only reasonable way forward is through <strong>rapid and inexpensive daily testing</strong>.</p>

<p>Yes, it sounds kind of crazy, but there are many groups working on simple tests which could be done in schools and
workplaces. <a href="https://www.stopcovid.science/" target="_blank">This group at MIT</a> has caught my eye. The “STOPCovid” white
paper is worth a read, but in summary, they claim to have a working technique wherein a nasal swab or saliva sample is
a) lysed to release RNA, b) RNA is reverse transcribed into DNA with a special tag, and finally c) the sample
is read visually like a pregnancy test. Sensitivity and specificity in intial tests are incredble at 97% and 100%
respectively. Finally, this test can be performed in about an hour and the group claims a preliminary cost of only
<strong>$10 USD per test</strong>.</p>

<p>If this or other rapid tests can be deployed and used daily (or at the very least every few days) on our entire
population, we can stop the spread of this insidious infection and open our economies again. Kids can go back to
school. Restaurants can increase customer volume. Elderly family members can safely reunite with their children
and grandchildren.</p>

<p><strong>The only way we can responsibly relax our restrictive social distancing policies is
with rapid and constant testing.</strong> I see no other way to proceed as we wait on a vaccine.</p>

    <p>I am planning to create a series of blog posts that includes some literature research, implementation of various data structures and our journey of creating a distributed datastore in <a href="https://distrentic.io/">distrentic.io</a>.</p>

<p>You might be wondering why I start with a blog post explaining the Bloom Filter while I don’t have single clue about how to create a distributed datastore? My answer is simple: “I like the idea behind it”.</p>

<hr>

<p>Before I get into the details of the Bloom filters, I want to give our backstory that will help you understand <strong>why we started building something we’d enjoy during our spare time that will never be production ready</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="the-backstory">The backstory</h4>

<p>My friend Ibrahim and I are always fascinated by complex software and distibuted systems - We’ve been working together more than 5 years (we got old dude) and we were  lucky enough to work for the largest e-commerce company in Europe. We battled our way solving many different problems that distributed systems can offer. We both moved to Cambridge, UK and still fighting against distributed world villains.</p>

<hr>

<p>Let’s explore the mystic land of probabilistic data structures by implementing a Bloom Filter.</p>

<h2 id="what-the-hell-is-a-bloom-filter">What the hell is a Bloom Filter</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>You might also want to read <a href="https://gopiandcode.uk/logs/log-bloomfilters-debunked.html">Bloom filters debunked</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A Bloom filter is a method for representing a set $A = {a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n}$ of n elements (also called keys) to support membership queries. It was invented by <strong>Burton Bloom</strong> in 1970 and was proposed for use in the web context by Marais and Bharat as a mechanism for identifying which pages have associated comments stored within a <em>CommonKnowledge</em> server. <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>It is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to answer a very simple question: <strong>is this element a member of a set?</strong>. A Bloom filter does not store the actual elements, it only stores the <strong>membership</strong> of them.</p>

<p>False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not – in other words, a query returns either “possibly in set” or “definitely not in set”. <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Unfortunately, this also means <strong>items cannot be removed from the Bloom Filter</strong> (Some other element or group of elements may be hashed to the same indices).</p>

<p>Because of its nature of being probabilistic, the Bloom Filter trades space and performance for accuracy. This is much like the CAP theorem, we choose performance over accuracy.</p>

<p>Bloom filters have some interesting use cases. For example, they can be placed on top of a datastore. When a key is queried for its existence and the filter does not have it, we can skip querying the datastore entirely.</p>

<p><img src="https://onatm.dev/assets/images/bloom_filter_example.png" alt="Example usage of a Bloom filter">
Figure 1: Example usage of a Bloom filter.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work</h3>

<p>The idea behind Bloom filter is very simple: Allocate an array $v$ of $m$ bits, each bit in the array is initially set to $0$, and then choose $k$ independent hash functions $h_1, h_2, …, h_k$, each with range ${1,…,m}$.</p>

<p>The Bloom filter has two operations just like a standard set:</p>

<h4 id="insertion">Insertion</h4>

<p>When an element $a \in A$ is added to the filter, the bits at positions $h_1(a), h_2(a), …, h_k(a)$ in $v$ are set to $1$. In simpler words, the new element is hashed by $k$ number of functions and modded by $m$, resulting in $k$ indices into the bit array. Each bit at the respective index is set.</p>

<p><img src="https://onatm.dev/assets/images/bloom_filter_add.png" alt="Adding elements to a Bloom filter">
Figure 2: Adding elements to a Bloom filter ($m = 10$, $k = 3$).</p>

<h4 id="query">Query</h4>

<p>To query the membership of an element $b$, we check the bits at indices $h_1(b), h_2(b), …, h_k(b)$ in $v$. If any of them is $0$, then certainly $b$ is not in the set $A$. Otherwise, we assume that $b$ is in the set although it’s possible that some other element or group of elements hashed to the same indices. This is called a <strong>false positive</strong>. We can target a specific probability of false positives by selecting an optimal value of $m$ and $k$ for up to $n$ insertions.</p>

<hr>

<p>A Bloom filter eventually reaches a point where all bits are set, which means every query will indicate membership, effectively making the probability of false positives $1$. The problem with this is it requires a priori knowledge of the data set in order to select optimal parameters and avoid “overfilling”. <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="finding-optimal-k-and-m">Finding optimal $k$ and $m$</h3>

<p>We can derive optimal $k$ and $m$ based on $n$ and a chosen probability of false positives $P_{FP}$.</p><p>

\[k = -\frac{\ln{P_{FP}}}{\ln{2}}
,
m = -\frac{n\ln{P_{FP}}}{(\ln2)^2}\]

</p><p>If you want to learn about how the above formulae are derived, you might want to pay a visit <a href="https://sagi.io/bloom-filters-for-the-perplexed/#appendix">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="rust-implementation">Rust implementation</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can find the full implementation <a href="https://github.com/distrentic/plum">here</a>.
Huge thanks to <a href="https://github.com/xfix">@xfix</a> for <a href="https://github.com/distrentic/plum/pull/1">fixing <code>hashers</code> initialization with the same seed</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dkales">@dkales</a> for spotting <a href="https://github.com/distrentic/plum/issues/2">an issue with the ordering of operations in index calculation</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally! It is time to write some <code>rust</code> <img title=":heart_eyes:" alt=":heart_eyes:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f60d.png" height="20" width="20">. I am simultaneously implementing the bloom filter whilst writing this blog post. If you don’t believe me then check the below command:</p>



<p>Let’s continue with the dependencies. There is only one dependency and we will use it to create $v$.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[dependencies]</span>
<span>bit-vec</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.6"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We will declare a new <code>struct</code> <code>StandardBloomFilter</code> to encapsulate required fields $k$ (optimal number of hash functions), $m$ (optimal size of the bit array), $v$ (the bit array), hash functions and a marker to tell rust compiler that our <code>struct</code> “owns” a <code>T</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>extern</span> <span>crate</span> <span>bit_vec</span><span>;</span>

<span>use</span> <span>bit_vec</span><span>::</span><span>BitVec</span><span>;</span>

<span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>marker</span><span>::</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>StandardBloomFilter</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>?</span><span>Sized</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Careful readers will think that I made a mistake in the declaration of <code>hashers</code> array because of the requirement of $k$ independent hash functions. It was indeed intentional here’s why:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Why two hash functions?</strong> Kirsch and Mitzenmacher demonstrated in their paper that using two hash functions $h_1(x)$ and $h_2(x)$ to simulate additional hash functions of the form $g_i(x) = h_1(x) + {i}{h_2(x)}$ can be usefully applied to Bloom filters. This leads to less computation and potentially less need for randomness in practice. <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> This formula may appear similar to the use of pairwise indenpendent hash functions. Unfortunately, there is no formal connection between the two techniques.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mentioned earlier that the Bloom Filter has two operations like a standard set: insert and query. We will implement those two operations along with constructor-like <code>new</code> method.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>?</span><span>Sized</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>StandardBloomFilter</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<p><code>new</code> calculates the size of the <code>bitmap</code> ($v$) and <code>optimal_k</code> ($k$) and then instantiates a <code>StandardBloomFilter</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s run these calculations on <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=f83331e5f3fa5be8ec52545d03afa00f">Rust Playground</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bitmap_size: 9585059

<p>This looks really promising! A Bloom Filter that represents a set of $1$ million items with a false-positive rate of $0.01$ requires only $9585059$ bits ($~1.14\mathrm{MB}$)  and 7 hash functions.</p>

<p>We managed to construct a Bloom Filter so far and it is time to implement <code>insert</code> and <code>contains</code> methods. Their implementations are dead simple and they share the same code to calculate indexes of the bit array.</p>

<p>The above methods depend on two other methods that we haven’t implemented yet: <code>hash_kernel</code> and <code>get_index</code>. <code>hash_kernel</code> is going to be the one where the actual “hashing” happens. It will return the hash values of $h_1(x)$ and $h_2(x)$.</p>

<p>We could’ve used $128$ bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash#MurmurHash3">MurmurHash3</a> and returned upper $64$ bit as <code>hash1</code> and the lower as <code>hash2</code> but to keep this implementation even simpler (this is how <a href="https://github.com/google/guava/blob/master/guava/src/com/google/common/hash/BloomFilterStrategies.java">Google Guava Bloom Filter implementation</a> currently works) and not to rely on any other additional dependencies I decided to continue with <code>DefaultHasher</code> - see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SipHash">SipHash</a></p>

<p>Now, it is time to make the final touch. We are going to implement <code>get_index</code> by using $g_i(x) = h_1(x) + {i}{h_2(x)}$ to simulate more than two hash functions.</p>

<p><em><u>Last Update</u>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">2020-08-09</a></em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I started asking, “What are the important problems of your field?” And after a week or so, “What important problems are you working on?” And after some more time, I came in one day and said, “If what you are doing is not important, and if you don’t think it is going to lead to something important, why are you (at Bell Labs) working on it?” I wasn’t welcomed after that; I had to find somebody else to eat with! — Richard Hamming, You and your research</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What grand challenges do we need to solve to push robotics (and AI) forward? When I thought hard about this question, I realized that I didn’t have a good answer. I’m actually not sure why I never asked myself this question before. Perhaps I’d converged to the “stationary distribution” of traversing only “relevant” research questions. Or maybe it’s a function of the sheer diversity in the different fields of inquiry that robotics supports. This coupled with the fast pace of the field makes it hard to identify key challenges and track progress. Nonetheless, I believe this is an important question to reflect on, not just for personal gratification, but more importantly, to understand how research contributions in one field can ripple across the space of research and affect questions in another field.</p>

<p>I expect this to be a living (and evolving) document as I distill information to reach a clearer understanding. For now, I’m bootstrapping most of the content from [1] and also using the paper as a scaffolding for organization. However, I expect the structure and content of this post to evolve as I read, synthesize, and figure out potentially better ways to organize the information.</p>

<p>While providing links to references + further reading, I’ve made the conscious decision of linking to sources with a high “fan-out”, to enable an easy launching point to read about further research.</p>

<p>I’d <a href="https://twitter.com/bhaprayan">appreciate suggestions</a> on content to add, general feedback, and comments!</p>

<li>data processing and dealing with artifacts of non-cerebral origin (especially for wearable approaches)</li>
<li>cortex folding differs between individuals, as do relevant functional maps</li>

<p><em>Goal:</em> to allow simpler, less expensive, modular units to be reconfigured into a team depending on the task that needs to be performed while being as effective as a larger, task-specific, monolithic robot.</p>

<p><em>Challenges:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>develop stochastic models for predicting collective behavior in large scale swarms (since interactions between individuals grow combinatorially)</p>

<ul>
<li>we lack models of flock/herd-like groups that elude enumeration in small scale groups yet do not justify ensemble-averaged models seen in large scale swarms</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>no systematic approach to designing multidimensional perception-action-communication feedback loops across large groups</p></li>

</ul></li>

<li><p>space robots</p>

<ul>
<li>long latency + low bandwidth reduces productivity and puts the survival of the robot at risk</li>

<p>The <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html">Random Forest Classifier</a> and <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html">Random Forest Regressor</a> have default hyper-parameters:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>max_depth=None</code>,</li>
  <li><code>min_samples_split=2</code>,</li>
  <li><code>min_samples_leaf=1</code>,</li>
</ul>

<p>which means that full trees are built. Bulding full trees is by design (see Leo Breiman, <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/randomforest2001.pdf">Random Forests</a> article from 2001). The Random Forest creates full trees to fit the data well. If there will be one tree in the Random Forest, then the model will overfit the data. However, in the Random Forest there are created set of trees (for example 100 trees). To overcome the overfitting (and increase stability) the bagging and random subspace sampling are used. (<strong>Bagging</strong> - selecting subset of rows for training, <strong>random subspace sampling</strong> - selecting subset of columns in each node split search).</p>

<p>In the case of large data sets or complex datasets, the full tree can be really deep and have thousands of nodes. 
Such single decision tree will use a lot of memory and thus the memory consumption of the Random Forest will grow very fast. In this post I will show how to reduce memory consumption of the Random Forest. In the example I will use <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset">Adult Income dataset</a>.</p>

<p>Our dataset size was <code>3.8</code> MB so the resulting Random Forest is about <code>13</code> times larger than the dataset!

<h2 id="reduce-memory-usage-of-the-scikit-learn-random-forest">Reduce memory usage of the Scikit-Learn Random Forest</h2>

<p>The memory usage of the Random Forest depends on the size of a single tree and number of trees. The most straight forward way to reduce memory consumption will be to reduce the number of trees. For example <code>10</code> trees will use <code>10</code> times less memory than <code>100</code> trees. However, the more trees in the Random Forest the better for performance and I will search for other hyper-parameters to control the Random Forest size.</p>

<p>The simplest way to reduce the memory consumption is to limit the depth of the tree. Shallow trees will use less memory. Let’s train shallow Random Forest with <code>max_depth=6</code> (keep number of trees as default <code>100</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>shallow_rf</span> <span>=</span> <span>RandomForestClassifier</span><span>(</span><span>max_depth</span><span>=</span><span>6</span><span>)</span>
<span>shallow_rf</span><span>.</span><span>fit</span><span>(</span><span>X_train</span><span>,</span> <span>y_train</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s save the shallow Decision Tree to the disk:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>joblib</span><span>.</span><span>dump</span><span>(</span><span>shallow_rf</span><span>.</span><span>estimators_</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>"first_tree_from_shallow_RF.joblib"</span><span>)</span> 
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"Single tree size from shallow RF: {np.round(os.path.getsize('first_tree_from_shallow_RF.joblib') / 1024 / 1024, 2) } MB"</span><span>)</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>Single</span> <span>tree</span> <span>size</span> <span>from</span> <span>shallow</span> <span>RF</span><span>:</span> <span>0.01</span> <span>MB</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You see, the full single tree size was: <code>0.52</code> MB while the shallow tree size is <code>0.01</code> MB. Let’s save the whole forest:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>joblib</span><span>.</span><span>dump</span><span>(</span><span>shallow_rf</span><span>,</span> <span>"Shallow_RandomForest_100_trees.joblib"</span><span>)</span> 
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"Shallow Random Forest size: {np.round(os.path.getsize('Shallow_RandomForest_100_trees.joblib') / 1024 / 1024, 2) } MB"</span><span>)</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>Shallow</span> <span>Random</span> <span>Forest</span> <span>size</span><span>:</span> <span>0.75</span> <span>MB</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The Random Forest with full trees has size <code>49.67</code> MB and the shallow Random Forest size is <code>0.75</code> MB so <code>66</code> times less!</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>49.67</span> <span>/</span> <span>0.75</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>66.22666666666667</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s check the performance of such shallow tree:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>y_predicted</span> <span>=</span> <span>shallow_rf</span><span>.</span><span>predict_proba</span><span>(</span><span>X_test</span><span>)</span>
<span>shallow_rf_loss</span> <span>=</span> <span>log_loss</span><span>(</span><span>y_test</span><span>,</span> <span>y_predicted</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>shallow_rf_loss</span><span>)</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>0.33017571925200956</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The perfomance is better! The shallow Random Forest has about <code>4%</code> better logloss (the lower value the better). So we reduced the size of Random Forest by <code>66</code> times and increase the perfomance! :-)</p>

<p>The shallow trees can be also obtained by tuning <code>min_samples_split</code> or <code>min_samples_leaf</code> (or even other hyper-parameters, like: <code>min_weight_fraction_leaf</code>, <code>max_features</code>, <code>max_leaf_nodes</code>). However, I prefer to tune <code>max_depth</code> because it is more intuitive.</p>

<h2 id="extra-tip-for-saving-the-scikit-learn-random-forest-in-python">Extra tip for saving the Scikit-Learn Random Forest in Python</h2>

<p>While saving the scikit-learn Random Forest with joblib you can use <code>compress</code> parameter to save the disk space. In the joblib <a href="https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/joblib.dump.html">docs</a> there is information that <code>compress=3</code> is a good compromise between size and speed. Example below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>joblib</span><span>.</span><span>dump</span><span>(</span><span>rf</span><span>,</span> <span>"RF_uncompressed.joblib"</span><span>,</span> <span>compress</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>)</span> 
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"Uncompressed Random Forest: {np.round(os.path.getsize('RF_uncompressed.joblib') / 1024 / 1024, 2) } MB"</span><span>)</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>Uncompressed</span> <span>Random</span> <span>Forest</span><span>:</span> <span>49.67</span> <span>MB</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>joblib</span><span>.</span><span>dump</span><span>(</span><span>rf</span><span>,</span> <span>"RF_compressed.joblib"</span><span>,</span> <span>compress</span><span>=</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>  <span># compression is ON!</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"Compressed Random Forest: {np.round(os.path.getsize('RF_compressed.joblib') / 1024 / 1024, 2) } MB"</span><span>)</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>Compressed</span> <span>Random</span> <span>Forest</span><span>:</span> <span>8.3</span> <span>MB</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>np</span><span>.</span><span>round</span><span>(</span><span>49.67</span> <span>/</span> <span>8.3</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>5.98</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Compressed Random Forest is <code>6</code> times smaller!</p>

<p>The same obervation about memory consumption should be valid for <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier.html"><code>Extra Trees Classifier</code></a> and <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTreesRegressor.html"><code>Extra Trees Regressor</code></a>.</p>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-118572e2a50dd046ebbf"><div><p><strong>Why Seth?</strong></p><p><a href="https://seths.blog/">Seth Godin</a> is an American marketer that I came across in my mid-20’s when I was directionless and unsure of where I wanted to take my business (and life). Seth’s contention is simple, we’re all marketers we just don’t know it. Marketing is the ability to move someone to act, not the sleezy getting someone to buy something they don’t want stereotype of Mad Men. </p><p>Marketing is in our DNA. We are constantly being marketed to or marketing to others: Do you want an extra large latte this morning? You gotta take a 10% pay cut to keep your job, what do you want to do? Will you marry me? Can I get an extension on my essay assignment? Seth helps you see marketing from 30,000 feet for what it is and then zooms into the dirt to show you how its done in a digital age. </p><p>While it took me over five years to get the most out of Seth Godin’s work, my goal here is to take the insights it took me five years to come to and put it into one spot so you don’t have to. Hence, the article’s title: The Seth Godin Encyclopedia. </p><p><strong>Table of Contents:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Why Seth Godin?</p></li><li><p>Why Marketing?</p></li><li><p>Why Now?</p></li><li><p>10.5 Ideas from Seth Godin that Changed My Life</p></li><li><p>My Top Five Seth Godin Books W/ Notes</p></li><li><p>25 Quotes to Reboot Your Marketing by Seth Godin</p></li><li><p>Treasure Trove of Videos/Ted Talks/Podcasts/Articles Featuring Seth</p></li></ul><p><strong>Why Marketing?</strong></p><p>The ability to ethically move others to take action through storytelling is marketing. And, good marketing has helped me experience success as a U.S. Peace Corps Ukraine Volunteer, teacher for over 9 years, build a successful 6-figure private coaching business, helped me meet all my NFL heroes growing up as a kid, talk to interesting people on my podcast and convince my wife to marry me (or take enough pity on me to do so). </p><p>Any meaningful thing you seek to do in life will involve people who have the power to say yes or no to your dreams. Knowing how to weave a story that moves them to support your dreams is crucial. Knowing how to create a product that is part of a bigger mission is crucial. Knowing how to convince others of your ability to do what your resume or business says it can do is crucial. </p><p>You’ve <em>already</em> been marketing your whole life. The first time you let out a wail as a newborn you were moving others around you to act on your behalf to fulfill your dream of needing to feel safety, security and warmth was marketing. All those times you deflected your parents’ fury onto your brothers instead of yourself was marketing. Persuading your girlfriend to say yes to your proposal was marketing. </p><p>The question becomes, do you want to get <em>even </em>better at it? </p><p>Seth shows you how. Enjoy. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596135828412_21883"><div><h4>10.5 Ideas From Seth Godin That Changed My Life</h4><p><strong>Idea #1: Ship</strong></p><p>Shipping is what creators do. At some point, you need to hit post, hit send or click upload to open your work up to be received or be rejected by your market. Rejection stings. We’ve been conditioned by school to avoid rejection at all costs. Yet, if you don’t ship, if you don’t hit send, you’ll never know what the market wants. Instead of seeing shipping as a win-lose binary experiment, you need to see it as a win-win: It’s a win when the market rejects me because now I am wiser at knowing what doesn’t work. It’s a win when the market accepts it because now I know what to do more of. Shipping is really just a different way of seeing risk. You need to take some. </p><blockquote><p><strong>The only thing shipping will cost you is little time and all of your ego. </strong></p></blockquote><p><strong>Idea #2: Wine Glasses</strong></p><p>In his book <a href="https://amzn.to/2X8W4Bx"><em>All Marketers Are Liars (Tell Stories)</em></a> Seth talks about a company that makes glasses shaped especially to bring out the most flavor from Chardonnay versus Merlot and so on. Yet, in double blind taste tests there is no correlation between flavor and the type of glassware used. Did that kill this business? Absolutely not. In fact, they are doing quite well. Their clients only bought <em>more</em> of these glasses. People want to believe stories they have about themselves. In this case, customers want to believe they are sophisticated wine-drinkers and this company’s product helps them believe it (even though it isn’t true scientifically). <br></p><blockquote><p><strong>People buy products that confirm the story they </strong><span><strong>want</strong></span><strong> to believe about themselves. </strong></p></blockquote><p><strong>Idea #3: Milk Cartons </strong></p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596193917055_25021"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596193917055_25309"><div><p>Attention is economic oxygen and getting it is trickier than ever. That’s why your business needs a purple cow - something remarkable that people cannot help <em>but</em> share with their friends. When Seth’s book <a href="https://amzn.to/3jRhzQW"><em>Purple Cow</em></a> came out, the first 5,000 copies of it actually came in a purple milk carton container. People loved this so much that they placed the empty purple milk carton on their desks. Of course, others would ask what this odd thing was and then his book would be shared even more. Seth made no money on the cartons, but he did make a ruckus. Your business would be much better off experimenting with the blurry line between absurd and remarkable to gain people’s attention than paying Facebook for ineffective advertisements. </p><blockquote><p><strong>If your message isn’t remarkable, it won’t be shared.</strong></p></blockquote><p><strong>Idea #4: Not For Everyone</strong></p><div><p>What you offer can’t be for everyone and it shouldn’t be. Mass marketing, mass business and mass production all died with the advent of the internet. No one is going to out-Amazon Amazon at driving prices into the ground, so your best bet is to go in the opposite direction: specializing. All you need is a small nucleus of ten or so clients to determine if what you have to offer is ultimately going to be profitable or not. And, if what you have to offer isn’t <em>for</em> someone that’s OK. Rejection is a win because someone found your business compelling enough that they felt the need to trash it! Did Hillary try to win over conservatives? Did Trump try to win over liberals? No. Both sides highly targeted their campaigning to the 5% of the US population that was undecided and could sway the vote. See <a href="https://amzn.to/2Xv0K51"><em>We Are All Weird</em></a><em> </em>for more of Seth’s take on niche. </p></div><blockquote><p><strong>A business for everyone is ultimately a business for no one. </strong></p></blockquote><p><strong>Idea #5: Quitting is OK</strong></p><div><p><a href="https://amzn.to/2Xeshas"><em>The Dip</em></a> was Seth Godin’s look at something society treats as a taboo: quitting. The premise is simple - if you' can’t be best in the world at something, quit. <strong>But, best in world doesn’t mean best out of 8 billion people, it means out of someone’s perceived market.</strong> You might not be the best football coach in America, but you are certainly the best one in your town so you receive a steady stream of private clients. You might not be the best tap dancer in the world, but you are the best tap dancer at a certain style of Vaudeville tap that no one else can teach. I think the irony of <a href="https://amzn.to/2Xeshas"><em>The Dip</em></a> is that it’s not really a book about quitting so much as a call imploring people to get hyper focused on the market they are trying to be best in the world at. </p></div><blockquote><p><strong>Get hyper focused on defining your “best in the world”. </strong></p></blockquote><p><strong>Idea #6: Positioning &gt; Product</strong></p><div><p>This is something I took away from Seth’s <a href="https://themarketingseminar.com/"><em>The Marketing Seminar</em> on Akimbo,</a> which I highly recommend you check out. Positioning is simply finding a hole in the market and placing your product/service as the thing to fill it. Volvo did this in the car market by finding that there was no company trying to dominate the luxury-safety market. So, Volvo is now positioned as the safest luxury vehicle in the market today. Tesla stayed in the luxury category, but went for electric saying “it’s kinda like an electric Mercedes”. Ford, still occupies the American-made + blue collar + everyday man vehicle market. Find all the various attributes that exist in your market place and see which combinations of these attributes your company can combine to create its own monopoly in a unique market.</p></div><blockquote><div><p><strong>Position yourself into a corner of the market where no one else is. </strong></p></div></blockquote><p><strong>Idea #7: What if you had to charge 10x for your product, how would you justify it?</strong></p><div><p>One of the biggest things I struggled the most with early on with my business was figuring out how to price myself. Most business owners when they begin drastically under price themselves. When you charge higher prices, you raise the stakes for your customers, attract more serious ones, and you also have an opportunity to prove that you are now worth the price you just charged.  Price, if it is part of the internal story of your customer that they want to believe about themselves, can be just as much as part of the value proposition of your service or product as the service or product itself. Price, weirdly, can actually make people feel better about themselves. </p></div><blockquote><p><strong>Price is a story.</strong></p></blockquote><p><strong>Idea #8: Locks Vs. Keys</strong></p><div><p>You can want your business to be so successful so badly that you struggle to even be good. That’s probably because you confused your product’s importance for your customer’s importance. You built a product to solve a very specific problem that you’ve labored day and night over, but now, once you introduce it to the world, no one wants it. Why? You treated your product as more important than your people. You build a key before you found a lock for it. Now you find yourself scrambling to retrofit a person to your product. Reverse your process: find the lock first, find the people try to break it open and then design them a key. </p></div><blockquote><p><strong>Find the lock. Find the people. Then, create your key. </strong></p></blockquote><p><strong>Idea #9: Who is it for, how did they get here and what do you want them to do?</strong></p><p>When creating ask yourself three questions: Who is it for? How did they get here? And, what do you want them to do? The type of person you built your website for will dictate the function of your site. In my coaching business, I knew 98% of my traffic was from busy professional working …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

This has been really great because it allows users to focus on particular techniques on individual components such as websites, network services and more. One down side of this is that it doesn't give the user a realistic experience of what to encounter in the real world; networks are used in almost every organisation and threats against networks can only be demonstrated and learnt through hands on experience. We've always focused on practical, real-world learning material and giving users' access to networks helps us fulfil this goal.</p><p>We have always taken an educational approach to teaching cyber security on TryHackMe - this is reflected by how rooms are structured. Our first network Throwback (more details later in the blog), simulate networks seen in the industry; we've added the complexity of a corporate network showing some very common attack paths. Instead of throwing users in the deep end and letting them figure how everything works, we're using a mixture of guided content and challenges to teach how networks can be vulnerable in many different ways.</p><p>Finally, we pride ourselves in being affordable. We've always worked on reducing barriers to entry for security, and one of these barriers is the cost. We want to provide high quality education that will be available for a reasonably low price! The first network we're releasing will be a paid course, the next network released will be for VIP Subscribers and then we will have networks freely available to everyone (<em>yes you read that right)</em>!</p><h2 id="future-plans">Future Plans</h2><p>We've always built TryHackMe to be flexible and networks is no exception. Here are a few of our plans for the future:</p><ul><li>Allowing users to upload their own machines, and configure their own vulnerable networks they can use in rooms they've created; <em>we already do this for certain educational institutions as a bespoke service.</em></li><li>Releasing VIP Subscriber-only networks, followed by networks available for everyone (at no cost).</li><li>Integrating networks into <a href="https://tryhackme.com/games/koth">King of the Hill</a>, our competitive hacking game.</li><li>More courses with network integration and a CTF-like network</li></ul><h2 id="our-first-network-throwback">Our First Network - Throwback</h2><p>A staple of modern hacking training, our first network is being released the week of the 17th of August: <strong>Throwback Hacks</strong></p><figure><img src="https://blog.tryhackme.com/content/images/2020/08/throwback.svg"><figcaption><em>Throwback Network Logo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Throwback is an Active Directory (AD) lab that teaches the fundamentals and core concepts of attacking a Windows network. The network simulates a realistic corporate environment that has several attack vectors you would expect to find in today’s organisations.</p><p>The lab uses a structured approach to guide users through exploiting the network, but requires you to put what you've learnt into practice, solving challenges as you go. The use of Windows to manage authentication and user identities in IT infrastructure today is so commonly used; as an aspiring security practitioner, it’s crucial to understand how this works and the network’s common weaknesses.</p><p>In this scenario, you’ll be assessing Throwback Hacks Security: a rather unfortunate security company that really doesn't practice much of what it preaches and subsequently has a network that is positively riddled with issues (and multiple paths for compromise). As our first network, this course will be targeted towards intermediate TryHackMe members as a separate package from our monthly subscription. Additionally, we'll have course material that accompanies the network which will cover the following topics (and more!):</p><ul><li>Phishing and OSINT (with user emulation!)</li><li>Lateral Movement</li><li>Kerberos Abuse </li><li> Malicious Macros</li><li>Active Directory Enumeration &amp; Exploitation</li><li>Attacking Mail Servers</li><li>Firewall Pivoting</li><li>Utilizing C2 </li><li>Abusing Cross-Domain Trusts</li></ul><p>Access to the network can be purchased so far in increments of either 30 or 45 days, albeit we're playing with these amounts a bit so they're subject to further change. Once available, you can find networks on the sidebar under networks (not shown until 15th August):</p><figure><img src="https://blog.tryhackme.com/content/images/2020/08/networks-link-location-highlighted.png"><figcaption><em>Networks location on the dashboard.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Once in this menu, you'll be presented with an overview of Throwback as well as the various purchasing options:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.tryhackme.com/content/images/2020/08/package-selection-purchase-preview.png"><figcaption><em>Purchasing Options Preview</em></figcaption></figure><p>Throwback consists of eleven different machines, varying in difficulty and in purpose. Here's a quick preview of the layout within the control panel:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.tryhackme.com/content/images/2020/08/network_layout.png"><figcaption><em>Throwback Hacks Network Control Panel Preview</em></figcaption></figure><p>Do note, to access this network you'll have to download a separate connection pack. You can select this from the access page per normal:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.tryhackme.com/content/images/2020/08/vpn-pack-preview.png"><figcaption><em>VPN Selection via the Access Page</em></figcaption></figure><p>Once connected, you'll be able to explore and start hacking the network. See if you compromise every machine and find every path to pwn Throwback Hacks!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.tryhackme.com/content/images/2020/08/breach-or-gtfo-header.png"><figcaption><em>One of the various services on the Throwback Hacks network</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're very fond of using the room like structure to provide access to content; users' don't just hack into virtual machines, but have access to supporting material to teach them various techniques. While progressing through room, users' also answer questions to ensure that they're on the right track and to reinforce their learning. We'll be applying the same approach to networks; you'll have plenty of material to guide you on what to do to provide an efficient and enjoyable learning experience. </p><p>The course will be $60 for 30 days of access (~£45); which works out to be $2 a day. </p><p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions:</strong></p><ul><li>Is this included with a subscription? <em>Unfortunately no, in this case we have networks available as a separate package. However, other networks will be available for both VIP and free users.</em></li><li>Is this a shared environment? <em>Yes, the networks will be shared between roughly five or so users. This allows us to keep costs significantly lower overall. </em></li><li>Are we allowed to do videos/stream the network? <em>Absolutely! You can stream/do videos over the network as much as you like, same as our other content. The only exceptions to this is that we ask you don't share the coursework.</em></li><li>Can we do write-ups on the network? <em>Yeah :) Just again, keep the coursework out of these. You can refer to specific sections of the coursework though! </em></li><li>Will you have more networks in the future? <em>Yup! We'll have one that's included with our normal subscription and eventually a free network. Of course these will vary in size from Throwback a fair bit.</em></li><li>Is there a certificate of completion? <em>Yes, once you've managed to compromise every machine on the network, you can download a certificate to prove your skills to others.</em></li></ul><p>As always, happy hacking! &lt;3</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-47adcb3e=""><p>With the recent ability for Rust to compile for AVR microcontrollers, I thought that it's time for
me to bring my favorite feature of Rust to Arduino: async/await.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> final code is at <a href="https://github.com/lights0123/async-avr" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/lights0123/async-avr</a>. <a href="https://github.com/lights0123/async-avr/blob/main/examples/serial.rs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Here's an example of a
simple task that does two things at once</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BlinkWithoutDelay" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">age-old</a> <a href="https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/49300/blink-without-delay-for-5-times-every-20-seconds" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">question</a> <a href="https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/44497/how-to-flash-blink-i2c-lcd-backlight-without-delay-function" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">when</a> <a href="https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/35436/arduino-blink-two-leds-without-delayamount-of-repetitions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">learning</a> <a href="https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/37032/how-to-blink-2-led-strips-without-delay" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Arduino</a>:
<em>"<a href="https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/73164/blink-not-working" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">How can I do</a> <a href="https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/49950/how-to-replace-the-delay-function-in-my-code" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">multiple things at once</a>"</em>? When programming for full operating
systems, like any desktop, mobile, or higher-end embedded platforms, the answer is easy—threads.
They're built into the OS, and you typically <em>have</em> to use them to take advantage of features like
multiple CPU cores. Or, when programming for an embedded target, you may reach for a lightweight
<abbr title="Real-Time Operating System">RTOS</abbr> like <a href="https://freertos.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">FreeRTOS</a>, which gives you full threads without much work.</p>
<p>But what if you have a 16MHz microcontroller with 2 KB of RAM?</p>
<p>The Arduino Uno is known for being ubiquitous, cheap, and easy to program. Although there are more
and more reasons to use competing products, such as the various ARM Cortex-M and Espressif boards
(which I use almost exclusively), the Microchip (formerly Atmel) ATMega series is sometimes still
preferred for low power applications, cutting cents off a <abbr title="Bill of Materials">BOM</abbr>, and its widespread support.</p>
<p>Typically, one checks in a loop repeatedly to see if the task is ready to activate. This can be
checking if there's data in a serial buffer, if a certain time period has passed, or a <abbr title="General-Purpose Input/Output">GPIO</abbr> pin has
toggled. However, I'm going to present an alternative to doing this—<code>async</code>/<code>await</code>.</p>

<p>Many modern languages are implementing <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>. C# was one of the first big languages to do
it, and then Python, JavaScript, Dart, Kotlin quickly followed. The big difference between threads
and <code>async</code> functions is that <code>async</code>hronous code is handled by the program itself, usually
cooperatively, while synchronous operations on threads rely on the OS to do it. The first obvious
reason for it, then, is when threads aren't available—just like what we're about to get into soon.
However, asynchronous code is typically faster than synchronous code because it is able to avoid the
overhead of spawning threads and context switches, as well as the memory overhead, as the amount of
space needed on the stack can be calculated ahead of time.</p>
<p>Internally, the compiler turns the code into a state machine, typically using the language's
generators feature if it has one. Here, every time you write <code>.await</code> and the data is not available
immediately, the compiler inserts a <code>return</code> statement, and adds a parameter that allows you to jump
right back to where it was. Rust uses <code>Pin</code>ning, where it is guaranteed that the generated struct
that holds the stack will always be in the same place in memory at all times. This avoids a problem
where a pointer is taken to a local variable, the function returns and comes back, and is suddenly
pointing to something completely different.</p>

<p>C++20 has similar features to Rust's <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> with the <code>co_await</code> keyword, although the
<a href="https://blog.panicsoftware.com/co_awaiting-coroutines/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">available documentation</a> is <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/02_execution/04_executor.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">not quite as good as Rust's</a>.
However, there's a total of... <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/search?q=%22co_await%22&amp;tab=forum" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">1 search result</a> on the Arduino forums, <em>and</em> it's
in German with no code. And even if there <em>was</em> code, it would be largely unaccessable as Arduino
ships with an old compiler:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>❱ ~/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avr-gcc/*/bin/avr-gcc --version
avr-gcc <span>(</span>GCC<span>)</span> <span>7.3</span>.0
Copyright <span>(</span>C<span>)</span> <span>2017</span> Free Software Foundation, Inc.</code></pre></div>
<p>GCC 7.3.0 ships with <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx17" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">"almost full support"</a> for C++17 (although not by default), but a
total of 0 C++20 additions. And if you're on PlatformIO, you'll have even less luck:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>❱ ~/.platformio/packages/toolchain-atmelavr/bin/avr-gcc --version
avr-gcc <span>(</span>AVR_8_bit_GNU_Toolchain_3.6.2_1759<span>)</span> <span>5.4</span>.0
Copyright <span>(</span>C<span>)</span> <span>2015</span> Free Software Foundation, Inc.</code></pre></div>
<p>However, Rust has been able to compile <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> code for <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/11/07/Async-await-stable.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">almost a year now on the <em>stable
compiler build</em></a>. There's been steadily increasing interest in using these
features on embedded platforms with Rust, and many projects have been using it as a result.</p>
<h2 id="pseudo-asyncawait">Pseudo-<code>async</code>/<code>await</code></h2>
<p>These libraries actually implement a <em>very</em> similar thing to <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> with a state machine,
and jumping to different positions in code based on where it's already been. For example,
<a href="https://github.com/bxparks/AceRoutine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AceRoutine</a> has a macro, <code>COROUTINE</code>, that internally converts the function into a state machine
that jumps to different places using <code>goto</code>. This is actually almost identical to how tools like
Babel in the JavaScript world convert <code>async</code> functions to traditional functions that can be used
with old browsers.</p>
<p>However, there are a few very critical problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local variables are not preserved across yields</strong>.</li>
<li>You can't use certain statements in some libraries (not AceRoutine), such as <code>switch</code>.</li>
<li>Destructors don't run properly, and will <strong><code>free</code> uninitialized memory</strong> if not done correctly
(due to the first point).</li>
<li>Tasks can't return values.</li>
</ul>
<p>These limitations are because simple preprocessor macros, which is the only option in C/C++, are
only "glorified copy-paste", and have no real computing power. Although <code>async</code> is built into the
Rust compiler, it wasn't before, and a (less-than-ideal, but still usable) macro could implement
most of the feature itself. Hopefully, new C++20 features will lead to more use in the embedded
world.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>It looks like there's a few packages (known as "crates" in the Rust world) to interface with the
hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/avr-rust/ruduino" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ruduino</a>, which only supports the Arduino Uno</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-device" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">avr-device</a>, which provides low-level hardware control</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">avr-hal</a>, which provides higher-level board and <abbr title="Microcontroller">MCU</abbr> support, and depends on avr-device</li>
</ul>
<p>Although <a href="https://github.com/avr-rust/ruduino" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ruduino</a> is by the avr-rust team that worked on getting Rust working on AVR, I ultimately
decided to go with <a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">avr-hal</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It supports many more boards, and has a structure that allows it to expand further</li>
<li>
<p>It supports <a href="https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/0.2.*/embedded_hal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">embedded-hal</a>, which allows us to share code between boards: for example, the
<a href="https://docs.rs/apa102-spi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>apa102_spi</code></a> crate will let us control APA102 LED strips on an Arduino Uno and a Raspberry Pi
running Linux, using the exact same code!</p>
<ul>
<li>embedded-hal also has a bigger focus on nonblocking operations, which is exactly what we're
looking for</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It has a cleaner and safer API</li>
</ul>
<p>To set that up:</p>
<p><strong>(Update 2020-07-26)</strong>: this is much simpler now with the latest nightly. All that is required:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>rustup <span>install</span> nightly
rustup +nightly component <span>add</span> rust-src</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="compiling-and-running">Compiling and Running</h2>
<p>We can compile by running</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>cargo +nightly build -Z build-std<span>=</span>core --release --target avr-atmega328p.json

cargo +nightly build --release</code></pre></div>
<p>Then, to upload it to a device, assuming that you have <code>avrdude</code> installed, run:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>avrdude -v -patmega328p -carduino -P/dev/ttyACM0 -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:target/avr-atmega328p/release/examples/serial.elf:e</code></pre></div>
<p>Change the upload path (<code>target/avr-atmega328p/release/examples/serial.elf</code>) to meet what you want
to upload.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-only-have-the-arduino-ide-installed">If you only have the Arduino IDE installed</h2>
<p>Enable "Show verbose output during: upload" in the Arduino IDE. Observe the build logs for an
<code>avrdude</code> command—it should look something like:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/bin/avrdude -C/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/etc/avrdude.conf -v -patmega328p -carduino -P/dev/ttyACM0 -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:/tmp/arduino_build_721874/Blink.ino.hex:i</code></pre></div>
<p>Copy that command, but delete everything after <code>-Uflash:w:</code>. Then, without spaces, add the path to
your binary. This will typically be <code>target/avr-atmega328p/release/project_name.elf</code>, or
<code>target/avr-atmega328p/release/examples/example_name.elf</code>. Finally, add <code>:e</code>. Your final command
will probably look something like:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/bin/avrdude -C/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/etc/avrdude.conf -v -patmega328p -carduino -P/dev/ttyACM0 -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:target/avr-atmega328p/release/project_name.elf:e</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="what-about-converting-to-hex-first">What about converting to hex first?</h3>
<p>Arduino typically converts the compiled binary to raw hex, and many AVR-Rust projects have
<a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal/blob/bfc5dfe67107a68b4a673e54532354af126cb3ba/mkhex.sh#L32" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">followed that pattern</a>. However, there's generally no need to do that, as <code>avrdude</code>
has the ability to upload ELF binaries directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="onto-async-operations">Onto <code>async</code> operations</h2>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, <a href="https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/0.2.*/embedded_hal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">embedded-hal</a> is implemented in such a way that asynchronous operations is
quite easy. When you attempt to read or write a value, you can get three results:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>WouldBlock</code>: I can't complete this operation right now.</li>
<li><code>Ok</code>: The operation succeeded. If reading something, this gives you the read value.</li>
<li><code>Err</code>: An error occurred while performing this operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>This maps very nicely to Rust's <code>Future</code> trait, which is used to implement asynchronous code. For
example, reading from a serial port is implemented like this:</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>poll_read</span><span>(</span>
    <span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>:</span> Pin<span>&lt;</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>Self</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    cx<span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> Context<span>&lt;</span><span>'_</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    buf<span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>[</span>u8<span>]</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> Poll<span>&lt;</span>Result<span>&lt;</span>usize<span>,</span> T<span>::</span>Error<span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>match</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>byte<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>*</span>ptr <span>=</span> byte<span>;</span>
                Poll<span>::</span><span>Ready</span><span>(</span><span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
            <span>}</span>
            <span>Err</span><span>(</span>nb<span>::</span>Error<span>::</span>WouldBlock<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> Poll<span>::</span>Pending<span>,</span>
            <span>Err</span><span>(</span>nb<span>::</span>Error<span>::</span><span>Other</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> Poll<span>::</span><span>Ready</span><span>(</span><span>Err</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
        Poll<span>::</span><span>Ready</span><span>(</span><span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Although there's a bit of weirdness in terms of checking if the buffer is big enough, for the most
part, this works pretty well.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="why-do-i-always-return-1-byte-read">Why do I always return 1 byte read?</h3>
<p>I'm mostly mirroring the <code>AsyncRead</code> and <code>AsyncWrite</code> in the <code>futures</code> crate, which typically is
used on machines with full operating systems. Typically, the overhead of a syscall is somewhat
high, so you might request e.g. 1024 bytes at a time. Obviously, that isn't the case for an 8-bit
<abbr title="Microcontroller">MCU</abbr>. However, I'm keeping that pattern for ease of porting and to allow for networking, e.g. the
Arduino Ethernet shield.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, I copied and pasted the <code>AsyncReadExt</code> and <code>AsyncWriteExt</code> traits from the <code>futures</code> crate as
well. The way this is set up is that you just implement the low-level functions, and the <code>Ext</code>
traits take care of the more user-friendly functions. This is done instead of default
implementations to allow the main trait to be small in case it is added to the standard library,
much like how <code>Future</code> is in <code>std</code>/…</p></div></div>

		<p>More than a year ago, <a href="https://erdavis.com/2019/05/07/distance-to-the-nearest-pub/">I mentioned</a> I was planning a map of roundabouts in the British Isles. Like always, though, I shelved it in favor of newer, flashier ideas and it just never got done.</p>
<p>I dragged the project out of the cobwebs last month, though, thinking it could be an easy thing to focus on instead of spiraling about the heartbreaking state of current affairs.</p>
<p>Naturally, that didn’t turn out to be the case.</p>
<p>Mapping just the British Isles felt a bit flat; I felt that I needed to include other countries to get a real sense of how common roundabouts really are.</p>
<p>Mapping just roundabouts felt facile; I needed to do roundabouts&nbsp;<em>per</em> something, to get a standardized view of the data.</p>
<p>This turned what was supposed to be a relaxing distraction into an extravaganza that tied up my laptop for several weeks. At least it prevented me from browsing too much internet news!</p>
<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>You can find my entire dataset for this post <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4zg8kb5tziq6z0r/AACoqXHHmzsQzzc5oKOf0QNna?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Roundabouts per intersection</h2>
<p>My initial thought was to map roundabouts per mile of road, but a bit of Googling turned up <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-10/mapping-america-s-resistance-to-traffic-roundabouts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this article</a> about work by Damien Saunder. He took a look at the number of roundabouts per intersection, which to me felt like the most compelling metric to use. After all, for every intersection a municipality has the choice whether or not to build a roundabout, and some treat that decision very differently than others.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don’t have access to his data set, so I had to create my own.</p>
<p>Getting roundabouts was pretty straightforward, if tedious. I just used the <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/osmdata" target="_blank" rel="noopener">osmdata </a>package in R to chug along every 50-ish miles and query for all roundabouts in a 50-mile radius.</p>
<p>I decided to go with a broad interpretation of what a roundabout&nbsp;<em>is</em>–I had no idea that there’s such disagreement on the term. If OpenStreetMap had an intersection tagged as a roundabout, mini-roundabout, or traffic circle, that was good enough for me. I didn’t validate them any further to see if they met with any more stringent criteria than that.</p>
<p>Getting all intersections, though, was a bit tricker. OSM doesn’t tag intersections, so I had to extract them myself. Like before, I chugged along every 50 miles and extracted the road network in the area (excluding highways and non-vehicular paths).</p>

<p>Then, with the sf package, I could use a one-liner to find everywhere that network overlapped itself.</p>
<pre>st_intersection(roads) %&gt;% subset(n.overlaps &gt; 1) %&gt;% st_cast( 'POINT') %&gt;% st_coordinates()</pre>

<p>It took about two weeks to cover Europe and get all the intersections. Of course, this isn’t a perfect method, but I can’t think of any other way to do it–do tell me if you know of something better.</p>
<p>For the US, I extracted road networks from TIGER/Line shapefiles instead of querying OSM. Without the overhead of the repeated queries, I was able to extract these intersections in under a week.</p>
<p>Finally, I decided to limit my final visualization to just 10 countries. Firstly, I think the roundabout data is incomplete in certain parts of the continent–Eastern Europe seemed unusually bare, for example. Secondly, I don’t think there’s much to gain in seeing these countries in their geographical contexts–there really didn’t seem to be a wider pattern that would be exposed by plotting everything all together. Lastly, plotting all the countries at the same size made it a lot easier to see detail in the smaller ones.</p>
<p>Hopefully you enjoy the results more than I enjoyed the process!</p>

<h2>Roundabouts per capita</h2>
<p>Another method to normalize roundabouts is to look at them per capita.</p>
<p>Luckily, I was able to find a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/population-distribution-demography/geostat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1km-grid population density shapefile</a> for Europe, so this map was pretty straightforward to make.</p>
<p>For the US, the R package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidycensus/tidycensus.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tidycensus</a> was invaluable–I absolutely recommend checking it out if you’ve ever found yourself lost in the depths of a .gov website, frantically searching for data that <em>should</em> be easy and obvious to download, but somehow isn’t.</p>
<p><a href="https://erdaviscom.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/percapita.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img data-attachment-id="575" data-permalink="https://erdavis.com/2020/07/06/how-common-are-roundabouts-plus-a-bunch-of-other-maps/percapita/" data-orig-file="https://erdaviscom.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/percapita.png" data-orig-size="3514,6631" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="perCapita" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://erdaviscom.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/percapita.png?w=159" data-large-file="https://erdaviscom.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/percapita.png?w=543" src="https://erdaviscom.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/percapita.png?w=723" alt="perCapita" srcset="https://erdaviscom.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/percapita.png?w=723 723w, https://erdaviscom.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/percapita.png?w=1446 1446w, https://erdaviscom.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/percapita.png?w=79 79w, https://erdaviscom.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/percapita.png?w=159 159w, https://erdaviscom.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/percapita.png?w=768 768w, https://erdaviscom.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/percapita.png?w=543 543w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px"></a></p>
<h2>What city has the most roundabouts?</h2>
<p>Surprisingly, the most roundabout-y city is in Indiana! Carmel’s city website even proclaims them the <a href="https://www.carmel.in.gov/department-services/engineering/roundabouts#:~:text=Carmel%20now%20has%20more%20than,city%20in%20the%20United%20States.&amp;text=The%20number%20of%20injury%20accidents,Insurance%20Institute%20for%20Highway%20Safety." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roundabout Capital of the United States</a>. I don’t believe this is true in terms of total roundabouts, but its absolutely true once you normalize by roundabouts per intersection.</p>
<p>Another surprising entry for me is Berkeley, CA. I lived there for four years during college and never really noticed a surplus of roundabouts. Then again, my main method of transportation was my own feet, and I wasn’t exactly on the lookout for intersection types.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the rest of the top 25 is completely dominated by cities in Europe.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting I just used the bounding box of each of these cities–I didn’t clip the results to the exact city boundaries. Numbers might be a bit off, especially for oddly-shaped cities (eg Venice’s bounding box contains quite a bit of mainland Italy).</p>

<h2>Mapping intersections</h2>
<p>This isn’t really roundabout-related, but seeing as I went to the trouble of getting all the intersections in the US and Europe it would be a huge shame not to map them all.</p>
<p>They are pretty much just population density maps, but I do love them. I was going for a “city lights from space” + “starry sky” effect, which I think I achieved!</p>

<p>I found more than 34 million intersections in Europe! It took my computer about five hours to plot them all. I did notice I missed a slice of Denmark, but like hell am I going back and re-plotting this.</p>
<p>I just love how Moscow appears as an 11-pointed star in this map, and how the topography of the Alps is readily apparent.</p>

<h2>Nobody lives here</h2>
<p>(This is just the post that keeps on giving, ain’t it?)</p>
<p>Since I had detailed European population density data anyway, I figured I’d also create a version of the <a href="https://tumblr.mapsbynik.com/post/82791188950/nobody-lives-here-the-nearly-5-million-census" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nobody Lives Here</a> map by Nik Freeman that was such a hit a few years ago.</p>

<h2>Last thoughts</h2>
<p>I was encouraged to include other countries in this analysis, but it was already such a stressful, overblown mess I just couldn’t bring myself to do it.</p>
<p>I also had wanted to make some sort of “tour of London’s roundabouts” map using a travelling salesman solver, but again, project fatigue was real on this one.</p>
<p>Perhaps I need to let myself make simple projects instead of turning everything into a huge production… I’ll give that some thought ☺</p>

<p>Software engineers have long joked about how much of their job is <a href="https://localghost.dev/2019/09/everything-i-googled-in-a-week-as-a-professional-software-engineer/">simply Googling things</a></p>
<p>Now you can do the same, but for free</p>
<p>Below, I'll cover <code>dorking</code>, the use of search engines to find very specific data</p>
<p><em>For each example, you can paste it directly into Google to see the result</em></p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/Contextify1/status/1255202725551202304">this Twitter exchange</a> with Gumroad CEO Sahil Lavingia, the next few examples will cover Gumroad and Sahil.</p>
<p>find specific pages within a website (ex: for DynamoDB e-books)</p>
<div><pre><span></span>site:gumroad.com dynamodb
</pre></div>


<p>find specific pages that must include a phrase in the Title text</p>
<div><pre><span></span>allintitle:"support this" site:gumroad.com
</pre></div>


<p>find similar sites (Google only)</p>



<p>you can chain operators together (ex: looking for bug bounties with either security or bug-bounty in the URL)</p>
<div><pre><span></span>(inurl:security OR inurl:bug-bounty OR site:hackerone.com) + "gumroad"
</pre></div>


<p>you can restrict to certain top-level domains (ex: lists of teachers)</p>
<div><pre><span></span>site:.edu filetype:xls inurl:"email.xls"
</pre></div>



<h3 id="emails">emails</h3>

<p>find Gmail accounts</p>
<div><pre><span></span>sahil lavingia "@gmail.com"
</pre></div>


<p>find work accounts (you'll need to find their domain first)</p>
<div><pre><span></span>sahil lavingia "@gumroad.com"
</pre></div>


<p>not finding what you're looking for with either of those? Try to guess the  format of the email (try going to <a href="https://www.email-format.com/d/shopify.com/#">this site</a>, search the domain, and click <code>Identified Name Formats</code>))</p>



<p>you can always find every page with emails on it (and then use the next snippet below)</p>
<div><pre><span></span>site:gumroad.com intext:"@gumroad.com"
</pre></div>


<p>find every email on a web page that you're on. The big kahuna - this works for every website. Inject it into a site with Chrome DevTools (<a href="https://www.alec.fyi/how-to-scrape.html">more here</a>)</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>var</span> <span>elems</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>.</span><span>getElementsByTagName</span><span>(</span><span>"*"</span><span>);</span>
<span>var</span> <span>re</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>RegExp</span><span>(</span><span>"(^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$)"</span><span>);</span>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>this will log every email found, without you having to scan through the whole page.</p>

<h3 id="files">files</h3>

<p>find spreadsheets</p>
<div><pre><span></span>filetype:csv OR filetype:xlsx OR filetype:xls OR filetype:xltx OR filetype:xlt OR inurl:airtable.com/universe/

<p>find Google Docs and Google Sheets</p>
<div><pre><span></span>site:docs.google.com "gumroad"
</pre></div>


<p>find where your competitor's logo is (ex: partners or customers' websites)</p>



<p>find your competitors' sales pitches and whitepapers</p>
<div><pre><span></span>site:intercom.com (filetype:pdf OR filetype:ppt)
</pre></div>


<p>find case studies written about competitors</p>
<div><pre><span></span>inurl:hubspot-case-study -site:http://hubspot.com
</pre></div>



<h3 id="seo">SEO</h3>

<p>find sites with specific keywords in the anchor text</p>
<div><pre><span></span>inanchor:"cyber security"
</pre></div>


<p>research blog posts with specific keywords in their title</p>



<p>find backlinks (ex: other sites that link to a particular blog post). note: the <code>link</code> operator is now deprecated</p>
<div><pre><span></span>intext:intercom.com/intercom-api-reference/reference
</pre></div>


<p>find keyword permutations with the <code>wildcard</code> operator</p>



<p>find companies using a given widget</p>
<div><pre><span></span>intext:"Powered by Intercom" -site:intercom.com
</pre></div>



<h3 id="coupons">coupons!</h3>

<p>search the site itself for codes</p>
<div><pre><span></span>site:curology.com ("coupon" | "referral code" | "affiliate code" | "discount code" | "VIP")
</pre></div>


<p>next, try twitter</p>
<div><pre><span></span>site:twitter.com + "meundies" + ("coupon" | "referral code" | "affiliate code" | "discount code" | "VIP")

<p>cybersecurity experts use dorking, as one tool among many, to find potential vulnerabilities in a company. I will not be covering any such queries, out of concern for their potential for misuse.</p>

<h3 id="review">operator review</h3>

<p><code>operators</code> are components of a search query that narrow the results down. You can combine as many as you want in one query. The most useful ones you'll want to know are:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>operator</th>
<th>description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>"phrase"</td>
<td>results must include "phrase"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-phrase</td>
<td>exclude results with phrase</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>phrase1 AND phrase2 &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td>phrase1 and phrase2 must both be included</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>phrase1 OR phrase2</td>
<td>one of phrase1 and phrase2 must be included (or both)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>site:example.com</td>
<td>results must be on domain example.com</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>filetype:jpg</td>
<td>results must be of type <code>.jpg</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>AND/OR logic can be used to combine distinct queries</p>
<div><pre><span></span>"phrase1" OR "phrase 2" AND "phrase3"
# equivalent to these two searches
&gt;&gt; "phrase1"
&gt;&gt; "phrase 2" AND "phrase3"
</pre></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm back! Sorry that I didn't blog for more than two weeks. I might have gotten a bit too much into the streaming world and programmed more than blogging about it. This post starts with some housekeeping and then explains the newest project I'm working on. Feel free to jump to the point you are most interested in.</p>

<h2 id="housekeeping"><a href="#housekeeping">Housekeeping</a></h2>
<p>The last post here was about visualizing kinda random numbers :D <a href="https://opensourc.es/blog/visualizing-digits">Visualizing digits</a>. It might be the one that brought me to building Javis but more on that later.</p>
<p>I'm currently mostly working on two projects:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/ConstraintSolver.jl">ConstraintSolver.jl</a> where I try to build a constraint solver from scratch in Julia.  I started with some refactoring lately and streamed about it via <a href="https://twitch.tv/opensourcesblog">Twitch</a>. The videos are saved on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrnUHCvJBCUggZUqBTAZb4w">YouTube</a>. The refactoring is still going and I probably will write a post about that once it's done just to have a better structure of the outcome. Streaming is unstructured and hard to watch later I suppose. I'm still trying to figure out the best way to combine my possibilities to teach julia. </p>
<p>The new project is <a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/Javis.jl">Javis.jl</a> which I explain in the next section.</p>
<p>Sometimes I work on <a href="https://github.com/lanl-ansi/Juniper.jl">Juniper.jl</a> as it is my small baby. It's my first project in Julia and the most used one I've built up til now. I mostly do bugfixes for it at the moment but might come back to it to add some new awesome features.</p>
<h2 id="javisjl"><a href="#javisjl">Javis.jl</a></h2>
<p>Okay what is Javis?</p>
<p>Javis stands for <strong>J</strong>ulia M<strong>a</strong>thematical <strong>vis</strong>ualizations and animations. (Currently at least 😄)</p>
<p>A small side note maybe: The Juniper package I was talking about was called <code>MINLPBnB.jl</code> which is the worst name possible, so I might have gotten better at naming things. I have to say it's very easy to see what the package does: <strong>M</strong>ixed <strong>I</strong>teger <strong>N</strong>on-<strong>L</strong>inear <strong>P</strong>rogramming using <strong>Branch</strong> a<strong>n</strong>d <strong>B</strong>ound. Well, some folks told me it should have a proper name... We debated to call it <code>Bacon.jl</code> and I can't remember what it stands for.</p>
<p>... <a href="https://github.com/lanl-ansi/Juniper.jl/issues/55#issuecomment-346687286">The thread</a> apparently it was for "Branch Optimization Nonlinear".  Just saw that I suggested BOREDOM as well. Oh man fun times...</p>
<p>Any way I liked <code>Javis</code> this time and just tried to find out what it might stand for.</p>
<p><strong>To answer the actual question:</strong></p>
<p>Javis tries to make it as easy and extensible as possible to create small animations like this one:</p>
<p><a href="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-08-04-javis-beginning/images/dancing_circles.gif"><img src="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-08-04-javis-beginning/images/dancing_circles.gif" alt="Dancing circles"></a></p><p>I'll show the code for it later. 😉  In general I want to have a simple way to animate all the ideas that might get into my head. Just some examples</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Visualizing linear algebra concepts easily</p>
</li>
<li><p>Animate puzzles for my ConstraintSolver</p>
</li>
<li><p>Explore math concepts</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants"><a href="#standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants">Standing on the shoulders of giants</a></h3>
<p>Normally I try to build things from scratch (in a high level programming language 😄). This time I'm more aware than ever that I'm standing on the shoulders of giants.</p>
<p>It is of course built with <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> which should be no surprise. BTW a new version (v1.5) is official now 👍</p>
<p>Besides that it is highly dependent on the awesome package <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Luxor.jl">Luxor.jl</a> which is used for all the drawing onto a canvas.  It provides simple functions like <code>line</code>, <code>circle</code> and so on but also gave rise to the way we do animations.</p>
<p>Luxor.jl is itself built using <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Cairo.jl">Cairo.jl</a> which is a wrapper around the C library <a href="https://www.cairographics.org/">Cairo</a>. </p>
<p>If you're interested in 2D graphics, you should definitely check out the awesome <a href="https://juliagraphics.github.io/Luxor.jl/stable/tutorial/">Luxor Tutorial</a>.</p>
<h3 id="state_of_javis"><a href="#state_of_javis">State of Javis</a></h3>
<div><p>Edit:  12.08</p>
<p>We're in rapid development so this is already out of date. At some points I have an edit like this one to show when something changed. We haven't released v0.1.0 yet so you don't get deprecation warnings if something fails 😕</p></div>
<p>You might be interested in the current state of <a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/Javis.jl">Javis.jl</a> as the documentation is very sparse (or non-existent for <code>stable</code>) and the README doesn't show anything especially entertaining 😄</p>
<p>Me an my fellow Julian and streamer <a href="http://jacobzelko.com/">Jacob Zelko</a> started this project about two weeks ago. Furthermore, I was away for a week so everything is very new.</p>
<p>The basic functionality</p>
<ul>
<li><p>\(\LaTeX\) text which is not possible in Luxor.jl</p>
</li>
<li><p>Translation and rotation of objects</p>
</li>
<li><p>Objects depending on others (quite basic as of now)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Very basic morphing between two shapes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Before I give a view into the future you might want to see some code, right?</p>
<h3 id="how_to_do_the_animation_from_above"><a href="#how_to_do_the_animation_from_above">How to do the animation from above?</a></h3>
<p>I think we should start with the very very basics before I show you the 40 lines of code.</p>
<pre><code>using Javis, Luxor</code></pre>
<div><p>Edit:  12.08</p>
<p>Now it's only <code>using Javis</code> as we started to reexport everything that Luxor does and change some methods to work in our favor 😃</p></div>
<p>We normally need both of the packages as we want to do some animations (<code>Javis</code>) and want to do some drawing (<code>Luxor</code>).</p>
<p>I don't like to work in the global scope so let's create a function:</p>
<pre><code>function dancing()
    video = Video(500, 500)
    javis(video,
        [
         ...
        ]
    ,tempdirectory="test/current/images", deletetemp=true, creategif=true, pathname="test/current/dancing_circles.gif")
end</code></pre>
<div><p>Edit:  12.08</p>
<p>I promise I write another post when we release v0.1 :) <code>deletetemp</code> and <code>creategif</code> don't exist anymore.</p></div>
<p>It has quite a few parameters to create a simple <code>gif</code> out of it, so I think this needs improvement but that's for another day.</p>
<p>First of all we create our video object which is nothing more than a struct. The object sets the width and height in pixel of the video and stores information in between but that is of no concern to the user.</p>
<p>Then we have our <code>javis</code> function which is the main function of our project. It takes at least two arguments: the <code>video</code> and a list of actions that shall be performed during the video. The <code>...</code> is just a placeholder for now. </p>
<p>We have a list of keyword arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>tempdirectory</code> stores the images (yes we create an image for each frame and combine them later)</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>deletetemp</code> means that all images are destroyed after we created the gif</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>creategif</code> yes we want to create a gif and not only having a list of images</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>pathname</code> the gif should be stored here</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay now to <code>Action</code>.</p>
<p>Let's create our first "Animation":</p>
<pre><code>function ground(args...) 
    background("white")
    sethue("black")
end

function dancing()
    video = Video(500, 500)
    javis(video,
        [
         BackgroundAction(1:70, ground)
        ]
    ,tempdirectory="test/current/images", deletetemp=true, creategif=true, pathname="test/current/dancing_circles.gif")
end</code></pre>
<p>The <code>ground</code> function sets the background to white and the paint brush color to black. </p>
<p><strong>Why do I need the <code>args...</code>?</strong> I'm glad you ask. Each user function gets three arguments <code>video, action, frame</code> where the first is the <code>Video</code> struct, the second is the <code>Action</code> struct and <code>frame</code> is just the current frame number. They are irrelevant for the background such that we don't need to write them down explicitly.  "Unfortunately" we need to write <code>args...</code> such that Julia actually knows that we have a method that accepts those three arguments. The <code>...</code> basically stands for as many arguments as you want.</p>
<div><p>⚠ Note</p>
<p><code>sethue</code> is the same as <code>setcolor</code> but doesn't mess with the opacity</p></div>
<p>More interesting is the <code>BackgroundAction(1:70, ground)</code> which has just two arguments here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>frames</code> a range of frames it is applied to. </p>
</li>
<li><p><code>func</code> the function that is called for each frame</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope it is clear what you can expect from the 70 frames we just created 😉 </p><details><summary> Feel free to click to see the boringness</summary> <a href="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-08-04-javis-beginning/images/test.gif"><img src="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-08-04-javis-beginning/images/test.gif" alt="Test"></a></details>
<p>Okay it's time to actually draw something with adding another action:</p>
<pre><code>...
    BackgroundAction(1:70, ground),
    Action(1:70, (args...)-&gt;line(O, Point(25, 25), :stroke), Translation(O, Point(0, 100)))
...</code></pre>
<p>This time we define an <code>Action</code> instead of a <code>BackgroundAction</code> which basically means: Everything in this action stays in the action and is not exposed to the outside world. You might wanna call it the Vegas of actions. Sorry for the bad joke...</p>
<p>There are some new parts in this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An anonymous function with the <code>-&gt;</code> syntax. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code>line</code> function from Luxor which takes in two points and an action</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>O</code> is the same as <code>Point(0, 0)</code> and stands for origin (which is in the center of the canvas)</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>:stroke</code> means that we want to actually draw the line which is <strong>not</strong> the default and might be confusing</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><code>Translation</code> from the origin to the point <code>(0,100)</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some more information before you have a look at the spoiler.</p>
<p>The canvas has its origin in the center as mentioned but it also has the y-axis going down instead of up. I'm not sure whether we want to change that for Javis.</p>
<details><summary> Did you expect this?</summary> <a href="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-08-04-javis-beginning/images/line.gif"><img src="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-08-04-javis-beginning/images/line.gif" alt="Falling line"></a></details>
<p>So the <code>Translation</code> is animated by interpolation between the start and end translation. In the future we will make it possible to use easing functions to change this behavior. </p>
<p>Additionally, the <code>Translation</code> translates the plane such that drawing the line from <code>(0,0)</code> to <code>(25, 25)</code> results in drawing it from <code>(0, 100)</code> to <code>(25, 125)</code> in the last frame.</p>
<p>I hope that it makes sense so far. </p>
<p>Okay how do I draw circle that is moving down at the same rate by defining a new <code>Action</code>?</p>
<pre><code>...
    BackgroundAction(1:70, ground),
    Action(1:70, (args...)-&gt;line(O, Point(25, 25), :stroke), Translation(O, Point(0, 100))),
    Action(1:70, (args...)-&gt;circle(Point(-25, 0), 10, :fill), Translation(O, Point(0, 100)))
...</code></pre>
<p>Simple, right?</p>
<p>Okay this is the boring way of doing it but let's have a look at the <code>circle</code> function first. </p>
<p>The <code>circle</code> function takes a <code>Point</code> a <code>radius</code> and an action. For the action I chose <code>:fill</code> instead of <code>:stroke</code> this time.</p>
<p>For a bit more fun we want to define the first action a bit differently using a named function.</p>
<pre><code>function draw_line(args...)
    line(O, Point(25, 25), :stroke)
    return Transformation(O, 0.0)
end</code></pre>
<p>and then:</p>
<pre><code>...
    BackgroundAction(1:70, ground),
    Action(1:70, :line, draw_line, Translation(O, Point(0, 100))),
    Action(1:70, (args...)-&gt;circle(pos(:line) .+ Point(-25, 0), 10, :fill))
...</code></pre>
<p>This adds quite some more complexity but hopefully it's not too hard to understand and it is a very powerful tool.</p>
<pre><code>Action(1:70, :line, draw_line, Translation(O, Point(0, 100))),</code></pre>
<p>is not an anonymous function anymore but it also has a name <code>:line</code> as the second argument.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the function now return something:</p>
<pre><code>return Transformation(O, 0.0)</code></pre>
<p>It does return the same position (the origin, tail of the line) every time. The second argument is the <code>angle</code> of the transformation which is set to <code>0.0</code> as we don't use it. There is …</p></div></div>

They found that cepafungin I bound to not one but two places on the proteasome, enacting a powerful result. Their report appears in the journal <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fcell-chemical-biology%2Ffulltext%2FS2451-9456%2820%2930285-3%3F_returnURL%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%252Fretrieve%252Fpii%252FS2451945620302853%253Fshowall%253Dtrue&amp;t=MmFmNjI0YTQ1OGEyZjVkYzczYzFhY2MwZjcwZDg3MjFiMzUyYzc3NCxSOHk5NUxheg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F625997758414929920%2Fsynthesizing-cepafungin&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1597292443"><i>Cell Chemical Biology</i></a>.</p><p>“Because cepafungin I is able to engage the proteasome in two ways, it allows for amplification of its effect,” Renata says. “We showed that this compound elicits many similar downstream biological responses as the FDA-approved chemotherapy bortezomib, while also having certain qualities that may translate into fewer unwanted side effects for patients.”</p><h2><b>Recreating nature</b></h2><p>Cepafungin I first intrigued researchers because of its usefulness as an antifungal substance, and later as a promising anti-cancer agent. It kills cells by acting on the proteasome, which is responsible for clearing away the “garbage” produced by cells. When the proteasome’s function is blocked, cells are overcome with their waste and die.</p><p>But making enough of the compound to be able to study its activity or enable its eventual use a medication has proven challenging, due largely to its complex molecular structure. In the field of chemistry, scientists seek to create the desired structure in as few steps as possible, which leads to cost and time savings. But with complex compounds, that isn’t an easy task. &nbsp;</p><p>The Scripps Research team was able to overcome these challenges and synthesize the compound in just nine steps. For comparison, a related compound known as glidobactin A was synthesized in 21 steps in 1992—and that was considered a landmark at the time.</p><p>The team was able to speed up the process by using certain enzymes that enabled construction of one of the compound’s key building blocks, an amino acid. Then they developed other creative chemistry methods to simplify construction of other parts of the molecule, including a branched lipid portion that was subsequently found to contribute to the compound’s potent activity.</p><p>“Our approach saved us many steps in synthesizing the final compound compared with using classical chemical approaches,” says Alexander Amatuni, a graduate student at Scripps Research and an author of the study.</p><h2><b>A good sign for safety</b></h2><p>After creating the compound, the chemists discovered that in addition to being exceptionally selective at targeting two sites on the proteasome, it didn’t show any undesired cross-reaction with other proteins in cells, a feature that could make it a better drug candidate.</p><p>Three proteasome inhibitors—bortezomib, carfilzomib and ixazomib—have already been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of multiple myeloma. “But those medications have some potentially serious side effects, and cancer cells may develop resistance to them over time,” says co-author Adibekian, associate professor of chemistry at Scripps Research. “There is a need for alternative, more specific proteasome inhibitors.”</p><p>Graduate student Anton Shuster, also an author of the new research, noted that the team’s discoveries were made possible by a close collaboration of labs with different expertise</p><p>“By combining the two complementary technological platforms—chemoenzymatic synthesis from the Renata lab and chemoproteomics from the Adibekian lab—we were able to succeed,” Shuster says. “Having the opportunity to work with scientists with divergent research background is what makes working at Scripps Research particularly exciting.”</p><p>Going forward, the scientists plan to continue structure-guided design of similar molecules with alternative structural features in search of useful compounds with superior anti-cancer activity.</p><p>The methods they developed will enable them to change various parts of the structure with relative ease, Amatuni says, allowing for further investigation of biological activity. “The emphasis on translational research at Scripps Research enables this discovery,” Adibekian says. “We’re excited about developing the molecule further.”</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scripps.edu%2Fnews-and-events%2Fpress-room%2F2020%2F20200806-renata-adibekian-cepafungin.html&amp;t=MjliY2VhZTdiMWRlNzcxZDY3NjJmZGJlZDg2NmVmMjk5YzEwNzQxOCxSOHk5NUxheg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F625997758414929920%2Fsynthesizing-cepafungin&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1597292443">Scripps Research Institute</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b> “Concise Chemoenzymatic Total Synthesis and Identification of Cellular Targets of Cepafungin I”, <i>Cell Chemical Biology</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1016%2Fj.chembiol.2020.07.012&amp;t=MThkMmNiY2U4ODc2ZGQyOWEyZGI1NWEyMDQ1NjJmMGMzMjk0OWMyMyxSOHk5NUxheg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F625997758414929920%2Fsynthesizing-cepafungin&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1597292443">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chembiol.2020.07.012</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/190367274522/non-oncology-drugs-killing-cancer-cells">A number of non-oncology drugs could potentially kill cancer cells</a></p>

<p>This essay is is broken up into 6 sections:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Introduction</strong>: short intro</li>
<li><strong>A Habit Mode</strong>l: a way to think about habits we'll be using throughout this post.</li>
<li><strong>Habit Properties</strong>: four useful things about habits to keep in mind.</li>
<li><strong>Creating Habits</strong>: three techniques for habit creation.</li>
<li><strong>Breaking Habits</strong>: two techniques for removing habits.</li>
<li><strong>tldr;</strong> a summary of the above sections.</li>
</ol>

<p>People, as the saying goes, are creatures of habit. Many of our actions every day are repeated often, typically without much thought. A 2002 study where university students were asked to write down their hourly tasks found that around 40% of daily activities were habitual (defined as regularly performed at the same time and location) <sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/habits/habits-everyday.svg" alt="40% of daily activities are habitual"></p>
<p>Many people have habits they wish to start or habits they wish to break. My goal here is three-fold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Give an overview of the mechanisms/models behind habits.</li>
<li>Clarify what is/isn't a habit, and when we have leverage to affect habits.</li>
<li>Explain several evidence-backed concrete techniques to create/break habits.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are many definitions of habits which all try to triangulate the term in different ways. The model we'll be working with here, which is often overlapped in these definitions is this: a habit is an automatic behavior that is cued by context from the situation <sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Habits can be thought of as your default responses to different situations. This model for habits is composed of two parts: the <strong>context cue</strong> and the <strong>response</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/habits/habits-model.svg" alt="an image of context cues and responses for a habit"></p>
<p>The <strong>context cue</strong>, also called the “trigger” or “situation”, is what first kicks off the entire process. Context cues are typically external things in the environment, from people to sensory details to preceding actions.</p>
<p>Once the cue occurs, the response is generated.</p>
<p>The <strong>response</strong>, also called the “action”, is the behavior that follows the cue. Responses are typically small, atomic actions, but there is also some research suggesting that a series of actions can be “chunked” together into a unit that follows from the response <sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>However, note that actions which require more thought and conscious effort don’t become habitual, even when repeated in the same context <sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>. Thus, I’ll be recommending simpler responses when we get to creating our own habits.</p>
<p>This [Context cue] → [Response] model is a core way think about habits. While this model might seem obvious, it also allows for templating much of what we intuitively label as “habits”.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Ring! Your alarm shakes you awake. In response, your arm slaps the alarm, hitting the Snooze button, and you go back to sleep.
<strong>[Context cue]</strong> Shrill sound of alarm going off.
<strong>[Response]</strong> Turn it off and go back to sleep.</p></li>
<li><p>"Hey!" Someone asks you “How are you doing?” and you instantly respond with “Good, you?”
<strong>[Context cue]</strong> The words “How are are you doing?”
<strong>[Response]</strong> Immediately saying “Good, you?”</p></li>
<li><p>Beep beep! You open the car door and get inside. After stepping into the car, your hands are already looking for the seatbelt.
<strong>[Context cue]</strong> Opening the car door.
<strong>[Response]</strong> Putting on the seatbelt.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This model is important in that it stresses how much of our behavior <em>isn’t</em> directly under our control. It highlights how habits can be seen as a way of outsourcing our behavior to the environment. There’s a very real sense in which the central point of control shifts from <em>internal</em> to <em>external</em>.</p>
<p>Much of the actual complexity is in figuring out how brains are able to somehow store the information about both the context cue and response together.</p>
<p>How are habits actually stored in the brain? One suggested mechanism for how this actually happens is motivated cuing <sup id="fnref7"><a href="#fn7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>. Motivated cuing claims that certain cues can cause us to act because we anticipate a reward as a result of our actions. Thus, the cue itself brings to mind a sense of “desiredness” which leads us to act.</p>
<p>One example is notifications on Facebook. Many people might feel a nagging draw to click on the red notification button as soon as they see it, like a sort of mental itch they need to scratch. There’s a two-step phenomenon here, something like [See Facebook notification] -&gt; [Click on it].</p>
<p>Motivated cuing says that this is because past experience with the cue (i.e. the red notification icon) has led to rewards (i.e. information about online activity that involves you). This means that one way habits could come about is by triggering a motivation to act when we experience <em>just</em> the situation itself (even if the accompanying reward hasn’t shown up yet).</p>
<p>Okay, so this seems plausible. How do we know if something like this is actually happening in the brain?</p>
<p>One piece of evidence is a classic study involving monkeys and juice. We started with some monkeys, some juice, and a light. Next, we trained the monkeys to push a lever when they saw the light flash, which would then reward them with the juice. When the monkeys received juice, we saw a spike of brain activity (as we might have expected). Eventually, though, we saw the monkeys’ brain activity shift. Rather than spiking when they received the juice, we began to see the spike when they merely saw the light. In other words, the monkeys seemed to react to the context cue that signaled the reward rather than the reward itself <sup id="fnref8"><a href="#fn8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>.</p>
<p>However, I think the motivated cuing model alone is unsatisfactory for several reasons. Many of our routines don’t always have well-defined rewards, like folding laundry or drying off with a towel. Additionally, as we’ll see in the next section, rewards seem to have an overall negative effect on habit formation.</p>
<p>Cognitive scientists will also talk about direct cuing as an alternative explanation for how these associations are made, but all "direct cuing" means is that associations get made without needing an accompanying goal state <sup id="fnref9"><a href="#fn9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>. It also doesn't provide a very mechanistic explanation, so I'll stop the discussion here.</p>
<hr>

<p>Apart from the standard habit model, there are a few other useful properties to keep in mind about habits. We’ll be going over <strong>insensitivity to reward changes</strong>, <strong>independence of intentions</strong>, <strong>automatic defaults</strong>, and <strong>base rates</strong>.</p>
<h2>Insensitivity to Reward Changes</h2>
<p>One property of habits is that they are largely insensitive to reward changes, meaning the habit persists even when the rewards are altered or removed. One study looked at people cued to press a button for a food reward; yet, even when the reward was removed, we saw that they continued to respond by pressing the button <sup id="fnref10"><a href="#fn10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This gives some insight into why using only rewards and incentives usually isn’t enough to change your habits. Once you’ve internalized the habit loop, changes to the outcome don’t have much effect on altering your behavior. This might seem counterintuitive. Surely people are more likely to act on certain behaviors if you pay them, right?</p>
<p>Well, we do see that financial incentives, as one example of a reward, actually <em>are</em> often good at encouraging short-term activities. Compared to a control group, we see that people who receive incentives are more likely to perform the target behavior. But once the rewards stop, the behavior often does <em>not</em> habituate <sup id="fnref11"><a href="#fn11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup>. For example, a recent study with over 1,000 subjects examined whether paying people to go to the gym would lead to increased gym habits. We found that about two months after the payment stopped, the increase in behavioral frequency went back down to roughly pre-incentive levels <sup id="fnref12"><a href="#fn12" rel="footnote">12</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Lastly, we often see that drug addicts continue to use substances, even when such behavior turns self-destructive. This sort of behavior has also been replicated in animal studies, where rats continue to respond habitually to stimuli, even when the incentive is changed to a disincentive (EX: a poison) <sup id="fnref13"><a href="#fn13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The takeaway here is that simply changing rewards isn’t enough to create or break habits.</p>
<h2>Independence of Intentions</h2>
<p>A common dichotomy for behavior is that between “goal-directed actions” and “habitual actions”.</p>
<p>Our intentions, i.e. our desires and thoughts, do a good job of predicting which goal-directed behaviors we’ll carry out. Goal-directed behavior refers to the category of actions where we act consciously on our preferences.</p>
<p>On the flip side, habitual behavior is quicker and largely unaffected by rewards, as we covered above. They are largely independent of intentions, meaning that they persist even if you don't want to continue the behavior <sup id="fnref14"><a href="#fn14" rel="footnote">14</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In the earlier example with drug use, for example, it’s quite plausible to assume that the addict would have liked to stop due to the negative effects of continued use, but still found it hard to quit. We see that one’s intentions only affect behavior when the habit is weak. For example, people’s intentions to purchase fast food only affected their actual purchases in the absence of a strong habit <sup id="fnref15"><a href="#fn15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup>. When habits become well-developed, intentions matter little.</p>
<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/habits/habits-intentions.svg" alt="shows that as intentions get stronger, habits become more automatic"></p>
<p>On the flip side, several studies have shown that in new, unfamiliar contexts, our habits become disrupted, and our intentions once again become a stronger guide to behavior <sup id="fnref16"><a href="#fn16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup>. We’ll formalize this dynamic later in the form of a technique called Cue Disruption in to help with creating and breaking habits.</p>
<p>Thus, there’s a sort of inverse relationship here between one’s intentions and one’s habits. When habits are not well-established, intentions are a strong determinant of behavior. When habits <em>are</em> well-established, intentions become irrelevant <sup id="fnref17"><a href="#fn17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The important takeaway here is that simply “intending” to change your habits <em>isn’t enough</em>.</p>
<h2>Automatic Defaults</h2>
<p>The last important property of habits is their automaticity. As alluded to earlier, habits operate without much conscious control. Though they might be deliberately overridden, they are what we default to in the absence of cognitive effort. Indeed, we see that when people become distracted, their habits take over, even in situations where a more reasoned decision might have been optimal <sup id="fnref18"><a href="#fn18" rel="footnote">18</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This also helps explain why rewards don’t do much to influence habitual behavior: Incentives often work best when they are deliberately considered, but the …</p></div></div>

<p>We spent the whole <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-06-21-zero-to-production-2-learn-by-building-an-email-newsletter/">Chapter 2</a> defining what we will be building (an email newsletter!), narrowing down a precise set of requirements. It is now time to roll up our sleeves and get started with it.</p>

<p>This chapter will take a first stab at implementing this user story:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a blog visitor,<br>
I want to subscribe to the newsletter,<br>
So that I can receive email updates when new content is published on the blog.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We expect our blog visitors to input their email address in a form embedded on a web page.<br>
The form will trigger an API call to a backend server that will actually process the information, store it and send back a response.<br>
This chapter will focus on that backend server - we will implement the <code>/subscribe</code> POST endpoint.</p>

<h2 id="1-1-our-strategy">1.1. Our Strategy</h2>

<p>We are starting a new project from scratch - there is a fair amount of upfront heavy-lifting we need to take care of:</p>

<ul>
<li>choose a web framework and get familiar with it;<br></li>
<li>define our testing strategy;<br></li>
<li>choose a crate to interact with our database (we will have to save those emails somewhere!);<br></li>
<li>define how we want to manage changes to our database schemas over time (a.k.a. migrations);<br></li>
<li>actually write some queries.</li>
</ul>

<p>That is a lot and jumping in head-first might be overwhelming.<br>
We will add a stepping stone to make the journey more approachable: before tackling <code>/subscribe</code> we will implement a <code>/health_check</code> endpoint. No business logic, but a good opportunity to become friends with our web framework and get an understanding of all its different moving parts.</p>

<p>We will be relying on our Continuous Integration pipeline to keep us in check throughout the process - if you have not set it up yet, have a quick look at <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-06-06-zero-to-production-1-setup-toolchain-ides-ci/">Chapter 1</a> (or grab one of the <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-06-06-zero-to-production-1-setup-toolchain-ides-ci/#5-2-ready-to-go-ci-pipelines">ready-made templates</a>).</p>



<p>What web framework should we use to write our Rust API?<br>
This was supposed to be a section on the pros and cons of the Rust web frameworks currently available. It eventually grew to be so long that it did not make sense to embed it here and I published it as a spin-off article: check out <em><a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-07-04-choosing-a-rust-web-framework-2020-edition/">Choosing a Rust web framework, 2020 edition</a></em> for a deep-dive on <code>actix-web</code>, <code>rocket</code>, <code>tide</code> and <code>warp</code>.</p>

<p><em>TL;DR:</em> as of August 2020, <code>actix-web</code> should be your go-to web framework when it comes to Rust APIs aimed for production usage - it has seen extensive usage in the past couple of years, it has a large and healthy community behind it and it runs on <code>tokio</code>, therefore minimising the likelihood of having to deal with incompatibilities/interop between different async runtimes.<br>
It will thus be our choice for Zero To Production.</p>

<p>Nonetheless <code>tide</code>, <code>rocket</code> and <code>warp</code> have huge potential and we might end up making a different decision in 2021 - if you are following along Zero To Production using a different framework I’d be delighted to have a look at your code! Please shoot me an email at <em>contact@lpalmieri.com</em></p>

<p>Throughout this chapter and beyond I suggest you to keep a couple of extra browser tabs open: <a href="https://actix.rs/"><code>actix-web</code>’s website</a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/"><code>actix-web</code>’s documentation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/actix/examples"><code>actix-web</code>’s examples collection</a>.</p>



<p>Let’s try to get off the ground by implementing a health-check endpoint: when we receive a <code>GET</code> request for <code>/health_check</code> we want to return a <code>200 OK</code> response with no body.</p>

<p>We can use <code>/health_check</code> to verify that the application is up and ready to accept incoming requests.<br>
Combine it with a SaaS service like <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/">pingdom.com</a> and you can be <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/product/alerting/#">alerted</a> when your API goes dark - quite a good baseline for an email newsletter that you are running on the side.</p>

<p>A health-check endpoint can also be handy if you are using a container orchestrator to juggle your application (e.g. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#define-a-liveness-command">Kubernetes</a> or <a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/service#service-parameters">Nomad</a>): the orchestrator can call <code>/health_check</code> to detect if the API has become unresponsive and trigger a restart.</p>

<h3 id="3-2-1-server-httpserver">3.2.1. Server - <code>HttpServer</code></h3>

<p><a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/struct.HttpServer.html"><code>HttpServer</code></a> is the backbone supporting our application. It takes care of things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>where should the application be listening for incoming requests? A TCP socket (e.g. <code>127.0.0.1:8000</code>)? A Unix domain socket?<br></li>
<li>what is the maximum number of concurrent connections that we should allow? How many new connections per unit of time?<br></li>
<li>should we enable transport level security (TLS)?<br></li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>HttpServer</code>, in other words, handles all <em>transport level</em> concerns.<br>
What happens afterwards? What does <code>HttpServer</code> do when it has established a new connection with a client of our API and we need to start handling their requests?<br>
That is where <code>App</code> comes into play!</p>

<h3 id="3-2-2-application-app">3.2.2. Application - <code>App</code></h3>

<p><a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/struct.App.html"><code>App</code></a> is where all your application logic lives: routing, middlewares, request handlers, etc.<br>
<code>App</code> is the component whose job is to take an incoming request as input and spit out a response.<br>
Let’s zoom in on our code snippet:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>App</span>::<span>new</span>()
    .<span>route</span>(<span>"/"</span>, <span>web</span>::<span>get</span>().<span>to</span>(<span>greet</span>))
    .<span>route</span>(<span>"/{name}"</span>, <span>web</span>::<span>get</span>().<span>to</span>(<span>greet</span>))
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p><code>App</code> is a practical example of the <em>builder pattern</em>: <code>new()</code> gives us a clean slate to which we can add, one bit at a time, new behaviour using a fluent API (i.e. chaining method calls one after the other).<br>
We will cover the majority of <code>App</code>’s API surface on a need-to-know basis over the course of the whole book: by the end of our journey you should have touched most of its methods at least once.</p>

<h3 id="3-2-3-endpoint-route">3.2.3. Endpoint - <code>Route</code></h3>

<p>How do we add a new endpoint to our <code>App</code>?<br>
The <a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/struct.App.html#method.route"><code>route</code></a> method is probably the simplest way to go about doing it - it is used in an <em>Hello World!</em> example after all!</p>

<p><code>route</code> takes two parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>path</code>, a string, possibly templated (e.g. <code>"/{name}"</code>) to accommodate dynamic path segments;<br></li>
<li><code>route</code>, an instance of the <code>Route</code> struct.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/struct.Route.html"><code>Route</code></a> combines a <em>handler</em> with a set of <em>guards</em>.<br>
Guards specify conditions that a request must satisfy in order to “match” and be passed over to the handler. From an implementation standpoint guards are implementors of the <a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/guard/trait.Guard.html"><code>Guard</code></a> trait: <code>Guard::check</code> is where the magic happens.</p>

<p>In our snippet we have</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="rust">.<span>route</span>(<span>"/"</span>, <span>web</span>::<span>get</span>().<span>to</span>(<span>greet</span>))
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p><code>"/"</code> will match all requests without any segment following the base path - i.e. <code>http://localhost:8000/</code>.<br>
<code>web::get()</code> is a short-cut for <code>Route::new().guard(guard::Get())</code> a.k.a. the request should be passed to the handler if and only if its HTTP method is <code>GET</code>.</p>

<p>You can start to picture what happens when a new request comes in: <code>App</code> iterates over all registered endpoints until it finds a matching one (both path template and guards are satisfied) and passes over the request object to the handler.<br>
This is not 100% accurate but it is a good enough mental model for the time being.</p>

<p>What does a handler look like instead? What is its function signature?<br>
We only have one example at the moment, <code>greet</code>:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3

    [...]
}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p><code>greet</code> is an asynchronous function that takes a <code>HttpRequest</code> as input and returns <em>~something~</em> that implements the <a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/trait.Responder.html"><code>Responder</code></a> trait<sup id="fnref:impl-trait-syntax"><a href="#fn:impl-trait-syntax">3</a></sup>.<br>
A type implements the <code>Responder</code> trait if it can be converted (asynchronously) into a <code>HttpResponse</code> - it is implemented off the shelf for a variety of common types (e.g. strings, status codes, bytes, <code>Http…</code></p></div></div>

Every time you talk to the best founders they’ve gotten new things done. In fact, this is the one thing that we learned best predicts a success of founders in YC. If every time we talk to a team they’ve gotten new things done, that’s the best predictor we have that a company will be successful.</p></blockquote><p>This propagates even down to the level of how quickly you deploy software changes. <a href="https://twitter.com/schrockn/status/1130569945891258369" target="_blank">Nick Schrock</a> on Facebook / Instagram moving fast and breaking things:</p><blockquote><p>Instagram was even faster operationally than Facebook. They had continuous deployment. Any engineer could deploy at any time (they would run a command called “Yolout” lol). Facebook was on weekly deploys at the time on the web and way slower on mobile.</p><p>IG story definitely lends credibility to the those-who-ship-faster-win argument</p><p>…Worth noting that Facebook learned from this. As the company grew, the release cadence got faster. First daily, then twice daily, and it is now continuous.

Google has found that <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/why-performance-matters" target="_blank">users <em>dramatically</em> prefer faster webpages</a>:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>The BBC found they lost an additional 10% of users for every additional second their site took to load.</p></li><li><p>DoubleClick by Google found 53% of mobile site visits were abandoned if a page took longer than 3 seconds to load.</p></li></ul><p>…</p><ul><li>When AutoAnything reduced page load time by half, they saw a boost of 12-13% in sales.</li></ul></blockquote><p><a href="https://jsomers.net/blog/speed-matters" target="_blank">James Somers</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Google famously prioritized speed as a feature. They realized that if search is fast, you’re more likely to search. The reason is that it encourages you to try stuff, get feedback, and try again. When a thought occurs to you, you know Google is already there. There is no delay between thought and action, no opportunity to lose the impulse to find something out. The projected cost of googling is nil. It comes to feel like an extension of your own mind.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://blog.nelhage.com/post/reflections-on-performance/" target="_blank">Nelson Elhage put it best</a>:</p><blockquote><p>What is perhaps less apparent is that <em>having faster tools changes how users use a tool or perform a task.</em> Users almost always have multiple strategies available to pursue a goal — including deciding to work on something else entirely — and they will choose to use faster tools more and more frequently. Fast tools don’t just allow users to accomplish tasks faster; they allow users to accomplish entirely new types of tasks, in entirely new ways. I’ve seen this phenomenon clearly while working on both Sorbet and Livegrep…</p><p>Many individual tests at Stripe would take 10-20s or more…. Because we succeeded at building Sorbet so that it could typecheck the entire codebase in that time window, it became the fastest way many developers could get decent feedback on their code, to check for basic typos, misused APIs, and other low-hanging classes of errors. Since it was their fastest option, we saw users reaching for Sorbet as their first line of checking their code fairly early on in our development and rollout. Getting even mediocre feedback and some confidence fast was much more important than anything that would take minutes.</p><p>Watching users use livegrep, I’ve seen a related upside from its performance…. Because livegrep is so fast, users use it <em>interactively</em> in a way I’ve rarely seen people interact with other search engines: they enter an initial query, and then, if they get too many or too few results, they edit it based on the result list, which gets a new set of results, which they continue to refine or expand until they hit on the results they are seeking.</p></blockquote><h3 id="personal-workflow">Personal workflow</h3><p><a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/productivity" target="_blank">Sam Altman</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I also made an effort to learn to type really fast and the keyboard shortcuts that help with my workflow.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/we-are-typists-first-programmers-second/" target="_blank">Steve Yegge via Jeff Atwood</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I was trying to figure out which is the most important computer science course a CS student could ever take, and eventually realized it’s Typing 101.</p><p>The really great engineers I know, the ones who build great things, they can type.</p></blockquote><p>This matches my experience at Wave, where the best engineers are disproportionately likely to type quickly, know their keyboard shortcuts, and have invested a lot of time making their common tasks efficient.</p><p>Obviously, those aren’t the main things that make them good engineers—but I think they help in more than just the obvious ways.</p><h3 id="negotiations">Negotiations</h3><p>At Wave, when hiring, we’ve noticed that moving someone through the hiring process faster makes them <em>much</em> more likely to accept our offer.

Boyd’s claim was that <em>going through the OODA loop faster was a decisive advantage</em>:</p><blockquote><p>In order to win, we should operate at a faster tempo or rhythm than our adversaries—or, better yet, get inside [the] adversary’s Observation-Orientation-Decision-Action time cycle or loop … Such activity will make us appear ambiguous (unpredictable) thereby generate confusion and disorder among our adversaries—since our adversaries will be unable to generate mental images or pictures that agree with the menacing, as well as faster transient rhythm or patterns, they are competing against.</p></blockquote><p>As a recent example, for instance, many states and countries <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/macovid/">waited far too long</a> to lock down when the COVID epidemic hit because <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/03/09/plot-economics/" target="_blank">the virus got inside their OODA loop</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Right now, the perception of agency at all levels is falling.

<h3>3.1 Second Normal Form </h3>

<p>Second normal form is violated when a non-key field is a fact about a subset of a key.
It is only relevant when the key is composite, i.e., consists of several fields. Consider
the following inventory record: </p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>---------------------------------------------------
| PART | WAREHOUSE | QUANTITY | WAREHOUSE-ADDRESS |
====================-------------------------------
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The key here consists of the PART and WAREHOUSE fields together, but WAREHOUSE-ADDRESS
is a fact about the WAREHOUSE alone. The basic problems with this design are: 

</p><ul>
  <li>The warehouse address is repeated in every record that refers to a part stored in that
    warehouse. </li>
  <li>If the address of the warehouse changes, every record referring to a part stored in that
    warehouse must be updated. </li>
  <li>Because of the redundancy, the data might become inconsistent, with different records
    showing different addresses for the same warehouse. </li>
  <li>If at some point in time there are no parts stored in the warehouse, there may be no
    record in which to keep the warehouse's address. </li>
</ul>

<p>To satisfy second normal form, the record shown above should be decomposed into
(replaced by) the two records: </p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>-------------------------------  --------------------------------- 
| PART | WAREHOUSE | QUANTITY |  | WAREHOUSE | WAREHOUSE-ADDRESS |
====================-----------  =============--------------------
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>When a data design is changed in this way, replacing unnormalized records with
normalized records, the process is referred to as normalization. The term
"normalization" is sometimes used relative to a particular normal form. Thus a
set of records may be normalized with respect to second normal form but not with respect
to third. </p>

</div><div name="label3.3">

<h3>3.3 Functional Dependencies </h3>

<p>In relational database theory, second and third normal forms are defined in terms of
functional dependencies, which correspond approximately to our single-valued facts. A
field Y is "functionally dependent" on a field (or fields) X if it is invalid to
have two records with the same X-value but different Y-values. That is, a given X-value
must always occur with the same Y-value. When X is a key, then all fields are by
definition functionally dependent on X in a trivial way, since there can't be two records
having the same X value. </p>

<p>There is a slight technical difference between functional dependencies and
single-valued facts as we have presented them. Functional dependencies only exist when the
things involved have unique and singular identifiers (representations). For example,
suppose a person's address is a single-valued fact, i.e., a person has only one address.
If we don't provide unique identifiers for people, then there will not be a functional
dependency in the data: </p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>----------------------------------------------
|   PERSON   |       ADDRESS                 |
-------------+--------------------------------
| John Smith | 123 Main St., New York        |
| John Smith | 321 Center St., San Francisco |
----------------------------------------------
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Although each person has a unique address, a given name can appear with several
different addresses. Hence we do not have a functional dependency corresponding to our
single-valued fact. </p>

<p>Similarly, the address has to be spelled identically in each occurrence in order to
have a functional dependency. In the following case the same person appears to be living
at two different addresses, again precluding a functional dependency. </p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>---------------------------------------
|   PERSON   |       ADDRESS          |
-------------+-------------------------
| John Smith | 123 Main St., New York |
| John Smith | 123 Main Street, NYC   |
---------------------------------------
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>We are not defending the use of non-unique or non-singular representations. Such
practices often lead to data maintenance problems of their own. We do wish to point out,
however, that functional dependencies and the various normal forms are really only defined
for situations in which there are unique and singular identifiers. Thus the design
guidelines as we present them are a bit stronger than those implied by the formal
definitions of the normal forms. </p>

<p>For instance, we as designers know that in the following example there is a
single-valued fact about a non-key field, and hence the design is susceptible to all the
update anomalies mentioned earlier. </p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>----------------------------------------------------------
| EMPLOYEE  |  FATHER    |  FATHER'S-ADDRESS             |
|============------------+-------------------------------|
| Art Smith | John Smith | 123 Main St., New York        |
| Bob Smith | John Smith | 123 Main Street, NYC          |
| Cal Smith | John Smith | 321 Center St., San Francisco |
----------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
</blockquote>

</div><div name="label4.1">

<h3>4.1 Fourth Normal Form </h3>

<p>Under fourth normal form, a record type should not contain two or more independent
multi-valued facts about an entity. In addition, the record must satisfy third normal
form. </p>

<p>The term "independent" will be discussed after considering an example. </p>

<p>Consider employees, skills, and languages, where an employee may have several skills
and several languages. We have here two many-to-many relationships, one between employees
and skills, and one between employees and languages. Under fourth normal form, these two
relationships should not be represented in a single record such as </p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>-------------------------------
| EMPLOYEE | SKILL | LANGUAGE |
===============================
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead, they should be represented in the two records </p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>--------------------  -----------------------
| EMPLOYEE | SKILL |  | EMPLOYEE | LANGUAGE |
====================  =======================
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that other fields, not involving multi-valued facts, are permitted to occur in the
record, as in the case of the QUANTITY field in the earlier PART/WAREHOUSE example. </p>

<p>The main problem with violating fourth normal form is that it leads to uncertainties in
the maintenance policies. Several policies are possible for maintaining two independent
multi-valued facts in one record: </p>

<p>(1) A disjoint format, in which a record contains either a skill or a language, but not
both: </p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>-------------------------------
| EMPLOYEE | SKILL | LANGUAGE |
|----------+-------+----------|
| Smith    | cook  |          |   
| Smith    | type  |          |
| Smith    |       | French   |
| Smith    |       | German   |
| Smith    |       | Greek    |
-------------------------------
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not much different from maintaining two separate record types. (We note in
passing that such a format also leads to ambiguities regarding the meanings of blank
fields. A blank SKILL could mean the person has no skill, or the field is not applicable
to this employee, or the data is unknown, or, as in this case, the data may be found in
another record.) </p>

<p>(2) A random mix, with three variations: </p>

<p>(a) Minimal number of records, with repetitions: </p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>-------------------------------
| EMPLOYEE | SKILL | LANGUAGE |
|----------+-------+----------|
| Smith    | cook  | French   |   
| Smith    | type  | German   |
| Smith    | type  | Greek    |
-------------------------------
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(b) Minimal number of records, with null values: </p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>-------------------------------
| EMPLOYEE | SKILL | LANGUAGE |
|----------+-------+----------|
| Smith    | cook  | French   |   
| Smith    | type  | German   |
| Smith    |       | Greek    |
-------------------------------
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(c) Unrestricted: </p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>-------------------------------
| EMPLOYEE | SKILL | LANGUAGE |
|----------+-------+----------|
| Smith    | cook  | French   |   
| Smith    | type  |          |
| Smith    |       | German   |
| Smith    | type  | Greek    |
-------------------------------
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(3) A "cross-product" form, where for each employee, there must be a record
for every possible pairing of one of his skills with one of his languages: </p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>-------------------------------
| EMPLOYEE | SKILL | LANGUAGE |
|----------+-------+----------|
| Smith    | cook  | French   |
| Smith    | cook  | German   |
| Smith    | cook  | Greek    |
| Smith    | type  | French   |
| Smith    | type  | German   |
| Smith    | type  | Greek    |
-------------------------------
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Other problems caused by violating fourth normal form are similar in spirit to those
mentioned earlier for violations of second or third …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                    <p>MinIO supports a complete object locking framework offering both Legal Hold and Retention (with Governance and Compliance modes). Object Locking functionality is a requirement for many regulated industries from financial services to healthcare. <br></p><p>Lifecycle management is an increasingly critical element in the data ecosystem. Data is the primary asset in most organizations at this point - more so than the physical assets we normally associate with large enterprises - trains, planes, automobiles or oil rigs. Protecting this data, and managing how long to protect it are complex challenges. <br></p><p>MinIO now offers the complete suite of lifecycle management capabilities. This includes versioning, object locking and the various derivative components. Every use case is different and our goal is to create software and documentation that allow our community to implement these features with confidence. <br></p><p>Our approach models Amazon’s. This is important for a number of reasons. First, for companies seeking compatibility for their applications, the same S3 API calls that work in the public cloud need to work on premises. Second, Amazon took a measured approach to the problem, considered all of the corner cases and built a strong offering. We acknowledge a debt there. Third, given Amazon’s leadership there is strong adoption of this in the approach and most of the issues have been resolved. <br></p><p>Even with Amazon’s leadership, not a lot of companies have implemented this feature. We are pleased to add our name to the list. Given the other attributes of our software, we think this removes any hesitation around adopting MinIO as your private cloud object store. <br></p><p>Having immutability and protection from deletion ensures that your data assets are safe.<br></p><p><strong>Versioning</strong><br></p><p>Versioning allows a user to retain multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. Versioning provides a mechanism to &nbsp;preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in a bucket. Versioning ensures that objects remain available across a range of failures from applications to human error. <br></p><p>Versioning is enabled at the bucket level. When enabled, MinIO automatically creates a unique version ID for the object. There can be multiple versions of the same object. <br></p><p>One of the main benefits of versioning is to protect overwriting it or deleting it unintentionally. This is performed using the concept of a delete marker. When a versioned object is deleted it is not removed permanently. Rather a delete marker is created and becomes the current version of the object. When that object is read it returns a 404 Not Found message.<br></p><p>Objects that have the delete marker can be restored. <br></p><p>Along the same lines, if a versioned object is overwritten, it creates a new version and that becomes the current version. Again, the older version can be restored as needed. <br></p><p>To account for these changes there are now three bucket states in MinIO. Unversioned which is the default, versioning-enabled, or versioning-suspended. Please note that once a bucket is enabled for versioning, that action cannot be undone - only suspended. Versioning is a global setting within the bucket - meaning all objects are now versioned. <br></p><p>Users with appropriate permissions can suspend versioning to stop accruing object versions. This is applicable only for that bucket and not for other buckets. For more information on what happens in this case refer to the documentation. <br></p><p>As with all of MinIO, versioning can be applied using the MinIO Client (mc), the SDK or via the command line. <br></p><p>Versioning is the simplest way to protect data from unintended actions. It does have the effect of adding to bucket sizes as objects are versioned and can lead to a higher number of interdependencies between the objects as well as the risk of hidden object dependencies. This can be mitigated with Lifecycle Management Choices. Still, for most organizations, this is a reasonable tradeoff for data protection. <br></p><p>There are, however, other use cases, that require another level of certainty. <br></p><p><strong>Object Locking, Retention and Legal Holds</strong><br></p><p>Object locking is a key feature for those companies operating in regulatory environments or having forward thinking policies around retention, audit or other compliance related requirements. We will be publishing our final Cohasset Report shortly but have a favorable assessment in hand. <br></p><p>This work builds on our previous feature set for write once, read many (WORM) - extending it as appropriate. As always, we took a minimalist approach - ensuring that it was feature complete without being feature-heavy and sapping performance. <br></p><p>While there are dozens of use cases, they can be effectively reduced to Legal Hold and Retention. Additionally there are modes, either Governance or Compliance and these have certain implications. There is some overlap here so we will do our best to be precise in our descriptions. <br></p><p><strong>Retention</strong><br></p><p>Retention ensures that an object is WORM protected (cannot be deleted or overwritten) for some period of time. It can be expressed in seconds, days or years. <br></p><p>Retention is set at the object level. You can place a retention period on an object version either explicitly or through a bucket default setting. A default lock configuration set at the bucket level does not apply retroactively to versions of objects created before. It only applies to objects that are created afterwards. &nbsp;When you apply a retention period to an object version explicitly, you specify a Retain Until Date for the object version. The Retain Until Date setting is stored in the object version's metadata and protects the object version until the retention period expires. <br></p><p>When the bucket default setting is used, a Retain Until Date is not specified. Instead, a duration is set (either days or years), for which every object version placed in the bucket should be protected. When a new object is placed in the bucket a Retain Until Date is calculated for the object version by adding the specified duration to the object version's creation timestamp. The object version is then protected exactly as though it was explicitly locked with that retention period on the object version.<br></p><p>When you place a retention period on an object version, a timestamp is stored in the object version's metadata to indicate when the retention period expires.

An object version can have both retention and legal hold. Retention and legal hold apply to individual object versions.

<p><em>‘The tradition of the oppressed teaches us that the “state of emergency” in which we live is not the exception but the rule. We must attain to a conception of history that is in keeping with this insight. Then we shall clearly realise that it is our task to bring about a real state of emergency, and this will improve our position in the struggle against fascism. One reason why fascism has a chance is that, in the name of progress, its opponents treat it as a historical norm. The current amazement that the things we are experiencing are “still” possible in the Twentieth Century is not philosophical. This amazement is not the beginning of knowledge — unless it is the knowledge that the view of history that gives rise to it is untenable.’</em></p>

<p>Coda: A Vision of our Future</p>
<p>The UK, and with it the nation states of Western capitalism, is undergoing a revolution. In comparison to the momentousness of this change, the neoliberal revolution overseen in this country by the Government of Margaret Thatcher merely created the political hegemony for the expansion and administration of a global economy. But the world of parliamentary democracies, of civil liberties and human rights, including our rights of assembly, speech, thought, privacy and a fair trial, of the division of powers between an executive, legislature and judiciary, of media scrutiny of Government, of freedom from censorship, of political activity itself, is now over. What we are entering into is something quite different. Like all revolutions, it’s been a long-time brewing, with the legislation necessary to administer it, the technology required to police it, and the manufacture of popular consent to its implementation having been in preparation for at least two decades. But the wheel has now turned, and the world we lived in no longer exists. This is the new normal.</p>
<p><strong>1. Historical Precedents for Emergency Powers</strong></p>
<p>On 15 June, opening the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2020-06-15/debates/852C6EE6-D006-4059-905B-8BAEE20975FB/HealthProtection(CoronavirusRestrictions)(England)(Amendment)(No2)Regulations2020">Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee</a> debate on the motion to approve Amendment No. 2 to the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England), Lord Bethell, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department of Health and Social Care, one of only 814 hereditary peers in the UK and the 5th Baron Bethell, declared:</p>
<p><em>‘The amending regulations we are discussing were made by the Secretary of State on 13 May. These remain an exceptional and necessary package of measures brought forward to protect public health. The regulations we are debating have been amended two further times since, on 31 May and 12 June. This is an unusual situation, so I will address this early in my speech because I know that it is a cause of concern.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘This sequencing has been a necessary consequence of the speed at which the Government have had to respond to the changing impacts of the pandemic on our country.</em> <em>Use of the emergency procedure has rarely been so necessary. These are not usual times. However, I believe that the situation has demonstrated that our flexible unwritten Constitution is a strength in extraordinary times such as these, and that our parliamentary democracy can retain its oversight while bringing about measures necessary to meet these unprecedented circumstances. </em></p>
<p><em>‘I ​assure noble Lords that this expedited process does not set some kind of inappropriate precedent for the future, when we reach a greater state of normality.’</em></p>
<p>We are — we are constantly being told — living in ‘unprecedented times’, facing ‘unprecedented circumstances’ requiring ‘unprecedented measures’ for which there is no historical precedent and for which — is the unstated implication — the Government cannot be held to account for the consequences of its responses. It didn’t know that emptying NHS hospitals of elderly patients already infected by SARs-CoV-2 would start an epidemic in UK care homes. It didn’t know that denying medical and emergency care for tens of thousands of patients with cancer, heart disease, diabetes and dementia would kill more people than COVID-19. It didn’t know that putting the country into lockdown for 3 months would send the UK economy spiralling into the worst depression in over 300 years, bankrupt thousands of small businesses and push unemployment up to an estimated 4-5 million people. And it apparently hasn’t considered that closing schools for four months because of a disease to which children are statistically immune will have an as-yet-unknown impact on the education and lives of millions of school children. The situation is unprecedented, and the Government is doing the best it can.</p>
<p>‘Unprecedented’, however, is one of those words that should set alarm-bells ringing in the head of the historical materialist, implying, as it does, that we are in a moment about which history can teach us nothing, but which signals, in practice, that the speaker either hasn’t a clue what they’re talking about (the journalist) or is deliberately dissembling what they are in fact doing (the politician). But in either case, whether the present is a product of ignorance or deceit, history inevitably has a lot to tell us about supposedly ‘unprecedented’ moments, and so it is with the coronavirus crisis. Bear with me, then, as we take a brief detour through the history of emergency powers, the better to arm ourselves for confronting their use in the present.</p>
<p>It took less than five years for France to pass from the revolutionary overthrow of the constitutional monarchy of King Louis Philippe I in February 1848; through the subsequent foundation of the French Second Republic in May 1848; the bloody repression of Parisian workers in the June Days uprising; the election by popular vote of Louis-Bonaparte as President of the Republic in December 1848; to the latter’s <em>coup d’état</em> in December 1851 and subsequent election as Emperor Napoléon III in December 1852 — five years to pass from a king to a republic and back to an emperor — and throughout most of that revolution the citizens of Paris were living under a ‘state of siege’.</p>
<p>The best commentary on the constitutional origins and use of emergency powers — as he has been throughout the coronavirus crisis on the juridico-political changes implemented under its cloak — is that by the Italian philosopher, <a href="https://architectsforsocialhousing.co.uk/2020/04/25/giorgio-agamben-and-the-bio-politics-of-covid-19/">Giorgio Agamben</a>. In <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/009254.html"><em>State of Exception</em></a>, in which he traces the history of emergency powers back to the French Revolution of 1789, Agamben writes:</p>
<p><em>‘The institution of the state of siege has its origins in the French Constituent Assembly’s decree of 8 July, 1791, which distinguished among état de paix, in which military authority and civil authority each acts in its own sphere; état de guerre, in which civil authority must act in concert with military authority; and état de siège, in which “all the functions entrusted to the civil authority for maintaining order and internal policing pass to the military commander, who exercises them under his exclusive responsibility”. </em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>‘The subsequent history of the state of siege is the history of its gradual emancipation from the wartime situation to which is was originally bound in order to be used as an extraordinary police measure to cope with internal sedition and disorder, thus changing from a real, or military, state of siege to a fictitious, or political one. In any case, it is important not to forget that the modern state of exception is a creation of the democratic-revolutionary tradition and not the absolutist one.</em></p>
<p><em>‘The idea of a state of suspension of the Constitution was introduced for the first time in the Constitution of 22 Frimaire Year 8, Article 92 of which reads: “In the case of armed revolt or disturbance that would threaten the security of the State, the law can, in the places and for the time that it determines, suspend the rule of the Constitution. In such cases, this suspension can be provisionally declared by a decree of the Government if the legislative body is in recess, provide that this body be convened as soon as possible by an article of the same decree.”</em></p>
<p><em>‘The city or region in question was declared “hors la Constitution” </em>[outside the Constitution]<em>. Although the paradigm is, on the one hand (in the state of siege) the extension of the military authority’s wartime powers into the civil sphere, and on the other a suspension of the Constitution (or of those constitutional norms that protect individual liberties), in time the two models end up merging into a single juridical phenomenon that we call the state of exception.’</em></p>
<p>Following the Restoration of the Bourbon monarchy, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charte_constitutionnelle_du_4_juin_1814#Texte_de_la_charte">Article 14 of the Royal Charter of June 1814</a> gave the king, as head of state and commander-in-chief of the armed forces, the exclusive power to ‘make the regulations and ordinances necessary for the execution of the laws and the security of the state’. The following April, after Napoloeon Bonaparte’s return from Elba, Section 66 of the <a href="https://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/legislation/c_additional.html">Additional Act</a> required that, in the case of civil disturbances, the Government’s declaration of a state of siege had to be made by law. This was the constitutional position when, thirty-three years later, on 22 February 1848, in response to striking workers and republican students taking to the streets of Paris, the French Government declared a state of siege. Unfortunately for King Louis Philippe, the National Guard sided with the revolutionaries, protecting them from the French Army. Following the fall of the so-called ‘July Monarchy’, a decree of the Constituent Assembly on 24 June, 1848, placed Paris back into a state …</p></div></article></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Software engineers feel uneasy when things aren’t right.</p>

<p>Students or junior engineers are unsettled through unfamiliarity with programming concepts.
Gradually, we are unsettled by abstractions at higher and higher levels.
We’re no longer troubled by a lack of understanding, but instead when systems don’t conform to patterns we know to be sound, or worse, when systems do conform to patterns we know to be harmful.
Refined unease.</p>

<p>We learn that unease is a reliable indicator that we are heading towards a problem.</p>

<p>Good and great engineers feel this unease.
What differentiates the good from the great? Great engineers listen to their intuition, but use their conscious minds to reason about whether something should be done.
Great engineers cultivate space between unease and action.
Great engineers can tolerate imperfection.</p>

<p>All engineering decisions should be made with an understanding of the business context that surrounds them.
Why is this piece of code being written? This must inform the decisions you make.</p>

<p>Imagine that you are developing a system that operates on some data.
Should you persist some data in a database, an ordered log, or a properties file? Does it need to be persisted at all, or would it be acceptable to recompute it on start? Or even to accept that the data will be lost on restart? In a vacuum, it is impossible to argue fruitfully for one of these solutions over any other.</p>

<p>All of these solutions (and more) are reasonable, depending on the context.
They all have tradeoffs: initial implementation effort, running costs, maintenance, monitoring.
But too often I see engineers choose a too-complicated, too-expensive, option because the stupid-simple solution made them uneasy.</p>

<p>Look, I’m not arguing that you should sleepwalk into tech debt.
I’m saying that when you have many options available to you to solve a problem, and the simple option makes you feel uneasy, you should step back and consider <em>why</em>.
Often, there’s a sound reason why the simple solution doesn’t work.
Sometimes there isn’t.
When there isn’t, you save yourself the trouble of implementing the complex solution, and your teammates the trouble of maintaining it.</p>

<p>Until now, I’ve discussed only the tradeoffs involved in writing new software.
But the cardinal sin is to reject imperfection in existing code.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing: it doesn’t matter what decision <em>might</em> have been made before this code was written.
The fact is, it exists.
Often it makes us uneasy.
Sometimes the wrong tradeoff was made.</p>

<p>You have a moral obligation to make the code you work on a better place for future engineers.
However, there comes a point (quickly) where re-engineering existing code is a waste of time.
Do the small things that  make the code more hospitable.
If you want to do anything more, consider carefully.</p>

<p>How many times have you heard a teammate say they’re picking up a refactor as part of their ticket only for it to get out of hand and completely halt progress on their primary goal? How many of these refactors are eventually abandoned before completion? How often does this result in two parallel models for the same thing, making the codebase even more confusing?</p>

<p>There are other advantages to tolerating imperfection.</p>

<p><a href="https://fs.blog/2020/03/chestertons-fence/">You might not really understand why the code is the way it is</a>.
The original authors might have made the perfect tradeoff, but you can’t see that from your position.
Your unease is unfounded and more akin to that of the junior engineer or student.
Always account for the possibility that your intuition is wrong.</p>

<p>Rewriting a junior engineer’s code demoralises.
If a junior has done something that isn’t right, don’t take it upon yourself to rewrite it.
First, decide if something needs to be done.
Maybe it doesn’t.
If it does, see if you can work with the junior to work towards a better solution.
Now this is a positive learning experience.
There is nothing more discouraging than discovering that a senior silently rewrote your code.</p>

<p>You must be able to tolerate imperfection if you are to get anything done at all.
Nothing we ever do will be perfect.
It’s a fool’s errand to try to make it so.</p>

<p>Imagine a race between two people. They are moving at the same exact speed. The only difference is that one of them got a 10-second headstart. That person has the advantage of being ahead the entire race, even though they are doing the exact same thing, moving at the exact same speed. They are always winning while the other person is always losing. Now imagine that race is not a simple sprint or even a marathon, but a race as long as life. This illustrates the unthinkable advantage of getting ahead. It is no harder for the person with the headstart to maintain their lead than it is for the person losing the entire way to maintain the distance they trail behind. In fact, it may in some cases be easier to stay ahead.</p>



<p>Another way to help illustrate this point is to look at the difference between savings and debt. Imagine two people both earn the same breakeven income to cover their same costs of living. The only difference is that one person starts with a little bit of savings and the other person starts with a little bit of debt. This small initial difference in their wealth will not only remain over time — it will actually grow much larger. The first person’s savings work for them, earning them interest over time. The second person’s debt works against them, charging them interest over time. Keep in mind, they are both earning the same income to cover the same costs of living the entire time. In this case, it is significantly easier for the person with the headstart to maintain their advantage than it is for the other person to maintain the amount by which they trail behind. Even if they both do the exact same thing over the long haul, the advantage granted by the initial headstart only increases over time.</p>



<p>This phenomenon applies in a number of other areas as well. Instead of thinking of it as the difference in a competition between two people, one can also think of it as the difference between two possible versions of oneself.</p>



<p>For example, one can lose the weight they want to lose in a relatively short period of time and then maintain a lower weight for years with no more effort than they would have needed to maintain their old heavier weight over time. All else equal, that person can enjoy the benefit of being in better shape for the rest of their life all because they put in some extra work for a short time to get down to their target weight just once.</p>



<p>This is the value of catching up and getting ahead. An early advantage can offer a lead for life. By putting in the short-term work in various areas to catch up and then get ahead, one can stay ahead in all of these areas without any more long-term effort in each, and often with less. This allows them to move on to catching up and getting ahead in other areas. The virtuous cycle continues.</p>



<p>Humans seem hardwired to always be behind. In school, kids do not do all of their assignments a week before they are due. They do them all the night before they are due. Most people tend to focus on not getting too far behind rather than on catching up and getting ahead. They fail to realize that it would often take the same or less effort to maintain a lead as it does the deficit. </p>



<p>Catching up and getting ahead is not necessarily easy, but once it is done, it is just as easy to stay ahead as it would have been to stay where one started. Catching up and getting ahead of wherever one is at the moment takes less time than that over which the benefits of doing so may be enjoyed. Get some leads in life. It is no harder and often easier to stay ahead than it is to stay behind. Why keep losing when you could just as easily keep winning? Catch up. Get ahead.</p>

August 9, 2020 | https://ahsmart.com/pub/juliacon2020/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ahsmart.com/pub/juliacon2020/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span> Aug 8, 2020 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 mins read</span></p>
<p><img src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/juliacon2020/juliacon_background_art.png" alt="juliacon"></p>
<p>The year of 2020 is interesting as the COVID-19 pandemic forces everyone to really think about how they communicate and work with each other. Technology conferences are hit particularly hard. As most people cannot travel anymore, and with the constraint of social distancing, it has become impractical to organize physical conferences anymore.</p>
<p>I just finished <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/">JuliaCon 2020</a> and I had a great experience.  So I would like to share my thoughts here.</p>

<p>JuliaCon has made a new record this year.</p>
<p>To get a taste of the scale, JuliaCon 2019 had about 400 attendees. In 2020, over 10,000 people registered prior to the conference. Dr. Viral Shah, co-founder and CEO of Julia Computing, reported 24,000 unique visitors at the YouTube channel by the end of the conference.</p>
<p><img src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/juliacon2020/juliacon_24000_viewers.png" alt="viewer stats"></p>
<p>It is known that the Julia Language has been doubling its users every year.  So there is already a popularity effect.  However, the combination of a free conference that anybody can participate online from anywhere in the world makes a huge difference.</p>
<p>Reference: <strong><em>Julia has been downloaded more than 17 million times and is used at more than 1,500 universities</em></strong> from Julia Computing's <a href="https://juliacomputing.com/blog/2020/07/17/julia-con.html">July 2020 newsletter</a>. By contrast, the <a href="https://juliacomputing.com/blog/2019/07/02/july-newsletter.html">July 2019 newsletter</a> claimed 9 million downloads.</p>

<p>When you go to a physical conference, you usually attend a session by sitting there and watching the speaker talk for half an hour.  You probably keep quiet and possibly taking some notes during the talk. When the talk is finished, you may have a few minutes to chat with some people around you and share with each other about any thoughts of the the session.</p>
<p><strong>At a virtual conference, the communication style is completely changed.</strong></p>
<p>In particular, the JuliaCon organizers set up a <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> server as a primary chat platform. The talks were all pre-recorded (except keynotes) so that the videos can start and finish on time.</p>
<p><strong>Now, two interesting things happen as everyone watched the talk at the same time:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The attendees were very chatty. People started asking questions and leaving comments on Discord about the topic or when they encountered any kind of “ah-ha” moments.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The speaker actually engages with the attendees and answering questions on Discord.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's a part of the conversations that happened during the talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_8kW8nlElY">The ups and downs of convincing to switch to Julia in a company</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/juliacon2020/juliacon_discord3.png" alt="discord"></p>
<p><strong>That's an important change in dynamics.</strong> Never before, the speaker of the talk is able to engage with such a wide spectrum of audience and have a meaningful conversation online, in real-time.</p>

<p>If I were to attend the conference at Lisbon, I would have prepared two large posters for my <a href="https://github.com/tk3369/BinaryTraits.jl">BinaryTraits.jl</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tk3369/ContextTracking.jl">ContextTracking.jl</a> packages. Since the conference became online, I have to create PDF files that is optimized for online viewing.  In other words, they look more like slides than posters.</p>
<p><img src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/juliacon2020/juliacon_my_posters.png" alt="posters"></p>
<p><strong>How do we engage with people that are just “stopping by”?</strong></p>
<p>JuliaCon organized two separate 90-minute poster sessions.  Each session covers approximately 15-20 posters.  The arrangement is that a single audio channel is open for the session.</p>
<p><strong>It was a little awkward if the poster presenters just sit there and wait for people to ask questions.</strong></p>
<p>We decided to have each presenter spend few minutes to explain his/her poster.  A moderator helped arrange and lined up the presenters.  After the presentation, attendees can go to the specific poster chat channel on Discord for further conversations.</p>
<p>For a physical conference, people sometimes get bored sitting in the talks and so they walk around and find the poster sessions and chat with people around. At an online conference, this behavior doesn't exist - when I get bored, I just walk around my house rather than visiting a poster session. For that reason, I feel that the poster sessions were a little under-represented. </p>

<p>One of the best things about attending a conference is to meet people that are like-minded.  As the attendees come from different background, you are able to learn from each other across different industries, technologies, etc. This kind of massive cross-pollination really helps innovation.</p>
<p>At a virtual conference, it becomes more challenging.  Chatting on Discord isn’t the same as talking to someone face to face.  For that reason, the JuliaCon organizers came up with two very interesting ideas - <em>Gather Town</em> and <em>Minecraft</em>.</p>
<p><strong>A Gather Town was set up so that you can just walk around a virtual map and meet up with other attendees. Here, let me thank the <a href="https://gather.town/">Gather Town</a> developers for their generosity and support of the conference.</strong> </p>
<p><img src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/juliacon2020/juliacon_map.png" alt="gather"></p>
<p>The app runs in the browser without any software installation.  Once you sign in with a name, you can start walking around and explore different areas.  When you get close to another attendee, a video stream instantly pops up at the top and you can start chatting with each other.  The technology is peer-to-peer.  It runs fairly smoothly up to about 8 people.</p>
<p><img src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/juliacon2020/juliacon_gather_boat_chat.png" alt="gather"></p>
<p>To spice up the fun, Ian Butterworth, the same person that introduced Gather Town to the Julia community, partnered up with Cormullion, author of <a href="https://juliamono.netlify.app/">JuliaMono font</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Luxor.jl">Luxor.jl</a>, to create a wormhole in the map. When you fall in the wormhole, you can experience a whole different kind of world. After exploring 5 levels of the worlds, you can return to the regular JuliaCon lobby.</p>
<p><img src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/juliacon2020/juliacon_wormhole_pi.png" alt="gather"></p>
<p><img src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/juliacon2020/juliacon_wormhole_illuminati.png" alt="gather"></p>
<p>I could see probably around 75 people at Gather Town during peak time. Perhaps not everyone is comfortable doing video chats yet. I imagine that may change in the future as online video chat becomes a normal activity. </p>
<p>In addition, a Minecraft server was created. The JuliaCon was originally planned to be in Lisbon, Portugal, until we all got hit by the pandemic.  The Minecraft server has a mini Lisbon town center created for attendees to get a taste of of Lisbon. I did not sign in to the Minecraft server but let me share the following image contributed by Ahan Sengupta.</p>
<p><img src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/juliacon2020/juliacon_minecraft.png" alt="minecraft"></p>
<p>Having these kinds of virtual worlds makes the conference experience more fun and enjoyable.</p>

<p>Another thoughtful idea with this year’s JuliaCon was the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sECiJ59hPXg&amp;list=PLP8iPy9hna6TXDX1I1hH_SM49zSxdnSYJ&amp;index=7">daily podcasts</a> during the conference.  Some of the most influential people from the Julia community were invited to the podcasts for interviews. </p>
<p><img src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/juliacon2020/juliacon_podcast.png" alt="podcast"></p>
<p>The best part is that the content of the podcast was largely influenced by suggestions/comments from the attendees.  Every day, the hosts would ask everyone to submit who they want to see in the upcoming episodes 👇👇👇</p>
<p><img src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/juliacon2020/juliacon_podcast_note.png" alt="podcast note"></p>
<p>The last episode of the podcast also includes a collage of short clips from the attendees. That really made the conference experience first-class. I certainly feel very engaged when attending the conference.</p>

<p>Because the talks are pre-recorded, the speakers had a lot of flexibility in preparing the video. For example, if the recording turned out to be too long, then the speaker could just increase the frame rate by 10-25% to make it fit the conference session time limit.</p>
<p>Apparently, Keno Fischer's beard was totally prepared just for the conference and he shaved it off immediately after the conference.</p>
<p><img src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/juliacon2020/juliacon_keno_beard.png" alt="keno's beard"></p>
<p>In summary, I had a great experience at JuliaCon this year. The virtual experience was even better than a physical one in some ways. I do miss the chance of having a more physical interaction with the community, like having a boat ride or having casual conversations over lunches/dinner.</p>
<p>Hats off to the JuliaCon organizers! They have done an amazing job during this difficult time.</p>
<p>I hope it will be just as fun in the years forward.

                            The 158 passengers on a flight between Nice and Oslo will have to self-quarantine for 10 days.                         </p>
                    
                    
<div>

<p>Norway announced Thursday that it was classifying France as a "red zone". All passengers returning from the country and entering Norway would have to self-quarantine for 10 days. That evening, a plane carrying passengers from France to Norway touched down at one minute past midnight, one minute after the measure went into effect.</p><p>Despite this rather unique yet bizarre situation passengers will have to follow the new rules and stay at home for the next week and a half.</p></div>

                        <p>In finance, everyone knows about compound interest. You’ve got a pile of stuff (usually money) that can grow on its own. It grows in proportion to the size of the pile. The bigger the pile gets, the more it grows. You can make the pile bigger in two ways. You can add to it yourself. Or, you can just let it grow on its own over time. For example, you can put your money in a bank account. Then, you add a little money to it every month, and the bank pays you interest for letting them hold your money. Your money grows. Even if you stopped adding your own money, the bank would keep paying you interest. Your money pile would continue to grow. </p><p>History is filled with three kinds of people: the kind who reap the benefits of compound interest, the kind who miss out on it, and the kind who get shafted by it. Remember, the bigger the pile, the more it can grow. Over time, this can make you very rich. Unless of course your pile periodically shrinks or catches fire and turns to ashes, or you blow it on something silly.</p><p>Compound interest can be slow at the start, but once it builds momentum, it takes off like nothing else. It’s an exponential process. Slow at first, but as fast as a mad squirrel on twelve shots of espresso towards the end. If your money grows with compound interest and your competition’s money doesn’t, you will eventually leave your competition in the dust. Even if they have a better start. </p><figure><img src="https://methodicallyprocessing.com/content/images/2020/07/Compound_v_Linear.png" alt="" srcset="https://methodicallyprocessing.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Compound_v_Linear.png 600w, https://methodicallyprocessing.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Compound_v_Linear.png 1000w, https://methodicallyprocessing.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Compound_v_Linear.png 1600w, https://methodicallyprocessing.com/content/images/2020/07/Compound_v_Linear.png 1700w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Given enough time, compound growth can overtake linear growth without fail. Here, despite the yellow line starting higher, compound growth (teal) overtakes it in just 6 years and quickly pulls away.</figcaption></figure><p>You might have heard of a gentleman by the name of John Williams. He’s a film composer. When he was a kid, he learned how to use a handful of tools. He learned how to use a pencil, paper, an eraser, and a piano. And then he went off and did something absolutely remarkable, especially by our modern standards. He kept using pencil, paper, eraser, and piano for the next eight decades of his life. I know. It’s a wholly bizarre and staggering concept in our world where there are 8,000 ways to keep a checklist on your pocket-sized supercomputer.</p><p>So, this Williams fellow has written music for Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Close Encounters, Jaws, the Olympics, Harry Potter, Schindler’s List, and hundreds of these incredibly successful movies, TV shows, and even concert works with nothing but pencil, paper, eraser, and piano.</p><p>Now, you turn around and look at what we all do in the modern world. We’re always retooling. People who code keep switching to the next best thing. They change text editors, languages, keyboard arrangements, you name it. Musicians switch their music-making software, the musical instruments they play, the samples they use. Let’s not get started on productivity people and their million schemes for keeping checklists. If you write checklist/todo/task apps, you're basically in a recursive new market. Just write a new one every year or so and you'll have and endless stream of customers. </p><p>It’s all done in the name of experimenting, but really, everyone’s playing a lottery and hoping to get lucky. “What tool can I find that’ll make me successful?”</p><p>As people wade through the crap, on the rare chance that the stars align, they happen on something really good. You’d be surprised <a href="https://money.com/gold-silver-platinum-sewage-study/">what you can find in sewers</a>. So now you’ve also got this addictive mechanism at play. Nothing tickles the gooey grey jelly in between our ears like random rewards. You grind through a bunch of tools, and then from time to time you get a nice blast of dopamine. So you get hooked on the search. You just want to find the next dopamine hit.</p><p>I think there's something funny going on. Everyone’s playing musical chairs with their tools and, now this could just be me, but I’m not seeing anything dramatically more compelling than what people could do with the tools a decade ago, or even twenty years ago.</p><p>Yeah we’ve got a lot more power at our disposal, yeah we’ve got much better access to a variety of tools, but at the individual level you don’t see a lot of divergence. Writers today aren’t exactly out-producing a Voltaire or Lope de Vega in quantity, let alone quality. No one's coding circles around John Carmack with his quaint C++. How could they? Who's got time to write code in the midst of all the new languages they could be learning. </p><p>Again go back and look at film music. Are people writing music that’s 10 times better than John Williams? No. Some even argue the quality of film music isn’t as artisanal these days. But that’s subjective. Are people today able to write 10 more music than a man who was born closer in time to Tchaikovsky than to today? An old man who uses an archaic pencil, paper, an eraser and a piano to write his music? No. Most composers are far less prolific. And the few that are more prolific are only modestly so. Hans Zimmer has &nbsp;spent many orders of magnitude more money on his studio than John Williams on his. I wouldn’t say he’s orders of magnitudes more prolific or even subjectively better.</p><p>Most of us are accomplishing nothing, because we’re trapped searching for something to help us accomplish something.</p><h2 id="the-great-search-has-great-costs-">The great search has great costs.</h2><p>The great search can occasionally pay off. That’s not the problem. The problem is when the search doesn’t stop. The search means you find a pile of money....and then you set fire to it and go looking for a slightly bigger pile of money. Okay, it might not be that bad. Certain skills transfer, so you take some money over with you. But you never give a pile the time it needs to grow and compound. So unless you get really lucky and find a pile that’s enormous, you’re missing out on compounding effects.</p><p>It’s like you put $1,000 in some magic bank account that returns 5% every year, and after a year you say, "what the hell I only have $1,050? I’m going to go look for something that has $1,100 in it." So, you spend another three years finding and burning piles of money looking for the one that starts a little bigger and then you find it. Of course if you do the math, by the time you find the pile that’s worth $1,100, the original pile, if you’d stuck to it, would be worth $1220. </p><p>There are costs to retooling. There’s a time cost. There’s the cost of the tool itself. And importantly, you lose, if not all of your compounding effects, you lose enough to hold you back.</p><figure><img src="https://methodicallyprocessing.com/content/images/2020/08/CompoundInterest.png" alt="" srcset="https://methodicallyprocessing.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/CompoundInterest.png 600w, https://methodicallyprocessing.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/CompoundInterest.png 1000w, https://methodicallyprocessing.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/CompoundInterest.png 1600w, https://methodicallyprocessing.com/content/images/2020/08/CompoundInterest.png 1742w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Every time you retool you lose a little bit of your compounded interest. Over the long run this can slow you down a lot, as you can see with the grey line compared to the teal line. The exception is if you get lucky and you retool to something that gets you equal or better to the teal line.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>I imagine that in his late eighties, &nbsp;John Williams feels like pencil, paper, eraser, and piano are extensions of his body, mind, and soul. He doesn’t need to figure out how a pencil works or how to draw a note. There’s no confusion about what the black keys on the piano do versus the white keys. So he can be free to create, express, tinker, and experiment.</p><p>Once he gets to that point, he’s got a clear edge. The more you can experiment, the more you can tinker without being obstructed by things like “what the heck does this button do?” the more prolific you can be. You can be prolific at a much higher quality.</p><p>At age 88, John Williams is writing scraps that others can’t even dream about.</p><p>Would John Williams be more creative and have more musical opportunities if he adopted music notation software or a DAW instead of sticking to paper, pencil, eraser, and piano? It’s possible he would do things differently. But is there something that software does that his tools can’t achieve? I’d argue not.</p><p>I’d actually argue that you have the opposite problem. Simpler tools give you far more flexibility than more complicated tools. With pencil and paper Williams can invent a whole new way to explore and write down his music. He can doodle pictures in the margins when he gets bored. He can scribble down an idea for later. The more complicated the tool, the more locked workflows there are. Complicated tools are someone else’s <em>designed</em> workflow. By definition, they lock you into that workflow. The best tools let you design your own workflow. Pencil and paper win there. With his pencil and paper, John Williams has a lot of freedom in how he approaches music than someone who is writing in a DAW.</p><p>That's a lot of why we switch tools. The designed workflows don't meet our needs, so we go searching for something that does. Maybe instead of searching for other designed workflows, you'd be better off stepping back and finding a simpler tool for the job? </p><p>I’m not saying you can’t stumble on something that will unleash a personal golden age for you. But it’s unlikely that you will. Just the same, I’m not saying sticking to your tools will guarantee success. But it will make it more likely.</p><p>Success is a function of performance and luck. You need to be good and you need to be lucky. Sticking to your tools improves your performance with those tools, and indirectly it makes it more likely that you get lucky. See, when you know your tools well, you perform better, and when you perform better, you can be more prolific. A person who is prolific has more chances to be lucky than a person who isn't prolific. </p><p>What the modern world does really well is expand access to tools. That means more people have access to a lot more potential. But here's the thing, a lot of that potential is locked up in compound interest. You have to stick with something to really unlock its power. Ideally, stick with the simplest tool that helps you do what you need. </p><h2 id="it-s-okay-to-enjoy-the-search-">It’s okay to enjoy the search.</h2><p>You might be worried about being too specialized. Frankly, I would agree that people in this day and age are too specialized. But I don’t think you can call yourself a generalist just …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="content" itemscope=""><header><p><br><time datetime="2019-12-18" itemprop="datePublished">2019-12-18</time></p><hr></header><p><span>A few months ago,</span> I pulled a muscle in my lower back, by rock climbing after doing lots of back-bends and handstand practice. I quickly went from feeling fairly nimble to hobbling around with limited mobility and an inability to sit at a desk. Argh!</p><p>Happily, I was prepared with some very comfortable and ergonomic<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> ways to use the computer while laying down (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supine_position">supine</a>). After about a week of doing this and phasing in some exercise, I could finally stand up straight again!</p><p>This post describes variations on supine computing – what's worked best for me so far.</p><h2 id="hammock-computing"><a href="#hammock-computing"></a>Hammock Computing!</h2><p>The best variety of supine computing is in a hammock! Here is a photo from summer of 2018:</p><p><img src="https://mgsloan.com/posts/images/back-yard-hammock.jpg" alt="Using a computer ergonomically in a hammock, via external split keyboard and computer suspended above head" width="1280" height="960"></p><p>This is highly ergonomic – most joints are in quite neutral positions. In particular, your neck can be fully relaxed because the screen is above your head.</p><p>In the photo above, the laptop is suspended via <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Releasable-cable-inch-50LBS-100pcs/dp/B00ANAWGM2?tag=mgsloan06-20">releasable zip ties</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup> threaded through a nice strap that came with some gymnastic rings. Ratchet straps are even better for this purpose, as they have a builtin way to tension them. In the photo below, a ratchet strap is tensioned from one end of the hammock stand to the other:</p><p><img src="https://mgsloan.com/posts/images/back-yard-hammock-strap.jpg" alt="strap tensioned across hammock stand" width="1280" height="1370"></p><p>In this case, zip ties are attaching to little wire loops wrapped around the laptop's hinges. Loops like this, or carabiners, are not necessary but they are a bit more convenient. With most ThinkPad laptops, and likely many other brands, its possible to thread the zip ties through between the body and screen or at the hinges. Here's a more recent picture showing this:</p><p><img src="https://mgsloan.com/posts/images/zip-tied-x1-carbon.jpg" alt="zip tie threaded through x1 carbon" width="1280" height="853"></p><p>I find that ThinkPads are more than sturdy enough to be suspended by their hinges. Sometimes I'll have the full weight on one hinge, while attaching the other. Please use your best judgment about what your laptop can handle<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p><h2 id="not-just-for-hammocks"><a href="#not-just-for-hammocks"></a>Not just for hammocks</h2><p>This is probably obvious, but supine computing is not just for hammocks! It's great for computing anywhere you can lay down. Since I also want to encourage computing outdoors and hammocking, all of the photos below will involve a <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Flowerhouse-FlyingSaucer-Hanging-Lounge-FHFSSVR-SET/dp/B07DB5LGNQ?tag=mgsloan06-20">"flying saucer" hammock</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup>.</p><h2 id="laziest-approach-pillows-but-poor-ergonomics"><a href="#laziest-approach-pillows-but-poor-ergonomics"></a>Laziest approach: pillows (but poor ergonomics)</h2><p>This approach can be quite convenient for short sessions:</p><p><img src="https://mgsloan.com/posts/images/supine-pillowing.jpg" alt="using pillow head support in circular hammock" width="1280" height="853"></p><p>Using a <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Kinesis-Advantage2-Ergonomic-Keyboard-KB600/dp/B07K1SMRGS?tag=mgsloan06-20">Kinesis Advantage 2</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup> keyboard works quite well in this posture, since there is a good amount of space between your hands. This might not be viable with other types of keyboards, but certainly worth a try.</p><p>The neck ergonomics are not ideal, though – doing extended sessions like this can cause neck soreness. So, please try to avoid that!</p><h2 id="much-better-screen-above-head--split-keyboard"><a href="#much-better-screen-above-head--split-keyboard"></a>Much better: screen above head + split keyboard</h2><p>Ideally, the screen would be above your head. Here, it's suspended via the same zip tie approach as above:</p><p><img src="https://mgsloan.com/posts/images/ergo-supine.jpg" alt="screen above head + split keyboard supine computing" width="1280" height="853"></p><p>Another improvement in this picture is using a split keyboard. In this case it's a <a href="https://keyboard.io/">keyboard.io</a>, but other split keyboards like the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">ErgoDox</a> can work great too. By placing the keyboard halves to either side, your arms can be in a more relaxed position.</p><p>This is much better than the prior supine posture. It doesn't seem to put much strain anywhere, and so is quite viable for extended computing sessions. It's also quite simple – split keyboard to either side, and screen above your head.</p><h2 id="other-suspension-methods"><a href="#other-suspension-methods"></a>Other suspension methods</h2><p>There are a huge variety of other ways to suspend a horizontal display above you. Pretty much any well anchored rope or strap will support the zip-ties-around-hinges approach. Here are a few more suspension ideas:</p><ul><li><p>Simply screw hooks into a strut in the ceiling.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B007VL3CB0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?tag=mgsloan06-20">Suction cups</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup> worked surprisingly well when I tried them, but only on smooth ceilings.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/s?tag=mgsloan06-20">3M Command Hooks</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup> work well on walls and slanted ceilings, but not well on flat ceilings, as they are not very strong perpendicular to the surface.

Like nearly all of these stands, their intended use does not involve the screen being entirely horizontal. For the MagicHold stand, the usual zip tie configuration can be used. I suspect for many of the stands, more direct attachment of the laptop could allow them to be used for fully horizontal supine computing.</p></li></ul><h2 id="other-supine-approaches"><a href="#other-supine-approaches"></a>Other supine approaches</h2><ul><li><p>I have a vague recollection from around ten years ago of <a href="https://timothy.hobbs.cz/">Timothy Hobbs</a> sharing a photo of supine computing on some freenode <abbr>IRC</abbr> channel, with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataHand">DataHand split keyboard</a> and a screen suspended above his head via a cardboard box. I googled for "timthelion data hands" and came across <a href="http://xirdalium.net/2008/02/10/laid-back/">a post from 2008</a> which ends with a more evolved version of his supine computing setup, which appears to be using a desk to support the monitor. It looks like more recently he's also had some interesting <a href="https://timothy.hobbs.cz/wearable-computing/adventures.html">adventures in outdoor wearable computing</a>.</p></li><li><p>After deciding to call this post "Supine Computing", I googled that phrase and came across a post by Justin Craig-Kuhn, titled <a href="https://medium.com/@jcraigk/healthy-hacking-diy-supine-workstation-cbaadcbbc2aa">"<abbr>DIY</abbr> Supine Workstation"</a>. He kindly gave me permission to reuse his photo here:</p><p><img src="https://mgsloan.com/posts/images/supine-jcg.jpg" alt="Justin Craig-Kuhn's supine setup" width="1280" height="916"></p><p>Cool stuff!! A couple notes on this:</p><ul><li><p>He's using an ipad as a screen along with a gooseneck tablet mount. This has nice adjustability, and is more elegant than putting a full laptop there. However, as he points out, using an IPad as a display adds some lag, about 20ms.</p></li><li><p>The keyboard position may well be better than mine, because each half is oriented vertically. This allows forearm rotation to be in the middle of its range rather than near its limit. I don't feel strain there, though, so I don't feel the need to do this.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>There are a variety of expensive solutions for reclined / supine computing workstations. For example, the offerings from <a href="https://altwork.com/">AltWork</a> and <a href="http://www.ergoquest.com/">ErgoQuest</a> are quite visually dramatic:</p><p><img src="https://mgsloan.com/posts/images/stations.jpg" alt="Expensive reclining workstations from AltWork and ErgoQuest" width="1280" height="480"></p><p>While I find these workstations quite cool, right now I can't justify the expense and non-portability. I prefer approaches which are inexpensive, portable, and use commonly found materials, such that they are more easily shared.</p></li></ul><h2 id="getting-weird-upside-down-belay-glasses"><a href="#getting-weird-upside-down-belay-glasses"></a>Getting weird: upside down belay glasses</h2><p>Alternatively, belay glasses can be used to allow your neck to be in a neutral position:</p><p><img src="https://mgsloan.com/posts/images/belay-glasses.jpg" alt="supine computing with belay glasses" width="1280" height="853"></p><p>Specifically, these are <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N1EYI37?tag=mgsloan06-20">clip on belay glasses</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup>, which can be used while belaying someone rock climbing, to allow you to watch the climber without craning your neck.

<p>The questions we often hear are “Why create a new query language?” and
            “What’s wrong with SQL?”.  This post contains answers to both.</p>
<p>Before we begin, let’s overview some of the history of how the relational
            model came to be, and how SQL was created.</p>
<div id="a-brief-history-of-the-relational-model-and-sql">
<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-the-relational-model-and-sql"><a href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#a-brief-history-of-the-relational-model-and-sql"><svg width="35" height="35" viewBox="0 0 35 35"><path d="M2.694 6.631h19.085v3.961h-1.944V8.574H4.636v10.962h15.199V17.52h1.944v3.96H2.694V6.632zM13.3 13.085h19.086v14.848H13.3v-3.962h1.942v2.019h15.2V15.027h-15.2v2.017H13.3v-3.96z" fill="#047CFF"></path></svg></a>A Brief History of the Relational Model and SQL</h2>
<p>The relational model was introduced by Edgar F. Codd in a seminal 1970 paper
                “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks” <span>[<a id="id1" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1970">4</a>]</span>.
                There, Codd postulated that all data in a database can be represented in
                terms of sets of tuples, called <em>relations</em>. Codd also invented a form of
                first-order predicate logic to describe the database queries: <em>tuple
                    relational calculus</em>.</p>
<p>Codd’s ideas were revolutionary.  For the first time, a database,
                and a universal way to query it, was described in a succinct, consistent
                mathematical model.  This, naturally, created lots of interest in further
                research and, importantly, into practical implementation of the relational
                model.</p>
<p>In 1974 Donald Chamberlin and Raymond Boyce published a paper
                <span>[<a id="id2" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fchamberlin-1974">2</a>]</span>, which introduced “a set of simple operations on tabular
                structures, […] of equivalent power to the first order predicate calculus”.
                Chamberlin and Boyce felt that the formal relational query languages proposed
                at the time were too hard to understand for “users without formal training in
                mathematics or computer programming” and thought that the “predominant use of
                the language would be for ad-hoc queries” <span>[<a id="id3" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fchamberlin-2012">3</a>]</span>.  Initially,
                the authors did not consider SQL to be a “serious” language.  Nonetheless,
                the great interest in the commercial application of the relational model had
                pushed IBM to quickly adopt and productize SQL, which was also picked up by
                their quickly-rising competitor–Oracle.</p>
<p>IBM had an overwhelmingly large influence over the tech market at the time,
                so SQL became a de facto standard for relational databases, and then a proper
                standard with the publication of the first ANSI standard in 1989 that
                essentially circumscribed the most prominent existing implementations
                of SQL.  Subsequent versions of the standard continued to be primarily
                influenced by the commercial vendors.</p>
<p>Today, SQL is by far the most widely used database language.  But that does
                not necessarily mean that it represents the best of what we can do.
                In fact, SQL’s beginnings as a “simple, ad-hoc” language coupled with
                “design by implementation” from competing vendors had left the language with
                a baggage of severe issues.</p>
</div>
<div id="critique-of-sql">

<p>SQL, especially its earlier versions, was heavily criticized by the experts,
                including Codd himself <span>[<a id="id4" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1990">6</a>]</span>, as well as C. J. Date, who published a
                multitude of papers and books on the subject (<span>[<a id="id5" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1985">7</a>]</span>, <span>[<a id="id6" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1987">9</a>]</span>,
                <span>[<a id="id7" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-2009">10</a>]</span>).  While many of the early shortcomings were fixed in the later
                versions of the standard, some of the serious issues had been only further
                ingrained.</p>
<p>Some of the complaints here apply to SQL as a whole, while others are specific
                to a certain implementation.  We are primarily using PostgreSQL for the
                examples.</p>
<p>SQL’s shortcomings can be grouped into these categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>lack of proper orthogonality — SQL is hard to compose;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lack of compactness — SQL is a large language;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lack of consistency — SQL is inconsistent in syntax and semantics;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>poor system cohesion — SQL does not integrate well enough with
                        application languages and protocols.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div id="lack-of-orthogonality">

<p>Orthogonality in a programming language means that a relatively small set
                    of primitive constructs can be combined in a relatively small number of ways.
                    A language with good orthogonality is smaller, more consistent, and is
                    easier to learn due to there being few exceptions from the overall set of
                    rules.  Conversely, bad orthogonality leads to a large language with many
                    exceptions and caveats.</p>
<p>A good example of orthogonality in a programming language is the ability to
                    substitute an arbitrary part of an expression with a variable, or a function
                    call, without any effect on the final result.</p>
<p>In SQL, such generic substitution is not possible, since there are <em>two</em>
                    mutually incompatible kinds of expressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <em>table expression</em> is a SQL expression that yields a table:
                            <code>SELECT * FROM table</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>scalar expression</em> is a SQL expression that yields a single scalar value:
                            <code>SELECT count(*) FROM table</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Table expressions can only be used in a <code>FROM</code> clause, in a function, or with
                    an operator that specifically expects a table expression as input.
                    What’s worse the scalar and table expressions may have exactly the same syntax,
                    which can be a source of further confusion.</p>
<p>For example, let’s imagine we needed to list the names of all department
                    heads in a company.  This query would do the job:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> name
<span>FROM</span> emp
<span>WHERE</span> role <span>=</span> <span>'dept head'</span></span></span></pre>
<p>Now let’s say we needed to add this bit to a larger query that extracts
                    information about a department.  An intuitive way is to simply add the
                    above as a subquery to the target list of our larger query:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span>
    dept<span>.</span>name<span>,</span>
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
    <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> name <span>FROM</span> emp
     <span>WHERE</span> role <span>=</span> <span>'dept head'</span> <span>AND</span> deptno <span>=</span> dept<span>.</span><span>no</span><span>)</span>
<span>FROM</span>
    dept
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></span></span></pre>
<p>This is legal, but <em>only</em> if the subquery returns not more than one row.
                    Otherwise, an error would be raised at run time.  To account for multiple
                    department heads, we would need to rewrite the query using a join:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span>
    dept<span>.</span>name<span>,</span>
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
    head<span>.</span>name
<span>FROM</span>
    dept
    <span>INNER</span> <span>JOIN</span> emp <span>AS</span> head
        <span>ON</span> <span>(</span>head<span>.</span>deptno <span>=</span> dept<span>.</span><span>no</span>
            <span>AND</span> head<span>.</span>role <span>=</span> <span>'dept head'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></span></span></pre>
<p>The difference in structure is large enough to make any sort of source-level
                    query reuse impractical.</p>
</div>
<div id="lack-of-compactness">

<div><p>Few claim that SQL is an elegant language characterized by orthogonality.
                        Some call it an elephant on clay feet.  With each addition, its body grows,
                        and it becomes less stable.  SQL standardization is largely the domain of
                        database vendors, not academic researchers without commercial interests
                        or users with user interests. <span>[<a id="id8" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fatzeni-2013">1</a>]</span></p><p>Paolo Atzeni et al.</p></div>
<p>SQL is not a small language. At the time of writing the PostgreSQL
                    implementation contains <b>469 keywords</b>. Just part 2 (out of 14) of the
                    SQL:2016 standard has <b>1732 pages</b>.</p>
<p>The main reason is that SQL, in line with its original goals, strives to be
                    an English-like language, catered to “non-professionals”.  However, with the
                    growth of the language, this verbosity has contributed <em>negatively</em> to the
                    ability to write and comprehend SQL queries.  We learnt this lesson with
                    COBOL, and the world has long since moved on to newer, more succinct
                    programming languages.</p>
<p>In addition to keyword proliferation, the orthogonality issues discussed
                    above make queries more verbose and harder to read.</p>
</div>
<div id="lack-of-consistency">

<p>SQL is arbitrarily inconsistent both in its syntax and semantics. What
                    makes things even worse is that different databases have their own version
                    of SQL, often incompatible with other SQL variants.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of entirely different calling conventions in SQL:</p>

<div><p>In some cases of inadequate handling of missing information,
                        the problem is incorrectly perceived to be a problem of the
                        relational model. In fact, the problem stems from the inadequacies
                        of SQL and its non-conformance to the relational model. <span>[<a id="id9" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1990">6</a>]</span></p><p>Edgar J. Codd</p></div>
<p>It has been extensively argued that <code>NULL</code> is the biggest misfeature of SQL
                    (<span>[<a id="id10" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1987">5</a>]</span>, <span>[<a id="id11" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1986">8</a>]</span>, <span>[<a id="id12" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1987">9</a>]</span>).
                    In fact, the handling of <code>NULL</code> in contemporary SQL implementations is so
                    surprising, inconsistent, and dangerous that this topic deserves a separate
                    section.</p>
<p><code>NULL</code> is so special that it’s not equal to anything, including itself:</p>
<pre><span><span>postgres=# select NULL = NULL;
 ?column?
----------

(1 row)</span></span></pre>
<p>In fact, almost any operation on <code>NULL</code> will return <code>NULL</code> and the
                    effect may be very subtle:</p>
<pre><span><span>postgres=# CREATE TABLE x (a int, b text);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# INSERT INTO x(a, b)
           VALUES (1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (NULL, 'three')
           RETURNING a, b;
 a |   b
---+-------
 1 | one
 2 | two
   | three
(3 rows)

postgres=# SELECT * FROM x WHERE a NOT IN (1, null);
 a | b
---+---
(0 rows)</span></span></pre>
<p>But, in some cases <code>NULL</code>
<em>is</em> equal to itself, such as in <code>DISTINCT</code>:</p>
<pre><span><span>elvis=# SELECT DISTINCT *
        FROM (VALUES (1), (NULL), (NULL)) AS q;
 column1
---------

       1
(2 rows)</span></span></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="w-node-cb7b2f22b997-0c7d327a"><div><p>In the last several years, Kubernetes has become the “go to” standard for managing and orchestrating containerized workloads. Thanks to it’s vendor agnostic nature, you can easily run Kubernetes almost anywhere, and in fact, all the major cloud vendors offer a managed Kubernetes service (AWS EKS, Google GKE, and Azure AKS).</p><p>With Kubernetes, one of the key advantages is the ease of managing multiple environments and workloads in a single cluster, by separating the cluster into logical areas using namespaces. This post will dive into how we can manage this by using Terraform to both manage the cluster provisioning as well as manage the namespaces.</p><h3>Multiple Environments in One Cluster</h3><p>When using Kubernetes for a team, you usually want to have an isolated environment for each developer, <a href="https://www.env0.com/blog/from-feature-branches-to-feature-environments" target="_blank">branch</a>, or pull request. There are a few ways to achieve that using Kubernetes: one way is to create a full blown cluster for each division, but the way we’re focusing on is using <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/" target="_blank">Kubernetes namespaces feature</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While the namespaces feature is quite powerful it’s not without its complications, especially with a large team of developers: How many namespaces do I have on my cluster?&nbsp; Can I remove them? Does anyone use them? Can I schedule them to automatically shut down during night time and weekend? Can I have policies on who can run what and where?&nbsp; Fortunately, with a good management platform, a lot of this can be alleviated.</p><h3>Why Manage Kubernetes using Terraform?</h3><p>As a cloud-native technology that is deployed at wide scale, it’s quite common to manage the deployment of the infrastructure of Kubernetes clusters using Terraform. And where you have many clusters to manage (Dev, Staging, Production, etc.), Terraform allows you to maintain a consistent configuration for the cluster and underlying infrastructure while creating as many clusters as you like with the same configuration in a reliable and easy way.</p><p>Terraform's multi-cloud approach lets you use any cloud provider you wish, including using the native managed services that I’ve mentioned above.</p><p>Similarly, when managing namespaces there’s a few ways, but using Terraform is probably the best overall. The main advantages of using Terraform are:</p><ol role="list"><li>Use the same <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax.html" target="_blank">configuration language</a> to provision the Kubernetes infrastructure and to deploy applications into it.</li><li>drift detection - `terraform plan` will always present you the difference between reality at a given time and the config you intend to apply.</li><li>full lifecycle management - Terraform doesn't just initially create resources, but offers a single command for creation, update, and deletion of tracked resources without needing to inspect the API to identify those resources.</li><li>synchronous feedback - While asynchronous behaviour is often useful, sometimes it's counter-productive as the job of identifying operation results (failures or details of created resource) is left to the user. e.g. you don't have IP/hostname of load balancer until it has finished provisioning, hence you can't create any DNS record pointing to it.</li><li><a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/internals/graph.html" target="_blank">Graph of relationships</a> - Terraform understands relationships between resources which may help in scheduling - e.g. if a Persistent Volume Claim claims space from a particular Persistent Volume, Terraform won't even attempt to create the PVC if creation of the PV has failed.</li></ol><h3>Putting It Into Action</h3><p>I’ve taken the Terraform code from a simple <a href="https://github.com/env0/kubernetes-namespaces-blog-post/tree/eks-cluster/eks_cluster" target="_blank">AWS EKS Terraform example</a>, popular for its ease, to provision a new EKS cluster in my AWS account.</p><p>To run the actual Terraform, I’m using <a href="https://www.env0.com/" target="_blank">env0</a> which allows me to quickly deploy and manage my environments based on Terraform templates. If you’re just getting started with env0, you should first get your organization set up and create a new template (check out the <a href="https://docs.env0.com/docs/create-your-first-template" target="_blank">getting started documentation</a> for help there).</p><p>Now we will run the template which will provision the EKS cluster with env0 and get the outputs:</p><figure id="w-node-6aa3d2fbc5ae-0c7d327a"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5dc3f52851595b160ba99670/5f18b52b56d41547b184b4af_sKiJiFsGGfK8SFTN9gaY_D9_6ULDpCWcv6v_Eh7iyP7PYDUjd2nopdWXUXhnEZNdm_zHwWWAVYXVIbUKyjwywt_u5unz1IVeOnQ4xaezsMOlicvaCCMSftc0tZMgA3G3JI_XkUx-.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Now that our EKS cluster is set up, we can create a new template for the namespaces and our deployment using the cluster name from the outputs.</p><h3>&nbsp;Set up Namespace + Deployment</h3><p>First we use the following code to authenticate against the Kubernetes cluster that we’ve created and create a new deployment with an ngnix:</p><p>So now let’s make (and run) a new template using that Terraform code which will create the namespace and run the deployment:</p><figure id="w-node-64fadb022916-0c7d327a"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5dc3f52851595b160ba99670/5f18b52b47617ffc0af75412_C16Bc8DfUdTWg3wtyz0HMva-_sSIqvLdF_Cbw5b4VACc1e6QGC1P7T4j9_TK0MRmPlp5ok_NCUk7DBAsdl7_pedBetBEzNRMKZoy3Mk08tZnVW2uXAWW6rXPu2bLsVDa7e-J8Z61.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Running <em>kubectl</em> to get the namespace and the deployment and we can see the resources we’ve created inside the cluster:</p><figure id="w-node-f42eb61c7f07-0c7d327a"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5dc3f52851595b160ba99670/5f18b52b941b8f845153acea_O64jHmVmLcgyEyoPR2BkOMSrZhfAHz-vI67jzdC9YWQtljSs-NUZgzljVzGD0ZwWdTIXk-4JIB-fZiYY2kcT7cZifl4v-QlLrvrJ2AWVOMeTpHSLeEyOdxxW_N9qagfYFzKgm07f.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>You can see that we use the <em>aws_eks_cluster</em> and the <em>aws_eks_cluster_auth</em> data resource to get the authentication data, and to be able to create the namespace and the deployment in the cluster.</p><p>There is another way to achieve this and import the state file of the Kubernetes cluster you created, but for simplicity we took a simpler approach. You can read more about it <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/terraform/d/remote_state.html" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>Take advantage of More Features</h3><p>So now that we have a template we can create as many namespaces and deployments as we want, as well as leverage some of the more advanced features of our management platform.</p><p><strong>Scheduling</strong></p><p>First, I want to make sure that those resources aren’t running over night and weekends so let’s set up scheduling for those namespaces:</p><figure id="w-node-57dda8b7bb34-0c7d327a"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5dc3f52851595b160ba99670/5f18b52f3226497c20d3f308_Ec-hkXbdgAPPKF1orDrAwZ-Ydl5cAZYfrpBC-tlT6x1HlWbd0FNBiNF9euwJsQiqmfyRWRdchwYOteJEUeHTtPm36PXVrXv9zPWVf9vcZyyRn_poRdDvsA-DOkHwP8AlBi8C9tsE.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Now, env0 will automatically destroy those namespaces on each workday at midnight and will deploy them at 9am when I start my workday.</p><p>You can even do that on the entire Kubernetes cluster to save even more money.</p><p><strong>Dev Team Environments</strong></p><p>Next, now that we have created an easy way for self service provisioning of environments, we want to set up appropriate permissions for everyone on the team to deploy their own environments. In most cases, we want the EKS cluster to be managed by the DevOps team, while the rest of the dev team should be able to provision their own individual environments.</p><p>You can achieve this by managing different projects with different permissions for each user.&nbsp;</p><p>So now I will give our DevOps team the ability to provision the Kubernetes cluster by assigning them a “Deployer” role, but the developers will be assigned as a Planners so they can request changes on the cluster but will need the approval of the DevOps to make the changes.<br></p><figure id="w-node-26e4a8c99642-0c7d327a"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5dc3f52851595b160ba99670/5f18b52b5031f93da1c0d246_51ifNVZ0FrzvLZql4U5CVBFYS6mB5sQBhJUjl_L-aWEBFeDUx8xq-Osl7f34pm0FIwkABIoh0ICnf0wE-Cf6bmuEH7hlviMMWmOmaRSd2bRAd0z4PrKRNxo_MakAvU1Y2FWaZeCc.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>For the ephemeral namespaces Project the developers can have a “Deployer” role so they will be able to create environments whenever they like, but everything will be cost effective and no resource will be left behind.</p><h3>Summary&nbsp;</h3><p>As this is a simple example of provisioning an EKS cluster with relevant deployment, we actually created a balance between a self service way to get resources and governance and a cost efficient way to manage those cloud resources without losing control.</p><p>In addition you can achieve this with any other managed kubernetes service like AKS and GKE, or even just a self managed cluster.</p><p>You can also leverage env0’s API and CLI to fully automate a per pull request environment, so each PR will get its own namespace and deployment, and once the PR will be merged to master, it will automatically tear down those resources.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>High performing teams thrive on accountability. Accountability is the foundation for a culture that gets stuff done: if you say you’ll do something, we all trust that it will happen. Accountability is empowering, creates great opportunities for learning, and allows the company to move faster. You can’t succeed in a competitive environment without it.</p>

<p>The more complex your organization, the more elusive accountability becomes. Startups foster learning because they’re high-accountability arenas: it’s immediately obvious when Bob isn’t towing the line. As a company scales, accountability easily gets lost if ownership isn’t well-defined and outcomes aren’t immediately observable. When things go well, people claim any victory that occurred in their area code as their own. When they go poorly, people skitter away to dusty corners of the org chart or just make excuses. This leads to a vicious cycle of eroding trust, heavyweight management processes, and disempowerment.</p>

<p>Eventually, when enough balls get dropped, leadership makes big, all-or-nothing decisions that either abandon accountability altogether or are overly harsh. The senior people in the vicinity of a big win get promoted. People find scapegoats. Nobody wins.</p>

<p>So how do you avoid this inevitable landmine? Get high-quality accountability from transparency.</p>

<h2 id="why-transparency-works">Why Transparency Works</h2>

<p>The first reason that transparency leads to accountability: <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/05/we-work-harder-when-we-know-someones-watching">people rise to the occasion when they know they have an audience</a>, and transparency gives your team a front row seat to the action. Put another way, people (generally) don’t want to publicly screw up. The light peer pressure of transparency immediately delivers results.</p>

<p>On healthy teams, people want to see their teammates succeed and will lend a hand if they see something falling off-track. But most people don’t want to go to their teammates with some form of “hey, it looks like you’re screwing up.” Transparency lowers the friction involved in asking or offering help.</p>

<p>Transparency also gives you observability well before the train flies off the tracks. Imagine the conversations below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Hey Bob, at the last 2 standups you said you were planning to get to Project X next. Still on-track for launch on the first of the month? Let me know if there are blockers I can help with, or if we should discuss whether it even still makes sense as a priority.”</li>
  <li>“Hey Bob, why did X not get done? We had planned for it to be done by the first of the month. What happened?”</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these conversations will get you to accountability, but the former conversation is infinitely easier. It’s early, and there is time to get help or adjust plans. There’s also still room for nuance – does it still make sense to spend our time here at all? By contrast, the latter conversation is an adversarial nightmare and almost guaranteed to elicit a defensive reaction. Transparency allows you to aim small, and therefore miss small.</p>

<p>Finally, if a project truly does fail, transparency helps you address it correctly and fairly.</p>

<p>There’s usually a pretty reasonable explanation when things go wrong. Were our goals unrealistic? Did other priorities get in the way? Did some exogenous factor throw a wrench into our plans? Or, are we in the (relatively uncommon) situation where someone was simply lazy or incompetent? As a manager, you owe it to your team to have a nuanced response to what is almost certainly a nuanced situation.</p>

<p>Transparency gives you a clear trail to understand and take action – which is the bedrock upon which true accountability rests. Trying to get accountability without transparency is like doing brain surgery with a sledgehammer rather than a scalpel.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-achieve-transparency">How to Achieve Transparency</h2>

<p>You can achieve transparency through a variety of methods, all centered around tracking true indicators of productivity or progress towards goals.</p>

<p>Tools for transparency should be neutral, objective, and predictable – think of metrics dashboards or a weekly team check-in, rather than a manager nosing in and asking for a status report on a whim. The best forms of transparency are impersonal as they’re rooted in facts and data, not opinions and explanations. They should be at least semi-public: shared between a manager and report, with a team, or with the entire company. And most importantly, transparency efforts must be lightweight: the benefit of more transparency is increased accountability and observability without a decrease in velocity.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite lightweight ways to get more transparency are below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make business metrics that you care about public to the company, and automatically publish them to an email list / public chat channel at a regular cadence. For example, create a public Slack channel in which you post metrics such as renewal rate, number of news signups, or number of support tickets per active user once a month.</li>
  <li>Use standups (of any form – live or virtual) to keep projects on track. The key is to follow up on hurdles that have blocked progress for some time as soon as things are off track – standup should be an active listening exercise.</li>
  <li>It’s easy for the “last 10%” of projects to take as much time to complete as the first 90%. As you’re approaching the end of a project, teams should track their current best guess for when a project will go live.</li>
  <li>On a quarterly basis, send everyone in the organization an anonymous poll rating their current job satisfaction on a few key dimensions, and have the CEO / other executives follow up with the heads of large functional groups that report to them.</li>
  <li>For any complex and sensitive business-critical process (e.g. deploying risky code or launching new products to customers), set up a checkin meeting to talk about all upcoming launches. The existence of the public checkin is a strong forcing function for people to run a tight ship.</li>
  <li>If you use an Agile system with sprints, track metrics such as points completed per sprint, average time that stories have been in-progress, or percentage of sprints in which all work is completed.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Everyone knows how to track which processes run on Linux, but almost no-one tracks them accurately. In fact, <strong>all</strong> of the methods listed in this post have some deficiency or another. Lets define requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>All processes should be logged including short-lived processes</li>
<li>We should know the full executable path of every process that runs</li>
<li>Within reason, we shouldn’t need to modify or recompile our code for different kernel versions</li>
<li>Bonus: If the host is a Kubernetes node or runs docker than we should be able to determine which pod/container a process belongs to. To do so, it is often sufficient to know a process’ cgroup ID. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>Lets looks at common Linux APIs that can solve this problem. For simplicity’s sake, we’ll focus on detecting <code>execve</code> syscalls. A full solution will also need to monitor <code>fork</code>/<code>clone</code> syscalls and their variants as well <code>execveat</code>.</p>

<h3 id="simple-usermode-solutions">Simple Usermode Solutions</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Poll <code>/proc</code></strong>. This is no good because it will miss short-lived processes.</li>
<li><strong>Use the netlink process connector</strong>. The connector will deliver notifications for short-lived processes but the notifications only include numerical data like the process’ <code>pid</code> without data like the executable path. Therefore, you’re back to reading data from <code>/proc</code> and have the same race condition for short-lived processes.</li>
<li><strong>Use the Linux audit API.</strong> This is the best solution out there. The audit API exists in all modern kernels, provides full executable paths, and won’t miss short-lived processes. There are only two disadvantages. First of all, only one usermode program can communicate with the kernel audit API at a time. This is a pain if you are developing an enterprise security solution and have customers who use the audit API themselves via <code>auditd</code> or <code>osquery</code>.<sup id="fnref:audit"><a href="#fn:audit">2</a></sup> Second of all, the audit API isn’t container aware, despite years of kernel mailing list discussions on fixing the issue.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="simple-kernel-debugging-solutions">Simple Kernel Debugging Solutions</h3>

<p>These solutions all involve a single kernel probe of various types.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Use tracepoints<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">3</a></sup> .</strong> The kernel contains several relevant tracepoints which execute at different points in the <code>execve</code> syscall. They are: <em>sched_process_exec</em>, <em>open_exec</em>, <em>sys_enter_execve</em>, <em>sys_exit_execve</em>.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">4</a></sup> These tracepoints are better than the previous solutions because they will track short-lived processes, but none of these tracepoints provide an executable’s full path when the parameter to <code>exec</code> is a relative path. In other words, if the user runs <code>cd /bin &amp;&amp; ./ls</code> then the path will be reported as <code>./ls</code> and not <code>/bin/ls</code>. Here is a simple demonstration:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code># enable the sched_process_exec tracepoint
sudo -s
cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
echo 1 &gt; events/sched/sched_process_exec/enable

# run ls via a relative path
cd /bin &amp;&amp; ./ls

# fetch data from the sched_process_exec tracepoint
# note that we don't see the full path
cd -
cat trace | grep ls

# disable the tracepoint
echo 0 &gt; events/sched/sched_process_exec/enable
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Use kprobes/kretprobes<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">5</a></sup>.</strong> Unlike tracepoints, there are many, many possible functions where you can insert a kprobe which will be hit during an <code>execve</code> syscall. However, I can’t find a single function in <code>execve</code>’s callgraph which has as function parameters both the process’ PID and the full path of the executable. Therefore we have the same issue with relative paths as the tracepoint solution. There are some clever hacks you can do here - after all, kprobes can read data from the kernel’s callstack - but these solutions wont be stable across kernel versions so I’m ruling them out.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Use eBPF programs with tracepoints/kprobes/kretprobes</strong><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">6</a></sup>. This opens up some new options. Now we can run arbitrary code in the kernel every time that the <code>execve</code> syscall runs. In theory, this should let us extract any information we want from kernel and send it to usermode. There are two ways of obtaining such data and neither meets our requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read data from kernel structs like <code>task_struct</code> or <code>linux_binprm</code>. We can indeed fetch the executable’s full path this way<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">7</a></sup> but reading from kernel structs will make us dependent on kernel versions. Our eBPF program needs to know the offsets of struct members so it has to be compiled with kernel headers for each kernel version. This is typically solved by compiling the eBPF program at runtime, but that brings it’s own issues like a requirement that you have kernel headers available on every machine.</li>
<li>Use eBPF helper functions to fetch data from the kernel. This is compatible across all kernel versions that contain the helper you use. In this method you never access kernel structs directly - rather you use helper APIs to fetch data. There is only one problem: there is no eBPF helper function which can obtain the executable’s full path. (However, in recent kernel versions, there <em>is</em> an eBPF helper function to get the cgroup ID which is useful for mapping processes to containers.)</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="hackish-solutions">Hackish Solutions:</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Use <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> on every running executable and hook <code>exec</code> calls in libc</strong>. Seriously, don’t do this. It won’t work for statically compiled executables, is easy for malicious code to bypass, and is fairly intrusive.</li>
<li><strong>Use tracepoints on <code>execve</code>, <code>fork</code>/<code>clone</code>, and <code>chdir</code> to track not only the creation of all processes but also their current working directory.</strong> For each <code>execve</code> lookup the process’ working directory and combine that with <code>execve</code>’s parameter to obtain a full path. If you do this, make sure you use eBPF maps and put all the logic into your eBPF programs to avoid race conditions where events arrive in usermode in the wrong order.</li>
<li><strong>Use ptrace based solutions</strong>. These are too intrusive for production code. However, if you do go this route then  use ptrace + seccomp and the <code>SECCOMP_RET_TRACE</code> flag. Then seccomp can intercept all <code>execve</code> syscalls in the kernel and pass them to a usermode debugger which can log the <code>execve</code> call before telling seccomp to continue with the <code>execve</code> as usual.</li>
<li><strong>Use AppArmor.</strong> You can write an AppArmor profile which forbids a process from executing any other executables. If you put that profile in complain mode then AppArmor wont actually prevent process execution - it will only issue alerts when the profile is violated. If we attach our profile to every running process then we will have a working but very ugly and hackish solution. You probably shouldn’t do this.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="3rd-party-tools">3rd Party Tools</h3>

<p>None of these solutions satisfy our requirements, but here they are:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Use <code>ps</code></strong> - this just polls from <code>/proc</code> and therefore has the usual race conditions</li>
<li><strong>Use the eBPF-based <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/execsnoop.py">execsnoop</a></strong> - this is just a kprobe/kretprobe based solution so it has the same dependency on kernel versions discussed above. Besides, execsnoop doesn’t even expand relative paths so we have gained nothing.</li>
<li><strong>Use the old non-eBPF version of execsnoop</strong> - this won’t work either. It is just a simple kprobe.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="future-solutions">Future Solutions:</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Use the eBPF helper function <a href="https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netdev/patch/7464919bd9c15f2496ca29dceb6a4048b3199774.1576629200.git.ethercflow@gmail.com/">get_fd_path</a></strong> - this doesn’t yet exist, but once it is added to the kernel it will somewhat help. You’ll still have to get the executable’s FD in a way that doesn’t involve reading from kernel structs.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="closing-notes">Closing Notes</h3>

<p>None of the APIs covered here are perfect. Here are my recommendations for which solution you should use and when:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you can, use the audit API via <code>auditd</code> or <a href="https://github.com/slackhq/go-audit">go-audit</a>. This will log all processes, including short-lived processes, and you’ll get full executable paths without any effort. This solution wont work if someone is already using the audit API via a different usermode tool than you. In that case, read on.</li>
<li>If you don’t care about full-paths and you want a quick, ready-made solution that doesn’t involve writing any code then use <code>execsnoop</code>. This has the disadvantage of requiring kernel headers at runtime.</li>
<li>If you don’t care about full-paths and you’re willing to go the extra mile to avoid requiring kernel headers then use one of the tracepoints mentioned above. There are multiple ways that you can connect to those tracepoints and transfer their data to usermode - whether it is via the filesystem interface shown above, via an eBPF program with eBPF maps, or via <code>perf</code> tools. I’ll cover these options in another post. The main thing to remember is this: if you use an eBPF program make sure it can be statically compiled so that you don’t have the same dependency on kernel headers that you’re trying to avoid. This means you can’t access kernel structs and you can’t use frameworks like <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc">BCC</a> which compile eBPF programs at runtime.</li>
<li>If you don’t care about short-lived processes and the previous solutions don’t fit your use-case then use the netlink process connector in conjunction with <code>/proc</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Have I forgotten an obvious solution? Message me! I haven’t yet setup a commenting system on this website, but you can message me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natanyellin/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I built a new workstation with somewhat beefy <code>AMD Ryzen 3950x</code> CPU and got a bit over-excited with
tuning it and getting the max (trying to reduce <code>rust</code> compile times) out of it 😅. One thing led to
another and I ended up with a <code>Corsair H150i RGB PRO XT</code> AIO to keep this thing cool enough.
Everything worked well until I found out that Corsair does not provide any support for Linux 🙄.
It was usable, as this device holds its config on board and does not need support from OS/Software to run,
but one can only adjust any settings or view any status in Windows.</p>

<p>How do I use this device in Linux? I wanted to look at the useless but pretty stats about how fast the
pump and fans are spinning, what is the temperature of the coolant? After all I gotta kill time when
<code>ferris</code> is churning bits…</p>

<h4 id="where-to-start">Where to start?</h4>

<p>My very first thought was to sniff the communication between the software and the device and replicate
it, problem solved! That is what I ended up doing but it wasn’t easy. I started with searching and asking for help</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/rustlang?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@rustlang</a> anyone has any pointers to start hacking on USB devices.

<p>I had no idea how USB devices work, apart from you plug them in and they play. I started reading up on USB protocol.
Here are some resources that I found very useful to get me started with reverse engineering and
understanding USB protocol in general.</p>

<p>In a nutshell USB is completely controlled by the host, it will sit there until host device makes a
request for a Transaction. To control a device we need to take these steps (I’m over-simplifying here)
get device info -&gt; configure its endpoint -&gt; run a command. Don`t worry if it doesn’t make sense for now
it didn’t for me either, hopefully it will start to make sense at the end of this article.
I strongly recommend to go thorough the resources above to help with the process.</p>

<p>Before we can reverse engineer a device we need to understand what it does and how it does. I started
with capturing packages, because it was supported only on windows I created a VM.
After a few unsuccessful attempts to install the software provided by Corsair in the VM
(it required OpenGl for some reason).
I ended up setting up a dual boot for Windows. After some <em>duckduckgoing</em> (if that’s even a word) I installed
<a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/USB" target="_blank">Wireshark</a> and <a href="https://desowin.org/usbpcap/" target="_blank">USBPcap</a>
to capture the USB traffic when the software was reading stats information off the device. I still
couldn’t see any USB interfaces listed in Wireshark to capture. But I could use USBPcap command line tool
to capture packets flying back and forth, between my AIO and the PC. That was Ok but not ideal as I could not
see live packets to see what packet is transferred when the values changed in the Corsair software. Later on,
I found the following tip buried in one of the youtube video comments and it worked.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>for live capture USB packets in wireshark, copy <code>USBPcapCMD.exe</code> into <code>wireshark\extcap</code> directory</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I had the needed data, and ‘commands’ that i could try to replicate. As you can see in the screenshot
below it is a sequence of commands <code>GET DESCRIPTOR</code> for <code>DEVICE</code> and then <code>Configuration</code> and various
other requests and responses. Later on we’ll see that after the initial setup it is just a couple of alternating
request are made to the device to receive sensor data. Corsair software parses the response and displays fan/pump
speeds and coolant temperature etc we’ll get to that later but lets setup our project in rust.</p>

<h3 id="setting-up-a-rust-project">Setting up a rust project</h3>

<p>On my Linux machine I ran <code>lsusb</code> to see the usb devices attached, and there it was
<code>Bus 001 Device 002: ID 1b1c:0c22 Corsair H150iRGBPROXT</code>, vendor and product IDs matching with the captured
data as expected.</p>

<p>I started a new rust project <code>cargo new rcue</code> named it <code>rcue</code> just because the software I’m
trying to replicate is called <code>iCue</code> 😜. Some awesome rust developers have already made a rust crate
<a href="https://lib.rs/crates/rusb" target="_blank">rusb</a> that provides safe bindings for <code>libusb-1.0</code>. For this project we only
need two dependencies as following.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="toml"><span>[</span><span>dependencies</span><span>]</span>
<span>rusb</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.6"</span>
<span>byteorder</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1.3"</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>byteorder</code> is an awesome crate, it will become handy as we see later. I looked at the examples provided
by the <code>rusb</code> repo <a href="https://github.com/a1ien/rusb/tree/master/examples" target="_blank">here</a> and started with just
reading some basic information about the device.</p>

<h3 id="configuring-usb-device">Configuring USB device</h3>

<p>Back to our captured data, if I filter the direction of all data going to the device, I can see a sequence
first three packets are for requesting information, presumably to confirm that we are connected to the required
device. Forth request (7th if you count responses) in the screenshot below is doing something. I think
it’s configuring the device endpoint. A USB device can be configured in many different ways as you might
have seen/read in the resources above. Since our device only has one configuration as confirmed in the output of
our program, there is no real point re-configuring it to the same one, but we’ll do it anyway for
the completeness sake.</p>

<figure>

</figure>


<p>The relevant piece of information here are the data that is sent or <em>the last 9 bytes</em>. Let’s try replicating
this in our program. To configure the device properly we need to claim it. That require some extra information
for the attached device i.e. its interface, settings and address identifiers. Let’s setup a function like the following.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[derive(Debug)]</span><span>

Let's try a bit of a deeper dive.
I hope this is, in some sense, a spiritual successor to some of Bruce Dawson's
work, especially "Comparing Floating Point Numbers, 2012 Editon".
(https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2012/02/25/comparing-floating-point-numbers-2012-edition/)

<p>Floating-point math is fraught with subtle gotchas,
and comparing values properly is no exception.
Here we discuss common pitfalls,
examine some possible solutions,
and try to beat Boost.</p>

<h2 id="things-you-probably-know-about-floats">Things you probably know about floats</h2>

<p>If you need to represent a non-integer in a mainstream programming
language, you’ll probably end up using IEEE&nbsp;754 floating-point values.
Since their standardization in 1985, they’ve become ubiquitous.
Nearly all modern CPUs—and many microprocessors—contain special hardware
(called <em>floating-point units</em>, or FPUs) to handle them.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Each float consists of a sign bit, some bits representing an exponent,
and bits representing a fraction, also called the <em>mantissa</em>.
Under most circumstances, the value of a float is:</p>



<p>where   is our sign bit,  is some fraction represented by the mantissa bits,
 is an unsigned integer represented by the exponent bits,
and  is half the maximum value of , i.e.,
127 for a 32-bit float and 1023 for a 64-bit float.</p>

<p>There are also some special cases.
For example, when all exponent bits are zero, the formula changes to:</p>



<p>Note the lack of an implicit 1 preceding the mantissa—this allows us to store
small values close to zero, called <em>denormal</em> or <em>subnormal</em> values.
And when all exponent bits are one, certain mantissa values represent
, , and “Not a Number” (NaN), the result of undefined
or unrepresentable operations such as dividing by zero.</p>

<p>We’ll make two observations that will prove themselves useful shortly:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Floats cannot store arbitrary real numbers,
or even arbitrary rational numbers.
They can only store numbers representable by the equations shown before.
For example, if I declare some variable,</p>

    

    <p><code>f</code> becomes 0.100000001490116119384765625, the closest 32-bit float
value to 0.1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the equations are exponential, the distance on the number line
between adjacent values increases (exponentially!) as you move away
from zero.
The distance between 1.0 and the next possible value is about
, but the distance between adjacent floats near
 is roughly .
This will prove to be our greatest challenge: when comparing floats,
we want to handle inputs close to zero as well as we handle ones
close to the Avogadro constant.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-is-equality">What is equality?</h2>

<p>Since the result of every floating-point operation must be rounded to the
nearest possible value, math doesn’t behave like it does with real numbers.
Depending on your hardware, compiler, and compiler flags,
 may produce a different result than .<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
Whenever we compare calculated values to each other,
we should provide some leeway to account for this.
Comparing their exact values with <code>==</code> won’t cut it.</p>

<p>Instead,
we should consider two distinct values  and  equal if
 for some sufficiently small .
As luck would have it, the C standard library contains a <code>FLT_EPSILON</code>.
Let’s try it out!</p>

<div><pre><code><span>bool</span> <span>almostEqual</span><span>(</span><span>float</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>fabs</span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>-</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>FLT_EPSILON</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>We would hope that we’re done here, but we would be wrong.
A look at the language standards reveals that
<code>FLT_EPSILON</code> is equal to
the difference between 1.0 and the value that follows it.
But as we noted before, float values aren’t equidistant!
For values smaller than 1, <code>FLT_EPSILON</code> quickly becomes too large to be useful.
For values greater than 2, <code>FLT_EPSILON</code> is smaller than the
distance between adjacent values, so
<code><span>fabs</span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>-</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>FLT_EPSILON</span></code>
will always be false.</p>

<p>To address these problems,
what if we scaled  proportionally to our inputs?</p>

<div><pre><code><span>bool</span> <span>relativelyEqual</span><span>(</span><span>float</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span>
    <span>float</span> <span>maxRelativeDiff</span> <span>=</span> <span>FLT_EPSILON</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>float</span> <span>difference</span> <span>=</span> <span>fabs</span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>-</span> <span>b</span><span>);</span>

    <span>// Scale to the largest value.
</span>    <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>fabs</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>);</span>
    <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>fabs</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>);</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>float</span> <span>scaledEpsilon</span> <span>=</span>
        <span>maxRelativeDiff</span> <span>*</span> <span>max</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>);</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>difference</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>scaledEpsilon</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This works better than our initial solution,
but it’s not immediately obvious what values of
<code>maxRelativeDiff</code> we might want for different cases.
The fact that we scale it by arbitrary inputs also means it can fall prey
to the same rounding we’re worried about in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-boost">What about Boost?</h2>

<p>Boost, the popular collection of C++ libraries,
provides functions for similar purposes.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>
After removing template boilerplate and edge case handling for  and NaNs,
they resemble:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>float</span> <span>relative_difference</span><span>(</span><span>float</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>fabs</span><span>((</span><span>a</span> <span>-</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>));</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>float</span> <span>epsilon_difference</span><span>(</span><span>float</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>relative_difference</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span>
           <span>FLT_EPSILON</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Unfortunately, these functions don’t seem to solve
our problems.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
Since the division in <code>relative_difference</code> often makes its result
quite small,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>
how do we know what a good threshold might be?
By dividing that result by <code>FLT_EPSILON</code>,
<code>epsilon_difference</code> attempts to give an easier value to reason about.
But we just saw the dangers of <code>FLT_EPSILON</code>!
This scheme becomes increasingly questionable as inputs move away from one.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-ulps">What about ULPs?</h2>

<p>It would be nice to define comparisons in terms of
something more concrete than arbitrary thresholds.
Ideally, we would like to know the number of possible floating-point
values—sometimes called <em>units of least precision</em>, or ULPs—between
inputs.
If I have some value , and another value  is only two or three ULPs away,
we can probably consider them equal, assuming some rounding error.
Most importantly, this is true regardless of the distance between
 and  on the number line.</p>

<p>Boost offers a function called <code>float_distance</code> to get the distance
between values in ULPs,
but it’s about an order of magnitude slower than the approaches
discussed so far.
With some bit-fiddling, we can do better.</p>

<p>Consider some positive float  where every mantissa
bit is one.
 must use the next largest exponent,
and all its mantissa bits must be zero.
As an example, consider 1.99999988 and 2:</p>



<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Value</th>
      <th>Bits</th>
      <th>Exponent</th>
      <th>Mantissa bits</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1.99999988</td>
      <td><code>0x3FFFFFFF</code></td>
      <td>127</td>
      <td><code>0x7FFFFF</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>2.0</td>
      <td><code>0x40000000</code></td>
      <td>128</td>
      <td><code>0x000000</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The property holds for denormals, even though they have a different
value equation.
Consider the largest denormal value and the smallest normal one:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Value</th>
      <th>Bits</th>
      <th>Exponent</th>
      <th>Mantissa bits</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td><code>0x007FFFFF</code></td>
      <td>-126</td>
      <td><code>0x7FFFFF</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td><code>0x00800000</code></td>
      <td>-126</td>
      <td><code>0x000000</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Notice an interesting corollary:
adjacent floats (of the same sign)
have adjacent integer values when reinterpreted as such.
This reinterpretation is sometimes called <em>type punning</em>,
and we can use it to calculate the distance between values in ULPs.</p>

<p>Traditionally in C and C++, one used a union trick:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>union</span> <span>FloatPun</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>float</span> <span>f</span><span>;</span>
    <span>int32_t</span> <span>i</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>FloatPun</span> <span>fp</span><span>;</span>
<span>fp</span><span>.</span><span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>25.624</span><span>f</span><span>;</span>
<span>// Read the same value as an integer.
</span><span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"%x"</span><span>,</span> <span>fp</span><span>.</span><span>i</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This still works in C,
but can run afoul of strict aliasing rules in C++.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>
A better approach is to use <code>memcpy</code>.
Given the usual use of the function, one might assume that it would be less
efficient, but</p>

<div><pre><code><span>int32_t</span> <span>floatToInt</span><span>(</span><span>float</span> <span>f</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>int32_t</span> <span>r</span><span>;</span>
    <span>memcpy</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>float</span><span>));</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>r</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>compiles to a single instruction that moves the value from a floating-point
register to an integer one.
This is exactly what we want.</p>

<p>With that problem solved, calculating the ULPs between values
becomes quite straightforward:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>int32_t</span> <span>ulpsDistance</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>float</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>float</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>// Save work if the floats are equal.
</span>    <span>// Also handles +0 == -0
</span>    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>==</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

    <span>const</span> <span>auto</span> <span>max</span> <span>=</span>
        <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>numeric_limits</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32_t</span><span>&gt;::</span><span>max</span><span>();</span>

    <span>// Max distance for NaN
</span>    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>isnan</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>||</span> <span>isnan</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>))</span> <span>return</span> <span>max</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// If one's infinite and they're not equal, max distance.
</span>    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>isinf</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>||</span> <span>isinf</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>))</span> <span>return</span> <span>max</span><span>;</span>

    <span>memcpy</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>ib</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>float</span><span>));</span>

    <span>// Don't compare differently-signed floats.
</span>    <span>if</span> <span>((</span><span>ia</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>!=</span> <span>(</span><span>ib</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span><span>))</span> <span>return</span> <span>max</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// Return the absolute value of the distance in ULPs.
</span>    <span>int32_t</span> <span>distance</span> <span>=</span> <span>ia</span> <span>-</span> <span>ib</span><span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>distance</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>distance</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>distance</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>distance</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This code is quite portable—it only assumes that the platform supports
32-bit integers and that floats are stored in accordance with
IEEE&nbsp;754.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>
We avoid comparing differently-signed values for a few reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>ULPs are the wrong tool to compare values near or across zero,
as we’ll see below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Almost all modern CPUs use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement">two’s complement</a>
arithmetic, while floats use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_number_representations#Signed_magnitude_representation">signed magnitude</a>.
Converting one format to the other in order to meaningfully add or subtract
differently-signed values requires some extra work.
For the same reason, the sign of our result might not be what we expect,
so we take its absolute value.
We only care about the distance between our two inputs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the subtraction overflows or underflows, we get undefined behavior
with signed integers and modular arithmetic with unsigned ones.
Neither is desirable here.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We calculate the absolute value ourselves instead of using <code>std::abs</code>
for two reaons.
First, the integer versions of <code>std::abs</code> only take types—such as
<code><span>int</span></code>, <code><span>long</span></code>, and <code><span>long</span> <span>long</span></code>—whose
sizes are platform-specific.
We want to avoid assumptions about implicit conversions
between those types and <code><span>int32_t</span></code>.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup>
The second is a strange pitfall related to the placement of
<code>std::abs</code> overloads in the C++ standard library.
If you include <code>&lt;cmath&gt;</code> but not <code>&lt;cstdlib&gt;</code>,
only the floating-point versions of <code>std::abs</code> are provided.
Several toolchains I tested then promote the <code><span>int32_t</span></code>
value to a <code><span>double</span></code>,
even if your target only has
a 32-bit FPU and must emulate <code><span>double</span></code>
using integer registers.
(As one might guess, this is <em>terrible</em> for performance.)
Warning flags such as <code>-Wconversion</code> can help us notice this happening,
or we can just avoid all these gotchas by calculating the absolute value directly.
At any rate, this is a trivial detail.</p>

<h2 id="no-silver-bullets">No silver bullets</h2>

<p>Relative epsilons—including ULPs-based ones—don’t make sense around zero.
The exponential nature of floats means that many more values are
gathered there than anywhere else on the number line.
Despite being a fairly small value in the context of many calculations,
0.1 is over one billion ULPs away from zero!
Consequently, fixed epsilons are probably the best
choice when you …</p></article></div>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>Despite using a FTTH internet connection since 2014, aside from the one fiber
uplink, I had always used network gear with 1 Gbit/s links over regular old rj45
cat5(e) cables.</p>

<hr>

<p>I liked the simplicity and uniformity of that setup, but decided it’s time to
add at least one fiber connection, to <strong>get rid of a temporary ethernet cable</strong>
that connected my kitchen with the rest of my network that is largely in the
living room and office.</p>

<p>The temporary ethernet cable was an experiment to verify that running a server
or two in my kitchen actually works (it does!). I used a <a href="https://www.digitec.ch/de/s1/product/hama-cat-6-flach-we-1000cm-netzwerkkabel-7465292">flat ethernet
cable</a>,
which is great for test setups like that, as you can often tape it onto the
walls and still close the doors.</p>

<p>So, we will replace one ethernet cable with one fiber cable and converters at
each end:</p>

<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-media-converters.jpg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-media-converters.thumb.1x.jpg" srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-media-converters.thumb.2x.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-media-converters.thumb.3x.jpg 3x" width="600" height="216" alt="0.9mm thin fiber cables"></a></p>

<p>Why is it good to switch from copper ethernet cables to fiber in this case?
Fiber cables are <strong>smaller and hence easier to fit</strong> into existing cable
ducts. While regular ethernet cable is way too thick to fit into any of the
existing ducts in my flat, I was hoping that fiber might fit!</p>

<p>When I actually received the cables, I was surprised <strong>how much thinner</strong> fiber
cables actually can be: there are 0.9mm cables, which are so thin, they can be
hidden in plain sight! I had only ever seen 2mm fiber cables before, and the
0.9mm cables are incredibly light, flexible and thin! Even pasta is typically
thicker:</p>

<hr>

<p>The cable shown above comes from <a href="https://www.fs.com/company/about_us.html">the fiber store
FS.COM</a>, which different people have
praised on multiple occasions, so naturally I was curious to give them a shot
myself.</p>

<p>Also, for the longest time, it was my understanding that fiber connectors can
only be put onto fiber cables using expensive (≫2000 CHF) machines. A while ago
I heard about <strong>field assembly connectors</strong> so I wanted to verify that those
indeed work.</p>

<hr>

<p>Aside from practical reasons, playing around with fiber networking also makes
for a good hobby during a pandemic :)</p>

<h2 id="hardware-selection">Hardware Selection</h2>

<p>I ordered all my fiber equipment at <a href="https://www.fs.com/">FS.COM</a>: everything
they have is very affordable, and products in stock at their German warehouse
arrive in Switzerland (and presumably other European countries) within the same
week.</p>

<p>If you are in the luxurious position to have enough physical space and agility
to pull through an entire fiber cable, <strong>without having to remove any
connectors</strong>, you can make a new network connection with just a few parts:</p>

<p>I recommend buying an extra fiber cable or two so that you can accidentally
damage a cable and still have enough spares.</p>

<p>Total cost thus far: just under 100 CHF. If you have existing switches with a
free SFP slot, you can use those instead of the media converters and save most
of the cost.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you need to <strong>temporarily remove</strong> one or both of the fiber cable connector(s),
you also need field assembly connectors and a few tools in addition:</p>

<p>I recommend buying twice the number of field assembly connectors, for practicing.</p>

<p>Personally, I screwed up two connectors before figuring out <a href="#field-assembly-connectors">how the process
goes</a>.</p>

<p>Total cost: about 160 CHF for the field assembly equipment, so 260 CHF in total.</p>

have, but you can get by without, if you’re on a budget.</p>

<p>With the visual fault locator, you can shine a light through your fiber. You can
verify correct connector assembly by looking at how the light comes out of the
connector.</p>

<p>The fiber cleaning swabs are good to have in general, but for the field assembly
connector, you need to use alcohol-soaked wipes anyway (which FS.COM does not
stock).</p>

<p>The total cost for everything is just under 300 CHF.</p>

<h3 id="hardware-selection-process">Hardware Selection Process</h3>

<p>The large selection at FS.COM can be overwhelming to navigate at first. My
selection process went something like this:</p>

<p>My first constraint is using bi-directional (BiDi) fiber optics modules so that
I only need to lay a single fiber cable, as opposed to two fiber cables.</p>

<p>The second constraint is to use field assembly connectors.</p>

<p>If possible, I wanted to use <a href="https://community.fs.com/blog/why-not-use-bend-insensitive-fiber-optic-cable-to-reduce-bend-radius.html">bend-insensitive
fiber</a>
so that I wouldn’t need to pay so much attention to the bend radius and have
more flexibility in where and how I can lay fiber.</p>

<p>With these constraints, there aren’t too many products left to combine. An
obvious and good choice are 0.9mm fiber cable using LC/UPC connectors.</p>

<h3 id="fs-com-details">FS.COM details</h3>

<p>As of 2020-08-05, FS.COM states they have 5 warehouses in 4 locations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Delaware (US)</li>
<li>Munich (Germany)</li>
<li>Melbourne (Australia)</li>
<li>Shenzhen (China)</li>
</ul>

<p>They recently built another, bigger (7 km²) warehouse in Shenzhen, and now
produce inventory for the whole year.</p>

<p>By 2019, FS.COM had over 300,000 registered corporate customers, reaching nearly
200 million USD yearly sales.</p>

<h2 id="delivery-times">Delivery times</h2>

<p>As mentioned before, delivery times are quick when the products are in stock at
FS.COM’s German warehouse.</p>

<p>In my case, I put in my order on 2020-Jun-26.</p>

<p>The items that shipped from the German warehouse arrived on 2020-Jul-01.</p>

<p>Some items had to be manufactured and/or shipped from Asia. Those items arrived
after 3 more weeks, on 2020-Jul-24.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, FS.COM doesn’t stock any 0.9mm fiber cables in their German
warehouse right now, so be prepared for a few weeks of waiting time.</p>

<h2 id="laying-the-fiber">Laying The Fiber</h2>

<p>Use a cable puller to pull the fiber through existing cable ducts where
possible.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In general, buy the thinnest one you can find. I have <a href="https://www.distrelec.ch/en/cable-pull-strap-10m-tools-495005/p/18092626">this 4mm diameter cable
puller</a>,
but a 3mm or even 2mm one would work in more situations.</p></li>

<li><p>I found it worthwhile to buy a brand one. It is distinctly better to handle
(less stiff, i.e. more flexible) than the cheap one I got, and thinner, too,
which is always good.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In my experience, it generally did not work well to <strong>push</strong> the fiber into an
existing duct or alongside an existing cable. I really needed a cable
<strong>puller</strong>.</p>

<p>If you’re lucky and have enough space in your duct(s), you can leave the
existing connectors on the fiber. I have successfully just used a piece of tape
to fix the fiber connector on the cable puller, pushing down the nose
temporarily:</p>

<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-cable-puller.jpg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-cable-puller.thumb.jpg" srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-cable-puller.thumb.2x.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-cable-puller.thumb.3x.jpg 3x" width="600" height="450" alt="fiber cable taped to cable puller"></a></p>

<p>Where there are no existing ducts, you may need to lay the fiber on top of the
wall. Obviously, this is tricky as soon as you need to make a connection going
through a wall: whereas copper ethernet cables can be bent and squeezed into
door frames, you quickly risk breaking fiber cables.</p>

<p>Luckily, the fiber is very light, so it’s very easy to fix to the wall with a
piece of tape:</p>

<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-wand-kabel.jpg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-wand-kabel.thumb.1x.jpg" srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-wand-kabel.thumb.2x.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-wand-kabel.thumb.3x.jpg 3x" width="600" height="450" alt="fiber cables on the wall"></a></p>

<p>You can see the upstream internet fiber in the top right corner, which is rather
thick in comparison to my 0.9mm yellow fiber that’s barely visible in the middle
of the picture.</p>

<p>Note how the fiber entirely disappears behind the existing duct atop the
door!</p>

<p>Above, you can see the flat ethernet cable I have been using as a temporary
experiment.</p>

<hr>

<p>Where there is an existing cable that you can temporarily remove, it might be
possible to remove it, put the fiber in, and put the old cable back in,
too. This is possible because the 0.9mm fiber cable is so thin!</p>

<p>I’m using this technique to cross another wall where the existing cable duct is
too full, but there is a cable that can be removed and put back after pulling
the fiber through:</p>

<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-loch.jpg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-loch.thumb.1x.jpg" srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-loch.thumb.2x.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-loch.thumb.3x.jpg 3x" width="600" height="450" alt="fiber cable next to existing cable"></a></p>

<p>…and on the other side of the wall:</p>

<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-dose.jpg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-dose.thumb.1x.jpg" srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-dose.thumb.2x.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-dose.thumb.3x.jpg 3x" width="600" height="450" alt="fiber cable next to existing socket"></a></p>

<p>Note how the fiber is thin enough to fit between the socket and duct!</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> despite measuring how long a fiber cable I would need, my cable turned
out too short! While the cable was just as long as I had measured, with
distances exceeding 10m, it is a good idea to <strong>add a few meters spare</strong> on each
side of the connection.</p>

<h2 id="field-assembly-connectors">Field assembly connectors</h2>

<p>To give you an overview, these are the required steps at a high level:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cut the fiber with the <a href="https://www.fs.com/de-en/products/14346.html">Fibre Optic Kevlar Cutter</a></li>
<li>Strip the fiber with the <a href="https://www.fs.com/de-en/products/72812.html">Fibre Optical Stripper</a></li>
<li>Put the field assembly <em>jacket</em> onto the fiber</li>
<li>Cut the stripped fiber cleanly with the <a href="https://www.fs.com/de-en/products/14341.html">High Precision Fibre Optic Cleaver FS-08C</a></li>
<li>Put the field assembly <em>connector</em> onto the fiber</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>I thought the following resources were useful:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pictograms: <a href="https://img-en.fs.com/file/user_manual/lc-field-assembly-connector-quick-start-guide-v1.0.pdf">PDF: FS.COM LC UPC field assembley connectors quick start

FS.COM</a></li>
<li>Video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epTzemeJjAw">YouTube: Terminate Fiber in 5
Minutes</a>: this video shows a
different product, but I found it helpful to see any field assembly connector
on video, and this is one of the better videos I could find.</li>
</ol>

<!-- TODO: include a link to my own video once published -->

<hr>

<p><strong>Beware:</strong> the little paper booklet that comes with the field assembly
connector contains measurements which are <strong>not to scale</strong>. I have suggested to
FS.COM that they fix this, but until then, you’ll need to use e.g. a tape
measure.</p>

<hr>

<p>For establishing an intuition of their different sizes, here are the different connectors:</p>

<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-07-fiber-cable-connector-size.jpg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-07-fiber-cable-connector-size.thumb.1x.jpg" srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-07-fiber-cable-connector-size.thumb.2x.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-07-fiber-cable-connector-size.thumb.3x.jpg 3x" width="600" height="450" alt="fiber cable next to existing socket"></a></p>

<p>From left to right:</p>

<ul>
<li>2.0mm fiber cable</li>
<li>cat6 ethernet cable</li>
<li>0.9mm fiber cable (LC/UPC factory)</li>
<li>0.9mm fiber cable (LC/UPC field assembly connector)</li>
</ul>

<p>The 0.9mm fiber cables come with smaller connectors than the 2.0mm fiber cables,
and that alone might be a reason to prefer them in some situations.</p>

<p>The field assembly connectors are pretty bulky in comparison, but since you can
attach them yourself after pulling only the cable through the walls and/or
ducts, you usually don’t care too …</p></div></div>

    <p>A hypothetical 5-year-old asks "I'm told the Sun is a big hot ball!  Awesome!  What color is the ball?".  Anecdotally, most astronomy graduate students will get this wrong.  And some professors.  So at least some science education misconceptions - basic, simple, significant, and easily falsifiable - are not restricted to introductory classes.  They persist into the profession, where they compromise textbooks, despite collaboration.  And survive for decades, despite awareness efforts.  Being largely ignored, it's an open question how typical this is,  and how much educational content might be improved by addressing it.  But for now, for correct crayon choice, ask a spectroscopist.</p>

          Are you tired of seeing wonderful insights in research talks, and knowing they won't reach introductory content for years?  I suggest the importance of direct research expertise, in creating accessible and powerful introductory content, is pervasively underestimated.

    </p></div>
    <div>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The last decade of science education research surprised the education community. Student understanding turned out to be poorly integrated, non-transferable, and riddled with misconceptions. But an assumption exists, that student understanding eventually gets fixed.  That over the course of undergraduate and graduate work, ramshackle novice understanding becomes a qualitatively different expert understanding.  At least within the field studied.</p>
      <p>Here is one misconception that persists.  I suggest it illustrates a larger problem, with implications for curriculum and content creation.  And that we need to reassess who has sufficient expertise to create accessible and insightful content.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>A 5-year-old comes up to you and asks "I'm told the Sun is a big hot ball!  Awesome!  What color is the ball?"</p>
      <p>Take a moment, and say an answer.</p>
      <p>Anecdotally, most astronomy graduate students will get this wrong.  And at least some astronomy faculty.  For correct crayon choice, it appears the 5-year-old should ask a spectroscopist.</p>
      <p>Why?  In textbooks, the question isn't a focus, and its treatment is usually ambiguous.  The underlying problem I'll describe later.  The issue is known, with years of folks pointing out confused students and colleagues.  But awareness remains low, and little changes.</p>
      <p>The intriguing question is, how much better might content become, if more and better experts were used.  If a spectroscopist, rather than confused faculty, were asked "What color is the Sun?"  If K picture books, and graduate astronomy texts, both got the crayon color right.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Asking the question</h2>
      <p>
        'A hypothetical 5-year-old asks
        "I'm told the Sun is a big hot ball.  Awesome!  What color is the ball?"'
        I've asked this, conversationally, for several years.
        Small n, some tens, mostly MIT and Harvard graduate students.
      </p>
      <h2>Getting it wrong</h2>
      <p>
        I see five common answers, plus a few outliers.
        </p><ul>
          <li><i>yellow</i></li>
          <li><i>orange</i> and yellow and red</li>
          <li><i>rainbow</i>: "it doesn't have a color"; "it's lots of different colors"; "it's rainbow color"</li>
          <li><i>white</i></li>
          <li><i>5700 K</i></li>
        </ul>
      
      <p>
        The answer I expect depends on the person.
        </p><ul>
          <li>From the public, I expect <i>orange</i> or <i>yellow</i>.</li>
          <li>From astronomy students, undergraduate and graduate, I expect <i>yellow</i>, with a small minority of <i>white</i>.</li>
          <li>From astronomy post-docs, I've seen <i>white</i> and <i>yellow</i>.</li>
          <li>From non-astronomy graduate students in physical sciences, I expect <i>rainbow</i> or <i>yellow</i>, but also see the others.  I've seen <i>rainbow</i> from post-docs in several fields.</li>
        </ul>
      
      <p>
        <i>Yellow</i> is the most common answer.  A follow-up question of "what color is sunlight?" almost always results in recognition that something is wrong.
        <i>White</i> is an infrequent answer in all groups, except for astronomy post-docs, for whom I can't say.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>White</i> is unambiguously the correct answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what is going on?
        "The Sun ball is white" is a concept accessible to 5-year-olds.
        So why do astronomy graduate students not know what color the Sun is?
        Why do physical-sciences graduate students not even know what <i>color</i> is?
        What implications might these have for science education content creation?
      </p>
      <h2>Implications</h2>
      <p>
        This failure mode is at least arguably atypical.  But it's existence has implications.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>A misconception can... persist into graduate school.</b>
        While this is a single example, there is literature on ramshackle understanding persisting into professions.
        At least some of the perception that "misconceptions resolve" appears similar to the familiar "our teaching simply <i>must</i> be working" fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>A misconception can... be an artifact of the field, not just of pedagogy.</b>
        With a feedback loop between misconception and poor content, stable for decades.
        In the current case, the field is unable to bring its collective understanding to bear on creating content.
        Diffusion of knowledge within the field, and textbooks' "hundreds of collaborators", are here not sufficient.
        Even in this field with a singular emphasis on terminal introductory courses.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Creating content requires better experts.  And more of them.</b>
        Not merely random faculty, whose expertise outside of their specific research area, unsurprisingly looks much like a graduate student.  For example.  An MIT microbiology professor writes a nifty children's' picture book on photosynthesis.  With such concern for correctness, that it has an errata page... which doesn't (yet) mention, the book's yellow Sun(s). This shouldn't surprise you now - an astronomy consult was needed for correct <span>crayon</span> paint choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Understanding can be poorly integrated and exercised.</b>
        "Sunlight is white" and "the Sun is yellow", don't make sense together.  Yet many astronomy graduate students believe both.   This undetected conflict among conceptions, demonstrates the existence of poorly integrated knowledge.  But they also instantly recognize them as inconsistent, when both are mentioned in these conversations.  Suggesting a long-term failure to exercise knowledge - that in all their years of study, these two concepts haven't collided before.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Content could be better.  Much.</b>
        Consider integrated and transferable knowledge.  Well shaped and chosen building blocks, exercised to knock off misconceptions, fit and fused together as foundation and scaffolding.
        If you believe "the Sun is yellow", that misshaped block interferes with others.  Many related concepts don't make sense:
        blackbodies; star color; blue sky; how color works; and others.
        Making them in turn harder to learn.  And discouraging exercise, over this broken pavement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Get it right, get it insightful, get it understood without misconceptions.  Even if failures to achieve these were rare, their impact could still be large.  And instead of rare, they are pervasive.  Suggesting the improvements in content over the coming decades, will not be a thing of refinement and decoration.  But something much more profound.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        How common is astronomy graduate students not knowing what color the Sun is?  And astronomy professors?  We don't know.  These anecdotes don't stretch that far.  I look forward to someone testing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is clear, is that at least some graduate students are confused.  In ways that surprise people.  And which suggest content needs to be better.  And can be.

      <h2>Methods - Question design</h2>
      <p>
        The core question is "What color is the Sun?".  The rest is there to constrain people's answers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "ball" helps clarify intent - 'object, viewed from space', not 'eyeball observation made through atmosphere'.  It works well, but not always.  Some "red or orange" responses remain.  And it creates guarded "well, under &lt;some eyeball condition&gt;, it looks &lt;color&gt;" responses.  These can be fixed with a reply like "yes, and viewed through rock it's black - but what is it itself?".  Cone saturation almost never comes up.
        </p><p>
          The "5-year-old" is better way of saying "one-word common color name".  Getting such names from people is <i>hard</i>.  As is creating recognition that not providing one constitutes failing to answer the question.  Without the 5-year-old, puzzled people start rifting through everything they vaguely remember that might be related, and finally end with a "did I get it?".  Some responses of "5700 Kelvin" remain, but can be fixed by replying "5-year-old!", or "the 5-year-old looks puzzled".  The 5-year-old also makes the conversation more upbeat - 'helping a child', instead of 'suffering a quiz'.  And it reduces the frequency of "well, does it really matter what color the Sun is?".
        </p>
        <p>
          The "What color is sunlight?" follow-up is an easy way to demonstrate that some answer was wrong.  The "sunlight is white" meme is widespread, and its recitation so reflexive, that the response almost always precedes the "oh, then that doesn't make sense, does it?" moment.  It also provides a nice illustration of knowledge being poorly …</p></div></div></div>

August 9, 2020 | https://www.dampfkraft.com/how-i-got-my-japanese-pr.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dampfkraft.com/how-i-got-my-japanese-pr.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2018 I applied for and received Permanent Residency in Japan. The process I
used is relatively new and unknown so I wanted to document it in case it might
come in handy for someone else.</p>
<h2 id="my-background"> My Background</h2>
<p>In 2011 I graduated with a Master's degree from Brown University and then moved
to Japan and got a job as a software engineer. I am not married. I am fluent in
Japanese but would not be mistaken for a native speaker. I am a citizen of the
United States.</p>
<h2 id="highly-skilled-foreign-professional"> Highly Skilled Foreign Professional</h2>
<p>There are three main ways to qualify for Permanent Residency in Japan.</p>
<ol>
<li>You can be a resident for 10 years or more on a work visa, or a smaller number of years on a marriage visa.</li>
<li>You can make a significant contribution to Japan (<a href="http://www.moj.go.jp/nyuukokukanri/kouhou/nyukan_nyukan36.html">我が国への貢献</a>), such as personally contributing to an Olympic victory by coaching, winning a similarly prestigious prize, or getting a medal from the Emperor.</li>
<li>You can use the Highly Skilled Foreign Professional visa system.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Highly Skilled Foreign Professional visa is a points-based visa system
introduced in 2012. It seems to have been modeled on points-based visa systems
introduced in Australia. The basic idea is that based on things like income,
educational history, and language ability you get points, and if you have
enough points you can apply for a special visa. In 2017, on average 352 people
a month were accepted in the visa program. (see graph 1-3-3 on page 27
<a href="https://www.soumu.go.jp/main_content/000627735.pdf">here</a>)</p>
<p>One of the advantages of the HSFP visa is a fast track to Permanent Residency.
When it was first introduced you could apply for a PR after five years on the
HSFP visa, as opposed to ten years on a normal work visa. Over time the fast
track became even faster, and in 2018 you could apply after three years or even
just one year if you had enough points. What changed in 2017 was that if you
could demonstrate that you had the points historically you could apply for a PR
without ever having the HSFP visa. That's the process I used.</p>
<h2 id="the-points"> The Points</h2>
<p>The way points calculation works is you calculate your points at the start of
the term (so one or three years ago) and at the time of your application for a
PR, and submit a separate point sheet for each of those times.</p>
<p>There are three categories of HSFP visa: academic, specialist/technical, and
business management. I was in the specialist/technical category, which covers
more than 80% of applicants. Some point sources are shared between all three
categories, but they do have significant differences in where most points come
from. For example, if you apply with the academic category, published papers
become an important criteria for points.</p>
<p>Excluding salary, here's my point breakdown. Note that this uses the rules at
the time of my application in 2018, and they have changed slightly since then,
and are likely to continue to change over time. You can view the current points
sheet as an Excel file at the <a href="http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/newimmiact_3/en/evaluate/index.html">Immigration Bureau site</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Master's Degree: 20 points</li>
<li>5-7 years of work experience: 10 points</li>
<li>Age less than 30: 15 points</li>
<li>JLPT N1: 15 points</li>
<li>Highly ranked school bonus: 10 points</li>
</ul>
<p>That's a total of 70 points at the time of my application (again, excluding
salary). 70 points is already enough to qualify for the three-year fast track.
A year before my application I only had the JLPT N2 (10 points) for a slightly
lower total of 65. That means that with a salary of five million yen a year or
more (roughly 50,000USD, worth 15 points) I would be eligible for the one-year
fast track.</p>
<p>There are a number of other bonuses I didn't qualify for, or may have qualified
for but didn't investigate because I already had enough points. When the system
was introduced it was relatively hard to get enough points to qualify, but over
time it's gotten easier. For example, initially only the JLPT N1 was worth
points, but later the N2 was added as well.</p>
<h2 id="the-reason-letter"> The Reason Letter</h2>
<p>Most of the paperwork required for the PR application is unremarkable. One
major exception is the 理由書 or "reason letter". The reason letter is required
when applying for a PR from a work visa, but the <a href="http://www.moj.go.jp/ONLINE/IMMIGRATION/ZAIRYU_EIJYU/zairyu_eijyu03.html#content:~:text=%E6%B0%B8%E4%BD%8F%E8%A8%B1%E5%8F%AF%E3%82%92%E5%BF%85%E8%A6%81%E3%81%A8%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B%E7%90%86%E7%94%B1%E3%81%AB%E3%81%A4%E3%81%84%E3%81%A6%EF%BC%8C%E8%87%AA%E7%94%B1%E3%81%AA%E5%BD%A2%E5%BC%8F%E3%81%A7%E6%9B%B8%E3%81%84%E3%81%A6%E4%B8%8B%E3%81%95%E3%81%84%E3%80%82">only guidance</a> is
that there is no fixed format. What on earth are you supposed to write in it?</p>
<p>By looking at websites run by immigration lawyers and blog posts from various
people, it seems the conventional wisdom is that you should briefly state your
educational history and how you came to Japan. You also need to explain your
reason for seeking the PR, but "I want to keep living in Japan" is not
appropriate.</p>
<p>Typical reasons to use here are an intention to raise a family or needing a PR
in order to get a loan. (Anyone can own property in Japan, but it's difficult
to get a mortgage if you don't have a PR.) Neither of those applied to me so I
struggled with what to put in the letter. Eventually I settled on describing
several reasons I was invested in staying in Japan, with supporting documentation.</p>
<p>Besides discussing my day job, one point was my work on Japanese NLP projects.
At the time of my application I was working on adding Japanese support to
<a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy</a>, and as part of implementing Universal Dependencies I needed to
contact <a href="https://www.ninjal.ac.jp/">NINJAL</a>, who were incredibly kind in responding to a request from a
random Internet person. I described this as part of an ongoing personal effort
to make Japanese NLP easier, which continues now that I maintain a
popular <a href="https://github.com/SamuraiT/mecab-python3">Python tokenizer for Japanese</a> and <a href="https://github.com/polm">other projects</a>.</p>
<p>Another point was my work with <a href="https://www.tokyoindies.com/">Tokyo Indies</a>, the largest monthly game
development gathering in Tokyo, where I'm on staff. Tokyo Indies had media
coverage from a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/matome/f2books/indies01.html">Famitsu subsidiary</a> and the <a href="https://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/mv/wbs/archive?date=2017-10-03">WBS television program</a>,
which made good supporting documents showing both the importance of the event
and my involvement in it.</p>
<p>A third point, different from the first two, was using the reason letter to
explain issues with my other supporting documentation. One of the required
documents for a PR application is a bank statement showing financial
independence in the form of savings or steady income. A few months before my PR
application I broke my leg, and I was unable to walk without crutches for three
months, two of which I was on unpaid leave. The reason letter gave me a place
to explain the situation (and attach X-rays).</p>
<h2 id="the-application-and-the-wait"> The Application and the Wait</h2>
<p>I actually composed my PR application during the considerable downtime I had
after breaking my leg, and went to Immigration on crutches towards the end of
my recovery process. When handing over my documents the person at the counter
was impressed by their tidyness, though all I'd done was use the <a href="http://www.moj.go.jp/ONLINE/IMMIGRATION/16-4.html#content:~:text=%E7%94%B3%E8%AB%8B%E6%9B%B8%E6%A7%98%E5%BC%8F">officially
provided Excel template</a> to fill it out.</p>
<p>One thing I was told at the counter was that I could provide a copy of my N2
certificate instead of the original. Official instructions say all supporting
documents generally have to be original, but I was told it was OK to copy my
US-issued N2 cert because it was hard to get it replaced. (Looking at <a href="https://www.aatj.org/jlpt-old-scores">current
re-issuance instructions</a> it doesn't look that bad, perhaps the
process has changed since my application.)</p>
<p>I also asked about whether I needed to submit a copy of my degree. I assumed I
didn't since I'd submitted one with my initial visa application years before
and figured it was still on file. I was told it was probably fine without it.
(It wasn't, but I'll get to that later.)</p>
<p>I applied in late January 2018 and was told that it would take a year to
process my application. This was a bit of a surprise, as Immigration's site
said it usually takes 4-6 months. Apparently the recent change in requirements
for PR applications had increased both the number of applicants and the amount
of time required per application as Immigration got used to the new rules.</p>
<p>In late September I got a letter from Immigration about an issue with my
documents. It turned out they needed a copy of my degree, submitted by mail
within two weeks. I had not expected this and it was nearly a problem - my
degrees were at my parents' house in America, and they don't use the Internet,
let alone a scanner. It took a nervous few days but my brother who lives nearby
managed to get the degrees and send me scans of them.</p>
<p>That presented another problem - I had forgotten, but my degree was in Latin.
All documents submitted as part of an application have to be translated into
Japanese, and I don't speak Latin. (Maybe they wouldn't really care about a
degree, but I didn't want to take any chances.) Luckily Brown has <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/registrar/http%3A/www.brown.edu/about/administration/registrar/academic-records/replacement-diplomas/english-tra">an English
translation</a> of their degrees, but that presented another problem - the
text of the degree reads like magical language.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TO ALL WHO ARE ABOUT TO READ THIS DOCUMENT, EVERLASTING GREETINGS IN THE LORD.</p>
<p>BE IT KNOWN TO YOU THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY WITH THE AUTHORITY
ENTRUSTED TO HER/HIM BY THE BOARD OF FELLOWS HAS BESTOWED IN PUBLIC ASSEMBLY</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>AND TO HIM/HER HAS GIVEN TO ENJOY ALL THE PRIVILEGES AND RIGHTS AND HONORS AND
SYMBOLS PERTAINING TO THOSE ADVANCED TO THIS DEGREE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I ended up writing a sheet explaining the degree was mostly formulaic language
including "appeals to God etc." and just translating the gist of it as "A
Degree in X is bestowed on Y". On the copy of the degree I circled the
important parts ("SCIENTIA COMPUTATORIA" is "Computer Science") and translated
them. I mailed the degree in time.</p>

<p>In late November the small postcard that implies acceptance came, and I took a
day off to go and get my new Residence Card. The process was short and
unremarkable. Since I had spare time and no plans I ended up going by my ward
office to update my My Number Card, deeply confusing the staff with a freshly
issued card not yet reflected in some databases and an unusual procedure, but
that got sorted too. (I did end up having to fill out a Change of Address form
with no Change of Address, but such is paperwork.)</p>
<p>In total it took ten months from application to acceptance, which while long
was less than the year I was quoted. Looking at posts by immigration lawyers
online it looks like the fastest applications around this time took eight
months. I …</p></div></div>

<![CDATA[Building a Basic Interpreter, '80s Style, Part 2]]>

August 9, 2020 | https://able.bio/kerrishotts/building-a-basic-interpreter-80s-style-part-2--e91250f1 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://able.bio/kerrishotts/building-a-basic-interpreter-80s-style-part-2--e91250f1">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you recall from <a href="https://able.bio/kerrishotts/building-a-basic-interpreter-80s-style--79a9d703" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">part one of the series</a>, we only really delved into Retroputer BASIC’s first phase of parsing — namely, converting the entered line into uppercase and checking if quotes were properly matched. (Note: it should be mentioned that we could do additional checks there too — like matching parentheses, but we don’t at the moment.)</p>
<p>I also mentioned that I wanted to address how much we take even fairly limited standard libraries for granted today (especially in relationship to JavaScript). Nothing described here is <em>magic</em>, but sometimes we take our tools for granted, and I find it useful to understand what’s going underneath the hood.</p>
<h2 id="tokenizing-user-input">Tokenizing User Input</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the last post, a common tactic used by BASICs of the era was that of tokenization. In order to save space and increase execution speed, keywords were “crunched” into single byte token (or two bytes if you needed more keywords).</p>
<p>Let’s imagine that you have a simple line of code that clears the screen and prints the now common greeting, like the following.</p>
<pre><code>CLS: PRINT "Hello, World"
</code></pre>
<p>While this doesn’t take up a lot of memory on its own, if you write a long program, a lot of the words in that program will be keywords. If we crunched them (tokenized them), we could save a decent amount of space. For example, after tokenizing the line above, you’d see something more like this in memory:</p>
<pre><code>8A E3 B5 FC Hello, World 00 00
</code></pre>
<p>It doesn’t take too much effort to map this back to our original statement:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>
<p>Byte</p>
</th>
<th>
<p>Keyword</p>
</th>
<th>
<p>Notes</p>
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>8A</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>CLS</p>
</td>
<td>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>E3</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>“:”</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>End of Statement</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>32</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>“ “</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>We store up to one space</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>B5</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>PRINT</p>
</td>
<td>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>FB</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>String-in-code</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>String literal follows</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Hello, World, 00</p>
</td>
<td>

</td>
<td>
<p>Strings are NUL-terminated</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>00</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>End Of Line</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Lines are also NUL-terminated</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>This may seem like a lot of work, but the space savings can be significant. It’s not a lot <em>here</em>, but even so, you should be able to imagine how it could quickly add up. In this case, our crunched result is 19 bytes. The original text is 26 bytes (counting a terminating NUL).</p>
<p>Saving some space becomes important if you’re a BASIC interpreter running on a machine with very limited RAM. Some BASICs had less than a kilobyte of RAM for user programs, so this crunching was indeed very important, and is something that would have been appealing even if it came with no additional benefits.</p>
<p>OK — so just how do we go about tokenizing something like this? It initially seems fairly trivial in JavaScript. Given an array of strings, you could easily do a quick replace of each keyword with the corresponding token. Right?</p>
<p>Sounds like a job for <code>String#replace</code>, right? Naively, we might try the following:</p>
<pre><code>const tokens = ["CLS", "PRINT", ":" ];
function tokenize (inStr) {
    const newStr = inStr;
    tokens.forEach((token, idx) =&gt; newStr = newStr.replace(
        new RegExp(token, "g"), String.fromCharCode(128+idx)
    );
    return newStr;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, it all comes crashing down when you realize that we can’t go about replacing tokens inside of string literals. This means we need to proceed character by character, keeping the context in mind, in order to avoid crunching things that aren’t actually keywords.</p>
<p>This new algorithm much more closely matches that of the assembly language code in Retroputer — but JS still makes things a lot easier. Here’s the start of that JS code (we’ll fill it in throughout the post):</p>
<pre><code>const tokens = ["CLS", "PRINT", ":" ];

function tokenize(inStr) {
    let out = [];                    // return value is "crunched" array
    let idx = 0;                     // index into inStr
    let ch = "";                     // current character
    while (idx &lt; inStr.length) {
        ch = inStr.charCodeAt(idx);  // get the current character code
        
        // our logic is going to go here

        out.push(ch);                // for now push the character
        idx++;                       // and keep going (next char)
    }
    out.push(0);                     // we end with NUL
    return out;
}
</code></pre>
<p>We’re starting with a very simplified token list, as no one wants to see the entire table in this format (<a href="https://github.com/kerrishotts/retroputer/blob/building-a-basic-interpreter-part2/asm/kernel/basic/tokens.js" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">it’s long, and Retroputer actually builds its token tables from a JS file!</a>), but this should be enough for our purposes here. The idea here is that when we see a token, we’ll record its index in an output array.</p>
<p>At this point we have a function that, for now, just converts a string into its equivalent character codes. It doesn’t do much useful at this point, but can serve as useful scaffolding.</p>
<p>Our assembly language version is pretty similar to the above as well.</p>
<pre><code>  do {
    call _get-source-index     # get next character index (in y)
    dl := &lt;BP+source&gt;,y        # read next char from our source string (ch)
    call _adv-source-index     # advance our source index
    call _get-target-index     # get position in target   ("out" in JS)
    &lt;BP+target&gt;,y := dl        # store to target          (out[y] = ch)
    call _adv-target-index     # move it along
    cmp dl, 0                  # was char 0? if so, break
  } while !z
</code></pre>
<p>I’ve not included <code>_get-source-index</code> or the other functions above because they do what they say on the tin, and are simply getting, setting, or advancing our source and target index. One thing of note is that unlike in JS, we don’t have dynamically allocated arrays in assembly language, and so this algorithm pre-allocates a reasonably-sized buffer. As we advance through the input string, we have to know where to write the next token to the target buffer, and that’s what the target index is doing above. Each one of the functions we’re calling above returns the index in <code>Y</code>. For example, The <code>_adv-target-index</code> function advances the target index by one (equivalent to <code>y++</code>).</p>
<h2 id="careful-with-literals">Careful with Literals</h2>
<p>One thing that we should be careful of is that string literals could confuse our tokenizer — we can’t just replace every string of characters that matches a keyword with a token value. If we see a string literal with “CLS” in it, we shouldn’t try to tokenize that. It’s not intended to be executable, and if we print it… well, we’d print the byte corresponding with the token instead. Not likely what the developer wanted.</p>
<p>Number literals, on the other hand, shouldn’t have the same problem since BASIC doesn’t have any numbers as keywords. Even so, there’s zero point in doing a keyword search if we’re looking at a number — why waste time?</p>
<h3 id="tokenizing-string-literals">Tokenizing String Literals</h3>
<p>So, first, let’s check if we’re starting a string — that’s not <em>too</em> hard to do in JS:</p>
<pre><code>if (ch === 34) {
  out.push (0xFB);             // string-in-code token
  idx++;
  ch = inStr.charCodeAt(idx);  // get next character after the quote
  while (ch !== 34 &amp;&amp; idx &lt; inStr.length) {
    out.push(ch);
    idx++;
    ch = inStr.charCodeAt(idx);
  };
  idx++;                       // go past the quote
  out.push(0);                 // end of string
  continue;
}
</code></pre>
<p>A double quote is represented as character code 34. Other programming languages recognize many more quote styles (such as JS or C), but BASIC is simple here: double quotes or bust.</p>
<p>Once we see that we’re starting a string, we can simply consume the remaining characters and add them to our return array until we see another quote.</p>
<p>When we’ve read in the whole string, we need to add a NUL byte, since Retroputer BASIC uses C-style strings. If we wanted to use Pascal-style strings, we could have maintained a counter and made sure to insert the length of the string literal. Not a big deal either way. The only reason I went with NUL-terminated strings is because that’s super easy to deal with in assembly language since we can just compare against the NUL byte instead of maintaining a counter.</p>
<p>Ok, so that JavaScript wasn’t too hard. Most of us, I think, would reach for something a bit more abstract, like a regular expression. It makes the intent a little more obvious, I think.</p>
<pre><code>if (ch === 34) {
  out.push (0xFB);             // string-in-code token
  const stringLiteral = inStr.substr(idx+1).match(/^[^"]*/)[0];
  idx += stringLiteral.length+1;
  out.push(...Array.from(stringLiteral, ch =&gt; ch.charCodeAt(0)));
  idx++;                       // go past the quote
  out.push(0);                 // end of string
  continue;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The above does very much the same thing — but instead of us having to do the work of checking character by character, we let JS do it instead with <code>match</code>. We know we’ll get a match (we’re in a string), so we don’t really even need to bother with checking if we get a successful match. Then we just increment our index past the length of the string and copy the characters into our return array. To <em>me</em>, anyway, this is much easier to follow (but does assume you understand regular expressions along with some ES6 syntax like <code>…</code> and arrow functions).</p>
<p>Of course, in assembly language we have to do the work that JS is doing for us. This yields a very similar result to our first JS attempt:</p>
<pre><code>  cmp dl, constants.QUOTE         # is dl a quote?
  brs !Z not-a-string             # nope; not a string

  call _get-target-index          # get next position in crunch target
  dl := brodata.TOK_CODE_STRING   # "String" token
  &lt;bp+target&gt;,y := dl             # Store it into the crunch target
  call _adv-target-index

still-a-string:
  call _get-source-index
  dl := &lt;bp+source&gt;,y             # get string character
  call _adv-source-index
  cmp dl, constants.QUOTE         # if it's a quote, we can zero it
  if Z { 
    dl := 0 
  }
  call _get-target-index
  &lt;bp+target&gt;,y := dl             # write to target
  call _adv-target-index
  cmp dl, 0                       # are we done?
  brs !Z still-a-string           # no, keep going
  continue                        # next!
not-a-string:
</code></pre>
<p>One thing to note about Retroputer’s assembly language parser — it has some very basic support for higher-level constructs, like blocks and loops. So <code>if Z {…}</code> will execute the contents inside the block if the zero flag is set, and <code>continue</code> can be used to branch back to the top of a block (<code>break</code> also works to exit the block). …</p></div></div>

                <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>On May 19th, in the early morning (Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)) quay.io went down. This affected customers of quay.io and open source projects that are using quay.io as a build and distribution platform for their software alike. Red Hat is firmly committed to serve both of these audiences well with this service.</p>
<!--more--><p>Red Hat’s&nbsp; site reliability engineering (SRE) team quickly engaged and worked diligently to stabilize the Quay service. During this time, clients were unable to push any new images and only sporadically could pull their images. Something was causing the quay.io database to lock up after scaling the service to full capacity.</p>
<p>During an incident like this the first question to ask is, “what’s changed?” We noticed that just prior to the incident the OpenShift Dedicated cluster on which quay.io runs had started an upgrade to version 4.3.19. Because quay.io runs on Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated (OSD), regular upgrades were a routine occurrence that had never presented any issues. In fact, in the preceding six months, several OSD upgrades were applied to Quay clusters without disruption to service. While we attempted to restore the service, a parallel effort began to spin up a new OSD cluster on the prior version so we could re-deploy if necessary.</p>
<h3>Root cause analysis</h3>
<p>The primary symptom of the outage was a storm of tens of thousands of database connections, effectively locking our MySQL instance. Because of this, it was difficult to diagnose the issue. We set a cap on the maximum client connections to allow our SRE team to evaluate the issue. We didn’t see any unusual database traffic; in fact, most of the queries were reads with a handful of attempted writes.</p>
<p>We also spent time trying to find a pattern in the database traffic that might cause such a connection storm. We did not find any patterns like this in the logs. While we waited for the new 4.3.18 OSD cluster to be completed, we continued to attempt to start up the quay.io pods. Each time we reached full capacity, the database would lock up. This meant having to restart our RDS instance as well as all of the quay.io pods.</p>
<p>By late afternoon, we had stabilized the service in read-only mode and disabled as many non-essential features as possible (e.g. namespace garbage collection) to reduce database load. While the lockups had stopped, we were still looking for the root cause. Our new OSD cluster was ready and we migrated the service, re-enabled write traffic, and continued to monitor.</p>
<p>Quay.io continued to run without incident on the new OSD cluster, so we continued to review the database logs but couldn’t find any correlation to explain the lockups. The OpenShift engineers worked with us to try to identify any changes in Red Hat OpenShift 4.3.19 that might be causing Quay problems. We did not find an issue and could not reproduce the issue in a lab environment.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Second outage</h3>
<p>On May 28 just before noon EDT, quay.io went down again with the same symptom: a locked database. All hands were on deck again. We immediately focused on service restoration. Our original procedure of restarting RDS and bouncing the quay.io pods again didn’t seem to help - another torrent of database connections were bringing us down. But why?</p>
<p>Quay is written in Python and each pod runs as a single monolithic container. Within the container runtime, there are many concurrent tasks going on at any one time. We use the gevent library under gunicorn to handle web requests. When a request comes into Quay (either through our own API or the Docker API), a gevent worker is assigned the request and that worker usually needs to talk to the database. After the first outage, we discovered that Quay was using the default database connection settings within our gevent workers. This meant that based on the large number of Quay pods and the thousands of incoming requests per second, it was theoretically possible that the number of database connections could overwhelm our MySQL instance. We knew from our monitoring that on average, Quay sustains about 5,000 requests per second and sees roughly that number of database connections on a constant basis. 5,000 connections were well within the limits of our RDS instance, but tens of thousands were not. Something was&nbsp; causing the connection count to suddenly spike but we couldn’t see a correlation against our incoming request traffic.</p>
<p>We remained focused on identifying and solving the issue, not simply restarting everything without a long term fix. We made a change to the Quay codebase to limit the database connections per gevent worker. The change made it a parameter in our config so we could easily change it without a new container image. To make sure we knew how many connections we could handle, we ran some tests in our staging environment with different values to see how it affected our load testing scripts. Eventually, we hit on 10,000 connections as the maximum before Quay began returning 502 errors to users. We redeployed this new version without delay and watched our graph of database connections. We knew that in the past we usually had a database lockup after about 20 minutes. After 30 minutes without incident, we were encouraged and an hour later we were convinced. We restored write traffic on the site and began our postmortem activities.</p>
<p>While we knew that we had avoided the issue causing the lockups, we still didn’t have a root cause. We confirmed that the issue was not related to any changes inOpenShift 4.3.19 since this issue occurred on version 4.3.18, which previously worked with Quay without issue. Something else was clearly going on.</p>
<h3>Deeper investigation</h3>
<p>Quay.io ran with the default database connection settings for nearly six years without ever showing this behavior. What had changed? Certainly the traffic on quay.io has grown steadily over that time period, but it felt like we were hitting a threshold that was causing the connection storms. We continued to review the database logs from the second outage and saw no patterns or obvious connections.</p>
<p>In the meantime, our SRE team was improving their observability into Quay’s requests and overall health. New metrics were deployed as well as new dashboards that showed which parts of Quay customers were using.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quay.io ran without incident until June 9. In the morning (EDT), we again observed a significant increase in database connections. We didn’t suffer any downtime (our new database connection parameter meant we couldn’t exceed MySQL’s connection ability), but for about 30 minutes, quay.io was slow for many users. We quickly gathered as much data as we could from the added monitoring. Suddenly, a pattern emerged.</p>
<p>Just prior to the connection spike, there was a large number of requests coming into our App Registry API. App Registry is a lesser-known feature of quay.io which allows things like Helm charts and containers with rich metadata to be stored.&nbsp; While most quay.io customers don’t use this feature, Red Hat OpenShift is a large user. The OperatorHub within OpenShift uses App Registry to host all of the Operators. These Operators form the foundation of OpenShift’s workload ecosystem and the partner-focused technology “Day 2” operating model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every OpenShift 4 cluster uses Operators from the embedded OperatorHub to serve a catalog of available Operators to install and provide updates to already installed Operators. As OpenShift 4 adoption has increased, so has the number of clusters globally. Each one of those clusters needs to download Operator content to run the embedded OperatorHub, using the App Registry inside quay.io as a backend. The correlation we missed was that while OpenShift usage had been steadily increasing, this was putting more and more pressure on one of the less commonly used features of <a href="http://quay.io/">quay.io</a>.</p>
<p>We did some analysis from the App Registry request traffic into the App Registry code. We immediately found several code paths that resulted in non-optimal queries against our database. Under light load they were no trouble, but under heavy load we started to see how they could cause problems. There were two App Registry endpoints that were having issues with the heavier load- one that listed all packages in a repository and one that returned all blobs for a package.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Remediations</h3>
<p>For the next week, we&nbsp; made optimizations both on and around the App Registry code. We refactored obviously inefficient SQL queries, removed an out of process “tar” command being run on every blob retrieval, and added caching wherever possible. We ran extensive performance tests comparing our App Registry performance before and after the changes. API calls that previously took half a minute were now taking milliseconds. The following week, we deployed the changes into production and since then quay.io has been stable. We have monitored several sharp traffic spikes on the AppRegistry endpoint since then, but the improvements have prevented database lockups.</p>
<h3>What Did We Learn?</h3>
<p>While no provider wants downtime, we believe that the recent outages have helped to make quay.io a better service. There are a few key learnings that are worth sharing:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can never have enough data about who and what are using your service. Since Quay “just worked”, we never needed to spend much time analyzing our traffic shape to handle the load. This created a false sense of security that the service would scale indefinitely.</li>
<li>When service is down, restoration is your top priority. Because Quay continued to experience database lockups during the first outage, our standard procedures weren't having the intended effect of service restoration. This led to a situation where we spent more time performing analysis and gathering data in the hopes of finding the root cause instead of putting every effort on getting our clients up and running again.</li>
<li>Understand the impact of every one of your service’s features. App Registry was seldom used by our customers, so it wasn’t a major priority for …</li></ol></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>

  <hr id="top">

  <p>This is a fun blog post to write for two big reasons.</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Thanks to Google Fonts (especially <a href="https://twitter.com/davelab6">Dave Crossland</a>) all of our typefaces have been liberated! What does that mean? Each one is now open source and free for all, forever.</li>
  <li>We made a new website to accommodate this big change, and it is more robust than before with better type preview tools</li>
</ol>
<p>Getting our work on to <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> is still a work in progress, but the typefaces (including variable versions) will make it there eventually. In the meantime, they are available on <a href="https://github.com/etcetera-type-co">Github</a> and each font page on our site is showing the latest version in webfont (woff2) form.</p>
<p>We haven't blogged in over a year but during that quiet time we deleted our social media profiles. However, several thousand of you have signed up for our newsletter, which is how we're going to spread the word about these huge updates. We'll blast the news out soon. It feels good to relaunch the website with no store functionality necessary. We're free. The fonts are free.</p>
<p>All of our work has been improved dramatically since we initially published them. Each typeface now meets the <a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/gftools/tree/master/Lib/gftools/encodings/GF%20Glyph%20Sets">Google Fonts Plus glyph set</a> requirements, and each one has received many aesthetic upgrades as well. We could post a bunch of images here but how about some big links to the respective font pages, yeah?</p>

<p>Web scraping is great, but it also tends to blow up rather easily. you need to install proxies, get around captchas and a lot more. Often you need databases, …</p><p>It gets complex rather fast, and then you don’t even have your results yet. Here I have a minimalistic example on how to analyze and plot a web scraped dataset.</p><p>We scraped a dataset that looks like:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/2020/08/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/image-5.png 600w, https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/2020/08/image-5.png 700w"></figure><p>When analyzing the dataset for quality and bias, we want to know how many VCs are in the dataset grouped by <code>Investmentsize</code>.</p><p>To load the data, we use a <strong><strong>json</strong></strong> endpoint as the data will be scraped and monitored every day. let’s use <a href="https://api.scraper.ai/api/website/02209169-a5fb-4a90-b540-9b86a751de95?api_key=10c5a982abeefecc50a68f134ff470ec&amp;json" rel="noopener nofollow">https://api.scraper.ai/api/website/02209169-a5fb-4a90-b540-9b86a751de95?api_key=10c5a982abeefecc50a68f134ff470ec&amp;json</a> as an example, this dataset contains the data shown above in the table.</p><pre><code># getting the scraped data
url = 'https://api.scraper.ai/api/website/02209169-a5fb-4a90-b540-9b86a751de95?api_key=10c5a982abeefecc50a68f134ff470ec&amp;json'
r = requests.get(url).json()</code></pre><p>Now we have a dictionary with data, to convert this to a dataset we use <strong><strong>pandas</strong></strong> where we take the count of each investment size.</p><p>Notice the <strong><strong>map</strong></strong> is being used to only take out the <code>Investmentsize</code> and get a list of investment sizes</p><pre><code># preparing the data frame
df = pd.DataFrame({"investment_size": map(lambda val: val["Investmentsize"], r["data"])})
df = df.value_counts().rename_axis('investment_size').reset_index(name='count')</code></pre><p>the data frame now looks like</p><figure><img src="https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/2020/08/image-6.png" alt=""></figure><p>After which we can plot a barplot for example. In this example <strong><strong>seaborn</strong></strong> is used.</p><pre><code># plotting
sns.set(style="ticks", palette="pastel")
sns_plot = sns.barplot(x="investment_size", y="count", data=df)
sns.despine(offset=10, trim=True)
sns_plot.get_figure().savefig("output.png")</code></pre><p>and you’ll see an image like</p><figure><img src="https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/2020/08/image-7.png" alt=""></figure><p>Everything put together:</p><pre><code>import requests
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd

# getting the scraped data
url = 'https://api.scraper.ai/api/website/02209169-a5fb-4a90-b540-9b86a751de95?api_key=10c5a982abeefecc50a68f134ff470ec&amp;json'
r = requests.get(url).json()

# preparing the data frame
df = pd.DataFrame({"investment_size": map(lambda val: val["Investmentsize"], r["data"])})
df = df.value_counts().rename_axis('investment_size').reset_index(name='count')

# plotting
sns.set(style="ticks", palette="pastel")
sns_plot = sns.barplot(x="investment_size", y="count", data=df)
sns.despine(offset=10, trim=True)

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>All docker containers are started from an image.</p>
<h2 id="whats-an-docker-image">What’s an Docker image?</h2>
<p>Image is a collection of read only layers with everything we need to run application. Commonly in image we have base layout of operating system we had choose and some necessary binaries to start our application.</p>
<p>For exaple, for PostgreSQL container image could contain CentOS base filesystem template, PostgreSQL binaries and some configuration files.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-build-docker-image">How we build Docker image?</h2>
<p>We build image by issuing command <code>docker build</code>, but before we use it we need to create a Docker
file.</p>
<p>Simplest-minimal command to build image:</p>
<p><code>docker build -t postgresql-server:11.6 .</code></p>
<p>We just use <code>-t</code> for setting image name and tag.<br>
Dot at the end means that for build context we choose current dir - we could specify here full path to build context directory, which should provide Dockerfile and other files that we want to copy into our image at building process.</p>
<p>Another important <code>docker build</code> parameters are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--pull</code> - Always pull a newer version of the image from which we build</li>
<li><code>--no-cache</code> - disable layer build cache</li>
<li><code>--build-arg</code> - send to docker daemon values for parameters from Dockerfile</li>
<li><code>--file</code> - choose custom Dockerfile location(out of build context directory)</li>
</ul>
<p>For complete list check <code>docker build -h</code></p>
<p>Before we use below command first we have to prepair Dockerfile.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-dockerfile">What is a Dockerfile?</h2>
<p>Dockerfile is text file with all commands needed to create environment for our application. We can easly define what files we want to include in our image, what binaries will run in container or what ports we want to expose from it. Using Dockerfile gives us possibility to fast create multiple enviroments just by modifying file and reissuing <code>docker build</code>.</p>
<p>Assume that we have our java application in 0.1 version currently running - we get from dev team 0.2. Only thing we have to do is to change in Dockerfile path to jar file(or if we put app version in variable use parameter <code>--build-arg</code> - later about it in sample) and issue <code>docker build</code> - of course we should provide proper name for new image which will reflect app version. After image build we can start container with new application.</p>

</span></code></pre></div><h2 id="what-commands-in-dockerfile-we-have">What commands in Dockerfile we have?</h2>
<h3 id="from">FROM</h3>
<p><code>FROM [--platform=&lt;platform&gt;] &lt;image&gt;[:&lt;tag&gt;] [AS &lt;name&gt;]</code></p>
<p><code>FROM centos7</code></p>
<p><code>FROM</code> tells Docker Engine which image it has to use as base image for current build.</p>
<p><code>[--platform=&lt;platform&gt;]</code> flag can be used to specify the platform of the image when we are building multi-platform image. For example, <code>linux/amd64</code>. By default image is build with platform on which build is triggered.</p>
<p><code>[AS &lt;name&gt;]</code> clause is used for creating multi stage builds. I will cover this topic in another post.</p>
<p>In example we use CentOS operating system, we didn’t specified any tag because we want newest CentOS image for version 7.</p>
<p>Every command under <code>FROM</code> directive will be run on base image. It’s important to notice that we don’t have to use as base images OS image. We can use any correctly build image, and build on top of it.</p>
<p>It is possible to parametrize image version specified in <code>FROM</code> clause with <code>ARG</code> and <code>--build-arg</code>.</p>
<h3 id="arg">ARG</h3>
<p><code>ARG &lt;name&gt;[=&lt;default value&gt;]</code></p>
<p><code>ARG PG_MAJOR</code><br>
<code>ARG PG_MINOR</code></p>
<p><code>ARG</code> clause define build time variable.<br>
We can pass parameters for it with <code>--build-arg</code> for <code>docker build</code> also we can specify default value for it in case of omitting in <code>--build-arg</code> by doing like <code>ARG PG_MINOR=11</code>.</p>
<p>This variables are available only at build time!</p>
<p>In our example we user <code>ARG</code> for PostgreSQL version. By doing so, we can build from one Dockerfile multiple images with different PostgreSQL engines. We can use <code>ARG</code> before <code>FROM</code> for parametrizing version of base image.</p>
<h3 id="env">ENV</h3>
<p><code>ENV &lt;key&gt; &lt;value&gt;</code></p>
<p><code>ENV PG_PORT 5432</code></p>
<p><code>ENV</code> clause define runtime variable.<br>
In form without <code>=</code> sign - all characters after name of variable are treat as one string including whitespaces.
The <code>ENV</code> variables will persist when a container is run. We can change them using <code>docker run --env &lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</code> on next container start.</p>
<h3 id="argenv-trick">ARG/ENV trick</h3>
<p><code>ARG PG_MAJOR</code><br>
<code>ARG PG_MINOR</code></p>
<p><code>ENV PG_MAJOR=${PG_MAJOR:-11}</code><br>
<code>ENV PG_MINOR=${PG_MINOR:-5}</code></p>
<p>Why we do something like this?</p>
<p>As mentioned, <code>ENV</code> - runtime variable, <code>ARG</code> build variable which can’t be accessed at container runtime.<br>
In our example, we want to modify version of PostgreSQL which we will use at build time, but what if after build we need this variable values for some operations which can happen in some scripts in our container?</p>
<p>To persist this variables and make them available in running container we make <code>ARG</code> variables without default.
Later we use them to set <code>ENV</code>'s. Also we move default values set to ENV(shell syntax for setting default value).</p>
<p>Now we can manipulate values with <code>docker build --build-arg</code>, but we also have them available after build at running container.</p>
<h3 id="label">LABEL</h3>
<p><code>LABEL &lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt; &lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt; &lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</code></p>
<p><code>LABEL maintainer="lukas@mail.com"</code></p>
<p><code>LABEL</code> is used for adding some metadata to image which we will be visible in <code>docker inspect</code> output.<br>
In example we add info about image building person.<br>
We can specify multiple labels - in multiple or one line.</p>
<h3 id="run">RUN</h3>
<p><code>RUN &lt;command&gt;</code><br>
<code>RUN ["exec", "param1", "param2"]</code></p>
<p><code>RUN chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh</code></p>
<p><code>RUN</code> execute command on operating system of container.<br>
If you just give command after <code>RUN</code> it will be execute in shell - for Linux it will be probably <code>bash</code>.
If you use <code>[]</code>(JSON form) it will execute command in raw mode - without shell characteristic behaviours. You should remember to use "” around each part of command.</p>
<p>Each <code>RUN</code> command creates new layer in image. Lesser layers, the better. Always try to merge multiple commands making some logical unit of work into one <code>RUN</code> statement.<br>
For example, appending to file, moving it and changing permissions.<br>
Use for it shell syntax like <code>RUN &lt;command&gt;; &lt;command2&gt;; &lt;command3&gt;</code> in Linux.</p>
<h3 id="copy--add">COPY &amp; ADD</h3>
<p><code>ADD [--chown=&lt;user&gt;:&lt;group&gt;] &lt;src&gt;... &lt;dest&gt;</code><br>
<code>COPY [--chown=&lt;user&gt;:&lt;group&gt;] &lt;src&gt;... &lt;dest&gt;</code></p>
<p><code>COPY my-yum-repo.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/</code></p>
<p><code>ADD</code> and <code>COPY</code> command will move files or directories from src to dest.
In most cases <code>COPY</code> is command you need.
<code>ADD</code> will be used only when you want to copy from URL - that is main difference between them, <code>COPY</code> don’t work over network - just local files.</p>
<p>In both cases build context is your “root” path from which you can use relative paths like <code>somefolder/somefolder2/somefile</code></p>
<p>In both cases you can use wildcards like <code>*</code> or <code>?</code>.</p>
<p>In both cases you can use <code>[--chown=&lt;user&gt;:&lt;group&gt;]</code> parameter to set owner and group for things that you place into image.</p>
<h3 id="volume">VOLUME</h3>
<p><code>VOLUME ["&lt;path&gt;"]</code></p>
<p><code>VOLUME ${PG_DIR}</code></p>
<p><code>VOLUME</code> creates mount point in filesystem of container for external volumes.</p>
<h3 id="entrypoint--command">ENTRYPOINT &amp; COMMAND</h3>
<p><code>ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"]</code></p>
<p><code>ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh"]</code></p>
<p><code>ENTRYPOINT</code> defines binary or shell script which will start immediately after starting container.<br>
In our example we have <code>docker-entrypoint.sh</code> script which can contain logic like: if <code>$PG_DATA</code> empty initialize new postgresql cluster with <code>initdb</code>, if not empty - start postgresql with <code>/usr/bin/postgres -D $PG_DATA</code>.<br>
We can pass arguments to <code>ENTRYPOINT</code> by adding it to <code>docker run</code> after image name.</p>
<p><code>COMMAND</code> clause will be support command for <code>ENTRYPOINT</code> - it will hold default parameters for binary started in <code>ENTRYPOINT</code> in case when they are must exists and we do not pass anything to <code>docker run</code>.
In our example there isn’t need for using <code>COMMAND</code>.</p>
<p>It is possible to override <code>ENTRYPOINT</code> when starting container with <code>docker run --entrypoint</code> parameter.</p>
<h3 id="expose">EXPOSE</h3>
<p><code>EXPOSE &lt;port&gt; [&lt;port&gt;/&lt;protocol&gt;]</code></p>
<p><code>EXPOSE 5432</code></p>
<p><code>EXPOSE</code> is documentation command that shows at which ports services in container will listen.</p>
<h3 id="user">USER</h3>
<p><code>USER &lt;user&gt;[:&lt;group&gt;]</code></p>
<p><code>USER</code> instruction will set user from which all <code>RUN</code>, <code>CMD</code> and <code>ENTRYPOINT</code> commands will run.</p>
<h3 id="workdir">WORKDIR</h3>
<p><code>WORKDIR &lt;path&gt;</code></p>
<p><code>WORKDIR</code> will set current working directory for all <code>RUN</code>, <code>CMD</code>, <code>ENTRYPOINT</code>, <code>COPY</code> and <code>ADD</code> commands.</p>
<h3 id="onbuild">ONBUILD</h3>
<p><code>ONBUILD &lt;dockerfile_command&gt;</code></p>
<p><code>ONBUILD</code> will trigger only if current image will be used as base image to build a new one. After <code>ONBUILD</code> we can specify any of the instructions explained below.</p>
<h4 id="example-build-process-for-our-dockerfile">Example Build process for our Dockerfile</h4>
<p>With file described below and other needed file in build context directory:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div>
        <div>
          <p>Have you ever "gone the other way", by which I mean where most people use product A then usually "grow up" or "evolve" and use product B, and you went the other way! B to A. A made up example of B to A would be ridesharing apps -&gt; calling a taxi service on the phone.</p>
<p>In the software world, when you go the other way you notice how all the blog posts, online help is not really helpful at all. They assume you'd only ever go A -&gt; B.</p>
<p>Examples of this I have found are: moving from AWS to Heroku for hosting or from Ledger-CLI to YNAB4 for budgeting. </p>
<p>I'll cover the first of those examples in this article. I will talk about going from AWS to Heroku for the tryjobalerts.com site hosting and data processing.</p>
<h2 id="william-shock-yes-bill-shock">William Shock. Yes... Bill Shock.</h2>
<p>I'm guessing many of you have tried the generous free year of AWS services, and then got your first bill on the 13th month and said "errr. OK". That happened to me and prompted me to cull or move out a load of stuff running in AWS. On the flip side, I was amazed at how cheap SES is - I think my bill was $0.10, and how expensive Elastic Search is, where my bill was $50 for a hardly used cluster. I would have not been suprised to see those numbers reversed.</p>
<p>However before the bill, I had started off moving EC2 servers to Heroku. The reason wasn't cost - Heroku is typically a little more expensive as it provides additional wrapping and services over cloud infrastructre. I moved for the obvious reason that I'm lazy. Which is a codeword for good time prioritisation. I don't want to manage a operating system, server or CI pipeline. Instead I want an expert to take care of that for me for an extra $5 a month. </p>
<p>The point where I switched from EC2 to Heroku wasn't a well thought out logical decision, based on sitting on a leather couch, musing about software architecture. It was an emotional decision based on my node app crashing, and all my services for tryjobalerts.com being out of action for 5 minutes and counting. What if someone tries to edit their settings and they get an error page? how embarassing. Although not that unusual these days, I didn't want to be the one.</p>
<p>What to do next? Well, in the time honoured solution of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nn2FB1P_Mn8">"turning it off and on again"</a>, I restarted the EC2 instance and BaaM! the node app crashed again. Whatever it did, it took out the machine in such a way I couldn't connect to it via SSH to fix the problem. By this point I rashly decided to move to Heroku. I just didn't have the heart to fix this shit when I wanted to be coding. And I knew this would likely happen again and again, and I'd probably end up on the slow march towards Kubernetes.</p>
<p>Was that a hasty decision? Well maybe it was, but it had been a subconcious thought for quite a while. Setting up nginx, let's encyrpt, PM2 etc. etc. was mildly intersting but feels like a distraction from what I am really trying to do. I am happy for someone else to deal with that, and if everything dies, build them up again. I'll concentrate on the code, thank you very much.</p>
<p>I gave Heroku a try. I thought, let's just see how easy it is. If it "just works" I'll switch over. Otherwise I'm downloading k8s (joking!). I was working on this while the site was out like a light, no one could access their settings, sign up or receive an email - so no pressure.</p>
<p>Moving to Heroku was redicuously easy. I just had to create a file called Procfile with this in it:</p>
<pre><code>web: node distjs/node/index.js
worker: node distjs/bot/index.js</code></pre><p>And set up a few things in the Heroku UI - secrets and such like. I also had to change the port express run on from a fixed port 3001 to the number Heroku provides as an environment variable. Within 15 minutes I say I had it working, sans DNS entries.</p>
<p>I kept SES and PSQL on AWS, and everything worked lovely.</p>
<p>I kept things this way for a few weeks. I then got that bigger than expected bill from AWS, including a fair amount for the PSQL. Nothing too catastophic but it didn't seem like good value for money. </p>
<h2 id="heroku-has-a-weird-limit-for-psql-hobby-basic">Heroku has a weird limit for PSQL Hobby Basic</h2>
<p>I noticed Heroku offers a "Hobby Basic" $9/month PSQL with up to 10M rows. It turns out I use a decent amount of space in TEXT fields, but not too many rows. So I migrated to that. Yes unbelievably I am migrating something from AWS to Heroku to save money.</p>
<p>The limit is weird, being based on number of rows rather than storage size. I wonder how much excellent data you can store as blobs in 10M rows - maybe I should keep quiet as the Heroku Product Owner could be reading.</p>
<p>I searched online for the best way to move the data over. I like Stack Overflow because if someone has had a war story you hear about it instead of experiencing it first hand. However most of the advice online is how to get your data out of Heroku into AWS. Going the other way. </p>
<p>Therefore I tried a couple of ways. It turned out it was easy enough to use psql command line tools <code>pg_dump</code> and <code>pg_restore</code>. It worked first time and took about 30 minutes to do - most of the time was me doing housework while waiting for <code>pg_restore</code> to do it's work.</p>
<p>(Incase it's helpful to anyone, the tip here is don't use the Heroku CLI, get the connection details from the Heroku portal, and use the psql standard tools.)</p>
<p>It is quite amazing to me that Heroku turns out to be cheaper on the PSQL database. It might be because they don't offer as much power as RDS, although they are using AWS in some capacity - perhaps they manage the VM themselves. </p>
<p>It could be that Heroku is happy to lose a bit of money on that Hobby Basic tier, or they more aggressively share resources than AWS does in RDS, so under load it would crack sooner.</p>
<p>Heroku's Hobby Basic PSQL doesn't offer rollbacks, and that could be another reason it's cheap. It means I need to take care of backups myself, however this can be automated quite easily with a periodic dump of the DB.</p>
<h2 id="dont-be-too-cheap-though">Don't be too cheap though</h2>
<p>The big mistake I made when moving to Heroku was to try and use the free dynos. Only do this for non-production MVPs. By using the free ones, I had to do a lot of work setting up SSL with Cloudflare, and I never quite got it to work. </p>
<p>I then realised I needed the paid dynos anyway because the free ones cannot be restarted (!) without a deployment. So I upgraded, and then the SSL was sorted. No Cloudflare needed. Had I done that in the first place I'd have saved a couple of hours of frustrating DNS hacking.</p>
<p>It's always a fine line. I mean you try to save money where you can, but sometimes you don't know in advance what the free-tier traps are. Maybe Heroku could make this more obvious, but they did warn that free dynos are mainly for hobby use, so fair enough.</p>
<h2 id="herokus-herokus-£2-a-lb">Herokus! Herokus! £2 a lb!</h2>
<p>I sound like a Heroku salesman at this point. There are other "Platform as a Service" offerings out there. I had just used Heroku before in 2014, and liked that it still existed, so I used that. However there could be better options for you, check them out. Or maybe a regular old cloud like AWS is what you needed all along.</p>
<p>Regardless, it's OK to go the other way, choose whatever makes sense for the project you are doing.</p>

        <div>
            




<p>Does your CMS leak drafts?</p>



<p>I don’t know about you but I’d be pretty concerned if I found out an unfinished work or report I was working on, was visible to the public. </p>



<p>It is a common feature of blogging platforms to let authors “export” drafts that can be shared with friends and peers to seek feedback.</p>



<p>Ideally, these would need the viewer to sign-in to the website, but not always.</p>



<p>Medium, dev.to, and other sites have similar features which let you “preview” and share draft versions of your blog posts.</p>



<p>But in the case of Hacker Noon, I came across an interesting finding.</p>



<p>Google is indexing these unpublished drafts and it is not clear why.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="728" src="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-09-at-9.00.26-am-1024x728.png" alt="" srcset="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-09-at-9.00.26-am-1024x728.png 1024w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-09-at-9.00.26-am-300x213.png 300w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-09-at-9.00.26-am-768x546.png 768w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-09-at-9.00.26-am.png 1502w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-srcset="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-09-at-9.00.26-am-1024x728.png 1024w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-09-at-9.00.26-am-300x213.png 300w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-09-at-9.00.26-am-768x546.png 768w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-09-at-9.00.26-am.png 1502w" data-src="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-09-at-9.00.26-am-1024x728.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption><strong>Google indexing Hacker Noon unpublished drafts</strong><br>Source: SecurityReport.com</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Moreover, unlike with Medium or dev.to, because of Hacker Noon’s predictable URL structure of drafts, anyone can simply run a search with the following string to see these:</p>



<pre>site:app.hackernoon.com/drafts/</pre>



<p>This shows various kinds of unfinished pieces which are still in progress, being edited live, were submitted, or rejected at some point. </p>

<h2>Indexed from public forums?</h2>



<p>My first hunch was, perhaps, these drafts are being indexed by Google from public forums.</p>



<p>It isn’t uncommon for Hacker Noon authors to publicly post their <em>finished</em> draft links in <a href="https://community.hackernoon.com/c/story-not-published" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forums</a>.</p>



<p>Typically authors do this to request editors to publish their drafts that have been sitting in the editorial queue for a while.</p>



<p>But in case of this particular article, for example, doing a search for its content yielded the one and only result: the unfinished draft.</p>

<p>Further to my investigation, there’s no “robots.txt” file on the “app.hackernoon.com” subdomain which could potentially prevent this by simply telling search engines not to look beyond <em>“/drafts/</em>.”</p>



<p>The “robots.txt” existing on the main hackernoon.com domain doesn’t (and can’t) do much in preventing the automatic indexing.</p>

<h2>Finished pieces have ‘draft’ versions too</h2>



<p>I have also seen “draft” clones of already published, live stories too.</p>



<p>For example, this published article can be accessed at its <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-to-reset-password-with-nodejs-and-angular-part-2-6815t3z8v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live link</a> but also has its draft version available via search engines.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I was not able to overwrite any drafts. Altering the content and pressing “Save” or “Save and Publish” buttons would simply not bring about any updates—unless done by the rightful author of the story.</p>



<p>But the issue remains, why can I see unpublished drafts through Google?</p>



<p>And if the issue is with Hacker Noon, a popular “independent technology media site with 7,000+ contributing writers, 200,000+ daily readers and 8,000,000+ monthly pageviews,” how many other blogs may be impacted by flaws like these?</p>



<p>In the meantime, you may only want to put in Hacker Noon drafts what you’re okay with the world seeing.</p>



<p>Perhaps, use an offline word processor, and copy-paste your final content into Hacker Noon drafts just when you’re ready to submit. </p>



<p><strong>Disclosure note: </strong>I had reported this issue to the Hacker Noon team last week via both email and Twitter but haven’t heard back since. Given this is a low severity flaw (most drafts wouldn’t reveal anything overly sensitive) and that Google already shows up the drafts, I have disclosed this flaw here.</p>

			<h2>–ise or –ize?</h2>
			

                    <p>There is nothing like a good rant!&nbsp; It may not 
					<span lang="en-gb">improve </span>the world, and it may not 
					<span lang="en-gb">fix the issue that initiated the </span>rant, but it feels so <em>good </em>afterwards.</p>

                    <p>This rant is about the suggestion that the use of a
                    ‘z’ in words like nationalization is somehow
                    wrong, or American. It must be admitted that there are
                    words with a ‘z’ in them that are purely
                    American, like advertize, or maybe just wrong, like
                    surmize. Sometimes it is simply error — a word whose
                    spelling is not known, and whose correct spelling is not
                    sought, is arbitrarily given a ‘z’ in the
                    honest but mistaken belief it is correct. Sometimes words
                    with a z-form in American represent an older (perhaps
                    Elizabethan) form of English that made its way to the USA
                    before the language was standardized in England. More
                    likely, the American ‘z’ is one of Noah
                    Webster’s attempts to ‘standardize’ or
                    ‘improve’ American usage of English when he
                    produced his famous dictionary in 1828, in which his
                    decision to make deliberate and extensive revisions of
                    spelling was implemented — he has been described as a great
                    spelling reformer (I also had a go at reforming spelling
                    when I was at school but it wasn’t appreciated).
                    Webster evidently decided to use a ‘z’ wherever
                    he considered the pronunciation called for it. This was a 
					highly unusual example of a dictionary leading the written 
					language rather than attempting to reflect it.</p>

                    <p>This polemic is nothing to do with the Americans. If we
                    overlook the various words that the Americans deliberately
                    choose to spell differently, the majority of words that take a
                    ‘z’, or an ‘s’ that is pronounced
                    like a ‘z’, seem to fall very clearly into
                    those that must take an ‘s’ (like
                    <em>compromise</em>, where the derivation is
                    –misser), those that must take a ‘z’,
                    (like <em>prize</em>), and the rest, about which
                    controversy apparently rages (if only here).</p>

                    <p>I have been to a great deal of trouble to look into
                    this, looking not only at various text books and style manuals,
                    but also at a range of literature over the years to see
                    which spelling was preferred. I refer only to cases of the 
					third type given above where writers <span lang="en-gb">or 
					their publishers </span>have come to regard the 
					use of 's' as an acceptable alternative to the 'z' (we are 
					all agreed that misuse of the two other types would be an 
					error).</p>

                    <p>It seems to me that in books printed in England the use
                    of the ‘z’ overwhelmingly predominated until
                    the Second World War, though on a far smaller scale the
                    ‘s’ can be found used by some printing houses,
                    even in Victorian times. Textbooks set out the correctness
                    of using ‘z’, some of them setting out in
                    considerable detail the rationale for use of
                    ‘s’ or ‘z’ depending on origin.
                    After the Second World War the ‘s’ alternative
                    is more frequently offered as a possibility and some house
                    style manuals (though not Oxford’s) indicate a
                    preference for ‘s’ — not because of any
                    suggestion that ‘z’ is wrong, mark you, but
                    because ‘s’ had come to be tolerated and it avoided
                    having to remember which usage is which. Recent manuals and
                    dictionaries seem to have given up on the prescriptive use
                    of a ‘z’, though it is usually offered as an
                    alternative where correct.</p>

                    <p>It seems to me, summarizing, and using a ‘z’
                    correctly and non-Americanly, that:</p>
					

                    <p>For myself, I am very happy to keep using a
                    ‘z’ where it is appropriate, and I do try hard
                    to get it right but must admit to being inconsistent
                    sometimes. <span lang="en-gb">Using the ‘z’ form</span>, of course, invites people to pick me up on
                    it, whence I refer them to the Oxford English Dictionary
                    (the big one) and that generally ends the matter. On the 
					whole it is not a book to pick a fight with.</p>

                    <p>I suppose even after being presented with the facts
                    there will be people who will persist with the
                    ‘s’ option, and that’s up to them —
                    nothing more I can do. All I ask is that people determined
                    to use the ‘s’ do not regard those using the
                    ‘z’ as using Americanisms!!!</p>

                    <p>Many of the great publishing houses are happy with ‘
                    <em>-ize</em>’ etc endings, and large, influential
                    organizations such as London Transport invariably used the
                    ‘- <em>ize’ </em>form in posters and other public
                    communications, though their modern PC-originated material
                    leaves much to be desired.</p>

                    <p>I attach below <span lang="en-gb">(actually it is in the 
					next column) </span>various references that shed more light
                    on the matter. Note that some house style guidance which
                    has opted for the '- <em>ise</em>' form refers to
                    alleged controversy about the more correct spelling about
                    which 'the authorities differ'. House style guides
                    are not authorities of themselves, although they may rely
                    on them and refer to them. Of the ‘authorities’ I
                    have sought, they all indicate '- <em>ize</em>' as
                    etymologically correct and I have not yet found any
                    'authority' that explains how '-
                    <em>ise</em>' can be correct; if any reader knows of
                    one I'd be glad to hear of it and will be happy to
                    quote it below.</p>

                    <p>And do I feel better? Well as a matter of fact, I rather
                    think I do.</p>

                    <p><strong>-ize,</strong> the normal
                    suffix added to the stems of nouns in -ism (criticize),

                    -YSE</p>

                    <p>THE <em>-ize, not -ise,</em> ending
                    should be used where both spellings are in use. Generally,
                    <em>-ize</em> is a suffix applied to the stems of nouns
                    ending in <em>-ism, -ization, -izer,</em> -y, or to the
                    complete noun.</p>

                    <p><strong>Examples:</strong>
                    <br>
                    agony − agonize
                    <br>
                    civilization − civilize
                    <br>
                    appetizer − appetize
                    <br>
                    criticism − criticize
                    <br>
                    canal&nbsp;− canalize
                    <br>
                    transistor&nbsp;− transistorize</p>

                    <p>The ending -ise is correct when the
                    noun has <em>–is ­</em>as part of the stem, e.g.
                    in the syllables <em>-vis­</em> (seeing), -cis-
                    (cutting), <em>-mis-</em> (putting), and is also used for
                    those nouns which do not terminate in <em>-ism,
                    -ization,</em> etc. Exceptions are
                    aggrandize­ment/aggrandize, recognition/recognize, and
                    others noted in <em>C.O.D.</em> as `assimilated to verbs in
                    -ize'. Reference should be made to <em>C.O.D.</em> and
                    Collins, <em>Authors' and Printers'
                    Dictionary,</em> if there is any doubt. Some of the more
                    common <em>-ise</em> words <em>follow:</em></p>

                    <p>
                    advertise&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

August 9, 2020 | https://blog.visionappster.com/2020/08/06/overriding-virtual-functions-at-run-time/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.visionappster.com/2020/08/06/overriding-virtual-functions-at-run-time/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-orge37fcf2">
<p> The C++ standard does not specify how virtual functions should be implemented. In practice, however, compilers generate a virtual function table and place a pointer to it as the first member of a class. Multiple inheritance complicates things, but let’s not jump into that rabbit hole for now. Instead, consider the following C++ class: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>class</span> <span>A</span>
{
<span>public</span>:
  <span>virtual</span> ~<span>A</span>();
  <span>virtual</span> <span>int</span> <span>func</span>(<span>int</span>);
  <span>int</span> <span>member</span>;
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Since the structure of the virtual function table is not standardized, compilers may use different layouts. The layout used by the GCC compiler is this: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>struct</span> <span>A_vtable</span>
{
  <span>void</span>* <span>type_info</span>; <span>// </span><span>Pointer to type information</span>
  <span>void</span> (*<span>destructor</span>)(<span>A</span>*); <span>// </span><span>Function pointer</span>
  <span>int</span> (*<span>func</span>)(<span>A</span>*,<span>int</span>);    <span>// </span><span>Function pointer</span>
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Virtual function pointers are laid out in declaration order. The <code>A_vtable</code> structure reveals another C++ secret: member functions are just obfuscated versions of normal functions that get <code>this</code> as the first argument. That’s it. If you know Python, D or Nim, this won’t surprise you a bit. </p>
<p> The fact that C++ has a dedicated syntax for member functions leads to numerous problems which I’m not going to detail here. Fixes have been proposed since at least 2004, <a href="https://twitter.com/ericniebler/status/705855444049399808">to no avail</a>. The <code>std::function</code> class however had to do it the right way, so we ended up with a language that has one syntax as a language feature and another as a standard library feature. </p>
<p> OK, enough whining. Back to our original track. </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You write</span>
<span>int</span> <span>A</span>::<span>func</span>(<span>int</span> <span>param</span>)
{
  <span>return</span> param;
}

<span>// </span><span>The compiler actually generates</span>
<span>int</span> <span>A_func</span>(<span>A</span>* <span>this</span>, <span>int</span> <span>param</span>)
{
  <span>return</span> param;
}
</pre>
</div>
<p> Generated member function names are actually much more complicated due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling#C++">name mangling</a>. </p>
<p> There is one virtual table that is shared by all instances of <code>class A</code>, and the compiler will statically initialize it for you by placing the addresses of <code>A</code>‘s member functions and the generated type info into it. About like this: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>const</span> <span>A_vtable</span> <span>A_vtable_instance</span>
{
  &amp;A_type_info,  <span>// </span><span>We'll skip this now</span>
  &amp;A_destructor, <span>// </span><span>Pointer to an ordinary function</span>
  &amp;A_func        <span>// </span><span>Ditto</span>
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Now, whenever you create an instance of <code>class A</code>, you actually instantiate a structure like this: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>struct</span> <span>class_A</span>
{
  <span>A_vtable</span>* <span>vtable</span>;
  <span>int</span> <span>member</span>;
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> The compiler will initialize the <code>vtable</code> pointer for you. </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You write</span>
<span>A</span> <span>a</span>;

<span>// </span><span>What actually happens</span>
<span>class_A</span> <span>a</span>;
a.vtable = &amp;A_vtable_instance;
</pre>
</div>
<p> If you derive <code>B</code> from <code>A</code>, this is what happens (conceptually): </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You say</span>
<span>class</span> <span>B</span> : <span>public</span> <span>A</span>
{
<span>public</span>:
  <span>int</span> <span>func</span>(<span>int</span>) <span>override</span>;
  <span>virtual</span> <span>void</span> <span>func2</span>() <span>const</span>; <span>// </span><span>A new virtual function</span>
};

<span>int</span> <span>B</span>::<span>func</span>(<span>int</span>) {}

<span>void</span> <span>B</span>::<span>func2</span>() <span>const</span> {}

<span>// </span><span>The compiler generates</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>B_vtable</span>
{
  <span>void</span>* <span>type_info</span>;
  <span>void</span> (*<span>destructor</span>)(<span>B</span>*);
  <span>int</span> (*<span>func</span>)(<span>A</span>*,<span>int</span>);
  <span>void</span> (*<span>func2</span>)(<span>const</span> <span>B</span>*);
};

<span>// </span><span>Auto-generated default destructor.</span>
<span>void</span> <span>B_destructor</span>(<span>B</span>* <span>b</span>)
{
  A_destructor((<span>A</span>*)b);
}

<span>int</span> <span>B_func</span>(<span>B</span>*, <span>int</span>) {}

<span>// </span><span>Member function qualifiers are actually qualifiers</span>
<span>// </span><span>of the this pointer.</span>
<span>void</span> <span>B_func2</span>(<span>const</span> <span>B</span>*) {}

<span>// </span><span>Note that the first three members have the same</span>
<span>// </span><span>layout as A_vtable, which means we can safely access</span>
<span>// </span><span>a B_vtable pointer as an A_vtable pointer.</span>
<span>const</span> <span>B_vtable</span> <span>B_vtable_instance</span>
{
  &amp;B_type_info,
  &amp;B_destructor,
  &amp;B_func,
  &amp;B_func2
};

<span>struct</span> <span>class_B</span>
{
  <span>B_vtable</span>* <span>vtable</span>;
  <span>int</span> <span>member</span>;
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Whenever your code calls a virtual function in <code>A</code>, the compiler looks up the actual function to call through the virtual function table: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You say</span>
<span>B</span> <span>b</span>;
<span>A</span>* <span>a</span> = &amp;b;
a-&gt;func(1);

<span>// </span><span>You get</span>
<span>class_B</span> <span>b</span>;
b.vtable = &amp;B_vtable_instance;
<span>class_A</span>* <span>a</span> = &amp;b;
a-&gt;vtable-&gt;func(a, 1);
</pre>
</div>
</div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	
		
<p>In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to create a dashboard for your application’s structured logs in Kibana.</p>



<p>This is a follow-up to <a href="https://pmihaylov.com/go-structured-logs/">this article</a>, which covers how to instrument your Go application \w structured logging for use by Kibana (in this tutorial).</p>



<p>We’ll use Kibana v7.6 but any version you’re using should work. It’s just that your UI might look a bit different &amp; you’ll have to adjust.</p>



<p>Let’s jump straight in! We’ll stick to simple panels, which suite most of the use-cases you’d need.</p>



<h2>The Starting Point</h2>



<p>First, make sure you have <strong>docker</strong> and <strong>docker-compose</strong> installed.</p>



<p>For <strong>docker</strong>, follow the installation instructions for your platform <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">here</a>.<br>For <strong>docker-compose</strong>, follow the installation instructions <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">here</a>.</p>



<p>Afterwards, download this exercise’s repository on the <strong>kibana-dashboard-tutorial</strong> branch:</p>



<pre><code>git clone --branch kibana-dashboard-tutorial https://github.com/preslavmihaylov/tutorials</code></pre>



<p>What you already have is a Go application, which randomly produces logs for endpoints <strong>/payments/execute</strong>, <strong>/payments/list</strong>, <strong>/payments/authhold</strong>.</p>



<p>Starting from here, you will build a dashboard for effectively monitoring &amp; analysing incoming traffic.</p>



<p>In the following section, I will walk you through how to achieve this step by step.</p>



<h2>The Walkthrough</h2>



<h3>Boot up all containers</h3>



<p>Invoke this command to bring up all containers:</p>



<pre><code>docker-compose up</code></pre>



<p>For all following steps, make sure you never execute docker-compose down.</p>



<p>That command will not only stop all containers but delete them as well.</p>



<p>If you’re seeing some issues with booting up elasticsearch, here is a reference to some common issues &amp; how to handle them:</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/laradock/laradock/issues/1699">elasticsearch exit code 78</a><br><a href="https://github.com/10up/wp-local-docker/issues/6">elasticsearch exit code 137</a></p>



<h3>Setup your application’s baseline saved search</h3>



<p>Go to <a href="http://localhost:5601/app/kibana#/home">http://localhost:5601/app/kibana#/home</a> and open the <strong>Discover</strong> tab.</p>



<p>First, expand the tab names in the bottom-left as they are unfamiliar at first:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/sOpKgG_GBDIzy2fvbObbUz1ae3FYa9UsWSBaTtgJ1dQm_ZErpGHm2p8KMj1Ut8VxZhZbAl_4WMmGVhnNar-jH-kZyNCnjNzm4KOXQszVxWpTl0fbe3WTbaVBuG1vKjHM9WCVgoH1" alt="the expand button" width="285" height="152"></figure>



<p>Then, find the <strong>Discover</strong> tab in the top-left:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/0_OX3LO3-oLo6AT7SV2C3KZR6KFxHmC-ZO2Nzss_jD0MnKQw4XT1tB-wNvHJ0kDhldMfji6aGEtOY6MfuzRfzopNkL8XSmBuUYFZmg5lklWMDGIkxezE_jlh74CYw9RhZ8TnX-dX" alt="Click discover in the Kibana dashboard" width="382" height="221"></figure>



<p>Set the index pattern if you haven’t already:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/PigYRco-kctctYwF_Pm_WvojuunJ2WgexEEPr-noiquQ1AWE9DI-TGKVJQy0N8vox8bV8uOY1pvkU4oR8yLDvbzCKeqGSNDVtxgGwRGZ-ju1SqSnrinpAZvyoIwk4WmZvc0XAVfg" alt="Create index pattern"></figure>



<p>On the next step, choose <strong>@timestamp</strong> as a time filter:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/vqREV-Zx7s7Q3oT_iPwm4gnQ7lEPt31dncYn6JDymQsgOLR8xMRgt5PuO1FuMMZhy7zKH-PB-6UL_tTf71umcRAJmjudTPOsXujY4DxKiiIOztZMWSc63sUA3wAq4x9YQ77LbM7k" alt="Configure index pattern settings"></figure>



<p>Open the <strong>Discover</strong> tab again. This is what the initial view should look like:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2MMlqalb-uNDR-QrvALEq3F4uYNQsKDvMCK27JW5MuwOHTNWTKD-mGPmCxAb_73DBh7rPznvJZhBvUqcu_jw9sfcuAmvjRHVlkA87HPZfRXcBQhQcwnAo6AYXKjAmH6Qcug_BUQ6" alt="The discover tab"></figure>



<p>Currently, kibana shows all log lines from our application without any filtered fields. We can exclude all fields we don’t need:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Wb6ozBL95IghC5tObSqx09919GqDMrm6ecN0cvy4qj7i8vpp-MZv0z1qGpBFwVE9GQhI3jRKNPovPQa805muoW7CpPotC38vf7vNzb3bX_X3_F_BVra1Z_OIdXgrjBKRllrTqhv6" alt="Exclude unneeded fields" width="569" height="224"></figure>



<p>Next, select only the fields which make sense for our application.</p>



<p>Those are <strong>endpoint, method, countryISO2, userID, paymentMethod, userType, error, msg</strong>.</p>



<p>For each of them, click Add to add them to the selected fields in the visualised log:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/84_InyZ2LisDaJ9IMMeBm7z8p2A9tft4emi8HZHH4B1yUtCCrSjRqwtGXtuGk2sYxXHcZocCR-akkz5a4wK0tS_-Ti8CG3TI6crkPO_tLCutu0OIapeOlrRSHns8dLmFW0eqAJ3q" alt="Filtering the fields you need" width="366" height="532"></figure>



<p>In the end, this is what your <strong>Selected fields</strong> should be:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/L78RkT2keQToPjkGI7qvtsyjD_i8-iHeSnh-UuBr2BsGkHcj3eL_SlHONYS_w5sCLsZjYwDrVSH6MbdlWkwHcahyHwPb0Tgldn6vb4hShrZNynhdqdMv4Gb5Fc68TX5yeC35hzCU" alt="The final selected fields" width="318" height="312"></figure>



<p>If you did these steps properly, this is an example of what your logs should look like:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/qOgyrN0CfQqK1RCXsidLgywYZsE3NC2SaH-B0Zv0OG_KuuuOKkG1Sbpi5xxM0-Ds1NN0rc0uxos56RY30PR61VZeKAKu29ON2Dj80o93oeTuvOZyrE4jj-GpuNvgcvlh8xUvZILH" alt="Discover tab after filtering"></figure>



<p>We will use this saved search as a baseline view for our dashboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Click <strong>Save</strong> at the top-left to later reuse this view for our dashboard:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/gfsRAEnWZKcq2yW2xCVd2cd5ynVcTkvQM4xlwYfr-mGRvvrnv0cuHp8eOQcT6uE7C2-XuFIl0ZqHjvQGQvyc-qRDXJCOmhYuBI-Go9SYB8YRwofUigOjJOMMmLn6ei0qMWvgbF8M" alt="Saving your current view" width="448" height="271"></figure>



<p>This is one of the most useful views as it allows one to inspect the details of the events which happen in your application.</p>



<h3>Setting up your initial Kibana dashboard</h3>



<p>Open the <strong>Dashboard</strong> tab to create your first dashboard:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CZhCxyjk6NLXRnHFoZwUatYfdZ4BYYB3JF1PY_Ws9rSC0SlwavrsgTn8wbCv-t0Xs6LsPLJ_2YR9VHKC2k0HYPKHSv26KggKOzoYvXXwlJfM3zNmSuT0qsG_fbfzt2CTYvUI6DUa" alt="Your initial Kibana dashboard" width="343" height="318"></figure>



<p>Follow the instructions on-screen:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/UBxo4umfb5ZQJLrh-GeZOL37qVpfkjFbiWNs6dvd5a9pe8FxMghcxA7unUP0AB5VX7sI3OGfrLQyUpx2FoMp-24qmG6ftoQC6hUL71pmRReZy35z-g2-R1jpRqwZwk5awJX_A9wO" alt="Creating your first dashboard message"></figure>



<p>After this, you should see an empty dashboard which doesn’t show anything:</p>

<p>Click the <strong>Add</strong> button at the top-left to add a new visualisation:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2ITOX0ufcf7k4oxMFWsrbzX6znK1WKMbVICT_ND_mrUJE8Na4qTy0QoBGoTG9zQKxiVMrnSKvWyVV76NrL4ufXVt1bd01EUvg9-Q44QJHCkpcWn3q72cchXoBoL1xzLh5DYJfdy6" alt="Add a new element" width="457" height="189"></figure>



<p>You should see the name of the <strong>saved search</strong> you created in the previous step. Choose that:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/QRkAc6vPzbv6EVPqQKRr3O8QqlRNZyomKTV5lXkDQ4LSVkRAbkHimleDp9cuA6JyXqfKnFJoriZ_sbatRFn9Bk35rxuXUQzKpEY_E_v6LPKGJB4MALQfDeazZwV36DnzbET0_jXe" alt="Select a panel to add to"></figure>



<p>Next, resize it as you see fit and you should see the first panel in your dashboard:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/V0KPt4qbJEEqw00wz34Q3Vy74-a6k8Hz-CsjFJHHw9STU_YvQ7ALpS8q3lXrq1xqtrlmR3uw7XQzbShAtBcDn24SX_8W8GhU-c2_EjqWvVxcDDOUj8F6OoRaWlhCpK2LOGW8q7Ut" alt="Adding the saved search"></figure>



<p>This view is great for inspecting the details of all requests &amp; using it for additional filtering on a given property.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, we will need to add some more visualisations to be able to see aggregations of the data in our dashboard.</p>



<p>Save your new dashboard with a descriptive name and proceed to the next section:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Ro1XT4eK8OpXt04bx9p-iW-bGnY40exiPHMuv43rMEbqEiAJOjjoTrAnINrYGZ7MqPhoJnQ5RSKVhbXjUPCd5ArAK4WounbDc2EvxYVpiV-NMR7WctmZxqXX-9UVeKVX_Zl2EwoX" alt="Saving the Kibana dashboard" width="572" height="292"></figure>



<h3>Add a data table to monitor requests per endpoint</h3>



<p>In this step, we will create a <strong>data table</strong> which will show how many requests we get per endpoint.</p>



<p>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button at the top-left to edit the contents of the dashboard and select <strong>Add</strong> to create a new view.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the panel which pops up, create a new visualisation from the bottom-left:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/6Lm9lMxk027D2vlNr6EKco_7-YuU0trRDF4n36_RT-gzutB-JhJJmsSCO5bEe2hbL6yMq-VXnXNAwEmCQdl_dnmB4d-D4f8XMempHG3VBN3iI0w3rnnMEXo3wjf1_pbJlsjJwkG7" alt="Create a new visualization" width="232" height="169"></figure>



<p>Next, create a new data table:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/VU5aqUm8NHSNtjEauRaYk2fQuRQJufcTxDCt4ncttf3bLUTI1fixrr4vpleagwKLDnaN3rAmJAvVzohiBuCFqjsj7lhxBBcLbnfpjJdinBXlMFtCenCUwau1J9k6P63oNQHCsAv-" alt="Picking a visualization template"></figure>



<p>On the next screen, select your <strong>saved search</strong>’s name as the data source to use.</p>



<p>Afterwards, you should see a screen which simply shows the total count of requests in a table. This is because the table currently aggregates all requests &amp; shows the total count for them.</p>



<p>We will aggregate the data in the table by the <strong>endpoint</strong> keys. This will show the count of each request per endpoint.</p>



<p>To do this, add a new <strong>Bucket </strong>which splits rows:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Ea3DRqBlyXrF2T8AxMcpwZfaS4RHm1YjLN6FZblmzYYh33mjHtvuxFdAmv5GNvNsPvYUAN8iPwv_Gqg2YoHNsmBHJZN8IBqfs-S7eHKunWLhdD1cYUnu9ZNhyi64x-PVrsPAPCrq" alt="Split rows setting" width="305" height="213"></figure>



<p>As an aggregation, use <strong>Terms</strong>. This is a simple aggregation which simply groups the data by the unique values for the key we’ll choose:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OnjB7XL7F0DUbIpV5c4RseX8j8VTEpyLujiFsh8QZsB4DNJDesrRxmYn4FHRm5OSBhT86ninZhPu5F1AFaSPi9C7_xi_FqWQiu2rNHy3gJiDGYbLWD3mnZdphPLYCveI7lJ1j8kq" alt="Aggregating by Terms" width="315" height="335"></figure>



<p>Aggregate by the endpoint key and use the following configuration:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/vLSF0mZnVoe6r8I9YJ7AJkvmHNagHCFnfmKPPj3DcrvyAUaiF91CuH9XnHErDDK1UfhcDGEg4k0HR6uE2Z6O5p_bq5uhCFmzrC8xpD7hEpC7-nKi46YViQOebtU1sZxmsDF1znRN" alt="The aggregation settings" width="315" height="501"></figure>



<p>The Group other values in separate bucket will display all data which is too little and doesn’t fit in the table (the limit is 5 rows, which we specify) in a general <strong>“Other”</strong> bucket.</p>



<p>For example, if we had 7 different endpoint and five of them get 80% of the traffic, the 20% other values will be aggregated in a row called <strong>“Other”</strong>.</p>



<p>Now, click the Play button at the top of the window to see how your table looks. You should see the count of requests per endpoint:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/CAJmDkpnhc23grSBSFU9A7aGT0IQPt99JbO7nHxUwFoOdw85b216h4LZaJ7kPHathqxXzsow4wdV1WRfd-_cXOSi96rg0UHI6aVX_jqp0HLUMHtRX3c7R3lnRaFT5xtPQIA_Qjbw" alt="Initial view after aggregation"></figure>



<p>This view now looks quite useful. With it, we can track how much traffic we get per endpoint. Click the <strong>Save</strong> button at the top-left, give the new view a title (e.g. <strong>Calls by Endpoints</strong>) and rearrange your dashboard to look aesthetically pleasing:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/bM48fmgIUWuWRSDnCtfODM_C-dWyU759Fn_0X8IJ5d6IBili-hwx_5ir0UMP1SDY33opCN9y2UiMLzpN6ZWv-LoiAijEG-MsWcJNI77py6Al5r_Nq_n3RqZN4Ov0i7nuovbk0HZo" alt="Adding the new visualization"></figure>



<p>Let’s now do the same for the rest of our significant fields.</p>



<h3>Add a data table for all significant fields</h3>



<p>In this step, add a new table, following the same steps as the previous one, for <strong>method, countryISO2, userType </strong>and<strong> paymentMethod</strong>.</p>



<p>There is no need to include a view for <strong>userID</strong> as the granularity of that field is typically way too big to make a sensible dashboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, you can usually take that by making custom filters on some of the log lines in the saved search view.</p>



<p>After you go through this, here is what the dashboard should look like:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/0xWb_4KToEpnubYP_HCUZt_xA4SauxjOey0o5Rm5pIbp3M2_1JF62WOnYTAxcHpvMj0hskIho8t0Z309wC_Zn4Phw0iLqOCNXeFlLSAfns0yWmcamVFj07ae_l66eATgR16JPYj6" alt="Adding all data tables"></figure>



<p>Now, you can see aggregations for all significant data points you are interested in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you want to further inspect e.g. what payment methods one uses when calling the <strong>/payments/execute</strong> endpoint, you can “zoom in” on the data by filtering for that data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Try it out and explore for yourself:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EiwZazuFfHFDja9xHOlHFA4g6tq9QOmS-VasvNBFa8dAPKssp_HkoFRFrjxSlComlia2_hu27UjDJ-XKyU-exdy_2hHDBbQXIUYKwKQoCz3kOxrS_MTmdAUM9MuOg8jB8om43FNw" alt="Filtering by a given field"></figure>



<p>Here is a challenge for you, zoom in on the <strong>errors</strong> and identify which is the endpoint which has the most errors.</p>



<p>The scope of this exercise is creating the dashboard, but don’t worry. You will get to play with it in the following exercise.</p>



<p>Our dashboard already looks quite informative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there is one final touch it needs.</p>



<h3>Add a histogram for tracking success/error rate</h3>



<p>In this step, we will diverge from the good old data table and add a histogram to track the <strong>success-to-error</strong> ratio over time.</p>



<p>The rest of the views in the dashboard are typically used to find the root cause of an issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The view we’ll create now will enable us to quickly identify if there is an issue.</p>



<p>Create a new visualisation, but this time, select a <strong>Vertical Bar</strong>:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_8J7Rde6OK8aEqNkJqMjBBXQVv-usxg0Rw0WNvsL6s9MNq6z88SCs6JHGAARGnpDHTu94UUbnjpFYpJY7yb2DqS1FU_Fzo8ABWsICbRHwUaRDmF7xhAK6dMr3WxVwSKhCCQs3kuf" alt="Adding a histogram" width="614" height="482"></figure>



<p>In the beginning, you will simply see a single bar with the total count of requests in the given time period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For starters, add an X-Axis which will create time intervals for each of the lines in the histogram. This will allow us to see the tendency of events over time.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/B19Ck1BBahMGnlJ3YHe_5tcJjdhP_KcPv7rzgW_qplBVJtX8dfD-eXiTLk439QLpBCi9tbR8Oa5E0G0x9tZh5WH0zDWn81MTWSmCda860aTJ_GY4UQqV4d8MyCYdX7ymIO5GkQ3M" alt="Choosing the X-Axis"></figure>



<p>This time, the selected aggregation is Date histogram on the @timestamp field:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/TBUXiBsUAO0SZI2ivGataKkLHj_Q8l_oq2EOwgQ6S8QDAzwjszmlfqreRHYnpAwegSr1EU_5mbWaIX-1n8Eo80Qf5ryyvK3lyIwPNNFYTQEv-Fy6sCA4kSHatLicO8VJVm58MNje" alt="X-Axis settings" width="316" height="521"></figure>



<p>Click the <strong>Play</strong> button and see how the view changes to reflect the count of events over time:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qExMoMPhtNFolD4fVbY4t764bHmJiIEmcZp8GWwejRAzAua41mzIKSXmqz-jfs1nHvtTcy6nim-Tar4PCNEIEh-pU8DF1Tdbwj9jBeJ8VWWnLCzuEeD9iVG7yqIGwV2KiB6fSU8c" alt="Initial histogram"></figure>



<p>This is cool, but it would be useful if we could actually see how many of those requests are success and how many are errors.</p>



<p>To do this, let’s customize the existing Y-Axis to only aggregate successful requests.</p>



<p>First, change the Y-Axis aggregation from Count to <strong>Sum bucket</strong>.</p>



<p>Then, use <strong>Filters</strong> as the <strong>Bucket</strong> aggregation. This will allow us to use KQL (Kibana Query Language) to make any custom filter we like.</p>



<p>Add a filter which says select all messages which are not empty strings:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/AuHwKgmQA_Wzo56ryHueplQGmutENBR-TX4mF9Xo4xxXaKNE4nrVwSg_LxpR2s9y1LfqVmk40VgWaY0W5zhmvRybutXl4IjyEXcHS8G7lAPw9wnjjS3tdli9P3rH_0n_lKhdoBCW" alt="Setting up the Y-Axis" width="302" height="397"></figure>



<p>Next, add a custom label <strong>“Success”</strong> for this Y-Axis at the bottom of the panel.</p>



<p>Click the Play button to see the results. You should now see the number of successful requests every 30s. The default color, however, is a bit off, so change it at the top-right to green:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/S6bwh01v6y1l4dH7l_lmm80jUmNBkuwvt6jp7LzjeoDhJW0aZmoQoRqo1uKobvJgoUHY8Y6nwaY7dxKeXXj7Dq6rHMr6wk5mdKGgp6Xp095AhJpUCxugGBGvYLPX1pMcG_CvEKIY" alt="Choosing a histogram color" width="360" height="251"></figure>



<p>Now, it looks a lot better:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/y7CDOe4YE3xHDwRqIZIa7X7LZ-zIVanmC4Lva1kOdRVtwMtTeVYqQH4mVxFFr57agI-I7XMUfUS551BX0RZNwqNqwBo79-pW4XOBqL2kzxaz2cA8HMgkWWNnrQIjOSYuHQkWTVRs" alt="Result after changing color"></figure>



<p>We aren’t done yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s now time to stack the <strong>errors</strong> on this Y-Axis as well.</p>



<p>Collapse the current Y-Axis settings and add a new one:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/r51mHHvUWrY1v-9hVHInp8LDH_eotdD_QTuAxxjdBj_I6fQOgnhaxzS3EWev3T7un2R58KCm2l__AuaJy8lyHyZ5531N0LhpXi7Z9QCwoNJJWy70CBlM5x3tvjr5AmdUhg4DQQur" alt="Adding the Y-Axis metric" width="314" height="314"></figure>



<p>The setup for this Y-Axis is simpler.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Choose <strong>Sum bucket</strong> as an aggregation again and <strong>Terms</strong> as an aggregation for the bucket. Choose <strong>errors.keyword</strong> as the field to use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keep the rest of the settings as-is.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YR8U2O3MnC_7OuoKsouugdvgKOFX0t89bJqPQ64_aKyYowMK-jfJrQ1ZWEyZrgXFW9v2js-Y4sYBUKEjIHBce888TZL0irSgoIxeBr83VQkttxTVL9GLheRrsCM4wh-M6K6J-AX9" alt="Y-Axis metric setup" width="324" height="395"></figure>



<p>Add a custom label <strong>“Errors”</strong>, change the color to red and here’s what you get:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/0veByMCfwOGbMoc8g3KQ4eAUrb7qF63y5Wycud1lJ3WpWosPVqGmcbRdyr3GGEBa0wF61O2mvpW5SQFx1vRZE4y1xpcJ-Gu87AHVpDNsS_QdgJyfE-HSBUHLzK5VSSY9BvNv7UAL" alt="Success to error ratio"></figure>



<p>This is the success-to-error ratio, aggregated per 30s.</p>



<p>This view will now enable you to see the % of errors for all endpoints with a single glance.</p>



<p>You could also zoom in on the data again and see the % of errors per endpoint/payment method/userType/etc.</p>



<p>Save this view, add it to your dashboard, arrange it nicely at the top and gaze at your beautiful application dashboard:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ul1DY26Rc2lzZMT6um6-fKpJPiHj-8oJZ1zNSKFgh-6ry4qZgF3Q-rB1vOsb-BafHVsqXlo1n8BW-YgX6nPROxejdllPnai3cskLu_XNPpOsaMHUWI5idFsuBKw7EzTU8xUAx_vX" alt="Final dashboard"></figure>



<h2>Finale</h2>



<p>Congratulations. 👏👏👏</p>



<p>You’ve successfully completed the tutorial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You should now have a decent practice using Kibana to create basic dashboards for your application.</p>



<p>The final step of this exercise is to add such a dashboard for your real production application, buy a 146-inch monitor, attach it to the wall in your office, open your app’s dashboard, enter full-screen and enable <strong>Auto-refresh</strong>.</p>



<p>After you do this, all your colleagues from the other teams will stare at it enviously.</p>

                    <p><strong>Knowledge Graphs </strong>are very powerful NLP tools and advanced studies in the field of Knowledge Graphs have created awesome products that are used by milions of people everyday: think of Google, Youtube, Pinterest, they are all very important companies in this field and their knowledge graphs results are spectacular to analyze and use.</p><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1565449446922-702749bcaf1b?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" alt="A White Library In The Middle Of Stuttgart!

But the thing is, the more spectacular knowledge graphs are, the more difficult they are to build. You actually need more than one way of building a feature like this: think of triples, relationships, integrating with other data sources and so on. </p><p>In this article I'm going to talk about a small subset of knowledge graph relationships: <em>type-of relationships </em>or <em>is-a relationships</em>, meaning we will try to build a small knowledge graph using Python, SpaCy and NLTK. The knowledge graph will tell us if a certain object is a subclass (a type) of another object. </p><blockquote><em>Interested in more? Follow me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/b_dmarius">@b_dmarius</a> and I'll post there every new article.</em></blockquote><p>As usual on this blog, I will go through a little bit of theory, then code presentation and explanations and in the end results analysis. Feel free to skip to whichever section you feel is relevant for you. Also, all the code for this article i<a href="https://github.com/bdmarius/python-knowledge-graph-semantic-relationships">s uploaded on Github</a> so you can check it out (please make sure to star the repository as it helps me know the code I write is helpful in any way). We will go through all the code anyways.</p><h3 id="article-overview">Article Overview</h3><ul><li>What is Information Extraction</li><li>What is a Knowledge Graph</li><li>Knowledge Graph applications</li><li>Semantic relationships: hypernyms and hyponyms</li><li>Python Knowledge Graph project overview and setup</li><li>Python Knowledge Graph implementation using Python and SpaCy</li><li>Conclusions</li><li>Related articles</li><li>References</li></ul><p><strong>Information Extraction </strong>is one of the most important fields of Natural Language Processing tasks and it consists of techniques of extracting structured information from unstructured text. </p><p>There is a lot of information out there stored in plain text that we as humans are able to understand in a blink, but computers have lots of troubles with this task because they don't understand text, language and context. </p><p>So in information extraction tasks we try to process textual information and transform it in a way that computers are able to understand and use. For this we need to use various NLP tasks like:</p><ul><li><a href="https://programmerbackpack.com/machine-learning-project-series-building-a-personal-knowledge-management-system-part-1-named-entity-recognition/">Named Entity Recognition</a>: the task of understanding where and how entities such as people, organisations, events and so on are mentioned in a text</li><li>Named Entity Linking: understand how 2 or more entities are related to each other</li><li><a href="https://programmerbackpack.com/machine-learning-project-series-part-2-python-keywords-extraction/">Keywords extraction</a>: Extracting the most relevant words from a text. This can be done using <a href="https://programmerbackpack.com/automated-python-keywords-extraction-textrank-vs-rake/">multiple algorithms</a></li><li>Relations extraction using triples</li><li>Knowledge Graphs</li></ul><p>A knowledge graph is a particular representation of data and data relationships which is used to model which entities and concepts are present in a text corpus and how these entities relate to each other. </p><p>The concept of Knowledge Graphs borrows from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">Graph Theory</a>. In this particular representation we store data as:</p><figure><img src="https://programmerbackpack.com/content/images/2020/08/Python-Knowledge-Graphs---Knowledge-Graph-example.png" alt="Python Knowledge Graph - Knowledge Graph Relationship"><figcaption>Knowledge Graph relationship</figcaption></figure><p>Entity 1 and Entity 2 are called nodes and the Relationship is called an edge. Of course, in a real world knowledge graph there are lots of entities and relationships and there is more than one way to arrive at one entity starting from another. </p><p>Usually these type of graphs are modeled with <strong>triples</strong>, which are sets of three items like (subject, verb, object), with the verb being the relationship between the subject and the object - for example (London, is_capital, England).</p><p>In this article we are focusing on only one particular type of relationship, the "is-a" relationship. If we replace this in the image above we read it as "Entity 1 is a type of Entity 2", meaning Entity 2 is the broader type and Entity 1 is the narrower type - for example (Londin, is_a, City).</p><p>Knowledge Graphs have broad applications, out of which some have not even been succesfully built yet. If you need to better understand your data and the relationships between your data points, a knowledge graph is the way to go. But there are some particulary famous examples of uses of knowledge graphs used in real world use cases:</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph">Google Knowledge Graph</a> is particulary because they have made this term so popular in the latest years. They use knowledge graphs to enhance search results using some additional information that has been gathered from lots of sources on the internet. They also use it for the Instant Answers feature, where you get an info box answering a question you put in the Google search bar (try for example "Who is the godfather of Harry Potter?"</li><li><a href="https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/interest-taxonomy-a-knowledge-graph-management-system-for-content-understanding-at-pinterest-a6ae75c203fd">Pinterest is using knowledge graphs</a> to model interests of users on the platform. The Pinterest engineering blog is one of my favourites, feel free to read some of their posts.</li><li>Youtube is also using Knowledge Graph to understand what's behind a video and to recommend the videos to users (thus helping them solve the cold-start problem of their collaborative filtering algorithm).</li></ul><p>So we said we are going to use Python and SpaCy to build a knowledge graph containing "is-a" relationships. But before that (and I promise this is the last introductory section) we need to look into some theoretical aspects. </p><p>In more fancy linguistics terms, "is-a" relationships are named <strong>Hypernymy</strong> and <strong>Hyponymy </strong>relationships. So for example, if we say "Harry Potter is a book character", then "Harry Potter" is the hyponym (the narrow entity) of the relationship, while "book character" is the hypernym (the broad entity) of the relationship. </p><p>And because we are using only plain text to extract such information, we need to look at the structure of the sentences, take a look at what Part Of Speech each word represents and try to figure out relationships from there. That's why we say that we are analyzing <strong>semantic relationships</strong>.</p><p>Now, there are many techniques we can use to extract relationships from text: supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised techniques are rule-based techniques. And in this article we are going to take advantage of the fact that English is a well-structured language, so we can go with the rule-based techniques.</p><p>There has been a lot of research in this area but a popular piece of research is done by Marti Hearst [1] the results from this research are popularly known as the Hearst Patterns. She has identified a few patterns that can be used in English to extract hypernyms and hyponyms. In the following table hyponyms are represented by <em>h </em>and hypernyms by <em>H</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://programmerbackpack.com/content/images/2020/08/Python-Knowledge-Graph---Hearst-Patterns.png" alt="Python Knowledge Graph - Hearst Patterns"><figcaption>Hearst Patterns</figcaption></figure><p>We are going to use these patterns to try and figure out is-a relationships from plain text extracted from Wikipedia. It's now time to switch to the real action.</p><p>We are going to extract the text from 4 Wikipedia articles about 2 different subjects: London, Paris, WWI and WWII. We are going to use the Hearst Patterns to extract relationships from these 4 articles and add them to a graph. Then are going to display the graph and analyze of results. First let's install some dependencies.</p><pre><code>pip3 install spacy
pip3 install wikipedia
pip3 install nltk
pip3 install networkx
pip3 install matplotlib</code></pre><p>SpaCy is used for text processing, wikipedia is used for extracting the data. We are using NLTK just for a visualization of the relationships between words in a sentence. Networkx is used for building the graph and matplotlib is used for visualization.</p><p>Another command you should run in your terminal (especially if it's the first time you are using spaCy or if you are using a virtual environment is</p><pre><code>python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm</code></pre><p>This is used to download the spaCy pre-trained model for English that we are going to use in this project. This the the small model and another, larger one is available (en_core_web_lg) but that is not necessary for this project.</p><p>Let's take a quick peek at our project file structure.</p><figure><img src="https://programmerbackpack.com/content/images/2020/08/Python-Knowledge-Graph---Project-file-structure.png" alt="Python Knowledge Graph - Project file structure"><figcaption>Project file structure</figcaption></figure><p>There are quite a lot of file, but we are going to go through each other one by one and I'll provide simple explanations.</p><p>First let's get this out of our way: the <em>utils.py</em> file contains a small utility function that I've added to visualize the structure of a sentence. It uses the NLTK Tree and it is inspired by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/39104235">this StackOverflow answer</a>.</p><pre><code>from nltk import Tree

def buildTree(token):
    if token.n_lefts + token.n_rights &gt; 0:
        return Tree(token, [buildTree(child) for child in token.children])
    else:
        return buildTree(token)</code></pre><p>We are going to store relations in a <em>Relation </em>object and the code for this class is self-explanatory and located in <em>relation.py</em>.</p><pre><code>class Relation:

    __hypernym: str
    __hyponym: str

    def __init__(self, hypernym, hyponym):
        self.__hypernym = hypernym
        self.__hyponym = hyponym

    def getHypernym(self):
        return self.__hypernym

    def getHyponym(self):
        return self.__hyponym

</code></pre><p>I've also written another class to store all relations. The class is stored in <em>relation_provider.py</em> and, again, it is fairly simple.</p><pre><code>from relation import Relation

class RelationProvider:

    __relations: [Relation]

    def __init__(self, relations=[Relation]):
        self.__relations = relations

    def getRelations(self):
        return self.__relations
</code></pre><p>The first step is to extract the text from Wikipedia. We are using the <em>wikipedia </em>package to get that, and this functionality is found in <em>text_extractor.py</em>. We are first downloading the data and storing it in a local file. To get the text, we are reading that file and returing the entire text.</p><pre><code>import wikipedia


class TextExtractor:

    __pageTitle: str
    __pageId: str

    def __init__(self, pageTitle, pageId):
        self.__pageTitle = pageTitle

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>I am sure you have heard about <strong> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://discord.com/new">Discord</a></strong>, a real-time chatting tool that started as a <strong><em>Slack for Gamers</em></strong>. </p>
<p>Today, Discord is used as a community for designers, developers, artists, business managers, friends hangout zones, and more. It has become a reliable and welcoming place, no matter your interest or background. Features like video calling, audio calling and broadcasting make it a powerhouse. Surprisingly, these features work better in Discord than Slack and Microsoft Teams from my experience. </p>
<p>Here's an interesting video by Discord that shares its future goals and vision:</p>

<p>I am glad that at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hashnode.com/">Hashnode</a>, we switched from Slack to Discord for our team discussions and collaborations. It's been two years now, and we are thrilled with the experience so far. Recently, we opened up our Discord server for anyone to join and get help directly from the Hashnode team and community. We have exclusive channels for support, writing help, blog introductions, Hashnode challenges and more. More than 800 developers have joined us in just a few weeks. </p>
<p><strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://discord.gg/qsAQfxX">👉 Join Hashnode's Discord</a></strong></p>

<p>While I was setting up Hashnode's Discord server, I was also joining various other programming portals on Discord. While searching for the best servers to join, I discovered some amazing dev communities. In this article, I will list <strong>10 best discord developer servers</strong> everyone should join. If you are just getting started with programming and are looking for instant help from the community, consider joining them. </p>

<p>Sometimes secondhand books can come into our possession in ways that make it quite clear they need us to read them.</p>
<p>Such was the case with&nbsp;<em>Le fascisme italien</em>&nbsp;by Pierre Milza and Serge Berstein, (1) which reached me by means of a random sequence of events including a friend moving flat, an unexpected traffic jam and a small public park on the outskirts of Paris.</p>
<p>It did not disappoint and, as I am about to explain in more detail, helped me to see a number of crucial issues more clearly.</p>
<p>Firstly, it confirmed that, despite constant claims to the contrary, fascism was not at all anti-capitalist, but extremely pro-capitalist.</p>
<p>Secondly, it presented interesting parallels with the Coronavirus-linked totalitarian mindset so dominant in 2020, which I am calling ‘newnormalism’.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it sparked some wider reflection on my part about the participation of most of the left in this 21st century authoritarianism and how that relates to my own anti-fascist position.</p>
<p><strong>FASCISM AND CAPITALISM</strong></p>
<p>It is well known, I think, that Benito Mussolini, the fascist dictator, began his political career on the left and, when he started building a movement immediately after the First World War, the initial programme that attracted support was left-wing, with anarchist influences.</p>
<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://network23.org/paulcudenec/files/2020/07/Milza-and-Berstein-543x900.jpg" alt="" width="333" height="552"></figure>
</div>
<p>However, as Milza and Berstein make abundantly clear, this prototype fascism was quickly and drastically ditched as Mussolini realised the only way he was going to gain the power he craved was with the support of capitalists and big landowners.</p>
<p>Much much later, at the end of the Second World War, in a desperate last-ditch attempt to rally the Italian people behind them in the face of defeat, the hardcore fascist Saló republic rediscovered their socialist side, but it was all hopelessly too late.</p>
<p>Having lived through the fascist&nbsp;<em>ventennio</em>&nbsp;(20 years), the population were not going to fall for any more redwashing attempts or superficial anti-bourgeois posturing. They had seen clearly that fascism in power defended the interests of Capital, rather than the people.</p>
<p>The authors trace this story back to 1910, when the Italian Nationalist Association was founded with “the support of certain business circles, in particular that of heavy industry”, (2) who had a very obvious direct vestes interest in promoting the nationalist call for Italian participation in the approaching war in Europe.</p>
<p>It was Mussolini’s sudden support for Italy going to war (on the Allied side), that led to him being thrown out of the socialist party, the PSI, splitting from others on the left. This left him ideally placed to benefit from capitalist funding, though it is not clear whether his conversion to the war cause was actually motivated by this consideration.</p>
<p>It is known that Mussolini received money from the French government and from pro-war businessmen like Filippo Naldi.</p>
<p>The first fascist general assembly in 1919 took place in a hall in Milan lent by a group of wealthy capitalists.</p>
<blockquote><p>Funds started to roll in from business, banks and big landowners</p></blockquote>
<p>Fascism benefited greatly from the ruling classes’ fear of a Bolshevik-style revolution in Italy, with post-war waves of strikes and a rural movement which reclaimed land from rich property owners.</p>
<p>Explain the authors: “The fear born in the world of the country landowners as a result of the land occupation movement greatly outlived the phenomenon itself and helped pushed them into the arms of fascism, through fear of a challenge to property rights”. (3)</p>
<p>Business organisations such as&nbsp;<em>Confagricoltura</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Confindustria</em>&nbsp;were set up to defend capitalism. Fascism was happy to win favour by providing them with foot soldiers, squadristi, who physically attacked trade unionists and leftists in a wave of “preventative counter-revolution”. (4)</p>
<p>This, say Milza and Berstein, represented fascism’s big break and funds started to roll in from business, banks and big landowners.</p>
<p>Moreover, the fascists started receiving the support of local authorities, the army and the police in their fight against leftist ‘subversion’. They were the system’s emergency weapon against the threat of revolution.</p>
<p>“Prefects, magistrates and officers of the Carabinieri, let the fascists carry on and assure them of impunity. The moment that the State started to crumble, the bourgeoisie, so frightened by the popular uprising of 1919-20, lent their support to fascism’s reactionary violence”. (5)</p>
<figure><img src="https://network23.org/paulcudenec/files/2020/07/squadristi.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><em>Fascist squadristi</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In November 1920, for instance, violent fascist squads descended on Bologna, where the radical left had gained control of the local council. There were nine deaths and more than 100 injuries.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, in the next couple of years, they smashed up trade union and co-operative HQs and attacked working-class districts, wielding clubs and revolvers to force strikers back to work.</p>
<p>By now the fascists had stopped pretending to be left-wing and were openly singing the praises of capitalism and economic liberalism. (6)</p>
<blockquote><p>Fascist economic policies were all in the interests of the ruling class.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Mussolini himself set before the future party a manfesto which no longer owed anything to the leftist tendencies of 1919. In the economic realm it was absolute liberalism, with the State indulging in no intervention or nationalisation, or any fiscal measures deemed ‘populist’. On the political and social side, a strong State was to be created, capable of imposing the ban on strikes in the public sector”. (7)</p>
<p>This was authoritarian capitalism, meant to please “the big money interests from whom Mussolini was now seeking political and financial backing”. (8)</p>
<p>As the future dictator said himself: “We are liberal economically, but we will never be so politically”. (9) This was a question of sacrificing political liberalism in the interests of economic liberalism, aka capitalism. (10) (<em>For more on the little-appreciated similarities between fascism and liberalism, see&nbsp;<a href="https://orgrad.wordpress.com/articles/liberalism-the-two-faced-tyranny-of-wealth/">this article</a>&nbsp;on the orgrad website</em>)</p>

<p>Once the fascists were in power, the clamp-down on opposition was ruthless. Strikes were banned and workers found themselves defenceless against their bosses.</p>
<p>Fascist economic policies were all in the interests of the ruling class. When finance minister Alberto De Stefani reformed the tax system in 1923 this “was above all to the profit of the rich”. (11)</p>
<p>He offered tax breaks for foreign investors, did away with the “red tape” of bodies controlling food prices and rents, ended state funding for co-operatives and halted land reforms which threatened the interests of rich landowners.</p>
<p>After 1925, in the face of economic crisis, the pure economic liberalism of the Manchester School went out of the window, in favour of state intervention.</p>
<p>But this was intervention in the interests of business and Capital, not in the interests of the Italian people whom fascism mendaciously claimed to represent!</p>
<p>‘Development’ was at the forefront of fascist plans, as is the case with all industrial capitalists. More land was cultivated and an infrastructure of roads, new towns and industrial estates was built.</p>
<div>
<figure><img src="https://network23.org/paulcudenec/files/2020/07/Turin-Milan-autostrada.jpg" alt=""></figure>
</div>
<p>“A vast programme of public works was undertaken, carried out by private firms, who were offered lucrative contracts by the State. Electrification of the rail system began, with the construction of tunnels on the Rome-Naples and Bologna-Florence lines. A massive roadbuilding programme was entrusted to ANAS (Azienda Nazionale Autonoma delle Strade), created in 1928, which oversaw the showcase construction of big toll motorways, the first in Europe”. (12)</p>
<p>This was nothing other than a bailing-out of the capitalist economy by the pro-business fascist state, for which the cost would ultimately have to be borne by the public.</p>
<p>Ring any bells in 2020?</p>
<p>Banks were also treated to fascist largesse, notably BCI, saved by the Italian state with a massive influx of money.</p>
<p>Note the authors: “There was neither socialisation nor nationalisation. The State became capitalist; it guaranteed the property of most of the shareholders and their future dividends. The only socialisation was that of the losses, assumed by the public purse”. (13)</p>
<div>
<figure><img src="https://network23.org/paulcudenec/files/2020/07/Istituto-Mobiliare-Italiano.jpg" alt=""></figure>
</div>
<p>In 1931, Mussolini even set up a body,&nbsp;<em>L’Istituto mobiliare italiano</em>, with the role of helping businesses in financial trouble, declaring that this was “a means of energetically driving the Italian economy towards its corporative phase, which is to say a system which fundamentally respects private property and initiative, but ties them tightly to the State, which alone can protect, control and nourish them”. (14)</p>
<p>But the emphasis was very much on the big businesses and financiers allied with the fascist regime. Economic crisis saw numerous small and medium-sized firms go to the wall or gobbled up by big companies, as the fascist state aided this concentration of wealth into ever-fewer hands. (15)</p>
<p>“As for the working classes,” add Milza and Berstein, “they paid the price for this alliance, with unemployment, reduced wages and higher cost of living”. (16)</p>
<p>Fascist corporatism, with its officially-approved phoney trade unions, was supposed to bring together workers and bosses in the interests of the nation, but did nothing of the sort: “It allowed big industry and financial groups to use the State’s arbitration and power of coercion to reinforce their positions and impose their law on their employees”. (17)</p>
<p>“Far from being destroyed by fascism as the first proto-fascist manifesto suggested, Italian capitalism found in it a defender which managed to save it from revolution or collapse and went on to reinforce its structures and its means of action”. (18)</p>
<p>It was not for nothing that the bankers of J.P. Morgan boosted the fascist regime with a $100m loan between 1925 and 1927 (19) or that Winston Churchill praised, during a 1927 visit, Mussolini’s success in defending Italy from what he termed international subversion. He meant the radical left. (20)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>For a long time, business software was clunky. Consumer software continued to radically innovate on user experience, staying ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>Palm to iPhone. Styluses to capacitive touch. Taxis to Ubers. Torrents to Netflix. MP3s to Spotify, etc. We’ve lived through this story of how innovation in consumer software radically improved our lives in the last decade.</p>
<p>At one point, business software had no choice but to stop being clunky and terrible to use, because nobody wanted to walk into work to use shitty software. And as teams got more power to pick the software they wanted, business software had no choice but to be simple enough for anyone to try and buy.</p>
<p>If a business application wasn’t easy to use, people just abandoned it and start trialing something else.&nbsp;Apps that had the best user experience started winning more often at work than the ones that didn’t.</p>
<p>Everyone called this trend ‘consumerization of business software/IT’. Dropbox, Google Drive, Docs and Sheets, etc led this era. But despite all efforts by business apps to keep things simple, consumer software continued to set the gold standard in user experience. Business software just followed the direction already set by consumer software products.</p>
<p>However, I think the scene is changing.</p>

<p>Look at Slack. Zoom. Typeform. They’ve gone above and beyond what we’d have expected of business software some years ago. They’re trendsetters in providing delightful user experiences, and they come out far ahead of similar consumer products in this space.</p>
<p>Can you think of another mainstream video calling software that’s as good as Zoom, for consumers? I can’t. About four weeks ago, my friends and I wanted to talk over WhatsApp but the app capped video call participants at 4. The quality of WhatsApp calls isn’t that great either (remember the “Reconnecting…” flashes?).</p>
<p><span> Zoom was top of mind for me because we use it at work every day. We switched to Zoom and everything worked just fine – there were no hiccups during the call, no onboarding problems, nothing at all. Seven people discovered Zoom that day, and all of them loved their first call.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I know several other folks who are defaulting to Zoom to stay in touch with their friends during this work-from-home season, despite WhatsApp, etc. being a tap away on their phones. That is saying <strong><em>a lot</em></strong> about how ahead of the pack Zoom is when it comes to group video/audio calling. Far ahead of consumer software in this space.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I’m going to unpack what’s happening here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zoom, <strong>a product that we use at work, nailed the calling experience.</strong> That’s a stark contrast from how sucky business software used to be, a decade ago.</li>
<li>Zoom enjoys <strong>fantastic brand recall</strong> – people spend hours on Zoom meetings every week (if not every day) so it’s on top of our minds when we’re thinking about calling our friends or family (ahead of consumer products that live in our phones.)</li>
<li>WhatsApp, <strong>a consumer product, didn’t impress us</strong> with the one job it was supposed to do (arbitrary limits be damned). Wasn’t consumer software supposed to be the gold standard in terms of user experience?</li>
<li>Seven of us <strong>switched to Zoom instantly</strong> and many of us went back to work to convince our closest teams to start using Zoom (network effects!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Business software like Zoom, etc. are so good that they’re winning against consumer software! If you said that to the person who had to deal with on-premise software and implementations ten or fifteen years ago, they’d certainly not believe it.</p>
<p>We’ve seen a lot of products go from consumer to enterprise – Skype, Facebook, WhatsApp, etc. launched versions for work after they succeeded in the consumer space. But with us relying on work apps day in and day out and realizing that they’re so delightfully built, we are naturally taking them outside of our work lives and introducing them to our friends and family.</p>
<p>This is a massive opportunity that I think organizations are slowly realizing they need to chase – Microsoft, for instance, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/03/30/introducing-new-microsoft-365-personal-family-subscriptions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just launched</a> personal and family subscriptions for Office 365. Lots of people <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/07/families-slack-asana/593584/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">already use</a> Asana (and even Slack!) to organize their personal lives.</p>
<p>Even if revenue from consumers doesn’t significantly add to the bottom line for companies like Zoom etc., getting regular users to vouch about your product is definitely going to help take the brand mainstream (think about how well Skype is recognized even today, only because it was available for consumers for so long!).</p>
<p>That’s only going to lead to a cycle of more people discovering these products back at work – helping improve adoption for the business version.</p>
<p>And that’s something nobody will refuse wanting!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <div id="post-body"><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h3 id="whatisahashmapandwhydoweneedit">What is a Hashmap and why do we need it?</h3>
<p>The Java hashmap is a data structure that allows efficient access and storage of elements in them. The elements are stored in a <code>&lt;key, value&gt;</code> format. It implements the <code>Map</code> interface and it is important to note that the <code>key</code> must be unique. This essentially means that if you insert <code>&lt;key = 5, value = 100&gt;</code> first and then insert <code>&lt;key = 5, value = 101&gt;</code> into the same hashmap, only the latter remains. This is illustrated in the code below. It allows us to access its elements in <code>O(1)</code> and should be used when the order of accessing elements is not important.</p>
<pre><code>package com.company;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; hashMap = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
        hashMap.put(1, 1001);
        hashMap.put(2, 1002);
        hashMap.put(3, 1003);
        hashMap.put(4, 1005);
        hashMap.put(5, 100);
		  // This gives output as 100
        System.out.println(hashMap.get(5));
		  hashMap.put(5, 101);
		  // This gives output as 101 because the previous entry is removed
        System.out.println(hashMap.get(5));
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="howareelementsinsertedintothehashmap">How are elements inserted into the HashMap?</h3>
<p>Let us understand a few keywords first to better understand the HashMap.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key</strong><br>
A key is an element in a hashmap that helps us uniquely identify entries in it. In the example above, <code>{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}</code> are the keys.</li>
<li><strong>Hash</strong><br>
As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function">Wikipedia</a> describes it, a <strong>hash function</strong> is a function that can be used to map keys of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. The values returned by a hash function are called <em>hash values</em>, <em>hash codes</em>, <em>digests</em>, or simply <em>hashes</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Values</strong><br>
Values are the elements that correspond to a key. In the example above, <code>{1001, 1002, 1003, 1005, 100, 101}</code> are the values.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we are done with these terms, let us dive into how inserting elements into a hashmap works. Hashmap entries are done inside a table which is nothing but an array of <code>Nodes</code>. A <code>Node</code> is made up of <code>Hash</code>, <code>Key</code>, <code>Value</code> and some other components. When an element has to be inserted into the Hashmap, the key’s <code>hash</code> is calculated which gives us the index of the table where the element has to be inserted.</p>
<p>By now you might have some questions in your mind! What if two keys have the same <code>hash</code> or in other words what if there is a collision in the map? What is the size of the table?</p>
<p>Let us first address the <strong>issue of collision</strong>! Whenever there is a collision due to hash values, the values are <strong>inserted in a linked list</strong>. However, when there are more than 8 elements in the linked list for a particular hash value, the list is <strong>refactored</strong> to a self balanced binary search tree or as we better know them, the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree">Red-Black trees</a></em>. This is done to avoid the linear search time in case of a lengthy linked list.</p>
<p>Now comes the size of the table. This part is pretty interesting! So why waste our time? Let us dive in right away!</p>
<p>The initial size of the table is 16 and the load factor is 0.75. The load factor is a parameter that will help us determine when we should increase the size of the table and recalculate the hash values. This happens when we reach the threshold value, which can be calculated by the equation,<br>
<code>Threshold = load factor * capacity</code></p>
<p>This threshold is set at 12 <code>(16 * 0.75)</code> initially. You can always change the load factor according to your needs but that won’t be necessary in most of the cases. The size of the table is doubled and the hashes are recalculate to populate the new table once the threshold capacity is reached.</p>
<h3 id="whywasthetablesizedoubledthough">Why was the table size doubled though?</h3>
<p>This question struck me when I was exploring the Hashmap and there is a pretty interesting reason for this decision. The hash function is <code>f(x) = key % table_capacity</code> and every time the table is resized, this tedious calculation must be done for each and every node. Now, the makers of the hashmap came up with a pretty neat bitwise hack; when we increase the <code>capacity</code> by a factor of 2, the hash value either remains the same or gets increased by the old value of <code>table_capacity</code> which can be done easily with bit manipulation rather than the costly operation of calculating the hash via the modulo operation. This stuff might seem a bit abstract at first but this code will clear your confusion.</p>
<pre><code>package com.company;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
		  // calculating hash for keys from 1 to 64
        for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 64; i++) {
			   // hash with table size 16 and 32 (16 * 2 = 32)
            System.out.println(i + " " + i % 16 + " " + i % 32);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Get and remove operations are quite trivial and you must have already understood them after reading this article! I am pretty sure you gained a good insight into the working of a hashmap :D</p>
<p>Now go, <em>get</em> them! :D</p>

<div>
<p>If you were born mid-90’s or earlier, you probably remember being bored. We used to talk to ourselves, play “make believe”, taking walks, listening to records, etc. We learned to entertain ourselves, imagine, and create.</p>
<p>Today, my children and children born into the age of the virtual world have not experienced boredom, at least not in the same way. In a sense, those who grew up in the 24-hour news cycle, with social media have never and will never experience being alone. They’ve rarely experience the <a href="https://austingwalters.com/the-last-free-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sense of freedom</a> that comes from thinking to oneself.</p>
<p>A personal concern, is that children’s personalities appear to develop in the absence of technology. They play with toys and make their world come to life. My two year old believes, with all his heart, that his toys are sentient. That our Roomba has feelings and needs to be “fed”. He’s learning reason, learning to manipulate the world, talking to us, and so much more.</p>
<h2>Tools of Gods</h2>
<p>Throughout all human history technology has been an extension of ourselves. Part of childhood is learning to use and create tools. However, today we don’t need to build tools. With phones, we have near infinite information, entertainment, and communication at our finger tips, we can connect to anyone or anything – instantly. Capture audio, video and picture with a tap. Search our memories with a voice command. Calculate any/all the math equations we can think of, etc. Our technology makes us ever more godlike.</p>
<p>To provide this godlike device to a child is irresponsible. Arguably, even in hands of adults, our devices do more harm than good.</p>
<p>The difference between adults and children, is that children need to <em>learn-to-learn</em>. It’s the most important thing a child can learn. How well a child <em>learns-to-learn </em>will shape their entire life, their potential is defined by how well they can learn. There are several important lessons in learning how to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning to self-reflect</li>
<li>Nurturing curiosity</li>
<li>Defining ones goals</li>
<li>Indexing knowledge</li>
<li>Finding motivation</li>
</ul>
<p>There is probably more than goes into learning-to-learn, but that’s a good list for now.</p>
<p>For me, a defining moment was learning to sculpt my character in an effort to find motivation. I spent quite a bit of time reflecting on who I was and who I wanted to be. I defined myself and found the motivation I needed, with constant self-reflection to change. Without my time riding bikes, running, playing in the woods, soccer, walking alone, I wouldn’t be who I am today.</p>
<h2>Empathy is Derived from Self</h2>
<p>Having a godlike tool able solve most problems is a double edge sward. A phone is addictive by design. Mobile phones track us and companies learn everything about us, with that information being weaponized against us to maximize “screen time”. Is social media useful? Quite frankly, I’d argue no, social media has a net negative effect. Importantly, social media and games on your mobile device keep you constantly stimulated and often push others agenda(s)[<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>].</p>
<p>I question if most of the newer generations, born into their environment, have really learned to live in the physical world. Has the newer generation(s) learned to live with and identify themselves? Is there self-reflection and growth? Without an internal dialog, a lot of things break down: personality, autonomy, comfort with being alone, understanding alternative viewpoints… empathy.</p>
<p>Perhaps, [even more concerning] without an internal identity / dialog one doesn’t develop a “classic” ego. If a self-image is typically defined by an internal image and that internal image doesn’t develop, what guides us? Likes? Karma?</p>
<p>This would explain the rise in more extreme moral stances. Such as building a hierarchy based on gender, race, etc. Lack of empathy for others, at the same time garnering more karma, for karma is the value system people can hold themselves to. We no longer need to contemplate who we want to be, because we can receive instant feedback on our actions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I suspect this optimizes for short-term gain, but long-term loss to society.</p>
<p>We’ve seen the start of the incredibly destructive cycle, where contemplating or a nuanced opinion is simply not acceptable, because others can’t relate.</p>
<center><iframe data-lazy-type="iframe" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2cMYfxOFBBM?start=314" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>
<h2>Who are you?</h2>
<blockquote><p>I am free, no matter what rules surround me. If I find them tolerable, I tolerate them; if I find them too obnoxious, I break them. I am free because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything I do.</p>
<p>– Robert A. Heinlein</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m a firm believer that life is and should be tough. Growth comes from adaptation, confidence is derived from overcoming challenges. When life is tough, you have to create goals and blaze a trail to somewhere better. This is what it means to be “free”, free to have self-determination, which few embrace.</p>
<p>I wasn’t born to my current “class”. I would say, I was born “big-mac” rich, where you could buy a “big-mac” once a month without worrying about budget. My parents provided shelter, food and clothes, but I started mowing lawns at 12 and working a job by 14 to buy anything I needed beyond food and shelter. Yet today, (14 years &amp; a couple kids later), I’d call myself “iPhone” rich, I can buy something of equivalent cost monthly without worrying about it.</p>
<p>This doesn’t happen in a vacuum.</p>
<p>My wife and I regularly create two and five year plans. These goals provide motivation. We can ask ourselves,</p>
<blockquote><p>Does this activity help hit our five year objective?</p></blockquote>
<p>If the answer is no, then it’s probably not worth doing it. We work hard, we reflect regularly and we try to improve; always iterating towards something better.</p>
<p>To have self-determination, people need to think for themselves. They need to contemplate what they want from life. They need to talk to themselves. Self-determination requires goals, it also requires grappling (or ignoring) others and importantly saying “no” and “yes” based on <em>objectives</em> not <em>desires</em>. In the end, this will make people happier.</p>
<p>It all starts with talking to ones-self, spending time alone and deciding what <em>you</em> want.</p>
<h2>A Bleak Outlook</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the god-like tools we’ve all grown accustom to (especially, when given to kids), seem to disrupt the ability to talk to one-self. In a sense, our phones, media, and general virtual world has taken all our time; this leaves us without time for self-reflection, self-thought, self-actualization. In this stunted world, the AI which manipulates our news replaces the ego we once had.</p>
<p>Complex discussions, real empathy, motivation — are going to be something most of us lose. I’m not sure if society is ready for what we created. It’s a mob of people who’ve never experienced real hardship, who’ve learned a social system designed by virtue signaling (aka trying to game the “karma” systems) and not really learning to live in the real world. Then again, these people will be shaping the real world, for better or worse.</p>

<p>My notes from <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs520/">CS520 - Knowledge Graph Seminar</a></p>
<h2 id="session-1---what-is-knowledge-graph">Session 1 - What is Knowledge Graph?</h2>
<p><em>Speakers: Denny Vrandečić, Jans Aasman, Mikhail Galkin</em></p>
<p><strong>Denny</strong></p>
<p>Denny speaks about knowledge graphs (KGs) are used for web search, question answer systems, data integration systems.</p>
<p>Specific use case of Wiki Data</p>
<ul>
<li>KG built on 80M nodes, 1B edges</li>
<li>Uses RDF open format (w3c)</li>
<li><a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a> annotation</li>
<li>SPARQL for querying</li>
</ul>
<p>Following the open format has great advantages. One example stated was how wikipedia can leverage other services which expose data. Wikipedia can run SPARQL to query OpenStreet Maps data - pick lat, long from OSM for ATMs in Munich for a specific bank network.</p>
<p><strong>Jans</strong></p>
<p>Discussion around modern KGs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Semantic graph DB</li>
<li>Ontologies &amp; Taxonomies</li>
<li>Rule based processing</li>
<li>ML &amp; NLP based processing</li>
</ul>
<p>AllegroGraph's KG implementation:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Document / NLP - Chomsky KG</p>
<p>The Noam Chomsky Knowledge Graph will link to over 1,000 articles &amp; over 100 books that Chomsky has authored about linguistics, mass media, politics &amp; war.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event Based for Motefiore Health Care</p>
<p>Montefiore’s Patient-centered Analytical Learning Machine (PALM), a machine learning platform built from the ground up to predict &amp; prevent life-threatening medical conditions &amp; minimize wait times.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Mikhail</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Think of KG as world models in terms of entities &amp; relations</li>
<li>Encoding can be based on different representations</li>
</ul>
<p>Representations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Symbolic - Logic, DB</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Store as triples</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">Subject-Predicate-Object

Rajakumara starring Puneet

Puneet born Chennai
</code></pre></div></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vector - NLP, Computer Vision</p>
<ul>
<li>Embeddings - Leverage high dimensional space &amp; a function to group similar things nearby</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>KGs can be viewed from different Point of Views:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Logic programming, RDF way</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RDMS - entities are cells, relations are columns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Computer Vision - CNN + RPN ⇒ graph inference</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NLP</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Knowledge Graph ⇒ Named Entity Recognition</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information Retrieval ⇒ Relation Linking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unstructured Sources ⇒ Question Answer System</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Language Models</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</ol>
<p>All these are fused together to build the Siri KG. Techniques used - Info Box extraction from wikipedia, Entity Resolution.</p>
<p>Challenges</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fields do not match</p>
<p>Date of Birth, DoB, Birth Date - all of them mean the same</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Built:</p>

<![CDATA[Run LLVM Assembly in the Browser]]>

August 8, 2020 | http://kripken.github.io/llvm.js/demo.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://kripken.github.io/llvm.js/demo.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p>
  This is a demo of compiling and running <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> assembly in JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
  Press the button to see it compile and run a tiny "hello world" program. You can also try modifying the LLVM assembly and pressing the button again - note though that <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html">LLVM assembly</a> is typed, so if you add characters to the string for example, you will need to adjust its length, both where it is defined and where it is used (otherwise you will get errors, which will show up in the output area).
</p>



<hr>

<br>

<br>





<hr>
<p>
  This demo works by using parts of the LLVM toolchain (llvm-dis and llvm-as), compiled by <a href="http://emscripten.org/">emscripten</a> from C++ to JavaScript, to check the assembly for errors and pretty-print it. Then the emscripten compiler (originally written in JavaScript, but ported from the normal batch/shell mode to the browser environment) is run on the output, and the code executed directly.
</p>
<p>
  This demo was done as a fun hacking project over a holiday vacation, so there are some caveats: The generated code is not optimized at all, so benchmarking is pointless; if you want to benchmark, run emscripten normally with <code>-O2</code>. Compilation speed has also not been optimized at all. Also, this demo has hardly been tested and glues together several codebases in ways they were not originally intended, there might be things that do not work.

It is also one of the poorest, with an annual&nbsp;per capita income of $870 US (<a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNP.PCAP.PP.CD">at purchasing power parity</a>).</p>   <p>"When you are in Malawi and someone asks you, 'Where do you go to church?' and you say you don't pray, it's an awkward thing, like you're a weird person," says Teresa Chirwa, a journalist from Malawi who is spending an academic year at the University of Toronto.</p>   <p>The majority of Malawians belong to one of several Christian denominations (including Roman Catholic, Anglican, Baptist, Presbyterian and the African Independent Churches),&nbsp;while another 15 to 20 per cent are Muslim. Much of the population also practices traditional African religions.</p>   <p>In recent years, new Pentecostal churches have begun to take hold, and the younger generation has started making its own choices about which churches to attend&nbsp;— rather than following&nbsp; their parents' beliefs, said Chirwa.</p>   <p>"Kids are revolting," she said. "They are leaving the traditional churches and going to the new churches that are emerging."</p>   <p>The country now also has its&nbsp;first atheist organization, although so far, except for its leader, the names of all its members remain secret.</p>   <p>"They're being ridiculed by the society," said Chirwa. "They're being discriminated against for those beliefs."</p>  </div>  <p>Gregory Paul doesn't think it can. After constructing a "Successful Societies Scale" that compared 25 socioeconomic indicators against statistics on religious belief and practice in 17 developed nations, the Baltimore-based paleontologist concluded in a&nbsp;2009 study&nbsp;that "religion is most able to thrive in seriously dysfunctional societies."</p>  <p>Paul, who is a freelance researcher not affiliated with any institution, compiled data on everything from homicide rates and income inequality&nbsp;to infant mortality and teenage pregnancies and found that the societies that scored&nbsp;the best&nbsp;on socioeconomic indicators were also the most secular.</p>  <p>"The correlation between religiosity and successful societies is somewhere around 0.7. Zero&nbsp;is no correlation and&nbsp;one is a perfect correlation, so it's a really good correlation, and it's not just an accident," he told CBC News.</p>  <p>"There's no situation where you have a really highly religious nation that's highly successful socially."</p>  <p>Paul's intention in creating the scale was to&nbsp;challenge the idea that religion is universal and innate to the human condition, and to show that societies that don't believe in God are not doomed, as some religious conservatives would have people believe.</p>  <p>"Religion is highly variable, and therefore we need to ask why is it sometimes popular and why it isn't,"&nbsp;Paul said. "One thing we do know is that it's only popular in societies that&nbsp;… have enough rate of dysfunction that people are anxious about their daily lives, so they're looking to the gods for help in their daily lives.</p>  <p>"It's not fear of death that drives people to be religious, and it's not a God gene or a God module in the brain or some sort of connection with the gods; it's basically a psychological coping mechanism."</p>  <h3>Religion on decline in West</h3>  <p>Belief in God and participation in religious services have been on the decline in recent decades in most First World nations but have remained high in developing countries. Between 1947 and 2001, belief in God declined by 33.6 per cent in Sweden, 19.9 per cent in Australia and 7.2 per cent in Canada, according to an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/pnorris/Articles/Articles%20published%20in%20journals_files/ppr2006%20norris.pdf">analysis</a>&nbsp;of social science surveys done by Harvard sociologist Pippa Norris and University of Michigan political scientist Ronald Inglehart.</p>  <p>Data for&nbsp;developing countries does not go back as far, but recent&nbsp;opinion polls&nbsp;suggest religiosity has remained high. The 10 most religious countries on the&nbsp;2012 WIN-Gallup International Religiosity and Atheism Index&nbsp;all had 85 per cent or more of respondents identifying as "a religious person," and all were countries with a per capita income&nbsp;of less than &nbsp;$14,100 US.</p>    <p>When Norris and Inglehart&nbsp;pooled 20 years of results from the World Values Survey, which regularly polls dozens of countries on social science questions, they found that in agrarian societies, 44 per cent of people said they attended church at least once a week compared to 25 per cent in industrial and 20 per cent in postindustrial societies. They also found that nations&nbsp;that scored&nbsp;low on the&nbsp;<a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/">Human Development Index</a>, which measures health, education and living standards,&nbsp;tended to be those&nbsp;with the highest rates of participation in religious services and prayer.</p>  <div>   <h2>Religion, faith and belief</h2>   <p>This story launches a CBC News series looking at religion, faith and belief in our world.</p>  </div>  <p>More recent polls have found similar divisions between rich and poor nations. The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx">2009 Gallup Inc. religion survey</a>, which sampled about 1,000 people in each of 114 countries, found that among nations with a per capita income of less than $2,000, 95 per cent of respondents, in the median, answered "Yes" to the question: "Is religion an important part of your daily life?"</p>  <p>In countries with per capita income of more than $25,000, 47 per cent of respondents answered "Yes." In Canada, 42 per cent of respondents said religion was important.</p>  <p>Bangladesh, Niger, Malawi and Yemen had some of the strongest&nbsp;positive responses (99 per cent) while Sweden (17 per cent), Denmark (19 per cent), Japan (24 per cent) and Estonia (16 per cent)&nbsp;— where religion was suppressed under the former Soviet regime&nbsp;— had some of the weakest.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>People walk past the Great Mosque in the ancient desert city of Agadez, Niger. Ninety-nine per cent of respondents to a Gallup Inc. survey in Niger said religion was an important part of daily life.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Tientan Ling/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>"I was a little surprised&nbsp;… how strongly it correlated with income, but it definitely corresponds to other research that has shown that societies tend to grow more secular as they modernize and as living standards improve," said Steve Crabtree, a research analyst with Gallup Inc. (a separate entity from WIN-Gallup International).</p>  <p>(The Gallup and the WIN-Gallup International polls have a margin of error of around +/- 3 to 5 per cent.)</p>  <h3>Most vulnerable are often most religious</h3>  <p>Sociologists have argued that the social benefits of religion take on greater importance, the fewer resources and the less&nbsp;control people have over their own lives.</p>    <p>"Religion becomes less central as people's lives become less vulnerable to the constant threat of death, disease and misfortune," Norris and Inglehart write in their 2004 book, <em>Sacred and Secular: Religion and Politics Worldwide</em>.</p>  <div>   <h2>Income gap</h2>   <p>The <a href="http://www.wingia.com/web/files/news/14/file/14.pdf">2012 WIN-Gallup International Global Index of Religiosity and Atheism</a>&nbsp;found that in the countries surveyed, respondents in the lowest income bracket were on average 17 per cent more religious than those in the highest.</p>   <p>In Canada, 44 per of those who earn between $20,000 and $29,999 say they practice their religious or spiritual beliefs at least once a week, compared to 32 per cent in the $80,000-$99,999 income bracket, according to the Statistics Canada General Social Survey in 2011.</p>   <p>A&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/114211/alabamians-iranians-common.aspx">Gallup Inc. poll</a>&nbsp;in the U.S. found that the poorest states&nbsp;in the country, such as Mississippi and Alabama, were the most religious and&nbsp;compared with&nbsp;countries like Iran, Lebanon and Zimbabwe in terms of the importance given to religion. Wealthier states like Vermont and Maine were more comparable to Switzerland and Canada, the poll found.</p>  </div>  <p>"As lives gradually become more comfortable and secure, people in more affluent societies usually grow increasingly indifferent to religious values, more skeptical of supernatural beliefs and less willing to become actively engaged in religious institutions."</p>  <p>In poor countries, religious institutions often provide essential services such as education and health care, and the social networks that faith communities provide can be crucial in times of crisis.</p>    <p>"In the richer countries, people are less likely to face existential threats … so they have more opportunity for fulfillment outside of religion," Crabtree said.</p>  <p>But it's more than just an accumulation of wealth that makes a country more secular, sociologists say.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"The United States is one of the wealthier societies, and yet, it's still quite religious," said Phil Zuckerman, a sociology professor at Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif., who has studied secularization in Scandinavian countries and wrote a book about it called <em>Society Without God</em>.</p>  <p>"I think it's when you have what we might call 'existential security'&nbsp;— so, wealth and prosperity are part of that, but by that we [also] mean the bulk of people in society have access to housing, health care, jobs. They live in a relatively stable, democratic society without much in the way of existential threats to their lives or their culture."</p>  <p>It's no accident, say some sociologists, that some of the world's least religious people live in nations …</p></span></p></div></div>

    <h2 id="title">2020-08-08: Where do argc and argv come from?</h2>
<p>Continuing on from <a href="https://briancallahan.net/blog/20200803.html">our tiny snake game</a>, let's explore more into how binaries work on Unix. Let's figure out how our programs come to obtain their argc and argv parameters.</p>
<p>You can grab the finished code for this write-up <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo">here on GitHub</a>.
</p><h4>The past: a no option world</h4>
<p>One thing we exploited with our snake game was the fact that it took no options. That was an easy way to keep the binary size down. If the user did happen to write things on the command line after the command invocation, our game would simply ignore it. Such behavior can be explained in the code that invokes the main function.</p>
<pre>main(void)
</pre>
<p>Our main function takes no arguments. But that's not the norm for Unix programs. It is more common that we see our main function take two parameters.</p>
<pre>main(int argc, char *argv[])
</pre>
<p>An integer telling us the number of arguments and a double pointer which gives us those arguments. But how does our program get those arguments? If we type them out on the command line, what is the mechanism that passes things to our program? Let's write a program that takes command line options. It doesn't have to do anything special. Just reading them in and printing them out would work for us. This is effectively the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/echo.1">echo(1)</a> utility we will recreate, though we will leave out the <code>-n</code> flag.</p>
<h4>Setting up our environment</h4>
<p>Let's copy over our <a href="https://github.com/ibara/snakeqr/blob/master/crt.s">crt.s file</a> from SnakeQR. Let's also split it up into three files: the .note.openbsd.ident section will remain in <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo/blob/master/crt.s">crt.s</a>, _start will go into a new <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo/blob/master/_start.s">_start.s</a> file and _syscall will go into a new <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo/blob/master/_syscall.s">_syscall.s</a> file. Let's write a simple <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo/blob/master/Makefile">Makefile</a> too while we're here. We will put our C code into an <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo/blob/master/echo.c">echo.c</a> file.</p>
<p>We are also going to improve our _start function. As we remember from SnakeQR, the equivalent C for our _start function is</p>
<pre>void
_start(void)
{

	main();

	_exit(0);
}
</pre>
<p>But we Unix people know that main is an int and can return different values. And we can use those values in other places (like shell scripts). Our current _start function doesn't cut it. We need something more like</p>
<pre>void
_start(void)
{
	int argc;
	char **argv;

	_exit(main(argc, argv));
}
</pre>
<p>In assembly, that looks something like</p>
<pre>	.text
	.p2align 2
	.globl	_start
_start:
	callq	main
	movl	%eax, %edi
	movl	$1, %eax
	syscall
	.size	_start,.-_start
</pre>
<p>Really similar to our previous version of _start but this time instead of clearing %edi we instead take the value of %eax after main exits and put it in %edi, which is the parameter for _exit. Why %eax? Because the return value of functions are put in %eax. We have to remember to move the return value to %edi right away because we need %eax again to provide the syscall number as we learned from SnakeQR. You'll notice that we don't handle argc or argv mostly because we don't know yet how to handle them. And maybe we don't have to. With this, we can write a very simple main function that returns the value of argc.</p>
<h4>Is it really that easy?</h4>
<p>Maybe it really is this easy; let's write that simple main function.</p>
<pre>int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{

	return argc;
}
</pre>
<p>If we run <code>echo one two three</code> we should get a return value of 4. Remember that the program name ends up counting in argc and lives in argv[0]. Run it, issue echo $? after and... 0. So no, it wasn't that easy. It was worth a shot.</p>
<p>But we know that argc and argv have to come from <i>somewhere</i> and if it's somewhere, chances are good it will show up in gdb. I'll be using <a href="https://github.com/openbsd/ports/tree/master/devel/gdb">egdb (aka gdb from ports)</a> since that's newer than the gdb in base. We can install it with a simple <code>doas pkg_add gdb</code>.
</p><h4>Running our program in gdb</h4>
<p>If you've never used gdb before, there are a lot of things you can do with it. But let's keep things simple. We can load our program into gdb like so</p>
<pre>$ egdb --args ./echo
</pre>
<p>This will allow us to put any number of command line options, though we're not using any right now. Our argc should be 1 so let's see if we can find a 1 somewhere in gdb.</p>
<p>The easiest thing to do in gdb is run the program. At the (gdb) prompt, type <code>r</code> and press Enter.</p>
<pre>(gdb) r
Starting program: /home/brian/echo/echo
/home/brian/echo/echo
[Inferior 1 (process 38559) exited normally]
</pre>
<p>That wasn't very interesting. It ran and exited without telling us anything.</p>
<h4>Breaking our program</h4>
<p>In order to do anything meaningful we should insert breakpoints. This tells gdb to pause execution at that memory location. All our functions can be used as locations to break. We can also break at offsets from our functions, but we don't need that functionality for today.</p>
<p>We only have two functions so far: _start and main. My hunch tells me that because _start is our entry point, if our hosted environment is giving us argc and argv, it will definitely be findable in _start, whereas we might lose it by the time we get to main. Let's set a breakpoint at _start.</p>
<pre>(gdb) b _start
Breakpoint 1 at 0x201170
</pre>
<p>OK. We're ready to go. Let's run the program now.</p>
<pre>(gdb) r
Starting program: /home/brian/echo/echo

Breakpoint 1, 0x0000000000201170 in _start ()
</pre>
<p>We are effectively at the point where our hosted environment hands off execution to the program. Now we can explore our program.</p>
<h4>Getting information</h4>
We can tell gdb to give us the contents of all our registers with the <code>info reg</code> command.
<pre>(gdb) info reg
rax            0x0      0
rbx            0x0      0
rcx            0x0      0
rdx            0x0      0
rsi            0x0      0
rdi            0x0      0
rbp            0x0      0x0
rsp            0x7f7ffffbe6e0   0x7f7ffffbe6e0
r8             0x0      0
r9             0x0      0
r10            0x0      0
r11            0x0      0
r12            0x0      0
r13            0x0      0
r14            0x0      0
r15            0x0      0
rip            0x201170 0x201170 &lt;_start&gt;
eflags         0x202    [ IF ]
cs             0x2b     43
ss             0x23     35
ds             0x23     35
es             0x23     35
fs             0x23     35
gs             0x23     35
</pre>
<p>We know that argc is going to be 1, so any register that is 0 we can ignore. Not what we're looking for. The %rip register holds our instruction pointer, and gdb helpfully tells us that memory location corresponds to the _start function. The eflags register is our status register, which contains information like the carry bit and the zero bit. We can't use that directly. And cs through gs are segment registers, which we are not going to look at today. That leaves us with %rsp as our candidate. It certainly holds something. It happens to be a location on the stack (%rsp = stack pointer). We can examine it with the <code>x/x $rsp</code> command. This is the x command. For us, we will use it in the form x/&lt;length&gt;&lt;format&gt;, where length is the number of format objects we want (if you leave it out, you want one) and format is our format specifier. An x for the format specifier means hexadecimal but there are others too, like f for floating point, i for instruction, and s for string.</p>
<pre>(gdb) x/x $rsp
0x7f7ffffbe6e0: 0x00000001
</pre>
<p>Hey! That's a 1! Let's quit out of gdb and rerun it as <code>egdb --args ./echo one</code> and see if we get a 2 next time.</p>
<pre>(gdb) x/x $rsp
0x7f7ffffcb900: 0x00000002
</pre>
We do!
<h4>Passing argc from our hosted environment to our program</h4>
<p>I think we've discovered that our hosted environment puts argc and argv on the stack and then jumps to _start so that _start also has access to argc and argv. Let's think back to our calling convention: the first argument goes in %rdi. We should be able to pop the top value off the stack and put it in %rdi and then our main function will return argc. Let's add this to _start.</p>
<pre>	.text
	.p2align 2
	.globl	_start
_start:
	popq	%rdi
	callq	main
	movl	%eax, %edi
	movl	$1, %eax
	syscall
	.size	_start,.-_start
</pre>
<p>All we did was add <code>popq %rdi</code> before the main call. Let's recompile and see what happens.</p>
<pre>/home/brian/echo $ ./echo        
/home/brian/echo $ echo $?       
1
/home/brian/echo $ ./echo one
/home/brian/echo $ echo $?    
2
/home/brian/echo $ ./echo one two
/home/brian/echo $ echo $?        
3
</pre>
<p>I think we can say we are successfully passing argc from our hosted environment to our program.</p>
<h4>Passing argv to our program, part 1</h4>
<p>Now we need to find and pass argv. Maybe it's as simple as the current top of the stack, now that argc has been popped off, is argv. Remember that %rsi is the second parameter according to our calling convention. If it's really that easy all we will need to do is add <code>movq %rsp, %rsi</code> after the <code>popq %rdi</code> we just added.</p>
<pre>	.text
	.p2align 2
	.globl	_start
_start:
	popq	%rdi
	movq	%rsp, %rsi
	callq	main
	movl	%eax, %edi
	movl	$1, %eax
	syscall
	.size	_start,.-_start
</pre>
<p>We should also write a proper echo function in C while we are here. The usual way it goes is skip argv[0], from argv[1] to argv[argc - 1], print the argument and if there is a next argument also print a space. Once we run out of arguments, print a newline. In C, this looks like
</p><pre>int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	int i;

	for (i = 1; i &lt; argc; i++) {
		write(1, argv[i], strlen(argv[i]));
		if (i + 1 != argc)
			write(1, " ", 1);
	}
	write(1, "\n", 1);

	return 0;
}
</pre>
<h4>strlen</h4>
<p>We don't actually know how long each argument will be, so we need some way to calculate that since our write function requires us to pass the number of characters to write as an argument. The <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/strlen.3">strlen(3)</a> function does that for us. But remember since we're building everything ourselves, let's take a moment to think about what strlen does and how we can recreate it.</p>
<p>The strlen function reads in a string and outputs the number of characters in that string. We can set up a second pointer that points to the first character in the string. Since we know strings in C must end with a NUL byte, we can check to see if our second pointer is the NUL byte and if not move to the next character in the string. When we hit the NUL byte, subtracting the original string location from the second string location will give us the length of the string. We can't …</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>There is a number of online “alternative lifestyle” movements that have been gaining steam among millennials. They are appealing in their leanness: do more with less. At first, they seem cute and liberating. Scores of Instagram influencers and bloggers romanticize these lifestyles, and their subreddits are buzzing with zealots. Key examples below:</p> <p><strong>FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early)</strong>: live frugally now to save money as quickly as possible, then buy a place in a low cost-of-living area and live (mostly) off your savings.</p> <p><strong>Van Life</strong>: Buy a van, trick it out with a beautiful bed and a kitchen. Live lightly, travel the world, work remotely.</p> <p><strong>Tiny Houses</strong>: Nobody needs 5,000 square feet. Why not play with constraints, and build a full house with the square feet of a studio?</p> <p><strong>Remote Work</strong>: work your high-paying-job from a low-cost-of-living area, save up money, and save on commuting.</p> <p>While these lifestyles are marketed as all about freedom, they come with major restrictions: they are overwhelmingly for the single and childless. Having children is very expensive, so it’s hard to make that work with FIRE. On the other hand, van life and tiny houses are logistically prohibitive to having children. By going down these routes, their adherents will delay having kids, likely by years. That’s usually a bad trade.</p> <p>Not only do these lifestyles constrain, they also reflect a severe already-existing capital constraint. Broadly, <em>all</em> of these movements are reactions to poverty. Living in a van, tiny house, or remotely all stem from one factor: real estate in your preferred area (perhaps the place you call “home”) is too expensive. You can’t afford to buy or rent a real place there, so you move into an Instagrammable shed, or you move away altogether. These lifestyles are solutions to problems of poverty – but in making those solutions fashionable, they hide the ugly reality underneath.</p> <p>Ultimately, these movements romanticize and hide the true <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials#In_the_United_States">generational poverty of millennials</a>. This is a generation of people who will never retire, who may never even buy real estate of their own. In terms of intergenerational wealth, these people are screwed. And I would like to see that point raised and addressed, instead of making do with solutions of desperation.</p> <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

<h2>ImageMagick Examples - Introductory Notes</h2>

<h3>What is ImageMagick?  A No-Holds-Barred Summary</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</a> is
designed for batch processing of images.  That is, it allow you to combine
image processing operations in a script (shell, DOS, Perl, PHP, etc.) so
the operations can be applied to many images, or as
a sub-system of some other tool, such as a Web application, video
processing tool, panorama generator, etc.  <i>It is not a GUI image
editor</i>. </p><p>

ImageMagick is, first of all, an image-to-image converter. That is what it was
originally designed to do.  That is, it will convert an image in just about
any image format (tell us if it can't) to any other image format.  </p><p>

But it is also a library of <i>image processing algorithms</i>.  These can be
access via the command line and shell/DOS scripts (which these example pages
demonstrate), or via a large number of programming languages, such as C, C++,
Perl, Ruby, PHP, etc.  See: <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/api.php">ImageMagick APIs</a>. </p><p>

Speed was never a major feature of IM, which places more emphasis on the
quality of the images it generates.  That is not to say that it can't
transform images in a reasonable amount of time. It's just not blindingly
fast.  Because of this, IM can be slow to perform certain processing
operations, especially when attempting to compress images into image formats
that have limited capabilities. </p><p>

ImageMagick concerns itself mainly with images in the form of a <i>rectangular
array of pixels</i>, commonly called a "raster."  It will handle "vector"
image formats like Postscript or PDF, but at the cost of converting those
images into a raster when loading them, and generating a vector image wrapper
around the raster when saving it.  As a result, vector images are often
processed badly when using the default settings.  However, specific options
can be used to improve this situation.  See: <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/formats/#vector">A word about vector image formats</a>.  </p>


<h3>About These Examples of ImageMagick Usage</h3><p>

These pages were developed from, and are a continuation of, my <a href="http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/anthony/info/graphics/imagemagick.hints">Collection of ImageMagick Hints and Tips</a> page I first started in 1993,
and placed on the new fangled world-wide-web making its appearance around the
same time.  Information on many aspects of IM, and notes not included in these
pages, are still present in that document.  However, while the present pages
were designed for you to look at, the hints and tips document was only for my
own edification.  So, it may be vague or chaotic in places.  You are welcome
to look at it, learn, and make comments on it.  </p><p>

Other examples were grabbed or developed from answers to users' questions on
he <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/forum_link.cgi?f=1">IM
Forums</a>, or contributed to me as solutions to various problems. </p><p>

I look forward to suggestions and e-mail from other IM users.  Such e-mail
generally results in improvements and expansions to these example pages.
</p>

<h3>Command Line Environments</h3><p>

All examples are written for use on UNIX, and specifically GNU/Linux systems,
using BASH scripting.  As a consequence, some examples use shell 'for-do'
loops. Most examples use a backslash '<code>\</code>' at the end of a line to
continue that command on the next line.  The longer commands are broken into
separate lines to try to further highlight the steps being applied. </p><p>

However, you can still use these examples from <b>PC Windows batch
scripts</b>, with some changes to the handling of certain characters.  With
some slight adaptation, the examples can also be run directly from
'<code>system</code>' calls in <b>PHP scripts</b>.  </p><p>

See <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/windows/">Windows Usage</a> and <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/api/index.html">APIs
and Scripting</a> for more information on using the ImageMagick commands in
these alternative environments. Contributions and test examples are welcome.
</p>


<h3>PerlMagick, and Other APIs</h3><p>

It should also be possible to adapt any of these examples to use the IM API
from languages such as Perl, C, C++, Ruby, PHP, and so on.  I recommend trying
things out on the command line first, until you get them right, and then
converting the operations to the specific API you are using. </p><p>

Although the situation has improved enormously with IM version 6, the command
line really only deals with a single image sequence at any one time. However,
APIs do not have this limitation, and allow you to manipulate multiple image
sequences, separately or together, to perform more complex operations.  This
ability makes it simpler to implement these examples using the IM API, and
removes the need to save images as temporary files, as many of the command
line examples require. When using an API, only permanent and semi-permanent
images need be saved to disk. </p><p>

Basically, let the example pages give you a start, to let you see what
is possible with ImageMagick.  Then, formulate what you want to do on
the command line, before coding the operations in scripts and API
code, where it is harder to make extensive changes. </p><p>

I also recommend that you comment your API code, <b>heavily</b>, adding the
command line equivalents to what you are trying to do, if possible. That way,
you can check and compare the results against those using the command line.
This lets you debug problems that you may come across later, especially as
improvements are made to image processing in the Core ImageMagick Library.
</p>

<h3>Downloading Input Images and Results</h3><p>

As much as possible, I try to use images built-into IM (such as
"<code>logo:</code>" or "<code>rose:</code>") as input images for IM example
commands, or to generate input images using IM commands.  I also often re-use
the output of previous commands in later examples.  Because of this, you
usually don't need to download any 'test' images in order to try out the
examples yourself. </p><p>

However, such generated or built-in images are not always convenient.  So,
when I do use an external image, I tend to re-use that input image, or the
results of previous examples, for later examples in that section. </p><p>

Sometimes the original source image will be displayed or for larger images
a link to the source image is provided. More commonly only the final resulting
image will be shown, as the input is well known or obvious. </p><p>

Almost all the IM example commands shown are executed in the same web
directory in which they appear.  That is, the command you see is the command
that was actually used to generate the image. Because of this you can modify
the page's URL to download or view the input image(s) used by an example.
Extra copies of the external source images have also been placed in the "<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/images/">images</a>" and "<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/img_photos/">img_photos</a>"
sub-directories.  See also the example of a <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/img_photos/INDEX.html">Fancy Photo Index</a> of those images. </p><p>


If text output or image information is produced by an example, it is saved to
a text file, and an image of it is generated for display on the Web page.
Selecting the text output image will link you to a copy of the actual text
output by the command.  </p><p>

In all these examples, selecting the output image should let you download the
image which was actually created by the example command. But be warned, not
all browsers understand all image formats used. </p>

<h3>External Image Sources</h3><p>

By the way, most of the source images used in these examples come from <a href="https://antofthy.gitlab.io/icons/">Anthony's Icon
Library</a>, particularly the  <a href="https://antofthy.gitlab.io/icons/desc/cl-bgnd/Icons.html">background tiles</a>, <a href="https://antofthy.gitlab.io/icons/large/Icons.html">large
clip-art</a>, and <a href="https://antofthy.gitlab.io/icons/dragons/Icons.html">dragons</a> sections of the library. (I like dragons!).  ASIDE: these pages
may be offline as the web site slowly moves to a new server.  </p><p>

This library actually predates the WWW. I created it in 1991, due to the lack
of good, clean iconic images for use on the X Window System.  The advent of
the WWW has of course changed this, but my original library still exists and
remains available as a source of images, even though it is not actively
growing.  </p><p>

Some specific images, and larger images, are contributed by the authors of
specific examples.  The authors of such examples are listed in the contributed
section, or at the bottom of the page. </p><p>

If you are looking for a specific image, I recommend using <a href="http://images.google.com/imghp">Google Image Search</a> (or similar) to
find something appropriate. You can, of course, convert or resize such images
using IM for your own purposes.  However, you should be careful about
copyright if you plan to use such images commercially. </p>


<h3>PNG Images on Web Pages</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/images/test.png"><img src="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/images/test.png" width="150" height="100" alt="[IM Output]"></a>

In many examples, I use an image in PNG format, such as that shown to the
right of this text.  The PNG image format supports images with
semi-transparent pixels, a feature few other image formats provide.  It is
also a very well-understood image format and, as such, is usable by most of
today's image programs and Web browsers.  </p><p>

Some Web browsers, however, do NOT handle transparent PNG images correctly
(most notably Microsoft Internet Explorer v6).  Because of this, I generally
use the JPEG and GIF formats for images on the Web, and only use the PNG
format when generating images with semi-transparent pixels, or when exact
colors are needed for later examples. </p><p>

To allow IE v6 browsers to display PNG images, I use a special 'style sheet'
using complex JavaScript.  For information on this, see <a href="http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/anthony/wwwlab/pngtest/">PNG with
transparency for IE</a>. Technically, this is only problem with IE, not
ImageMagick. </p>

<table>
<tbody><tr><td>

<a name="display"></a>
<h3>Displaying Images on Your Screen</h3>

Display problems can also occur when displaying images on-screen.  Because of
this, I recommend using a command like the following to tile
a '<code>checkerboard</code>' pattern underneath the image, to highlight any
transparent or semi-transparent pixels in it.

<div><pre><code do_not_execute="">
    composite  -compose Dst_Over -tile pattern:checkerboard image.png x:
</code></pre></div>
</td><td>
   <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/test_undertile.jpg"><img src="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/test_undertile.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="[IM Output]"></a>
</td></tr></tbody></table><p>

The image displayed in the above example is a special PNG-format <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/images/test.png">test image</a>, which was generated using the shell
script "<code><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/scripts/generate_test">generate_test</a></code>".
Normally, the command would output the results to your display, not onto a Web
page like this.  </p><p>

If you look carefully, you can see the checkerboard pattern though the
semi-transparent colors. However, the image, as a whole, is fully opaque.  So,
this technique should work on all displays, Web browsers, and image viewers.
</p><p>

As of IM v6.0.2, the "<code>display</code>" program performs something like
this automatically.  However, it does not seem to handle images using color
tables (i.e., GIF) in this way. Using the "<code>x:</code>" output image format
(as above) causes an …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="content" itemscope=""><header><p><br><time datetime="2019-12-18" itemprop="datePublished">2019-12-18</time></p><hr></header><p><span>A few months ago,</span> I pulled a muscle in my lower back, by rock climbing after doing lots of back-bends and handstand practice. I quickly went from feeling fairly nimble to hobbling around with limited mobility and an inability to sit at a desk. Argh!</p><p>Happily, I was prepared with some very comfortable and ergonomic<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> ways to use the computer while laying down (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supine_position">supine</a>). After about a week of doing this and phasing in some exercise, I could finally stand up straight again!</p><p>This post describes variations on supine computing – what's worked best for me so far.</p><h2 id="hammock-computing"><a href="#hammock-computing"></a>Hammock Computing!</h2><p>The best variety of supine computing is in a hammock! Here is a photo from summer of 2018:</p><p><img src="https://mgsloan.com/posts/supine-computing/images/back-yard-hammock.jpg" alt="Using a computer ergonomically in a hammock, via external split keyboard and computer suspended above head" width="1280" height="960"></p><p>This is highly ergonomic – most joints are in quite neutral positions. In particular, your neck can be fully relaxed because the screen is above your head.</p><p>In the photo above, the laptop is suspended via <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Releasable-cable-inch-50LBS-100pcs/dp/B00ANAWGM2?tag=mgsloan06-20">releasable zip ties</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup> threaded through a nice strap that came with some gymnastic rings. Ratchet straps are even better for this purpose, as they have a builtin way to tension them. In the photo below, a ratchet strap is tensioned from one end of the hammock stand to the other:</p><p><img src="https://mgsloan.com/posts/supine-computing/images/back-yard-hammock-strap.jpg" alt="strap tensioned across hammock stand" width="1280" height="1370"></p><p>In this case, zip ties are attaching to little wire loops wrapped around the laptop's hinges. Loops like this, or carabiners, are not necessary but they are a bit more convenient. With most ThinkPad laptops, and likely many other brands, its possible to thread the zip ties through between the body and screen or at the hinges. Here's a more recent picture showing this:</p><p><img src="https://mgsloan.com/posts/supine-computing/images/zip-tied-x1-carbon.jpg" alt="zip tie threaded through x1 carbon" width="1280" height="853"></p><p>I find that ThinkPads are more than sturdy enough to be suspended by their hinges. Sometimes I'll have the full weight on one hinge, while attaching the other. Please use your best judgment about what your laptop can handle<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p><h2 id="not-just-for-hammocks"><a href="#not-just-for-hammocks"></a>Not just for hammocks</h2><p>This is probably obvious, but supine computing is not just for hammocks! It's great for computing anywhere you can lay down. Since I also want to encourage computing outdoors and hammocking, all of the photos below will involve a <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Flowerhouse-FlyingSaucer-Hanging-Lounge-FHFSSVR-SET/dp/B07DB5LGNQ?tag=mgsloan06-20">"flying saucer" hammock</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup>.</p><h2 id="laziest-approach-pillows-but-poor-ergonomics"><a href="#laziest-approach-pillows-but-poor-ergonomics"></a>Laziest approach: pillows (but poor ergonomics)</h2><p>This approach can be quite convenient for short sessions:</p><p><img src="https://mgsloan.com/posts/supine-computing/images/supine-pillowing.jpg" alt="using pillow head support in circular hammock" width="1280" height="853"></p><p>Using a <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Kinesis-Advantage2-Ergonomic-Keyboard-KB600/dp/B07K1SMRGS?tag=mgsloan06-20">Kinesis Advantage 2</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup> keyboard works quite well in this posture, since there is a good amount of space between your hands. This might not be viable with other types of keyboards, but certainly worth a try.</p><p>The neck ergonomics are not ideal, though – doing extended sessions like this can cause neck soreness. So, please try to avoid that!</p><h2 id="much-better-screen-above-head--split-keyboard"><a href="#much-better-screen-above-head--split-keyboard"></a>Much better: screen above head + split keyboard</h2><p>Ideally, the screen would be above your head. Here, it's suspended via the same zip tie approach as above:</p><p><img src="https://mgsloan.com/posts/supine-computing/images/ergo-supine.jpg" alt="screen above head + split keyboard supine computing" width="1280" height="853"></p><p>Another improvement in this picture is using a split keyboard. In this case it's a <a href="https://keyboard.io/">keyboard.io</a>, but other split keyboards like the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">ErgoDox</a> can work great too. By placing the keyboard halves to either side, your arms can be in a more relaxed position.</p><p>This is much better than the prior supine posture. It doesn't seem to put much strain anywhere, and so is quite viable for extended computing sessions. It's also quite simple – split keyboard to either side, and screen above your head.</p><h2 id="other-suspension-methods"><a href="#other-suspension-methods"></a>Other suspension methods</h2><p>There are a huge variety of other ways to suspend a horizontal display above you. Pretty much any well anchored rope or strap will support the zip-ties-around-hinges approach. Here are a few more suspension ideas:</p><ul><li><p>Simply screw hooks into a strut in the ceiling.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B007VL3CB0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?tag=mgsloan06-20">Suction cups</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup> worked surprisingly well when I tried them, but only on smooth ceilings.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/s?tag=mgsloan06-20">3M Command Hooks</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup> work well on walls and slanted ceilings, but not well on flat ceilings, as they are not very strong perpendicular to the surface. It might be sufficient for lightweight laptops / tablets.</p></li><li><p>There are also a <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/s?tag=mgsloan06-20">variety of laptop stands</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup> intended for bed use. The only one I've personally used is the <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/MagicHold-Rotating-Adjusting-Compatible-13-15-6/dp/B07NXZNC88/ref=sr_1_7?tag=mgsloan06-20">MagicHold Laptop stand</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup>, which I mostly use for <a href="https://mgsloan.com/posts/deck-desk">reclined computing</a>. Like nearly all of these stands, their intended use does not involve the screen being entirely horizontal. For the MagicHold stand, the usual zip tie configuration can be used. I suspect for many of the stands, more direct attachment of the laptop could allow them to be used for fully horizontal supine computing.</p></li></ul><h2 id="other-supine-approaches"><a href="#other-supine-approaches"></a>Other supine approaches</h2><ul><li><p>I have a vague recollection from around ten years ago of <a href="https://timothy.hobbs.cz/">Timothy Hobbs</a> sharing a photo of supine computing on some freenode <abbr>IRC</abbr> channel, with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataHand">DataHand split keyboard</a> and a screen suspended above his head via a cardboard box. I googled for "timthelion data hands" and came across <a href="http://xirdalium.net/2008/02/10/laid-back/">a post from 2008</a> which ends with a more evolved version of his supine computing setup, which appears to be using a desk to support the monitor. It looks like more recently he's also had some interesting <a href="https://timothy.hobbs.cz/wearable-computing/adventures.html">adventures in outdoor wearable computing</a>.</p></li><li><p>After deciding to call this post "Supine Computing", I googled that phrase and came across a post by Justin Craig-Kuhn, titled <a href="https://medium.com/@jcraigk/healthy-hacking-diy-supine-workstation-cbaadcbbc2aa">"<abbr>DIY</abbr> Supine Workstation"</a>. He kindly gave me permission to reuse his photo here:</p><p><img src="https://mgsloan.com/posts/supine-computing/images/supine-jcg.jpg" alt="Justin Craig-Kuhn's supine setup" width="1280" height="916"></p><p>Cool stuff!! A couple notes on this:</p><ul><li><p>He's using an ipad as a screen along with a gooseneck tablet mount. This has nice adjustability, and is more elegant than putting a full laptop there. However, as he points out, using an IPad as a display adds some lag, about 20ms.</p></li><li><p>The keyboard position may well be better than mine, because each half is oriented vertically. This allows forearm rotation to be in the middle of its range rather than near its limit. I don't feel strain there, though, so I don't feel the need to do this.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>There are a variety of expensive solutions for reclined / supine computing workstations. For example, the offerings from <a href="https://altwork.com/">AltWork</a> and <a href="http://www.ergoquest.com/">ErgoQuest</a> are quite visually dramatic:</p><p><img src="https://mgsloan.com/posts/supine-computing/images/stations.jpg" alt="Expensive reclining workstations from AltWork and ErgoQuest" width="1280" height="480"></p><p>While I find these workstations quite cool, right now I can't justify the expense and non-portability. I prefer approaches which are inexpensive, portable, and use commonly found materials, such that they are more easily shared.</p></li></ul><h2 id="getting-weird-upside-down-belay-glasses"><a href="#getting-weird-upside-down-belay-glasses"></a>Getting weird: upside down belay glasses</h2><p>Alternatively, belay glasses can be used to allow your neck to be in a neutral position:</p><p><img src="https://mgsloan.com/posts/supine-computing/images/belay-glasses.jpg" alt="supine computing with belay glasses" width="1280" height="853"></p><p>Specifically, these are <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N1EYI37?tag=mgsloan06-20">clip on belay glasses</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup>, which can be used while belaying someone rock climbing, to allow you to watch the climber without craning your neck. In this case, they are flipped upside down such that your vision is downwards. This actually works fairly well, but certainly looks quite strange.</p><p>I haven't found myself doing this much, likely due to the following reasons:</p><ul><li><p>It can be a little finicky, though possible, to get the prisms oriented such that the screen is visible for both eyes. It's unpleasant for parts of the screen to be occluded for one eye.</p></li><li><p>When used outside, glare from the sky above can be more of a problem.</p></li><li><p>They induce some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration">chromatic aberration</a>, which can make text harder to read. This might be avoided by using a prism material with a lower refractive index.</p></li></ul><h2 id="downsides-of-supine-computing"><a href="#downsides-of-supine-computing"></a>Downsides of supine computing</h2><ul><li><p>Can be way too comfortable and relaxing, causing drowsiness. The best way to deal with this is to do a bit of exercise. A really good cycle is switching between a treadmill desk, standing, and supine computing.</p></li><li><p>You may find yourself using your computer in bed more frequently. I've read in a number of reputable places that it's good sleep hygiene to only use your bed for sleep and sex. So, if possible, please try to make your supine computing habit somewhere other than where you sleep.</p></li></ul><h2 id="upsides-of-supine-computing"><a href="#upsides-of-supine-computing"></a>Upsides of supine computing</h2><ul><li><p>Can allow you to comfortably use the computer when an injury might otherwise prevent it.</p></li><li><p>Is a great posture to include in a rotation of postures<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. For example, I don't find it practical to stand or walk (on a treadmill desk) for the entire day. Mixing in some supine computing makes it entirely viable to avoid all sitting.</p></li><li><p>It's a great way to do some physical resting while still getting things done. Sometimes it's better to take a proper nap, but other times I find that I'm physically tired but mentally active – this is a great posture for those times.</p></li></ul><h2 id="thanks-for-reading"><a href="#thanks-for-reading"></a>Thanks for reading!</h2><p>Thanks for reading this post, I hope some of you are inspired to try out supine computing, perhaps even outside! If you're dealing with back pain – argh – that sucks :( ! But I hope this approach helps you manage some of that, or at least work around it.</p><p>If you do experiment with this stuff, I'd be curious to see what you come up with! My email address is this site's hostname at gmail.com</p><p>Also, I'm working on more posts exploring other approaches, which I hope to publish in the next few weeks.

August 8, 2020 | https://ajpierce.com/2020-08-08_crypto-in-rust/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ajpierce.com/2020-08-08_crypto-in-rust/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Since around 2015, I’ve been <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/investing/dollar-cost-averaging-pays/">dollar-cost averaging</a>
cryptocurrencies over at Coinbase. “Stacking Sats,” it’s called these days.</p>
<p>Coinbase makes it very straightforward: link your bank account, pick your currency and frequency of purchase, <em>et voila:</em> your USD becomes cryptocurrency. For a fee, of course.</p>
<p>Anybody who has been around Cryptocurrency for more than a couple minutes knows that prices tend to fluctuate wildly.
On the whole, however, prices have been trending up.
As of the time of this writing, Bitcoin is:</p>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>Last 6 months, +194.86%</li>
    <li>Last 2 years, +266.49%</li>
    <li>Last 3 years, +290.18%</li>
    <li>Last 5 years, +5,300.92%</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Price information derived from <a href="https://www.barchart.com/crypto/quotes/%5EBTCUSD/performance">barchart</a>
  </p>
</div>
<p>With a significant general upward trend like this, monthly cost averaging means you’re leaving a lot of BTC on the table compared with weekly or daily cost average investing.
I decided that daily dollar cost averaging was in my best interest, so I set up a recurring purchase for $10 per day, and ate the $1 service charge. What’s $30/mo when you’ve got compounding double-digit gains on $270/mo?</p>
<p>It’s a lot of extra money on the table!
Thinking about this in terms of USD is the wrong approach; the amount of USD I’m spending is fixed.
The correct way to think about this is: how much more BTC would I have if I were not paying Coinbase a 10% fee?</p>
<p>To be clear, Coinbase’s fee is a much smaller percentage if you’re investing a larger sum of money.
Investing a larger sum would mean more time between purchases, which (for reasons described above) I want to avoid.</p>
<p>One solution is to use <a href="https://pro.coinbase.com/">Coinbase Pro</a> instead of <a href="https://coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a>.
The <a href="https://pro.coinbase.com/fees">trading fees</a> on Coinbase Pro are <em>significantly</em> less — at the volume I’m trading, they’re 0.5% instead of 10%: a whole 9.5% less.</p>
<p>Switching to Coinbase Pro, in other words, earns me 10.5% more BTC per transaction when compared with Coinbase’s “Recurring Buys” offering.
The problem? Coinbase Pro does not offer recurring buys! They <em>do,</em> however, offer an API that we can use to initiate recurring buys on our own.</p>
<h2>Enter Rust</h2>
<p>Call me paranoid, but I am not about to put API keys that can access my personal Coinbase account on servers that I don’t physically control. This means running servers at home, which means electricity costs and heat.</p>
<p>The electricity and heat problems associated with running servers at home can be mitigated by using hardware like a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> — a credit-card sized computer that draws around 5W of power, and doesn’t put out enough heat to even require fans. The downsides include limited processing power, and downright atrocious disk IO (if using the built-in SD card reader).</p>
<p>The Pi’s performance limitations mean that I want software running on it to be small and fast.
Furthermore, because I’m dealing with money and network-based APIs, it’s also important that the software I’m using is <em>correct.</em></p>
<p>The Rust Programming Language checks all of these boxes — with performance on par with C and C++, and a compiler that requires you to account for failure cases and not just happy paths, it becomes difficult to write incorrect code.
Furthermore, Rust makes it easy to compile to multiple targets, which means getting it onto an ARM processor (the Pi) is not a significant undertaking.</p>
<p>In fact, thanks to Github’s new pricing strategy around Github Actions (free!), we can just let Github compile all the binaries for us! 😁</p>
<h2>The Strategy</h2>
<p>Instead of relying on Coinbase to purchase BTC for us, we’ll write a Rust program to do it instead.
Nothing fancy needed here — no price watching or machine learning to optimize purchase times, just a Rust binary that starts instantly, makes a transaction, logs the output, and exits. Stick it on the crontab and call it good!</p>
<p>The program I ended up with, <a href="https://github.com/ajpierce/hodl/">hodl</a>, has been running faithfully for the past two months! It’s my first Rust program, so please be kind and help me learn 😊.</p>
<p>Since I began “stacking sats” this way, I’ve only run into one issue: after losing power in a storm, we came back online with a new IP address, and the new address was not yet associated with my API key, so <code>hodl</code> failed to make a couple purchases (this is a security feature that you can elect to disable).
I noticed something was afoot after I stopped receiving my nightly confirmation emails, so I logged onto the Pi, checked the logs, saw the issue, added the new IP address, and we were back in business.</p>
<h2>Setting it up</h2>
<p>Everyone is going to have different API keys, and I’m not about to check mine into the repository :)
In order to use hodl, you need to set some environment variables.</p>
<p>My recommendation would be to create a script, <code>hodl</code>, that sets these and invokes <a href="https://github.com/ajpierce/hodl/releases">the hodl binary you download</a>:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>export</span> <span>COINBASE_API_KEY</span><span>=</span><span>[</span>your key<span>]</span>
<span>export</span> <span>COINBASE_API_SECRET</span><span>=</span><span>[</span>your secret<span>]</span>
<span>export</span> <span>COINBASE_API_PASSPHRASE</span><span>=</span><span>[</span>your passphrase<span>]</span>
<span>export</span> <span>BANK_ID</span><span>=</span><span>[</span>id of your associated bank account<span>]</span>

./hodl-ARMv7 <span>$@</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then, you can set your crontab to run periodic deposit and buy commands. For example,</p>
<div data-language="cron"><pre><code># m h  dom mon dow   command
0   0   */3  *   *   /home/pi/hodl deposit 45 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee -a /home/pi/logs/hodl.log
7   0   *    *   *   /home/pi/hodl buy BTC 10 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee -a /home/pi/logs/hodl.log
8   0   *    *   *   /home/pi/hodl buy ETH 5 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee -a /home/pi/logs/hodl.log</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Et voila,</em> cryptocurrency dollar cost averaging at a fraction of the retail cost!</p>
<p>The crontab above will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deposit $45 USD into Coinbase every 3 days (every 72 hours)</li>
<li>Buy $10 USD worth of BTC every day at 7 minutes past midnight</li>
<li>Buy $5 USD worth of ETH every day at 8 minutes past midnight</li>
<li>Send both standard error and standard output to a log file</li>
</ol>
<p>The times I picked were arbitrary; some time spent with historical data and in a Jupyter notebook revealed that there wasn’t a reliable correlation with time of day and low (relative to a sliding window) prices, so pick a time that’s convenient for you!</p>
<h2>Thoughts on Rust</h2>
<p>Overall, I’ve walked away with a positive impression of Rust.
I especially like the <code>match</code> structure, though it took me a while to get comfortable with the difference between <code>Option</code> and <code>Result</code> types.
Figuring out how to cryptographically sign API request headers to accommodate the Coinbase Pro API was a fun challenge that forced me to get into the docs of other Crates, and (coming from the dynamically typed world of JavaScript and Clojure) suffer a bit of pain for the type system, though I am grateful that it keeps me honest.
I also like the stance Rust takes towards data organization with Structs, which I feel are a much better alternative to the OO purgatory I found myself in back when worked in Java. When it comes to data, though, I still feel like Clojure has it figured out the best.</p>
<p>For this job, Rust was excellent, and I believe in picking the right tool for the job.
Not that other tools wouldn’t have done the job just as nicely, but I was looking for an excuse to learn something, and this solved a real problem that is making me more money as a result.
Just in time, too: since I started using <code>hodl</code> instead of Coinbase, the price of BTC has gone up over 30%!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you’re in the market for some Cryptocurrencies, why not check out <a href="https://github.com/ajpierce/hodl">hodl</a>, or use it as a starting point for trading against some other API if Coinbase Pro is not your preferred exchange?
If you’re a Rust pro, I’d love your feedback on how to improve the program.
And I’d like <em>everyone</em> to start buying Bitcoin — if you haven’t already, <a href="https://decrypt.co/37922/1-million-bitcoin-wallets-are-now-being-used-every-day?s=08">now is the time</a> to hop on the bandwagon!</p></section></div>]]>

<h2 id="environment-variables-for-single-page-apps-spas">Environment Variables for Single Page Apps (SPAs)</h2>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>Have you ever built a SPA, and found yourself frustrated at having to build specifically for the target environment?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“oh dang, this container won’t run in staging because it has localhost:1337 for the back-end API endpoint, whut do?!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously you don’t want to pass secrets, but having to build a container per environment for config items is a PITA.</p>
<p>Fear not, answer below.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> In the container entrypoint, use <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/envsubst" target="_blank" rel="noopener">envsubst</a> to push env vars into a template file and serve as a JS file.</p>
<h2 id="environment-variables-env-vars">Environment variables (env vars)</h2>
<p>Environment variables are variables which are present in the current environment, duh. For example a container, or a Linux/Windows server, or your local machine.</p>
<p>Once set, they can be read by a program running in that environment. In Go you can do <code>myEnvVar = os.Getenv("MY_ENV_VAR")</code> to read the MY_ENV_VAR env var into a variable in your program.</p>
<p>Docker Compose provides a nice way to pass these from the yaml files which define services:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>my-service:
    environment:
        - MY_ENV_VAR=a-string-value-m9
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>When the compose file is used to run the services (containers) it defines, the variable <code>myEnvVar</code> in the Go example would be set to “a-string-value-m9”.</p>
<p>This is really useful, as now the same code can be run, but have things like URLs, DB host names etc. passed in to suit the environment.</p>
<h2 id="when-are-you-going-to-talk-about-spas-though">When are you going to talk about SPAs though?</h2>
<p>I know that the above is most likely familiar, but it gets a bit tricker when you try reading env vars in a statically compiled web app. This is where the docker + envsubst magic comes in.</p>
<p>As a container starts up, a command is run - normally in this context, to run a webserver like Nginx - to serve the static content. At this point we use envsubst to read our template file, squirt in the env vars, and then call the oringinal entry point command - start ya webserver.</p>
<h2 id="show-me-what-you-mean">Show me what you mean…</h2>
<p>From the Dockerfile:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>CMD ["sh", "-c", "envsubst &lt; /usr/share/nginx/env-config.template.js &gt; /usr/share/nginx/html/env-config.js &amp;&amp; nginx -g 'daemon off;'"]
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Our config template is read from a non-web-accessible directory above the web root (keep things clean), has the env vars injected by envsubst (<code>envsubst &lt; /usr/share/nginx/env-config.template.js</code>), and the result is output (<code>&gt; /usr/share/nginx/html/env-config.js</code>) into the web root of the static web app.</p>
<p>^^^ that, is the magic!</p>
<h2 id="the-web-bit">The web bit</h2>
<p>The template file I use looks like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>window.myexampleapp = {
	env: {
		API_URL: "$API_URL",
	},
};
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This is simply chucking us a configuration object onto window.</p>
<p>As long as we include env-config.js in our html <code>&lt;script src="/env-config.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> before our application JS, we can be sure that our env vars will be available for use.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>this.apiUrl = window.myexampleapp.env.API_URL
			? window.myexampleapp.env.API_URL
			: "http://localhost:1337";
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Read the values in our application as above.</p>
<h2 id="let-us-recap">Let us recap</h2>
<p>So far we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>set the env var (in the docker-compose file, or in a docker run command)</li>
<li>modified container entrypoint to spin up our container with envsubst + run our webserver start command</li>
<li>dropped a file in our container webroot with the env vars injected and added to window</li>
<li>added that file to our html via a script tag</li>
<li>read the env vars from window in our JS</li>
</ul>
<p>Hey presto - your container will now ingest those juicy env vars, and make them accessible to your static front-end application!</p>
<p>One of the huge benefits here is that a single container can be re-used across all environments - giving a higher level of confidence that any testing done has been on that specific piece of built code. Oh, and saving on the number of env specific containers, allowing for easier caching of images for deployments etc.</p>
<p>It also makes for riveting pub chat with your non-technical buddies.</p>
<h2 id="gimme-a-full-example-then-pal">Gimme a full example then pal</h2>
<p>It’ll be up on GitHub soon!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading - technical and other feedback very welcome, hope this is as helpful for you as it has been for me!</p>

<a name="sec:LArCal">&nbsp;</a>For the electromagnetic calorimeter in ATLAS is chosen a liquid argon
sampling calorimeter. Layers of lead/stainless steel and liquid argon
are interspaced.  The lead gives the shower development with its short
radiation length and the secondary electrons create ionisation in the
narrow gaps of liquid argon. An inductive signal from the ionisation
electrons drifting in the electric field across the gas-gap is
registered by copper electrodes.

To achieve a low capacitance of the detecting elements and thereby a
fast signal the lead plates have an accordion shape as shown in
fig. <a href="https://www.hep.lu.se/atlas/thesis/egede/thesis-node43.html#fig:Accordion">4.5</a>. At the same time this creates a fully homogeneous
calorimeter in the  <img width="13" height="24" src="https://www.hep.lu.se/atlas/thesis/egede/thesis-img37.gif" alt="$\varphi$">  coordinate. In the central rapidity
region there are four samplings:

  Detector, solenoid and cryostat wall.

<p>
In the end-cap there is less material in front of the calorimeter and
the presampler can be avoided. The end-cap EM calorimeters start at
 |<img width="11" height="24" src="https://www.hep.lu.se/atlas/thesis/egede/thesis-img48.gif" alt="$\eta$">| = 1.5  and continue down to  |<img width="11" height="24" src="https://www.hep.lu.se/atlas/thesis/egede/thesis-img48.gif" alt="$\eta$">| = 3.2  but with an increased
cell size above  |<img width="11" height="24" src="https://www.hep.lu.se/atlas/thesis/egede/thesis-img48.gif" alt="$\eta$">| = 2.5 . There is a crack with bad energy
resolution where the end-cap and barrel calorimeters meet. A large
effort has gone into reducing the size of the crack while still
leaving space for cables and cooling for the Inner Detector.

with energies measured in GeV. The sampling term  <i>a</i>  is defined by the
number of lead/argon interfaces and is 8-11% depending on rapidity.
Noise influences the resolution at the lowest energies through the
term  <i>b</i>  which is of the order 400 MeV when running at high
luminosity. The constant term affects the resolution for high energy
clusters and is limited by the calibration of the global energy scale
and local variations in this. It is hard to predict but is believed to
stay below 0.7%<a name="tex2html40" href="https://www.hep.lu.se/atlas/thesis/egede/thesis-footnode.html#1927"><sup><img alt="[*]" src="https://www.hep.lu.se/atlas/thesis/egede/foot_motif.gif"></sup></a>.
<p>
To withstand the high radiation levels in the forward region the
hadronic calorimeter is also of liquid argon type in the end-caps. The
design is simpler than the EM calorimeter and has parallel copper
plates as absorbers placed perpendicular to the beam.
</p><p>
The very forward hadronic calorimeter with a coverage down to
 |<img width="11" height="24" src="https://www.hep.lu.se/atlas/thesis/egede/thesis-img48.gif" alt="$\eta$">| = 4.9  is made of copper/tungsten. The choice of copper/tungsten
is necessary to limit the width and depth of the showers from high
energy jets close to the beam pipe, and to keep the background level
low in the surrounding calorimeters from particles spraying out from
the forward region. The calorimeter is a metal matrix with cylindrical
holes. The holes have rods inside with a slightly smaller radius
allowing for a liquid argon gap of just 250  <img width="12" height="24" src="https://www.hep.lu.se/atlas/thesis/egede/thesis-img13.gif" alt="$\mu$"> m. The small gap
limits the sensitivity to pile-up effects which are large close to the
beam pipe where energetic jets often hit the same area of the
calorimeter.

                	<h2>The Halifax Gibbet</h2>
                    <p><img src="https://www.guillotine.dk/images/gibbetold.jpg" alt="The Halifax Gibbet shown in an old drawing "></p>                	
               		<p>The 'privilege' (right) of a gibbet is believed to have been vested in Halifax around the time of the Norman Conquest in 1066, although the earliest reference to it dates from 1280. At that time, there were said to be one hundred other places in Yorkshire that similarly enjoyed this distinctive honour. In the case of Halifax, however, its notoriety stemmed from the fact that the custom of the Gibbet Law continued long after it had been abandoned elsewhere.</p>
         
          			<p>The Laws of Halifax were administered from the Moot Hall (demolished 1957) which stood on a site near the Parish Church in Nelson Street. It was from here that the Lords of the Manor held their court and imposed fines and punishment for a wide variety of offences. Early records show that John de Warren, Earl of Surrey, held court here in 1286. In the same year, the Earls of Warren were granted by the Crown the 'Royalty' to execute thieves and other criminals, from which the Halifax Gibbet Law developed. It was in that first year that John of Dalton was decapitated, the first known victim of the Halifax Gibbet, although formal records of victims did not begin until 1541.<br>
</p>
        			<p>Up to the arrival of the Tudor dynasty in the late fifteenth century, Halifax was little more than a hamlet consisting of some fifteen cottages. However, its strategic position and abundance of clear spring water, made it an ideal location for the fast developing cloth trade. By 1556 the hamlet had grown to more than 500 households, all thanks to cloth manufacture. At that time, the newly manufactured cloth was delivered weekly to the town where it was washed and stretched out on wooden tenterframes and left to dry in the open air. Considering the size of the Halifax trade, the surrounding hillsides would have been covered by row upon row of these frames, leaving exposed and vulnerable the valuable pieces of cloth. And with the cloth reaching high prices, delivery of the bolts became a more and more dangerous occupation. Alarmed at the increase in thefts and at the number that went unpunished, local traders were fearful that the unchecked crime wave could lead to economic damage.<br>
        </p>
        			<p>Evidence of the arrival of the gibbet is recorded in Thomas Deloney's "Thomas, of Reading", a romantic and racy ballad in which 'Hodgskins, of Halifax, and his fellow clothiers are represented as having obtained the valuable privilege of the gibbet from the Crown, for the purpose of punishing those who filched their cloth from the tenters.' Local legend goes onto tell of how the good gentlemen of Halifax found it impossible to take on the role of hangman, but that eventually 'a "feat friar" came to the rescue of the tender consciences of the townsfolk, by the timely invention of a "gin" [engine] which was capable of cutting off the heads of "valiant rogues" without the direct intervention of human hands.'<br>
        </p>
        			<p>By today's standards, the use of the gibbet was harsh, often being deployed for the punishment of both minor and major offences. Local Gibbet Law dictated that 'If a felon be taken within the liberty of Halifax...either hand-habend (caught with the stolen goods in his hand or in the act of stealing), back-berand (caught carrying stolen goods on his back), or confessand (having confessed to the crime), to the value of thirteen pence half-penny, he shall after three markets...be taken to the Gibbet and there have his head cut off from his body'. While the sum may sound paltry by today's standards, English Common Law at that time permitted the death penalty for thefts to the value of twelve pence and above.<br>
        </p>
        			<p>When a thief was caught, he was placed in the custody of the Lord of the Manor's Bailiff. The Bailiff was an important official in that he kept the gaol, the gibbet-axe, and occasionally acted as executioner. Four constables of the Township then met to assess the value of the contraband. If the consensus was that it exceeded the minimum threshold, the Bailiff summoned a jury of sixteen men, usually selected from those who the manor held to be the 'most wealthy and best reputed for honesty and understanding.' Jurors were not put on oath, although their duties hardly required it as they were far from onerous. Their primary responsibility was to identify the goods and confirm its value, and ascertain the means by which the thief (hand-habend, back-berand or confessand). At this point the thief was confronted by the evidence. If he was then acquitted, he was set free after having paid the court fees; if he was condemned, arrangements were made for the execution. Markets occurred on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays: the main market was held on Saturday. These were busy affairs and the spectacle of a decapitation - all beheadings took place at the Saturday market - added to the numbers attending.<br>
        </p>
        			<p>After conviction, the felon's fate depended on which day of the week he had been tried. If it took place on a Saturday, he was immediately led to the market place and beheaded. If it was a Monday, he would be kept for three market-days and then beheaded at the next Saturday market. During the intervening days, the prisoner was placed back in the care of the Manor Bailiff and held in gaol. Each day he was taken out and placed in the stocks as a public display of justice being served and as a deterrent to others, often with the contraband placed around him: the stolen cloth would be draped around his shoulders, while stolen animals would be tethered about him.<br>
        </p>
        			<p>A curious note on the act of beheading is recorded by the Halifax historian Wright, in which he tells of a country woman on horseback who passed the gibbet while an execution was taking place. At her sides were large wicker baskets, and when the head of the victim was dispatched, the force of the descending axe caused it to bounce a considerable distance "into one of the hampers, or, as others say, seized her apron with its teeth, and there stuck for some time."<br>
        </p>
        			<p>A considerably longer description of a decapitation was recorded in Daniel Defoe's account of Halifax in his work "A Tour through the whole Island of Great Britain" (1724-1727). In it he says that 'I must not quit Halifax till I give you some account of the famous course of justice anciently executed here, to prevent the stealing of cloth. Modern accounts pretend to say it was for all sorts of felonies, but I am well assured it was first erected purely, or at least principally, for such thieves as were apprehended stealing cloth from the tenters; and it seems very reasonable to think it was so, because of the conditions of the trial.'<br>
        </p>
        			<p>The case to which he alludes was 'the erecting of the woollen manufacture here was about the year 1485 when King Henry VII, by giving encouragement to foreigners to settle in England, and to set up woollen manufactures, caused an Act to pass prohibiting the exportation of wool into foreign parts unwrought, and to encourage foreigners to come and settle here. Of these, several coming over settled the manufactures of various kinds of cloth in different parts of the kingdom, as they found the people tractable and as the country best suited them; as, for instance, the cloth named bays at Colchester; the says at Sudbury; the broadcloth in Wilts and other counties, and the trade of kersies and narrow cloth at this place [Halifax] and other adjacent towns.<br>

        			<p>When this trade began to settle nothing was more frequent than for young workmen to leave their cloths out all night upon the tenters; and the idle fellows would come in upon them, and tearing it off without notice, steal the cloth. Now, as it was absolutely necessary to preserve the trade in its infancy, this severe law was made, giving the power of life and death so far into the hands of the magistrates of Halifax, as to see the law executed upon them. But the power was not given unless in one of these three plain cases, namely, hand-having, back-bearing, or tongue-confessing.<br>
        </p>
        			<p>This being the case, if the criminal was taken he was brought before the magistrate of the town, and those who were to judge and sentence and execute the offender, or to clear him, within so many days. Then there were frithborghs (or jurors) also to judge of the fact, who were to be good and sober men, and by the magistrates of the town to be approved as such.

Within these was a square block of wood four and a half feet long, which moved up and down by<br>
          means of grooves made for that purpose; and to the lower part of this sliding block was fastened a sharp iron axe of the weight of seven pounds twelve ounces.<br>
        </p>
        			<p>The axe thus fixed was drawn up to the top of the grooves by a cord and pulley. At the end of the cord was a pin, which, being fixed to the block, kept it suspended till the moment of execution, when the culprit, having placed his head on the block, the pin was withdrawn, the axe fell suddenly and violently on the …</p></div></div></div>
